2745,recent flood related disasters which affect many areas of the world due to a combination of climate change and increasing urbanization have prompted researchers to study catastrophic phenomena for which large scale mitigation strategies are needed however lower impact flood events occur more frequently and although these floods are relatively less destructive they can be effectively mitigated with local protection measures this work focuses on understanding the factors that influence the reliable modeling of these lower impact and less studied flood events we propose a procedure that combines the use of a simple but effective numerical model of the last segment of ticino river with a global sensitivity analysis for an in depth evaluation of i the backwater induced flooding of an urban area in the historical city of pavia northern italy and ii the potential flood damage due to such events a 1d unsteady hec ras model termed the 3r model was set up and validated against historical floods then the 3r model output was compared with a hybrid 1d 2d model of the same area both model schemes provide reliable results and similar predictions of the flood depth and its spatial extent the 3r model is demonstrated to be a successful modeling approach providing a computational cost that is always less than one tenth of the cost of the hybrid 1d 2d for the simulated floods the morris method of sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential factors affecting the results of the 3r model to help inform local policies aimed at flood risk reduction the morris results highlight that the maximum water level of the po river has a dominant role in determining the flood magnitude for the whole area with an influence at the control points in the floodplain that is more than triple that of the ticino maximum flow rate a damage index quantifying the housing loss due to the urban flood extent was introduced and analyzed using the morris method the results show that the predicted flood damage is strongly influenced by the uncertainty in the roughness coefficient of the floodplains the contemporaneity of the floods on the ticino and po rivers was also influential playing a key role in flood severity within the urban area a 5 hour delay of the ticino flood wave maximum flow rate of 2000 m3 s with respect to that of the po river maximum stage level of 59 8 m a s l reduces the water level in the flooded area by 8 cm these results will help the development of flood risk reduction strategies keywords hec ras hydraulic modeling

natural hazards in many regions of the world and represent a critical threat to human life and infrastructure causing huge amounts of economic damage unisdrs 2009 increasing urbanization and climate change are intensifying the frequency and the severity of water disasters tanoue et al 2016 due to an alteration of the hydrological cycle yilmaz et al 2014 coppola et al 2014 todeschini 2012 kay et al 2021 for this reason the assessment of flood risk and mitigation have become a topic of great importance kuriqi and hysa 2021 merz et al 2014 albano et al 2020 even when dealing with domestic and industrial activities related to water production panagopoulos 2021 2022 numerical models are currently widely used for river flow analysis to support the design and management of riverine structures and for the development of hydraulic risk mitigation strategies in response to catastrophic events amicarelli et al 2021 castellarin et al 2011a micotti et al 2014 zeleňáková et al 2019 depending on the aim of each study and data availability 1d 2d or 3d models can be implemented using a variety of approaches for example vergnani et al 2010 used a 1d model to evaluate the impact on ticino river flowrate after a structural modification of the lake maggiore outlet while trueheart et al 2020 set up a full 2d unsteady model to simulate the impact of individual structures on a bridge stream network during extreme floods and bangwen et al 2021 proposed a large scale 3d model to analyze the asynchronous movement characteristics of flood wave propagation and sediment transport the type of model implemented depends on a variety of factors such as the type of data available the desired level of accuracy in the model results the desired ease of use for future users the required spatial resolution of the model results and the need for computational efficiency these factors are often in conflict with one another making it difficult to determine the most appropriate modeling scheme the reliability of numerical modeling for the analysis and prediction of the river flow conditions during floods relies on the degree of complexity of the model adopted to reproduce the involved physical processes a 1d approach implies a simpler spatial discretization scheme and may be suitable for the analysis of river conditions where the stream is characterized by a dominant velocity field in the longitudinal direction with negligible velocity components in the transversal direction along with negligible secondary flow effects awang shariee et al 2020 meanwhile the adoption of a 2d scheme provides an improved representation of flow conditions during flood events where the local hydrodynamics may strongly deviate from the 1d path such as urban flashfloods when increasing the model complexity both a higher computational effort and more accurate input data are generally required gibson et al 2016 for those reasons the set up of a reliable numerical model for river analysis represents a complex task especially when the model is adopted to create probabilistic maps of risk and to develop a multi disciplinary decision support system for natural hazard risk reduction and management by exploring many potential hydrological scenarios and risk mitigation measures newman et al 2017 many recent numerical models have focused on simulating flashfloods inundations caused by heavy precipitation that occurs in a very short time in highly urbanized areas gaume et al 2009 bout et al 2018 galuppini et al 2020 such phenomena are characterized by high water velocity and require complex computationally expensive modeling for adequate description of the water flow through urban elements and massive solid transport costabile et al 2020 in contrast this paper focuses on backwater induced urban floods that are rarely considered in the literature except in coastal environments kumbier et al 2018 lyddon et al 2018 backwater induced urban floods are not due to insufficiency of the drainage network or levee failure as often happens for flashfloods but occur when a watercourse is not able to freely flow into the receiving one due to its high stage level and is therefore consequently impeded this phenomenon causes inundations which are characterized by low velocity in the areas upstream of the confluence of the two watercourses these events are of interest since they can amplify the devastation associated with a watercourse s flood making lamination ineffective along the watercourse such backwater induced floods require a modeling approach that is reliable yet not too time consuming to support early warning systems and effective local protection measures liro et al 2020 adopted a 2d numerical model for simulating dam backwater in a mountain river and evaluating the hydrodynamic pattern and morphological changes in the upstream river reach the impact of reservoir induced backwater on river hydrodynamics is evaluated by considering proper modeling scenarios that combine three cases of flood magnitudes with two values of downstream stages in each scenario they assume constant water level at the downstream section rather than adopting a time dependent stage hydrograph however the work did not apply a sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of input model parameters on the results even though sensitivity analysis is of great concern to evaluate model accuracy depending on reliability of input data as well as to provide useful information for risk assessment and mitigation xing et al 2021 in this context the main aim of this work is to setup a reliable numerical model for backwater flood analysis in an urban area while balancing trade offs between accuracy and computational cost to support decision makers in the prediction and mitigation of flood risk as well as for the development of an early warning system the proposed procedure combines a hydraulic model developed using the common open source software for river analysis hec ras with the morris method for global sensitivity analysis gsa morris 1991 for reliable modeling of the backwater induced flooding and analysis of the most influential factors affecting inundation extent and induced damage in an urban floodplain the open source software hec ras developed by the u s army corps of engineers hec 2001 is widely adopted for the hydraulic simulation of river floods and for the numerical investigation of the effect of structures that affect the river cross section altering the hydraulic regime and causing a backwater effect ardiclioglu et al 2022 tariq et al 2021 ardiclioglu and kuriqi 2019 the morris method is applied to this hydraulic model to assess which model inputs have the greatest influence on modeled flood dynamics in the urban area of interest while variance based methods are frequently adopted for carrying out model sensitivity analysis their higher computational demand with respect to alternative methods e g those based on the analysis of partial derivatives makes them more suitable for applications to laboratory experiments chen et al 2018 or urbanized areas with small spatial extents xing et al 2021 the morris method was therefore chosen instead of such variance based methods to reduce the computational expense the proposed procedure is applied to the case of the borgo basso urban area in the city of pavia northern italy located in the right hand floodplain of the ticino river which is a few kilometers upstream of its confluence with the po river the most important river in italy fig 1 several catastrophic inundations have occurred in this area over the past centuries and can be divided into three classes i high flow floods that occur when precipitation in the upper ticino basin is particularly intense and prolonged ii backwater floods caused by the po river water level preventing the normal flow of the ticino river and iii contemporary floods of the ticino and po rivers piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 cattaneo et al 2000 saltalippi 1999 an example of the latter type is the october 2000 flood which was devastating not only for the city of pavia but for the whole po river basin causing incalculable damage throughout northern italy many researchers have since simulated the dynamics of the october 2000 flood event and it still represents a reference benchmark for the calibration validation of numerical models of the ticino river cattaneo et al 2000 micotti et al 2014 anghileri et al 2013 castellarin et al 2011a for example 1d models along the ticino river were calibrated validated using the october 2000 flood event to create a hydro geological risk assessment for the city of pavia available in piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 and to analyze the propagation of high return period flood waves micotti et al 2014 vergnani et al 2010 therefore the current study similarly uses the october 2000 flood event to validate our numerical model results in this study a hydraulic model is proposed to reproduce with suitable accuracy the flood dynamics within the borgo basso urban area in pavia during backwater induced floods both for catastrophic events and for more modest floods where less damage is expected and local mitigation measures can be more easily implemented a 1d hydraulic model set up for the simulation of catastrophic events for the area of interest termed the 1r model is initially presented along with a discussion of its intrinsic limitations for the description of the flood dynamic within the borgo basso urban area for moderate flood events an improved 1d model of the area is then proposed 3r model to overcome such limitations even if some studies showed that 2d hydrodynamic models outperform 1d models in some applications alipour et al 2022 a 1d 2d hybrid model is developed to demonstrate the reliability of the 3r model when reproducing two recent flood events that occurred in november 2014 and november 2019 a morris analysis is then performed to assess the relative role and the ranking of flood controlling variables influencing the outputs of the 3r model even if variance based computationally expensive methods have been adopted for sensitivity analysis of simplified inundation models pheulpin et al 2022 the measure of morris 1991 is more appropriate to fix non influential factors especially when the number of uncertain parameters is high and or the model computational time is expensive hall et al 2009 xu and mynett 2006 in the present work a relatively simple but reliable 1d model is combined with the morris method of sensitivity analysis allowing for exploration of the effects of many six uncertain input parameters on a real case with complex topography the time dependent influence of both upstream and downstream hydrographs as well as their relative peak timing can be considered which allows for investigation of the peculiar dynamics of backwater flooding and represents an innovation with respect to the referenced works on this topic alipour et al 2022 pheulpin et al 2019 a damage index is also proposed based on the inundation depth and extent within the flooded area lastly an additional morris analysis is carried out to assess which factors are most influential on the damage index when flooding occurs within the borgo basso urban area the proposed modeling approach based on a fast running simple and accurate 1d numerical model is suitable for simulating the dynamic pattern of backwater induced flooding and allows us to assess the most influential parameters on the modeled flood damage the model can be applied to risk analysis and management supporting the planning of effective protection strategies for mitigating the flood risk in the examined area furthermore owing to its relatively simple structure and relatively low numerical complexity the model is suitable for inclusion in an early warning system ews 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the ticino river which is 248 km long is one the main tributaries of the po river it originates in the swiss alps and flows into lake maggiore from which it continues for 110 km along the north italian lowlands called the pianura padana until its confluence with the po river the hydrologic regime of the ticino river is characterized by high flows in autumn and spring alternating with dry periods in summer and winter the river is regulated through the miorina dam built in 1942 at the outlet of lake maggiore and the panperduto diversion dam which is slightly downstream of the outlet bizzi et al 2012 both dams are significantly upstream 96 km and 89 km respectively of where the numerical model reach begins in the city of pavia the final portion of the ticino river from the ponte coperto bridge in pavia to its confluence with the po river flows through a plain characterized by a low slope 0 2 the ponte coperto historical non automatic hydrometer and the ponte della libertà gauging station arpa lombardia 2020 are located along the ticino river near the city of pavia fig 1 the ponte della libertà hydrometer records stage data every 10 minutes while the ponte della becca gauging station aipo 2020 is located along the po river at its confluence with the ticino and records stage data every 30 minutes the data from these three gauging stations are used in this study to validate the model results the area of interest for this study termed borgo basso is located on the right hand side of the ticino river approximately 10 km upstream of its confluence with the po river fig 1 this area is within the portion of the ticino river floodplain that extends downstream of the ponte coperto bridge to the confluence of the ticino river and the gravellone canal bounded by the green line in fig 2 a borgo basso is an urban area containing both residential and commercial buildings that can be inundated during flood events the final stretch of the gravellone canal is located to the south of borgo basso transporting water east into the ticino river whenever the gravellone canal can no longer flow into the ticino river due to the rise in the ticino river stage level it is necessary to close the battella sluice gate located where the gravellone canal crosses the ticino main levee the battella sluice gate is closed to protect the territories that lie upstream of the barrier from backwater flooding when the sluicegate is closed flooding of the whole area is determined only by the stage in the ticino river at its confluence with the gravellone canal in this situation flood pattern b fig 2b water from the ticino river flows backwards along the gravellone canal inundating several cultivated fields fig 2b zones 3 4 and the longarina artificial canal which leads the water to more internal areas fig 2b zones 1 2 and 5 zone 1 is connected to the longarina canal through an underground concrete pipe with a diameter of 80 cm in the past the depressed area of zone 1 was the natural continuation of the longarina canal and was part of an articulated attenuation system that safeguarded the borgo basso urban area from backwater floods this system was interrupted by the construction of the trinchera road embankment but the hydraulic continuity is now partially restored by the aforementioned concrete pipe as the ticino river stage continues to rise a larger portion of the floodplain gradually becomes submerged when the stage level in the ticino reaches the elevation of 61 61 m a s l at the hydrometer of ponte coperto submersion of the floodplain is complete under such conditions the five zones depicted in fig 2b merge and water flow in this area becomes determined by the current in the ticino river such as shown in fig 2a 2 2 mathematical modeling the numerical hydraulic models used for this study are implemented with the open source software hec ras 5 0 7 developed by the u s army corps of engineers hec 2001 hec ras allows the user to perform 1d and 2d unsteady flow calculations 1d and 2d approaches can also be conveniently combined within the same model for a better representation of complex problems while maintaining a relatively low computational effort in this study three different model schemes are explored to reproduce the dynamics of flood events characterized by significant backwater effect conditions simulations are performed using both the 1d and 2d unsteady flow modules of hec ras the 1d unsteady flow component of hec ras adopts the 1d de saint venant equations 1 a t q x 0 2 q t q v x g a ξ x s f 0 where q is the flow rate a is the flow area v is the flow velocity g is the gravitational acceleration ξ is the free surface elevation with respect to a reference height and sf represents the friction slope eqs 1 and 2 are solved using the 4 node priessman numerical method preissmann 1961 barkau 1997 the required basic input data include cross section geometry at representative locations manning s roughness coefficients for the riverbed and for the floodplains upstream and downstream boundary conditions energy loss coefficients and hydraulic structure data rodriguez et al 2008 the 2d unsteady flow module is based on the 2d shallow water equations swe 3 h t h u x h v y q 0 4 u t u u x v u y g h x v t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 c f u f v 5 v t u v x v v y g h y v t

coriolis parameter hec ras can solve either the full 2d swe eqs 3 5 or the diffusive shallow water equations dswe a simplification that neglects the inertial terms of the momentum equations in this study the dswe approach was implemented the computing domain is composed of a grid staggered or unstaggered of cells with a maximum of 8 sides whose dimensions depend on several factors such as the dtm resolution or the desired computational cost the grid can be locally refined to comply with the orography and the bathymetry of the domain hec 2001 the current study compares the results from three hec ras modeling schemes that describe the flooding of borgo basso during both flood patterns a and b fig 2 the three schemes include 1 a 1d model termed 1r 1 reach 2 a 1d model termed 3r 3 reaches and 3 a hybrid 1d 2d model termed 2d 2 2 1 1r model the 1r 1 reach 1d unsteady model simulates the behavior of the final portion of the ticino river that extends from the ponte coperto bridge in pavia to the confluence with the po river fig 1 one hec ras reach element is used in this model to describe the behavior of the ticino river the model incorporates the five available surveyed cross sections along the reach to describe the bathymetry fig 1 sections 4 3 2 1 00 piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2004 aipo 2004 aipo 2005 fictitious cross sections are introduced to ensure that a maximum distance of 150 m between contiguous cross sections is not exceeded in such a way the stability of the numerical model is guaranteed saleh et al 2013 all the interpolated cross sections are extracted from the 5x5 m dtm regione lombardia 2015 using the ras mapper tool and then the bathymetry of the main riverbed is corrected using a geometrical interpolation via the xs interpolation tool between the surveyed cross sections to avoid the shortcomings of the lidar data acquisition technique bhuyian et al 2015 ineffective flow area ifa elements are introduced in the model to consider that during backwater induced floods the water flow is characterized by a low modulus i e close to zero of the velocity field in the more lateral flood plains an ifa is a geometrical element in hec ras that identifies the cross sectional area not actively involved in the flow as confirmed by our numerical results it is assumed that water tends to pond in the areas that are inundated only during exceptional floods i e the areas defined as fascia b in the technical document piano di stralcio per l assetto idrogeologico pai adb po 1999 therefore the floodplain area of fascia b fig 1c is modeled as an ifa in such a way the computational domain is divided into transport ineffective areas which are passively flooded and active transport effective areas which convey the stream flow and can be modeled using a 1d hydraulic approach in accordance with previous works anghileri et al 2013 saleh et al 2013 the 1r model adopts a single manning s roughness coefficient for the riverbed and another one for the floodplains the values for these two roughness coefficients are determined during model calibration the upstream boundary condition for the model is based on a discharge flow hydrograph calculated from measurements at the miorina dam arpa lombardia 2020 shifted in time majone mignosa 1995 while the downstream boundary condition is the stage hydrograph at the confluence of the ticino and po rivers ponte della becca station aipo 2020 2 2 2 3r model the 1r model reliably simulates the flood dynamics within the floodplain for events that cause the water surface threshold of 61 61 m a s l to be exceeded at the ponte coperto station flood pattern a above this height via milazzo is completely flooded allowing direct flooding from the ticino river fig 2a under these conditions borgo basso can be considered part of the active floodplain of the ticino river however less severe flood events i e that do not reach 61 61 m a s l at the ponte coperto station cannot be modeled by such a simplified geometry that does not allow simulation of the indirect flooding from the ticino river as its waters flow backward along the gravellone and longarina canals fig 2b therefore the 3r 3 reaches 1d unsteady model is proposed to accurately describe the flood dynamics inside the borgo basso urban area flood pattern b in the 3r model two additional reach elements are added to the geometry used in the 1r model to separately describe the behavior of the gravellone and longarina canals fig 2b and fig 3 a the two minor channels are linked to each other and to the main watercourse through junction elements in hec ras that ensure hydraulic continuity hec 2001 in the 3r model sections 4 to 3 25 of the ticino river are re shaped by removing the right hand side of them such that only the central riverbed and the left hand floodplain are included fig 3a cross sections of the gravellone and longarina canals are acquired from a 5 5 m dtm regione lombardia 2015 and in situ inspections the floodplain areas that are directly flooded by the gravellone canal fig 2b and 3a zones 3 4 are included within the gravellone cross sections while those that receive water from the longarina canal fig 2b and 3a zones 1 2 and 5 are represented using storage area sa elements a lateral structure ls is introduced to connect the longarina canal to each sa element in agreement with the approach of castellarin et al 2011a a ls is also introduced between zone 1 and zone 2 to represent the connection between the two sas which occurs when the via trinchera road embankment is overtopped starting from 60 4 m a s l the connection between the longarina canal and zone 1 which occurs through an underground concrete pipe as explained in subsection 2 1 is described using a ls culvert scheme the selection of the appropriate connection type between storage areas to be used in the 1d model deserves careful attention as it can affect the water level distribution in the floodplain pheulpin et al 2019 like the 1r modeling scheme ifa elements are introduced for the floodplain area enclosed in fascia b of the piano di stralcio per l assetto idrogeologico pai adb po 1999 the upstream boundary condition for the ticino river is a discharge flow hydrograph while the downstream boundary condition is the stage hydrograph at the confluence during the simulation of flood events when the battella sluice gate is closed the upstream boundary condition for the gravellone and longarina canals is a negligible constant flow hydrograph since zero flow is not allowed as an upstream boundary condition for a reach element the values of the manning s roughness coefficients for the riverbed and the floodplains are those determined during the calibration of the 1r model 2 2 3 2d model lastly a hybrid 1d 2d model 2d model is introduced to more accurately represent the flood dynamics inside borgo basso and to test the reliability of the 3r model to reproduce flood events in the examined floodplain area the 1d scheme is maintained along the reach of the ticino river while a 2d approach is used to represent the floodplain area fig 3b the geometry of the floodplain area is composed of a structured mesh of 20 20 m cells with a 10 10 m refinement around the breaklines geometrical elements used to align the cells along higher elevation structures such as levees embankments etc an additional 5 5 m refinement was necessary near the confluence of the gravellone canal and the ticino river and near the via trinchera culvert the manning s roughness coefficients for the 2d area are based on the land use of soil dusaf 6 0 from regione lombardia 2019 and range from 0 06 s m1 3 for the cultivated areas to 0 15 s m1 3 for the high density urban areas following the values suggested by the hec ras manual hec 2001 the weighted on area average of these values is used to calculate the manning s coefficient of the floodplain 0 1 s m1 3 for the 2d model the connection between the 1d reach and the 2d area is made using a ls that represents the ticino right bank and the gravellone canal confluence 2 3 morris global sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was performed using the morris method morris 1991 wainwright et al 2014 to assess the sensitivity of the 3r model to the uncertainty in model input factors also referred to as model input parameters global sensitivity analysis is widely adopted as a diagnostic method of hydrologic and hydraulic models herman et al 2013 investigated the potential of the morris method to correctly identify sensitive and insensitive parameters of highly parameterized spatially distributed watershed models with significant reduction of the computational expense with respect to sobol s method hall et al 2009 reviewed a variety of methods for sensitivity analysis that are computationally efficient and allow the effect of input factors acting individually or in combination to be diagnosed these methods including the morris method sobol s method and the fast method were tested on the very simple benchmark example of the sudden release of water in a flume including an adverse slope they concluded that if the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to fix non influential factors then the measure of morris 1991 is more appropriate especially when the number of uncertain parameters is high and or the model computational time is expensive hall et al 2009 xu and mynett 2006 investigated the effect of parameter uncertainty in a flood damage model and defined the rank of these parameters based on the morris sensitivity analysis they concluded that the morris method is an efficient approach to help reduce the uncertainty in model outputs the guiding philosophy of the morris method is to determine which factors may be considered to have effects that are a negligible b linear and additive or c nonlinear or interacting with other inputs campolongo et al 2007 a factor is any source of uncertainty in the modeling process including physical parameters boundary conditions model structure etc pappenberger et al 2008 according to the morris method the range of each model input x i i 1 k is scaled to a unitary interval 0 1 divided in p equally spaced levels and may take on values from 0 1 p 1 2 p 1 1 in the k dimensional p level grid which is named the region of experimentation ω for a given set of values x x 1 x 2 x k assumed by the model inputs the elementary effect of the i th input factor is defined as 6 ee i j d i x y x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ in eq 6 y is the chosen model output δ is a pre determined multiple of 1 p 1 and x x 1 x 2 x k is any selected value in ω so that the transformed point x e i δ is still in ω e i is a vector of zeroes except for the i th element which is equal to 1 a convenient choice for the parameters p and δ is p even and δ p 2 p 1 to guarantee a symmetric treatment of inputs as suggested by morris morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 starting from the initial set of factors x x 1 x 2 x k randomly chosen between the p possible values the value of a single factor xi is adjusted by δ and the ee i j is computed using eq 6 subsequently all the remaining factors are adjusted one at a time in a random order thus drawing a trajectory in the region of experimentation at the end of the k 1 th simulation the ee i is computed for each of the factors and a new initial set x x 1 x 2 x k is selected at the beginning of a new trajectory once all r trajectories have been investigated the mean elementary effect μ i the absolute value of the mean elementary effect μ i and the standard deviation of the mean elementary effect σ i are calculated for each input x i as morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 kaixuan et al 2019 7 μ i j 1 r ee i j r 8 μ i j 1 r ee i j r 9 σ i j 1 r ee i j μ i 2 r 1 in eqs 7 9 μ i and σ i are the sensitivity measures as proposed by morris 1991 and represent the mean and the standard deviation of the ee i while μ i the absolute value of the mean elementary effect is a measure proposed by campolongo et al 2007 in place of μ i this is because the latter may be affected by type ii errors i e failure to identify a factor of considerable influence on the model the larger the value of μ i for the considered input factor the more influential the factor is on the assessed model output if σ i is large compared to μ i the relationship between a change in the parameter value and the resulting model output is either nonlinear and or the parameter interacts with other model parameters and so the elementary effect is affected by the values of the other input parameters morris 1991 feng et al 2019 reinecke et al 2019 the sensitivity of the 3r model to the uncertainty in model input factors is carried out by imposing synthetic hydrographs for upstream and downstream boundary conditions fig 4 the upstream boundary condition is a parameterized hydrograph for the ticino river proposed by d andrea et al 2009 the hydrographs have an initial constant value of 600 m3 s followed by a 24 h long ramp that linearly links the initial flow rate to the maximum value q and is maintained constant until the end of the simulation the downstream boundary condition consists of a triangular parameterized stage hydrograph based on the synthetic hydrographs calculated for the po river majone et al 2006 applying the method described by tomirotti and mignosa 2017 the triangular stage hydrograph starts from 56 m a s l and has a fixed duration d of 168 h it is defined by a maximum of the po river water surface elevation z and a coefficient c t p d which defines the temporal occurrence tp of the hydrograph peak with respect to the beginning of the event and its duration d the relative position of the peak of the ticino river hydrograph with respect to the peak of the po river hydrograph is described with the relative peak timing rpt fig 4 shows that the shape of the adopted synthetic hydrographs is consistent with those of the observed flood event of november 2019 the morris analysis was carried out using the salib package herman usher 2017 in python to determine the relative sensitivity of i the calculated water surface elevation in four representative locations of the study area and ii a damage index di based on both water depth and flood extent in borgo basso to each of six uncertain model factors a set of 20 factor trajectories for each of these two model outputs was chosen by maximizing the distance between the trajectories using the methods of campolongo et al 2007 and ruano et al 2012 the model output flow velocity is not included in the analysis since backwater induced flooding is characterized by a very low velocity field in borgo basso the sensitivity of the model outputs water surface elevation and di to each of the six model factors is assessed by sampling each factor at six values over their respective ranges similar to pappenberger et al 2008 according to the choices in alipour et al 2022 and pheulpin et al 2022 and considering the peculiar flood dynamics induced by the backwater effect the six factors include the maximum flow rate of the ticino river at the upstream boundary q the maximum water surface elevation of the po river at the confluence z the manning s roughness coefficients of the main channel nch and the floodplains nfp the relative peak timing rpt of the ticino and po river hydrograph peaks and the coefficient c which defines the peak of the hydrograph s temporal occurrence with respect to the beginning of the event and its duration d the current study does not consider the dependence among the uncertain model factors on the output the effect on the predicted flooding due to the dependent input model factors will be considered in future research table 1 shows the sampling range for the examined model factors when the considered model output is the water surface elevation q is assumed to range from 1000 m3 s to 2000 m3 s which corresponds to return periods of 1 5 20 years for the ticino peak flow rate z is assumed to range from 58 6 m a s l first alarm threshold to 60 6 m a s l critical alarm threshold adb po 1999 the rpt parameter ranges from 10 h ticino peak occurring before po peak to 15 h ticino peak occurring after po peak the uncertainty related to the coefficient c is examined by varying the value between 0 23 and 0 33 which corresponds to the values proposed for the casale monferrato and piacenza synthetic hydrographs majone et al 2006 fig 1b casale monferrato and piacenza are the closest upstream and downstream gauging stations with respect to the ponte della becca station the uncertain ranges of the manning s roughness coefficients of the main channel nch and the floodplains nfp span from 0 025 to 0 045 s m1 3 and 0 06 0 21 s m1 3 respectively according to hec ras manual hec 2001 meanwhile the twenty morris trajectories are generated using narrower ranges for some factors z q n ch to assess which factors most influence the di which indicates when houses are flooded table 1 the proposed di is similar to the depth damage curves described by nadal et al 2010 and relies on the observation that while flooding often occurs in borgo basso not every event inundates the houses in this area analyzing the dtm of the urban area of borgo basso fig 3 shows that the houses along via milazzo are built at a higher level than the countryside behind them and remain dry up to an elevation of 60 6 m a s l at this elevation homes in the borgo basso area begin to flood even though much of the study area is already flooded the di value is defined to equal 0 when the inhabited area is not flooded i e when the water level in the storage areas is below 60 6 m a s l the di equals 1 when the water level reaches or exceeds 61 4 m a s l resulting in flooding of all the houses for water levels ranging from 60 6 to 61 4 m a s l the di is calculated as 10 di a wet a u where a wet is the extent of the flooded portion of the urban area for the given water surface elevation h and a u is a constant 48309 m2 that represents total flooding of the urban area when the water level reaches 61 4 m a s l fig 5 a 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the 1r and 3r models since the proposed 1d models i e 1r model and 3r model only differ in their schematization of the floodplain area behind borgo basso which is a small portion of the entire modeled reach of the ticino river it is suitable to calibrate the 1d models against historical flood events using only the 1r geometry the 3r geometry is subsequently used for model validation stage data from the catastrophic flood event of october 2000 is compared to stage values calculated by the 1r model during model calibration subsequently stage data from the less severe flood events of november 2019 and november 2014 are compared to stage values calculated by the 3r model to validate the models the calibration process was used to determine the channel and floodplain manning s roughness coefficients 0 035 s m1 3 for the channel and 0 1 s m1 3 for the floodplain that minimize the difference between the simulated hydrograph and the measured data at the ponte coperto cross section fig 6 the october 2000 flood is one of the most severe known flood events for the city of pavia this event shows the contemporaneity of exceptional water levels in the po river which reached a peak stage of 62 94 m a s l at the ponte della becca station 60 6 m a s l is the critical emergency threshold and in the ticino river which reached a peak value of 63 69 m a s l at the ponte coperto piano comunale di protezione civile del comune di vigevano 2011 the ticino peak flow rate of 2646 m3 s is a value that exceeds the 200 year return period flow based on adb po 1999 fig 6 the 1r model reproduces the observed stage hydrograph at the ponte coperto with suitable accuracy and the modeled hydrograph is close to the one simulated by vergnani et al 2010 with a 1d unsteady hydraulic model vzm model of the sublacual ticino river and po river from isola s antonio to piacenza fig 6 additionally at the ponte coperto the peak stage value of 63 51 m a s l calculated by the 1r model is similar to that of the observed peak 63 69 m a s l and the peak calculated by the vzm model 63 50 m a s l further confirming the reliability of the 1r model results for extreme flood events fig 6 according to alipour et al 2022 the roughness coefficient dem and mesh resolution are more influential on the prediction of both maximum water level dynamics therefore the satisfactory results confirm the suitability of the adopted mesh and spatial resolution as well as the reliability of calibrated roughness coefficients it is worth noting that while some modeling approaches considered a constant downstream water level for the analysis of backwater induced flooding liro et al 2020 the present work applies a time varying stage hydrograph at the downstream boundary which helps improve the accuracy of model prediction the 3r 1d model is validated against the flood events of november 2019 and november 2014 the comparison of the 3r simulated hydrograph and the observed data show that the 3r model effectively reproduces the observed water surface elevation values near the ponte coperto fig 7 a and e using the manning roughness coefficients determined through calibration of the 1r model the small deviation with respect to measured peak water surface elevation is of the same order of magnitude as the resolution accuracy of the digital terrain model adopted for the schematization of the area alipour et al 2022 showed that the dem resolution is an important factor when simulating water level dynamics in floodplains the maximum dem resolution adopted in their hec ras model of san jacinto river basin southeast texas was twice i e 10 m the spatial resolution of 5 m resolution used in this study xing et al 2021 investigated the influence of model spatial resolution on the flooding of an urbanized area they showed that spatial resolution may have more influence on flood flow characteristics since water blocking obstacles i e buildings may be better or worse represented therefore they adopted a minimum resolution of 5 m the small deviation of simulated with respect to measured peak water surface elevation can be partially attributed to the fact that the available observation data for these events are acquired at the ponte della libertà hydrometer which is located about 400 m upstream of the ponte coperto according to the longitudinal profiles for a 200 year return period event for the ticino river available in piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 the difference between the water levels at the two bridges may vary from approximately 5 to 15 cm depending on the intensity of the po river s influence the 1r and 3r models provide nearly identical results at the control points ponte coperto urban area 3 for the two flood events table 2 but the simplified 1r geometry is omitted for the remainder of the study since it inadequately describes the flood dynamics in the borgo basso area for flood events that do not cause the critical threshold related to the direct flooding of via milazzo to be exceeded urban areas 1 and 2 are inaccurately predicted to be dry table 2 3 2 3r vs 2d model to test the reliability of the 3r model in reproducing the flood dynamics inside the borgo basso urban area the results of the 1d and 2d models were compared for the two recent floods of november 2014 and november 2019 the outputs from both models are examined both at the ponte coperto and at three additional locations within the floodplain area to obtain a comprehensive and detailed interpretation of the flood dynamics throughout the inhabited areas the three sub areas in which the trend of the water surface elevation is examined include fig 2b urban area 1 which extends from the ponte coperto to the via trinchera road embankment and is totally included in zone 1 urban area 2 which extends from via trinchera to the continuation of the embankment that separates zone 2 from zone 3 and urban area 3 which is the most downstream area of the borgo basso settlement although the two flood events used for comparison of the 3r and 2d models are characterized by similar maximum water levels at the ponte della libertà gauging station table 2 they show different dynamics through time fig 7 the 2014 event has two neighbouring flow peaks of about 2000 m3 s three days apart assessed from measurements at the miorina hydrometer and a maximum stage level of 60 25 m a s l recorded at ponte della becca po river during the second peak table 2 november 2014 was a critical month for the ticino river basin with a discharge flow calculated from stage measurements at the miorina station that exceeded 1000 m3 s for 20 days during november 2019 the maximum discharge flow at the lake maggiore outlet was around 1000 m3 s but the po river water level reached 60 87 m a s l table 2 exceeding the maximum alert threshold set at 60 6 m a s l adb po 1999 the 2019 flood was therefore a shorter event mainly caused by the backwater action of po river while the 2014 flood had a longer duration due to a prolonged rainy period in the ticino river basin while the causes of the november 2014 and 2019 floods were different both the 3r and 2d models simulate these floods with similar accuracy fig 7a 7e the simulated hydrographs for the two models are almost coincident for the 2019 event while they differ slightly for the 2014 flood fig 7a e the 3r model returns a maximum water level at the ponte coperto bridge that is 4 cm higher than the level predicted by the 2d model for the 2014 flood event and 2 cm higher for the 2019 flood event table 2 this slight difference can be attributed to the difference in how the study area is hydraulically connected to the main watercourse in the two models in the 2d model the connection is continuous and governed by a ls that extends from ponte coperto to the confluence with the gravellone canal the hydraulic connection in the 3r model occurs using a junction element that connects the ticino river with the gravellone canal the wider connection in the 2d model allows for greater transport of water towards the internal areas of the floodplain this is consistent with the 4 cm lower maximum water level in the urban areas within the floodplain predicted by the 3r model as compared to the level predicted by the 2d model table 2 the flood dynamics within the urban areas of borgo basso can be further compared both temporally and spatially the simulated hydrographs in urban area 1 exhibit a different shape compared to those obtained in urban areas 2 and 3 fig 7 for both the 3r and 2d models the rate of change of the water surface elevation for urban area 1 suddenly increases when the overtopping of the via trinchera road embankment occurs starting from 60 4 m a s l which directly connects urban area 2 to urban area 1 fig 7b and f after this elevation the three urban areas are hydraulically connected and therefore experience the same water elevation the simulated hydrographs are nearly identical for the two models in urban areas 2 and 3 during the 2019 flood event and only differ slightly 4 cm at the flood peak during the 2014 flood event fig 7 table 2 meanwhile the simulated hydrographs for the two models differ to a greater extent in urban area 1 particularly when modeling the recession of the flood fig 7b f even if further investigation is required to assess the above difference between the 3r and 2d models in urban area 1 these models only differ in their prediction of the peak water level by 4 cm table 2 thus ensuring accurate evaluation of the peak water levels in the urban areas which is the key aspect for a reliable estimate of flood damage within borgo basso additionally the spatial extent and depth of the flooding in the floodplain are other important factors in predicting the extent of damage during flood events and can be estimated using the 3r and 2d models the two model schemes result in similar predictions of the flood depth and its spatial extent fig 8 a 8b especially in zone 1 and the upstream portion of zone 2 where most buildings are located fig 2b fig 8a b the modeling schemes show the greatest difference along the border of zones 2 and 3 and in zone 3 near the river where urban area 3 is located with the 2d model predicting flooding in this area and the 3r model not fig 8a b such a difference in the model response may be related to the type of hydraulic connection between neighbouring storage areas that may induce local differences of the water level distribution with respect to the 2d model pheulpin et al 2019 however this investigation is beyond the target of this work because the difference can be neglected since it pertains to a relatively small portion of the floodplain with flooding throughout most of the floodplain similarly predicted regardless of whether the 3r or 2d model is implemented this similarity between the predicted flood extents depths for the two schemes indicates the model assumption that ponding occurs in the areas described with storage area elements in the 3r model is valid this assumption of ponding in these areas is further validated by the velocity map from the 2014 flood peak obtained with the 2d model which shows that the velocity is close to zero fig 8c both the 3r and 2d modeling schemes consistently reproduce the backwater inundation of borgo basso during the non extreme flood events of november 2014 and 2019 similarly simulating both the hydrographs throughout the duration of the events fig 7 and the flood extent and depth fig 8a b however the 1d 3r model proves particularly advantageous as it both produces reliable results and saves computational time as compared to the 2d hybrid model for example the simulation of the november 2014 flood with a 60 s computational time step lasts approximately 10 s for the 3r model while it takes about 180 s for the 2d model to run when an intel r core tm i7 10710u cpu 1 61 ghz processor with 16 gb ram is used this faster computational time becomes important when running numerous simulations such as may be necessary when trying to predict how different flow conditions along the ticino and po rivers may interact to affect flooding within borgo basso 3 3 sensitivity of the 3r model the morris method of global sensitivity analysis was used to explore how different conditions along the po and ticino rivers affect the simulated hydrographs and flooding within borgo basso the morris method was first applied to assess the sensitivity of the calculated water level elevations to the 6 model factors table 1 fig 9 the relative influence of each model factor on the calculated water level was evaluated at each of the four control point locations i e at the ponte coperto bridge and urban areas 1 2 and 3 within the borgo basso flood zone fig 2 the factor that is most influential on the water levels predicted by the 3r model at ponte coperto and in the urban areas within borgo basso is the maximum water level of the po river z fig 9 this behavior is consistent with the dynamics of past flood events from which it is well known that the water level of the po is the real threat to borgo basso rather than the ticino river flow rate meanwhile the different shape of the stage hydrograph expressed by the parameter c has a negligible influence on the maximum water level values at the ponte coperto and within borgo basso pheulpin et al 2022 considered the dependence between model input parameters on the modeling of dike breach induced inundation in a very simple case even if the flooding dynamics may be somewhat different with respect to the present case as the backwater effect is neglected they found that if the three hydrograph parameters are assumed to be dependent they all have a greater effect on the flooding it is possible that c has a greater impact on flood duration and or on the time to reach the maximum water surface elevation within the borgo basso area but this aspect as well as the dependency between hydrograph parameters can be further investigated in the near future while the ranking of the factors is the same for each of the four control points the influence of the factors differs between the main river and the three control points in the borgo basso floodplain at the ponte coperto nch and q exert slightly more influence on the modeled water level than they do on the water levels calculated in the urban areas this difference is explained by the fact that the ponte coperto control point is located on the main channel to which nch applies and closer to the upstream boundary condition which is parameterized using q the influence of all the factors in the three urban areas is similar this first application of the morris method comprised 140 simulations but only 43 of the simulations calculated a water level higher than 60 6 m a s l at the control points in the three urban areas making these simulations unreliable for assessing the sensitivity of the di to the 6 factors to assess whether the influence of the model factors on the di remains unchanged when the analysis is restricted to the simulations leading to flooding of houses in borgo basso a further application of the morris method was performed by restricting the range of some parameters table 1 this second application of the morris method shows that under scenarios which lead to flooding of borgo basso houses the di is most influenced by the value of nfp fig 5b this is because nfp directly affects the movement of floodwaters in this floodplain area the examined range of nfp is wide and only conditions for which active floodplains convey large quantities of water are considered in this analysis this is a crucial aspect to consider since the simplifications deriving from the 1d approach require a large sampling range of the roughness coefficient this second application of the morris method to the di also shows that the maximum peak stage of the po river z maintains a fundamental role in predicting the flooding of borgo basso despite its reduced range in uncertainty and confirms this input as the most dangerous factor influencing the flooding of the houses in borgo basso however the mean elementary effects are more similar across all factors excluding c than they were for the initial morris analysis where the mean elementary effect of the maximum stage level of the po river z was significantly greater than any of the other factors therefore the peak flow rate in the ticino q and the relative time between the po and ticino peaks rpt also play a role in the flooding of borgo basso examining the corresponding σ values from the morris analysis also indicates there may be a slight interaction between some of the factors since some σ values are almost as large as their corresponding µ values e g q µ 0 305 σ 0 278 and rpt µ 0 298 σ 0 289 in the di morris analysis fig 5b the most influential factors resulting from the sensitivity analysis are in accordance with theoretical expectations based on the physics of the considered phenomenon i e backwater flooding this important outcome confirms that the morris method is appropriate in the case where the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to fix non influential factors hall et al 2009 despite the relative complexity of the computational domain which extends further downstream of the flooded area and the burden of unsteady flow simulations a relatively small amount of computational time and resources are required to evaluate the sensitivity to model factors with respect to variance based methods applied to other cases that model urban flooding chen et al 2018 when dealing with complex computer models in the field of hydraulic engineering sensitivity analysis continues to be an essential step in good modeling practice because it provides a systematic approach to explore how the model outputs are affected by varying input values 3 4 implications for flooding of borgo basso the morris sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the maximum stage level in the po river z is most influential on the results of the model while the shape of its stage hydrograph expressed by the coefficient c has a negligible influence the remaining examined factors maximum flow rate in ticino q manning s roughness of the riverbed nch manning s roughness of the floodplains nfp rpt parameter that expresses the contemporaneity of the floods of the ticino and po rivers have a similar influence on the results although q and nch are slightly more influential than the n fp and rpt parameters since the most serious flood threat to borgo basso is the severity of the po river flood expressed by the maximum water level at the confluence z measures that attenuate po river floods would be most helpful in reducing floods in borgo basso such interventions must be enacted at the basin scale and various studies on the subject have already been conducted especially related to catastrophic events e g castellarin et al 2011a and b in this study the focus is on less severe flood events di 1 that are generally neglected even though they occur more frequently thus causing recurrent inconvenience for the inhabitants of borgo basso the sensitivity analysis that focuses on scenarios which lead to flooding of houses within borgo basso fig 5b demonstrates that the maximum ticino river flow rate q and the relative timing of the hydrograph peak rpt parameters have a similar influence on the potential damage to the inhabited area through analyses not shown in this work it was found that a delayed ticino flood wave of even a few hours with respect to that of the po river can make a difference for the houses in borgo basso although the impact is only a few centimeters at the river scale for example a 5 hour delay rpt can produce a reduction of 8 cm for the water level in the flooded area when the ticino maximum flow rate q is 2000 m3 s and the po river maximum stage level z is 59 8 m a s l meanwhile the shape of the stage hydrograph of the po river expressed by parameter c has a negligible influence on the maximum stage values of the flooding at ponte coperto and within borgo basso however it is reasonable to expect that parameter c may be influential on the flood duration and on the time to reach the maximum water surface elevation within the borgo basso area therefore future analyses should address the influence of rtp and c on the temporal dynamics of flooding within the inhabited borgo basso floodplain because the rate at which the water surface elevation rises within the floodplain is likely crucial in assessing the vulnerability of the inhabited area and is thus crucial for a comprehensive risk analysis of the floodplain 3 5 innovation and potential applicability the results of numerical modeling are strongly affected by the degree of complexity of the model as well as by the uncertainties inherent in the definition of model input parameters sometimes many describing the investigated phenomenon in this context one of the main innovations brought by this research is the analysis of the influence of modeling scheme on the model results in terms of maximum water level and flooding extent to assess the trade off between model accuracy and complexity also in terms of computational expense three different flood events occurring between 2000 and 2019 are simulated for calibration validation and comparison of different hydraulic models characterized by an increasing degree of structural and numerical complexity even if some studies showed that 2d hydrodynamic models outperform 1d models in some applications alipour et al 2022 the present work demonstrates that by proper representation of the relevant flow controlling factors the 1d modeling approach can still provide high quality results while significantly reducing the computational effort with respect to the 2d approach concerning the uncertainty of some model parameters sensitivity analysis represents a necessary step toward the responsible use of hydraulic models hall et al 2009 if reliable easy to use hydraulic models are required by decision makers for prediction and mitigation of flood risk comprehensive analysis of the model sensitivity to variations in the model input parameters is required to assess the most influential parameters and possibly to provide model simplification without loss of accuracy in general the higher the number of uncertain parameters in the sensitivity analysis the simpler the test case on which the numerical model is run hall et al 2009 pheulpin et al 2022 this work developed a relatively simple with respect to 2d models and reliable 1d model and combined it with the morris method of sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of many six uncertain input parameters on a real case with complex topography in particular the influence of both upstream and downstream hydrographs as well as their relative peak timing is considered which represents an innovation with respect to the referenced works dealing with sensitivity analysis alipour et al 2022 pheulpin et al 2019 another novel aspect of this work is the analysis of a peculiar flood dynamic and pattern which is induced by the backwater effect even if such a category of inundations is rarely considered in the literature except in coastal environments it is a serious threat to both local governance and citizens because these events can cause recurrent inconvenience in an urban floodplain and amplify the devastation and losses associated with a watercourse s flood making lamination ineffective along the watercourse further studies can be carried out to include how dependence between model factors may influence model outputs in the work by pheulpin et al 2022 a fictive idealized test case was analyzed where flow hydrograph parameters were considered dependent the results showed that all the factors have a major effect on the predicted flooding when they are considered dependent unlike in the case where they are assumed to be independent the application of this methodology to a large 2d hydraulic model was not performed in that study probably because the use of sobol s method for sensitivity analysis becomes computationally demanding when real cases must be simulated with increasing model complexity for this reason the 1d modeling approach combined with the morris sensitivity method proposed in the current study may be applied to the study of such dependent model parameters and may help overcome this issue in future studies the modeling approach proposed in the current study based on a fast running simple and accurate 1d numerical model may be suitable for risk analysis and management it can be used to develop a multi disciplinary decision support system dss for flood hazard risk prediction and to explore several scenarios including potential risk reduction options manenti et al 2019 furthermore owing to its relatively simple structure and relatively low numerical complexity the model is suitable for inclusion in an early warning system ews 4 conclusions in recent years worsening climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressure have led to more rapid and destructive floods for this reason most of the hydraulic models available today are focused on the study of these extreme events against which large scale mitigation measures are required however there are some phenomena such as backwater induced flooding in urban areas which are rarely considered although they can cause recurrent inconvenience in an urban floodplain and amplify the devastation and losses associated with a watercourse s flood in this study we analyzed the borgo basso area in the city of pavia using hec ras software to reproduce the complex flood dynamics of both catastrophic and moderate events within an urbanized area of the floodplain the influence of modeling schemes 1d 2d on flood dynamics as well as the model sensitivity were thoroughly investigated to assess the most influential factors leading to modeling simplifications that allowed us to setup a fast running and reliable numerical model for backwater flood analysis in the urban area the model reliably reproduces recent flood events for which observed data are available by adopting parameters consistent with those proposed in the scientific literature and technical manuals comparison of a 1d model 3r model with a 1d 2d hybrid model 2d model demonstrates that both models consistently simulate the flood dynamics within the borgo basso area especially during those floods in which the backwater effect dominates while the 1d model requires less than a tenth of the computational time required by the 2d model this finding demonstrates that despite technological advances which allow an increasingly extensive use of complex and accurate 2d models carefully designed 1d models can still provide high quality results in a short time and with reduced computational effort due to the short computational time of the 3r model simulations a global sensitivity analysis was carried out using the morris method that allowed for the identification of which model factors are more influential and which factors are negligible for the computed water surface elevation in borgo basso at four representative control points the results of the morris analysis indicate that the severity of the po river flood expressed by the maximum stage level z is most influential on the results of the model highlighting that measures that attenuate po river floods would be most helpful in reducing flooding within borgo basso in addition the morris analysis carried out with narrower ranges of some factors z maximum flow rate in the ticino q manning s roughness of the riverbed n ch allowed for the assessment of which factors are most influential on the damage index di which is formulated based on both water depth and flood extent within borgo basso with a focus on the floodable inhabited area the uncertainty of the roughness of the floodplains has a key role on the results of the simulated events in the active floodplain and is more influential than in the previous morris analysis this is a crucial aspect to consider since the simplifications deriving from the 1d approach require a large sampling range of the roughness coefficient the methodological approach of combining a fast running accurate model with the morris method of sensitivity analysis computationally faster than variance based methods accurately reproduces the dynamic pattern of an extensive combination of different flooding conditions quickly and easily and allows us to assess the most influential parameters on flood damage therefore it can be adopted to support decision makers in the prediction of flood risk for the development of early warning systems and for the definition of mitigation strategies against flood risk in urban areas future research will investigate the influence of model factors on the temporal dynamics of flooding to broaden the significance of these findings to better address safety and security

2745,recent flood related disasters which affect many areas of the world due to a combination of climate change and increasing urbanization have prompted researchers to study catastrophic phenomena for which large scale mitigation strategies are needed however lower impact flood events occur more frequently and although these floods are relatively less destructive they can be effectively mitigated with local protection measures this work focuses on understanding the factors that influence the reliable modeling of these lower impact and less studied flood events we propose a procedure that combines the use of a simple but effective numerical model of the last segment of ticino river with a global sensitivity analysis for an in depth evaluation of i the backwater induced flooding of an urban area in the historical city of pavia northern italy and ii the potential flood damage due to such events a 1d unsteady hec ras model termed the 3r model was set up and validated against historical floods then the 3r model output was compared with a hybrid 1d 2d model of the same area both model schemes provide reliable results and similar predictions of the flood depth and its spatial extent the 3r model is demonstrated to be a successful modeling approach providing a computational cost that is always less than one tenth of the cost of the hybrid 1d 2d for the simulated floods the morris method of sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential factors affecting the results of the 3r model to help inform local policies aimed at flood risk reduction the morris results highlight that the maximum water level of the po river has a dominant role in determining the flood magnitude for the whole area with an influence at the control points in the floodplain that is more than triple that of the ticino maximum flow rate a damage index quantifying the housing loss due to the urban flood extent was introduced and analyzed using the morris method the results show that the predicted flood damage is strongly influenced by the uncertainty in the roughness coefficient of the floodplains the contemporaneity of the floods on the ticino and po rivers was also influential playing a key role in flood severity within the urban area a 5 hour delay of the ticino flood wave maximum flow rate of 2000 m3 s with respect to that of the po river maximum stage level of 59 8 m a s l reduces the water level in the flooded area by 8 cm these results will help the development of flood risk reduction strategies keywords hec ras hydraulic modeling

al 2021 for this reason the assessment of flood risk and mitigation have become a topic of great importance kuriqi and hysa 2021 merz et al 2014 albano et al 2020 even when dealing with domestic and industrial activities related to water production panagopoulos 2021 2022 numerical models are currently widely used for river flow analysis to support the design and management of riverine structures and for the development of hydraulic risk mitigation strategies in response to catastrophic events amicarelli et al 2021 castellarin et al 2011a micotti et al 2014 zeleňáková et al 2019 depending on the aim of each study and data availability 1d 2d or 3d models can be implemented using a variety of approaches for example vergnani et al 2010 used a 1d model to evaluate the impact on ticino river flowrate after a structural modification of the lake maggiore outlet while trueheart et al 2020 set up a full 2d unsteady model to simulate the impact of individual structures on a bridge stream network during extreme floods and bangwen et al 2021 proposed a large scale 3d model to analyze the asynchronous movement characteristics of flood wave propagation and sediment transport the type of model implemented depends on a variety of factors such as the type of data available the desired level of accuracy in the model results the desired ease of use for future users the required spatial resolution of the model results and the need for computational efficiency these factors are often in conflict with one another making it difficult to determine the most appropriate modeling scheme the reliability of numerical modeling for the analysis and prediction of the river flow conditions during floods relies on the degree of complexity of the model adopted to reproduce the involved physical processes a 1d approach implies a simpler spatial discretization scheme and may be suitable for the analysis of river conditions where the stream is characterized by a dominant velocity field in the longitudinal direction with negligible velocity components in the transversal direction along with negligible secondary flow effects awang shariee et al 2020 meanwhile the adoption of a 2d scheme provides an improved representation of flow conditions during flood events where the local hydrodynamics may strongly deviate from the 1d path such as urban flashfloods when increasing the model complexity both a higher computational effort and more accurate input data are generally required gibson et al 2016 for those reasons the set up of a reliable numerical model for river analysis represents a complex task especially when the model is adopted to create probabilistic maps of risk and to develop a multi disciplinary decision support system for natural hazard risk reduction and management by exploring many potential hydrological scenarios and risk mitigation measures newman et al 2017 many recent numerical models have focused on simulating flashfloods inundations caused by heavy precipitation that occurs in a very short time in highly urbanized areas gaume et al 2009 bout et al 2018 galuppini et al 2020 such phenomena are characterized by high water velocity and require complex computationally expensive modeling for adequate description of the water flow through urban elements and massive solid transport costabile et al 2020 in contrast this paper focuses on backwater induced urban floods that are rarely considered in the literature except in coastal environments kumbier et al 2018 lyddon et al 2018 backwater induced urban floods are not due to insufficiency of the drainage network or levee failure as often happens for flashfloods but occur when a watercourse is not able to freely flow into the receiving one due to its high stage level and is therefore consequently impeded this phenomenon causes inundations which are characterized by low velocity in the areas upstream of the confluence of the two watercourses these events are of interest since they can amplify the devastation associated with a watercourse s flood making lamination ineffective along the watercourse such backwater induced floods require a modeling approach that is reliable yet not too time consuming to support early warning systems and effective local protection measures liro et al 2020 adopted a 2d numerical model for simulating dam backwater in a mountain river and evaluating the hydrodynamic pattern and morphological changes in the upstream river reach the impact of reservoir induced backwater on river hydrodynamics is evaluated by considering proper modeling scenarios that combine three cases of flood magnitudes with two values of downstream stages in each scenario they assume constant water level at the downstream section rather than adopting a time dependent stage hydrograph however the work did not apply a sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of input model parameters on the results even though sensitivity analysis is of great concern to evaluate model accuracy depending on reliability of input data as well as to provide useful information for risk assessment and mitigation xing et al 2021 in this context the main aim of this work is to setup a reliable numerical model for backwater flood analysis in an urban area while balancing trade offs between accuracy and computational cost to support decision makers in the prediction and mitigation of flood risk as well as for the development of an early warning system the proposed procedure combines a hydraulic model developed using the common open source software for river analysis hec ras with the morris method for global sensitivity analysis gsa morris 1991 for reliable modeling of the backwater induced flooding and analysis of the most influential factors affecting inundation extent and induced damage in an urban floodplain the open source software hec ras developed by the u s army corps of engineers hec 2001 is widely adopted for the hydraulic simulation of river floods and for the numerical investigation of the effect of structures that affect the river cross section altering the hydraulic regime and causing a backwater effect ardiclioglu et al 2022 tariq et al 2021 ardiclioglu and kuriqi 2019 the morris method is applied to this hydraulic model to assess which model inputs have the greatest influence on modeled flood dynamics in the urban area of interest while variance based methods are frequently adopted for carrying out model sensitivity analysis their higher computational demand with respect to alternative methods e g those based on the analysis of partial derivatives makes them more suitable for applications to laboratory experiments chen et al 2018 or urbanized areas with small spatial extents xing et al 2021 the morris method was therefore chosen instead of such variance based methods to reduce the computational expense the proposed procedure is applied to the case of the borgo basso urban area in the city of pavia northern italy located in the right hand floodplain of the ticino river which is a few kilometers upstream of its confluence with the po river the most important river in italy fig 1 several catastrophic inundations have occurred in this area over the past centuries and can be divided into three classes i high flow floods that occur when precipitation in the upper ticino basin is particularly intense and prolonged ii backwater floods caused by the po river water level preventing the normal flow of the ticino river and iii contemporary floods of the ticino and po rivers piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 cattaneo et al 2000 saltalippi 1999 an example of the latter type is the october 2000 flood which was devastating not only for the city of pavia but for the whole po river basin causing incalculable damage throughout northern italy many researchers have since simulated the dynamics of the october 2000 flood event and it still represents a reference benchmark for the calibration validation of numerical models of the ticino river cattaneo et al 2000 micotti et al 2014 anghileri et al 2013 castellarin et al 2011a for example 1d models along the ticino river were calibrated validated using the october 2000 flood event to create a hydro geological risk assessment for the city of pavia available in piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 and to analyze the propagation of high return period flood waves micotti et al 2014 vergnani et al 2010 therefore the current study similarly uses the october 2000 flood event to validate our numerical model results in this study a hydraulic model is proposed to reproduce with suitable accuracy the flood dynamics within the borgo basso urban area in pavia during backwater induced floods both for catastrophic events and for more modest floods where less damage is expected and local mitigation measures can be more easily implemented a 1d hydraulic model set up for the simulation of catastrophic events for the area of interest termed the 1r model is initially presented along with a discussion of its intrinsic limitations for the description of the flood dynamic within the borgo basso urban area for moderate flood events an improved 1d model of the area is then proposed 3r model to overcome such limitations even if some studies showed that 2d hydrodynamic models outperform 1d models in some applications alipour et al 2022 a 1d 2d hybrid model is developed to demonstrate the reliability of the 3r model when reproducing two recent flood events that occurred in november 2014 and november 2019 a morris analysis is then performed to assess the relative role and the ranking of flood controlling variables influencing the outputs of the 3r model even if variance based computationally expensive methods have been adopted for sensitivity analysis of simplified inundation models pheulpin et al 2022 the measure of morris 1991 is more appropriate to fix non influential factors especially when the number of uncertain parameters is high and or the model computational time is expensive hall et al 2009 xu and mynett 2006 in the present work a relatively simple but reliable 1d model is combined with the morris method of sensitivity analysis allowing for exploration of the effects of many six uncertain input parameters on a real case with complex topography the time dependent influence of both upstream and downstream hydrographs as well as their relative peak timing can be considered which allows for investigation of the peculiar dynamics of backwater flooding and represents an innovation with respect to the referenced works on this topic alipour et al 2022 pheulpin et al 2019 a damage index is also proposed based on the inundation depth and extent within the flooded area lastly an additional morris analysis is carried out to assess which factors are most influential on the damage index when flooding occurs within the borgo basso urban area the proposed modeling approach based on a fast running simple and accurate 1d numerical model is suitable for simulating the dynamic pattern of backwater induced flooding and allows us to assess the most influential parameters on the modeled flood damage the model can be applied to risk analysis and management supporting the planning of effective protection strategies for mitigating the flood risk in the examined area furthermore owing to its relatively simple structure and relatively low numerical complexity the model is suitable for inclusion in an early warning system ews 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the ticino river which is 248 km long is one the main tributaries of the po river it originates in the swiss alps and flows into lake maggiore from which it continues for 110 km along the north italian lowlands called the pianura padana until its confluence with the po river the hydrologic regime of the ticino river is characterized by high flows in autumn and spring alternating with dry periods in summer and winter the river is regulated through the miorina dam built in 1942 at the outlet of lake maggiore and the panperduto diversion dam which is slightly downstream of the outlet bizzi et al 2012 both dams are significantly upstream 96 km and 89 km respectively of where the numerical model reach begins in the city of pavia the final portion of the ticino river from the ponte coperto bridge in pavia to its confluence with the po river flows through a plain characterized by a low slope 0 2 the ponte coperto historical non automatic hydrometer and the ponte della libertà gauging station arpa lombardia 2020 are located along the ticino river near the city of pavia fig 1 the ponte della libertà hydrometer records stage data every 10 minutes while the ponte della becca gauging station aipo 2020 is located along the po river at its confluence with the ticino and records stage data every 30 minutes the data from these three gauging stations are used in this study to validate the model results the area of interest for this study termed borgo basso is located on the right hand side of the ticino river approximately 10 km upstream of its confluence with the po river fig 1 this area is within the portion of the ticino river floodplain that extends downstream of the ponte coperto bridge to the confluence of the ticino river and the gravellone canal bounded by the green line in fig 2 a borgo basso is an urban area containing both residential and commercial buildings that can be inundated during flood events the final stretch of the gravellone canal is located to the south of borgo basso transporting water east into the ticino river whenever the gravellone canal can no longer flow into the ticino river due to the rise in the ticino river stage level it is necessary to close the battella sluice gate located where the gravellone canal crosses the ticino main levee the battella sluice gate is closed to protect the territories that lie upstream of the barrier from backwater flooding when the sluicegate is closed flooding of the whole area is determined only by the stage in the ticino river at its confluence with the gravellone canal in this situation flood pattern b fig 2b water from the ticino river flows backwards along the gravellone canal inundating several cultivated fields fig 2b zones 3 4 and the longarina artificial canal which leads the water to more internal areas fig 2b zones 1 2 and 5 zone 1 is connected to the longarina canal through an underground concrete pipe with a diameter of 80 cm in the past the depressed area of zone 1 was the natural continuation of the longarina canal and was part of an articulated attenuation system that safeguarded the borgo basso urban area from backwater floods this system was interrupted by the construction of the trinchera road embankment but the hydraulic continuity is now partially restored by the aforementioned concrete pipe as the ticino river stage continues to rise a larger portion of the floodplain gradually becomes submerged when the stage level in the ticino reaches the elevation of 61 61 m a s l at the hydrometer of ponte coperto submersion of the floodplain is complete under such conditions the five zones depicted in fig 2b merge and water flow in this area becomes determined by the current in the ticino river such as shown in fig 2a 2 2 mathematical modeling the numerical hydraulic models used for this study are implemented with the open source software hec ras 5 0 7 developed by the u s army corps of engineers hec 2001 hec ras allows the user to perform 1d and 2d unsteady flow calculations 1d and 2d approaches can also be conveniently combined within the same model for a better representation of complex problems while maintaining a relatively low computational effort in this study three different model schemes are explored to reproduce the dynamics of flood events characterized by significant backwater effect conditions simulations are performed using both the 1d and 2d unsteady flow modules of hec ras the 1d unsteady flow component of hec ras adopts the 1d de saint venant equations 1 a t q x 0 2 q t q v x g a ξ x s f 0 where q is the flow rate a is the flow area v is the flow velocity g is the gravitational acceleration ξ is the free surface elevation with respect to a reference height and sf represents the friction slope eqs 1 and 2 are solved using the 4 node priessman numerical method preissmann 1961 barkau 1997 the required basic input data include cross section geometry at representative locations manning s roughness coefficients for the riverbed and for the floodplains upstream and downstream boundary conditions energy loss coefficients and hydraulic structure data rodriguez et al 2008 the 2d unsteady flow module is based on the 2d shallow water equations swe 3 h t h u x h v y q 0 4 u t u u x v u y g h x v t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 c f u f v 5 v t u v x v v y g h y v t

coriolis parameter hec ras can solve either the full 2d swe eqs 3 5 or the diffusive shallow water equations dswe a simplification that neglects the inertial terms of the momentum equations in this study the dswe approach was implemented the computing domain is composed of a grid staggered or unstaggered of cells with a maximum of 8 sides whose dimensions depend on several factors such as the dtm resolution or the desired computational cost the grid can be locally refined to comply with the orography and the bathymetry of the domain hec 2001 the current study compares the results from three hec ras modeling schemes that describe the flooding of borgo basso during both flood patterns a and b fig 2 the three schemes include 1 a 1d model termed 1r 1 reach 2 a 1d model termed 3r 3 reaches and 3 a hybrid 1d 2d model termed 2d 2 2 1 1r model the 1r 1 reach 1d unsteady model simulates the behavior of the final portion of the ticino river that extends from the ponte coperto bridge in pavia to the confluence with the po river fig 1 one hec ras reach element is used in this model to describe the behavior of the ticino river the model incorporates the five available surveyed cross sections along the reach to describe the bathymetry fig 1 sections 4 3 2 1 00 piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2004 aipo 2004 aipo 2005 fictitious cross sections are introduced to ensure that a maximum distance of 150 m between contiguous cross sections is not exceeded in such a way the stability of the numerical model is guaranteed saleh et al 2013 all the interpolated cross sections are extracted from the 5x5 m dtm regione lombardia 2015 using the ras mapper tool and then the bathymetry of the main riverbed is corrected using a geometrical interpolation via the xs interpolation tool between the surveyed cross sections to avoid the shortcomings of the lidar data acquisition technique bhuyian et al 2015 ineffective flow area ifa elements are introduced in the model to consider that during backwater induced floods the water flow is characterized by a low modulus i e close to zero of the velocity field in the more lateral flood plains an ifa is a geometrical element in hec ras that identifies the cross sectional area not actively involved in the flow as confirmed by our numerical results it is assumed that water tends to pond in the areas that are inundated only during exceptional floods i e the areas defined as fascia b in the technical document piano di stralcio per l assetto idrogeologico pai adb po 1999 therefore the floodplain area of fascia b fig 1c is modeled as an ifa in such a way the computational domain is divided into transport ineffective areas which are passively flooded and active transport effective areas which convey the stream flow and can be modeled using a 1d hydraulic approach in accordance with previous works anghileri et al 2013 saleh et al 2013 the 1r model adopts a single manning s roughness coefficient for the riverbed and another one for the floodplains the values for these two roughness coefficients are determined during model calibration the upstream boundary condition for the model is based on a discharge flow hydrograph calculated from measurements at the miorina dam arpa lombardia 2020 shifted in time majone mignosa 1995 while the downstream boundary condition is the stage hydrograph at the confluence of the ticino and po rivers ponte della becca station aipo 2020 2 2 2 3r model the 1r model reliably simulates the flood dynamics within the floodplain for events that cause the water surface threshold of 61 61 m a s l to be exceeded at the ponte coperto station flood pattern a above this height via milazzo is completely flooded allowing direct flooding from the ticino river fig 2a under these conditions borgo basso can be considered part of the active floodplain of the ticino river however less severe flood events i e that do not reach 61 61 m a s l at the ponte coperto station cannot be modeled by such a simplified geometry that does not allow simulation of the indirect flooding from the ticino river as its waters flow backward along the gravellone and longarina canals fig 2b therefore the 3r 3 reaches 1d unsteady model is proposed to accurately describe the flood dynamics inside the borgo basso urban area flood pattern b in the 3r model two additional reach elements are added to the geometry used in the 1r model to separately describe the behavior of the gravellone and longarina canals fig 2b and fig 3 a the two minor channels are linked to each other and to the main watercourse through junction elements in hec ras that ensure hydraulic continuity hec 2001 in the 3r model sections 4 to 3 25 of the ticino river are re shaped by removing the right hand side of them such that only the central riverbed and the left hand floodplain are included fig 3a cross sections of the gravellone and longarina canals are acquired from a 5 5 m dtm regione lombardia 2015 and in situ inspections the floodplain areas that are directly flooded by the gravellone canal fig 2b and 3a zones 3 4 are included within the gravellone cross sections while those that receive water from the longarina canal fig 2b and 3a zones 1 2 and 5 are represented using storage area sa elements a lateral structure ls is introduced to connect the longarina canal to each sa element in agreement with the approach of castellarin et al 2011a a ls is also introduced between zone 1 and zone 2 to represent the connection between the two sas which occurs when the via trinchera road embankment is overtopped starting from 60 4 m a s l the connection between the longarina canal and zone 1 which occurs through an underground concrete pipe as explained in subsection 2 1 is described using a ls culvert scheme the selection of the appropriate connection type between storage areas to be used in the 1d model deserves careful attention as it can affect the water level distribution in the floodplain pheulpin et al 2019 like the 1r modeling scheme ifa elements are introduced for the floodplain area enclosed in fascia b of the piano di stralcio per l assetto idrogeologico pai adb po 1999 the upstream boundary condition for the ticino river is a discharge flow hydrograph while the downstream boundary condition is the stage hydrograph at the confluence during the simulation of flood events when the battella sluice gate is closed the upstream boundary condition for the gravellone and longarina canals is a negligible constant flow hydrograph since zero flow is not allowed as an upstream boundary condition for a reach element the values of the manning s roughness coefficients for the riverbed and the floodplains are those determined during the calibration of the 1r model 2 2 3 2d model lastly a hybrid 1d 2d model 2d model is introduced to more accurately represent the flood dynamics inside borgo basso and to test the reliability of the 3r model to reproduce flood events in the examined floodplain area the 1d scheme is maintained along the reach of the ticino river while a 2d approach is used to represent the floodplain area fig 3b the geometry of the floodplain area is composed of a structured mesh of 20 20 m cells with a 10 10 m refinement around the breaklines geometrical elements used to align the cells along higher elevation structures such as levees embankments etc an additional 5 5 m refinement was necessary near the confluence of the gravellone canal and the ticino river and near the via trinchera culvert the manning s roughness coefficients for the 2d area are based on the land use of soil dusaf 6 0 from regione lombardia 2019 and range from 0 06 s m1 3 for the cultivated areas to 0 15 s m1 3 for the high density urban areas following the values suggested by the hec ras manual hec 2001 the weighted on area average of these values is used to calculate the manning s coefficient of the floodplain 0 1 s m1 3 for the 2d model the connection between the 1d reach and the 2d area is made using a ls that represents the ticino right bank and the gravellone canal confluence 2 3 morris global sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was performed using the morris method morris 1991 wainwright et al 2014 to assess the sensitivity of the 3r model to the uncertainty in model input factors also referred to as model input parameters global sensitivity analysis is widely adopted as a diagnostic method of hydrologic and hydraulic models herman et al 2013 investigated the potential of the morris method to correctly identify sensitive and insensitive parameters of highly parameterized spatially distributed watershed models with significant reduction of the computational expense with respect to sobol s method hall et al 2009 reviewed a variety of methods for sensitivity analysis that are computationally efficient and allow the effect of input factors acting individually or in combination to be diagnosed these methods including the morris method sobol s method and the fast method were tested on the very simple benchmark example of the sudden release of water in a flume including an adverse slope they concluded that if the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to fix non influential factors then the measure of morris 1991 is more appropriate especially when the number of uncertain parameters is high and or the model computational time is expensive hall et al 2009 xu and mynett 2006 investigated the effect of parameter uncertainty in a flood damage model and defined the rank of these parameters based on the morris sensitivity analysis they concluded that the morris method is an efficient approach to help reduce the uncertainty in model outputs the guiding philosophy of the morris method is to determine which factors may be considered to have effects that are a negligible b linear and additive or c nonlinear or interacting with other inputs campolongo et al 2007 a factor is any source of uncertainty in the modeling process including physical parameters boundary conditions model structure etc pappenberger et al 2008 according to the morris method the range of each model input x i i 1 k is scaled to a unitary interval 0 1 divided in p equally spaced levels and may take on values from 0 1 p 1 2 p 1 1 in the k dimensional p level grid which is named the region of experimentation ω for a given set of values x x 1 x 2 x k assumed by the model inputs the elementary effect of the i th input factor is defined as 6 ee i j d i x y x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ in eq 6 y is the chosen model output δ is a pre determined multiple of 1 p 1 and x x 1 x 2 x k is any selected value in ω so that the transformed point x e i δ is still in ω e i is a vector of zeroes except for the i th element which is equal to 1 a convenient choice for the parameters p and δ is p even and δ p 2 p 1 to guarantee a symmetric treatment of inputs as suggested by morris morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 starting from the initial set of factors x x 1 x 2 x k randomly chosen between the p possible values the value of a single factor xi is adjusted by δ and the ee i j is computed using eq 6 subsequently all the remaining factors are adjusted one at a time in a random order thus drawing a trajectory in the region of experimentation at the end of the k 1 th simulation the ee i is computed for each of the factors and a new initial set x x 1 x 2 x k is selected at the beginning of a new trajectory once all r trajectories have been investigated the mean elementary effect μ i the absolute value of the mean elementary effect μ i and the standard deviation of the mean elementary effect σ i are calculated for each input x i as morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 kaixuan et al 2019 7 μ i j 1 r ee i j r 8 μ i j 1 r ee i j r 9 σ i j 1 r ee i j μ i 2 r 1 in eqs 7 9 μ i and σ i are the sensitivity measures as proposed by morris 1991 and represent the mean and the standard deviation of the ee i while μ i the absolute value of the mean elementary effect is a measure proposed by campolongo et al 2007 in place of μ i this is because the latter may be affected by type ii errors i e failure to identify a factor of considerable influence on the model the larger the value of μ i for the considered input factor the more influential the factor is on the assessed model output if σ i is large compared to μ i the relationship between a change in the parameter value and the resulting model output is either nonlinear and or the parameter interacts with other model parameters and so the elementary effect is affected by the values of the other input parameters morris 1991 feng et al 2019 reinecke et al 2019 the sensitivity of the 3r model to the uncertainty in model input factors is carried out by imposing synthetic hydrographs for upstream and downstream boundary conditions fig 4 the upstream boundary condition is a parameterized hydrograph for the ticino river proposed by d andrea et al 2009 the hydrographs have an initial constant value of 600 m3 s followed by a 24 h long ramp that linearly links the initial flow rate to the maximum value q and is maintained constant until the end of the simulation the downstream boundary condition consists of a triangular parameterized stage hydrograph based on the synthetic hydrographs calculated for the po river majone et al 2006 applying the method described by tomirotti and mignosa 2017 the triangular stage hydrograph starts from 56 m a s l and has a fixed duration d of 168 h it is defined by a maximum of the po river water surface elevation z and a coefficient c t p d which defines the temporal occurrence tp of the hydrograph peak with respect to the beginning of the event and its duration d the relative position of the peak of the ticino river hydrograph with respect to the peak of the po river hydrograph is described with the relative peak timing rpt fig 4 shows that the shape of the adopted synthetic hydrographs is consistent with those of the observed flood event of november 2019 the morris analysis was carried out using the salib package herman usher 2017 in python to determine the relative sensitivity of i the calculated water surface elevation in four representative locations of the study area and ii a damage index di based on both water depth and flood extent in borgo basso to each of six uncertain model factors a set of 20 factor trajectories for each of these two model outputs was chosen by maximizing the distance between the trajectories using the methods of campolongo et al 2007 and ruano et al 2012 the model output flow velocity is not included in the analysis since backwater induced flooding is characterized by a very low velocity field in borgo basso the sensitivity of the model outputs water surface elevation and di to each of the six model factors is assessed by sampling each factor at six values over their respective ranges similar to pappenberger et al 2008 according to the choices in alipour et al 2022 and pheulpin et al 2022 and considering the peculiar flood dynamics induced by the backwater effect the six factors include the maximum flow rate of the ticino river at the upstream boundary q the maximum water surface elevation of the po river at the confluence z the manning s roughness coefficients of the main channel nch and the floodplains nfp the relative peak timing rpt of the ticino and po river hydrograph peaks and the coefficient c which defines the peak of the hydrograph s temporal occurrence with respect to the beginning of the event and its duration d the current study does not consider the dependence among the uncertain model factors on the output the effect on the predicted flooding due to the dependent input model factors will be considered in future research table 1 shows the sampling range for the examined model factors when the considered model output is the water surface elevation q is assumed to range from 1000 m3 s to 2000 m3 s which corresponds to return periods of 1 5 20 years for the ticino peak flow rate z is assumed to range from 58 6 m a s l first alarm threshold to 60 6 m a s l critical alarm threshold adb po 1999 the rpt parameter ranges from 10 h ticino peak occurring before po peak to 15 h ticino peak occurring after po peak the uncertainty related to the coefficient c is examined by varying the value between 0 23 and 0 33 which corresponds to the values proposed for the casale monferrato and piacenza synthetic hydrographs majone et al 2006 fig 1b casale monferrato and piacenza are the closest upstream and downstream gauging stations with respect to the ponte della becca station the uncertain ranges of the manning s roughness coefficients of the main channel nch and the floodplains nfp span from 0 025 to 0 045 s m1 3 and 0 06 0 21 s m1 3 respectively according to hec ras manual hec 2001 meanwhile the twenty morris trajectories are generated using narrower ranges for some factors z q n ch to assess which factors most influence the di which indicates when houses are flooded table 1 the proposed di is similar to the depth damage curves described by nadal et al 2010 and relies on the observation that while flooding often occurs in borgo basso not every event inundates the houses in this area analyzing the dtm of the urban area of borgo basso fig 3 shows that the houses along via milazzo are built at a higher level than the countryside behind them and remain dry up to an elevation of 60 6 m a s l at this elevation homes in the borgo basso area begin to flood even though much of the study area is already flooded the di value is defined to equal 0 when the inhabited area is not flooded i e when the water level in the storage areas is below 60 6 m a s l the di equals 1 when the water level reaches or exceeds 61 4 m a s l resulting in flooding of all the houses for water levels ranging from 60 6 to 61 4 m a s l the di is calculated as 10 di a wet a u where a wet is the extent of the flooded portion of the urban area for the given water surface elevation h and a u is a constant 48309 m2 that represents total flooding of the urban area when the water level reaches 61 4 m a s l fig 5 a 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the 1r and 3r models since the proposed 1d models i e 1r model and 3r model only differ in their schematization of the floodplain area behind borgo basso which is a small portion of the entire modeled reach of the ticino river it is suitable to calibrate the 1d models against historical flood events using only the 1r geometry the 3r geometry is subsequently used for model validation stage data from the catastrophic flood event of october 2000 is compared to stage values calculated by the 1r model during model calibration subsequently stage data from the less severe flood events of november 2019 and november 2014 are compared to stage values calculated by the 3r model to validate the models the calibration process was used to determine the channel and floodplain manning s roughness coefficients 0 035 s m1 3 for the channel and 0 1 s m1 3 for the floodplain that minimize the difference between the simulated hydrograph and the measured data at the ponte coperto cross section fig 6 the october 2000 flood is one of the most severe known flood events for the city of pavia this event shows the contemporaneity of exceptional water levels in the po river which reached a peak stage of 62 94 m a s l at the ponte della becca station 60 6 m a s l is the critical emergency threshold and in the ticino river which reached a peak value of 63 69 m a s l at the ponte coperto piano comunale di protezione civile del comune di vigevano 2011 the ticino peak flow rate of 2646 m3 s is a value that exceeds the 200 year return period flow based on adb po 1999 fig 6 the 1r model reproduces the observed stage hydrograph at the ponte coperto with suitable accuracy and the modeled hydrograph is close to the one simulated by vergnani et al 2010 with a 1d unsteady hydraulic model vzm model of the sublacual ticino river and po river from isola s antonio to piacenza fig 6 additionally at the ponte coperto the peak stage value of 63 51 m a s l calculated by the 1r model is similar to that of the observed peak 63 69 m a s l and the peak calculated by the vzm model 63 50 m a s l further confirming the reliability of the 1r model results for extreme flood events fig 6 according to alipour et al 2022 the roughness coefficient dem and mesh resolution are more influential on the prediction of both maximum water level dynamics therefore the satisfactory results confirm the suitability of the adopted mesh and spatial resolution as well as the reliability of calibrated roughness coefficients it is worth noting that while some modeling approaches considered a constant downstream water level for the analysis of backwater induced flooding liro et al 2020 the present work applies a time varying stage hydrograph at the downstream boundary which helps improve the accuracy of model prediction the 3r 1d model is validated against the flood events of november 2019 and november 2014 the comparison of the 3r simulated hydrograph and the observed data show that the 3r model effectively reproduces the observed water surface elevation values near the ponte coperto fig 7 a and e using the manning roughness coefficients determined through calibration of the 1r model the small deviation with respect to measured peak water surface elevation is of the same order of magnitude as the resolution accuracy of the digital terrain model adopted for the schematization of the area alipour et al 2022 showed that the dem resolution is an important factor when simulating water level dynamics in floodplains the maximum dem resolution adopted in their hec ras model of san jacinto river basin southeast texas was twice i e 10 m the spatial resolution of 5 m resolution used in this study xing et al 2021 investigated the influence of model spatial resolution on the flooding of an urbanized area they showed that spatial resolution may have more influence on flood flow characteristics since water blocking obstacles i e buildings may be better or worse represented therefore they adopted a minimum resolution of 5 m the small deviation of simulated with respect to measured peak water surface elevation can be partially attributed to the fact that the available observation data for these events are acquired at the ponte della libertà hydrometer which is located about 400 m upstream of the ponte coperto according to the longitudinal profiles for a 200 year return period event for the ticino river available in piano di governo del territorio del comune di pavia 2012 the difference between the water levels at the two bridges may vary from approximately 5 to 15 cm depending on the intensity of the po river s influence the 1r and 3r models provide nearly identical results at the control points ponte coperto urban area 3 for the two flood events table 2 but the simplified 1r geometry is omitted for the remainder of the study since it inadequately describes the flood dynamics in the borgo basso area for flood events that do not cause the critical threshold related to the direct flooding of via milazzo to be exceeded urban areas 1 and 2 are inaccurately predicted to be dry table 2 3 2 3r vs 2d model to test the reliability of the 3r model in reproducing the flood dynamics inside the borgo basso urban area the results of the 1d and 2d models were compared for the two recent floods of november 2014 and november 2019 the outputs from both models are examined both at the ponte coperto and at three additional locations within the floodplain area to obtain a comprehensive and detailed interpretation of the flood dynamics throughout the inhabited areas the three sub areas in which the trend of the water surface elevation is examined include fig 2b urban area 1 which extends from the ponte coperto to the via trinchera road embankment and is totally included in zone 1 urban area 2 which extends from via trinchera to the continuation of the embankment that separates zone 2 from zone 3 and urban area 3 which is the most downstream area of the borgo basso settlement although the two flood events used for comparison of the 3r and 2d models are characterized by similar maximum water levels at the ponte della libertà gauging station table 2 they show different dynamics through time fig 7 the 2014 event has two neighbouring flow peaks of about 2000 m3 s three days apart assessed from measurements at the miorina hydrometer and a maximum stage level of 60 25 m a s l recorded at ponte della becca po river during the second peak table 2 november 2014 was a critical month for the ticino river basin with a discharge flow calculated from stage measurements at the miorina station that exceeded 1000 m3 s for 20 days during november 2019 the maximum discharge flow at the lake maggiore outlet was around 1000 m3 s but the po river water level reached 60 87 m a s l table 2 exceeding the maximum alert threshold set at 60 6 m a s l adb po 1999 the 2019 flood was therefore a shorter event mainly caused by the backwater action of po river while the 2014 flood had a longer duration due to a prolonged rainy period in the ticino river basin while the causes of the november 2014 and 2019 floods were different both the 3r and 2d models simulate these floods with similar accuracy fig 7a 7e the simulated hydrographs for the two models are almost coincident for the 2019 event while they differ slightly for the 2014 flood fig 7a e the 3r model returns a maximum water level at the ponte coperto bridge that is 4 cm higher than the level predicted by the 2d model for the 2014 flood event and 2 cm higher for the 2019 flood event table 2 this slight difference can be attributed to the difference in how the study area is hydraulically connected to the main watercourse in the two models in the 2d model the connection is continuous and governed by a ls that extends from ponte coperto to the confluence with the gravellone canal the hydraulic connection in the 3r model occurs using a junction element that connects the ticino river with the gravellone canal the wider connection in the 2d model allows for greater transport of water towards the internal areas of the floodplain this is consistent with the 4 cm lower maximum water level in the urban areas within the floodplain predicted by the 3r model as compared to the level predicted by the 2d model table 2 the flood dynamics within the urban areas of borgo basso can be further compared both temporally and spatially the simulated hydrographs in urban area 1 exhibit a different shape compared to those obtained in urban areas 2 and 3 fig 7 for both the 3r and 2d models the rate of change of the water surface elevation for urban area 1 suddenly increases when the overtopping of the via trinchera road embankment occurs starting from 60 4 m a s l which directly connects urban area 2 to urban area 1 fig 7b and f after this elevation the three urban areas are hydraulically connected and therefore experience the same water elevation the simulated hydrographs are nearly identical for the two models in urban areas 2 and 3 during the 2019 flood event and only differ slightly 4 cm at the flood peak during the 2014 flood event fig 7 table 2 meanwhile the simulated hydrographs for the two models differ to a greater extent in urban area 1 particularly when modeling the recession of the flood fig 7b f even if further investigation is required to assess the above difference between the 3r and 2d models in urban area 1 these models only differ in their prediction of the peak water level by 4 cm table 2 thus ensuring accurate evaluation of the peak water levels in the urban areas which is the key aspect for a reliable estimate of flood damage within borgo basso additionally the spatial extent and depth of the flooding in the floodplain are other important factors in predicting the extent of damage during flood events and can be estimated using the 3r and 2d models the two model schemes result in similar predictions of the flood depth and its spatial extent fig 8 a 8b especially in zone 1 and the upstream portion of zone 2 where most buildings are located fig 2b fig 8a b the modeling schemes show the greatest difference along the border of zones 2 and 3 and in zone 3 near the river where urban area 3 is located with the 2d model predicting flooding in this area and the 3r model not fig 8a b such a difference in the model response may be related to the type of hydraulic connection between neighbouring storage areas that may induce local differences of the water level distribution with respect to the 2d model pheulpin et al 2019 however this investigation is beyond the target of this work because the difference can be neglected since it pertains to a relatively small portion of the floodplain with flooding throughout most of the floodplain similarly predicted regardless of whether the 3r or 2d model is implemented this similarity between the predicted flood extents depths for the two schemes indicates the model assumption that ponding occurs in the areas described with storage area elements in the 3r model is valid this assumption of ponding in these areas is further validated by the velocity map from the 2014 flood peak obtained with the 2d model which shows that the velocity is close to zero fig 8c both the 3r and 2d modeling schemes consistently reproduce the backwater inundation of borgo basso during the non extreme flood events of november 2014 and 2019 similarly simulating both the hydrographs throughout the duration of the events fig 7 and the flood extent and depth fig 8a b however the 1d 3r model proves particularly advantageous as it both produces reliable results and saves computational time as compared to the 2d hybrid model for example the simulation of the november 2014 flood with a 60 s computational time step lasts approximately 10 s for the 3r model while it takes about 180 s for the 2d model to run when an intel r core tm i7 10710u cpu 1 61 ghz processor with 16 gb ram is used this faster computational time becomes important when running numerous simulations such as may be necessary when trying to predict how different flow conditions along the ticino and po rivers may interact to affect flooding within borgo basso 3 3 sensitivity of the 3r model the morris method of global sensitivity analysis was used to explore how different conditions along the po and ticino rivers affect the simulated hydrographs and flooding within borgo basso the morris method was first applied to assess the sensitivity of the calculated water level elevations to the 6 model factors table 1 fig 9 the relative influence of each model factor on the calculated water level was evaluated at each of the four control point locations i e at the ponte coperto bridge and urban areas 1 2 and 3 within the borgo basso flood zone fig 2 the factor that is most influential on the water levels predicted by the 3r model at ponte coperto and in the urban areas within borgo basso is the maximum water level of the po river z fig 9 this behavior is consistent with the dynamics of past flood events from which it is well known that the water level of the po is the real threat to borgo basso rather than the ticino river flow rate meanwhile the different shape of the stage hydrograph expressed by the parameter c has a negligible influence on the maximum water level values at the ponte coperto and within borgo basso pheulpin et al 2022 considered the dependence between model input parameters on the modeling of dike breach induced inundation in a very simple case even if the flooding dynamics may be somewhat different with respect to the present case as the backwater effect is neglected they found that if the three hydrograph parameters are assumed to be dependent they all have a greater effect on the flooding it is possible that c has a greater impact on flood duration and or on the time to reach the maximum water surface elevation within the borgo basso area but this aspect as well as the dependency between hydrograph parameters can be further investigated in the near future while the ranking of the factors is the same for each of the four control points the influence of the factors differs between the main river and the three control points in the borgo basso floodplain at the ponte coperto nch and q exert slightly more influence on the modeled water level than they do on the water levels calculated in the urban areas this difference is explained by the fact that the ponte coperto control point is located on the main channel to which nch applies and closer to the upstream boundary condition which is parameterized using q the influence of all the factors in the three urban areas is similar this first application of the morris method comprised 140 simulations but only 43 of the simulations calculated a water level higher than 60 6 m a s l at the control points in the three urban areas making these simulations unreliable for assessing the sensitivity of the di to the 6 factors to assess whether the influence of the model factors on the di remains unchanged when the analysis is restricted to the simulations leading to flooding of houses in borgo basso a further application of the morris method was performed by restricting the range of some parameters table 1 this second application of the morris method shows that under scenarios which lead to flooding of borgo basso houses the di is most influenced by the value of nfp fig 5b this is because nfp directly affects the movement of floodwaters in this floodplain area the examined range of nfp is wide and only conditions for which active floodplains convey large quantities of water are considered in this analysis this is a crucial aspect to consider since the simplifications deriving from the 1d approach require a large sampling range of the roughness coefficient this second application of the morris method to the di also shows that the maximum peak stage of the po river z maintains a fundamental role in predicting the flooding of borgo basso despite its reduced range in uncertainty and confirms this input as the most dangerous factor influencing the flooding of the houses in borgo basso however the mean elementary effects are more similar across all factors excluding c than they were for the initial morris analysis where the mean elementary effect of the maximum stage level of the po river z was significantly greater than any of the other factors therefore the peak flow rate in the ticino q and the relative time between the po and ticino peaks rpt also play a role in the flooding of borgo basso examining the corresponding σ values from the morris analysis also indicates there may be a slight interaction between some of the factors since some σ values are almost as large as their corresponding µ values e g q µ 0 305 σ 0 278 and rpt µ 0 298 σ 0 289 in the di morris analysis fig 5b the most influential factors resulting from the sensitivity analysis are in accordance with theoretical expectations based on the physics of the considered phenomenon i e backwater flooding this important outcome confirms that the morris method is appropriate in the case where the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to fix non influential factors hall et al 2009 despite the relative complexity of the computational domain which extends further downstream of the flooded area and the burden of unsteady flow simulations a relatively small amount of computational time and resources are required to evaluate the sensitivity to model factors with respect to variance based methods applied to other cases that model urban flooding chen et al 2018 when dealing with complex computer models in the field of hydraulic engineering sensitivity analysis continues to be an essential step in good modeling practice because it provides a systematic approach to explore how the model outputs are affected by varying input values 3 4 implications for flooding of borgo basso the morris sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the maximum stage level in the po river z is most influential on the results of the model while the shape of its stage hydrograph expressed by the coefficient c has a negligible influence the remaining examined factors maximum flow rate in ticino q manning s roughness of the riverbed nch manning s roughness of the floodplains nfp rpt parameter that expresses the contemporaneity of the floods of the ticino and po rivers have a similar influence on the results although q and nch are slightly more influential than the n fp and rpt parameters since the most serious flood threat to borgo basso is the severity of the po river flood expressed by the maximum water level at the confluence z measures that attenuate po river floods would be most helpful in reducing floods in borgo basso such interventions must be enacted at the basin scale and various studies on the subject have already been conducted especially related to catastrophic events e g castellarin et al 2011a and b in this study the focus is on less severe flood events di 1 that are generally neglected even though they occur more frequently thus causing recurrent inconvenience for the inhabitants of borgo basso the sensitivity analysis that focuses on scenarios which lead to flooding of houses within borgo basso fig 5b demonstrates that the maximum ticino river flow rate q and the relative timing of the hydrograph peak rpt parameters have a similar influence on the potential damage to the inhabited area through analyses not shown in this work it was found that a delayed ticino flood wave of even a few hours with respect to that of the po river can make a difference for the houses in borgo basso although the impact is only a few centimeters at the river scale for example a 5 hour delay rpt can produce a reduction of 8 cm for the water level in the flooded area when the ticino maximum flow rate q is 2000 m3 s and the po river maximum stage level z is 59 8 m a s l meanwhile the shape of the stage hydrograph of the po river expressed by parameter c has a negligible influence on the maximum stage values of the flooding at ponte coperto and within borgo basso however it is reasonable to expect that parameter c may be influential on the flood duration and on the time to reach the maximum water surface elevation within the borgo basso area therefore future analyses should address the influence of rtp and c on the temporal dynamics of flooding within the inhabited borgo basso floodplain because the rate at which the water surface elevation rises within the floodplain is likely crucial in assessing the vulnerability of the inhabited area and is thus crucial for a comprehensive risk analysis of the floodplain 3 5 innovation and potential applicability the results of numerical modeling are strongly affected by the degree of complexity of the model as well as by the uncertainties inherent in the definition of model input parameters sometimes many describing the investigated phenomenon in this context one of the main innovations brought by this research is the analysis of the influence of modeling scheme on the model results in terms of maximum water level and flooding extent to assess the trade off between model accuracy and complexity also in terms of computational expense three different flood events occurring between 2000 and 2019 are simulated for calibration validation and comparison of different hydraulic models characterized by an increasing degree of structural and numerical complexity even if some studies showed that 2d hydrodynamic models outperform 1d models in some applications alipour et al 2022 the present work demonstrates that by proper representation of the relevant flow controlling factors the 1d modeling approach can still provide high quality results while significantly reducing the computational effort with respect to the 2d approach concerning the uncertainty of some model parameters sensitivity analysis represents a necessary step toward the responsible use of hydraulic models hall et al 2009 if reliable easy to use hydraulic models are required by decision makers for prediction and mitigation of flood risk comprehensive analysis of the model sensitivity to variations in the model input parameters is required to assess the most influential parameters and possibly to provide model simplification without loss of accuracy in general the higher the number of uncertain parameters in the sensitivity analysis the simpler the test case on which the numerical model is run hall et al 2009 pheulpin et al 2022 this work developed a relatively simple with respect to 2d models and reliable 1d model and combined it with the morris method of sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of many six uncertain input parameters on a real case with complex topography in particular the influence of both upstream and downstream hydrographs as well as their relative peak timing is considered which represents an innovation with respect to the referenced works dealing with sensitivity analysis alipour et al 2022 pheulpin et al 2019 another novel aspect of this work is the analysis of a peculiar flood dynamic and pattern which is induced by the backwater effect even if such a category of inundations is rarely considered in the literature except in coastal environments it is a serious threat to both local governance and citizens because these events can cause recurrent inconvenience in an urban floodplain and amplify the devastation and losses associated with a watercourse s flood making lamination ineffective along the watercourse further studies can be carried out to include how dependence between model factors may influence model outputs in the work by pheulpin et al 2022 a fictive idealized test case was analyzed where flow hydrograph parameters were considered dependent the results showed that all the factors have a major effect on the predicted flooding when they are considered dependent unlike in the case where they are assumed to be independent the application of this methodology to a large 2d hydraulic model was not performed in that study probably because the use of sobol s method for sensitivity analysis becomes computationally demanding when real cases must be simulated with increasing model complexity for this reason the 1d modeling approach combined with the morris sensitivity method proposed in the current study may be applied to the study of such dependent model parameters and may help overcome this issue in future studies the modeling approach proposed in the current study based on a fast running simple and accurate 1d numerical model may be suitable for risk analysis and management it can be used to develop a multi disciplinary decision support system dss for flood hazard risk prediction and to explore several scenarios including potential risk reduction options manenti et al 2019 furthermore owing to its relatively simple structure and relatively low numerical complexity the model is suitable for inclusion in an early warning system ews 4 conclusions in recent years worsening climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressure have led to more rapid and destructive floods for this reason most of the hydraulic models available today are focused on the study of these extreme events against which large scale mitigation measures are required however there are some phenomena such as backwater induced flooding in urban areas which are rarely considered although they can cause recurrent inconvenience in an urban floodplain and amplify the devastation and losses associated with a watercourse s flood in this study we analyzed the borgo basso area in the city of pavia using hec ras software to reproduce the complex flood dynamics of both catastrophic and moderate events within an urbanized area of the floodplain the influence of modeling schemes 1d 2d on flood dynamics as well as the model sensitivity were thoroughly investigated to assess the most influential factors leading to modeling simplifications that allowed us to setup a fast running and reliable numerical model for backwater flood analysis in the urban area the model reliably reproduces recent flood events for which observed data are available by adopting parameters consistent with those proposed in the scientific literature and technical manuals comparison of a 1d model 3r model with a 1d 2d hybrid model 2d model demonstrates that both models consistently simulate the flood dynamics within the borgo basso area especially during those floods in which the backwater effect dominates while the 1d model requires less than a tenth of the computational time required by the 2d model this finding demonstrates that despite technological advances which allow an increasingly extensive use of complex and accurate 2d models carefully designed 1d models can still provide high quality results in a short time and with reduced computational effort due to the short computational time of the 3r model simulations a global sensitivity analysis was carried out using the morris method that allowed for the identification of which model factors are more influential and which factors are negligible for the computed water surface elevation in borgo basso at four representative control points the results of the morris analysis indicate that the severity of the po river flood expressed by the maximum stage level z is most influential on the results of the model highlighting that measures that attenuate po river floods would be most helpful in reducing flooding within borgo basso in addition the morris analysis carried out with narrower ranges of some factors z maximum flow rate in the ticino q manning s roughness of the riverbed n ch allowed for the assessment of which factors are most influential on the damage index di which is formulated based on both water depth and flood extent within borgo basso with a focus on the floodable inhabited area the uncertainty of the roughness of the floodplains has a key role on the results of the simulated events in the active floodplain and is more influential than in the previous morris analysis this is a crucial aspect to consider since the simplifications deriving from the 1d approach require a large sampling range of the roughness coefficient the methodological approach of combining a fast running accurate model with the morris method of sensitivity analysis computationally faster than variance based methods accurately reproduces the dynamic pattern of an extensive combination of different flooding conditions quickly and easily and allows us to assess the most influential parameters on flood damage therefore it can be adopted to support decision makers in the prediction of flood risk for the development of early warning systems and for the definition of mitigation strategies against flood risk in urban areas future research will investigate the influence of model factors on the temporal dynamics of flooding to broaden the significance of these findings to better address safety and security

2746,a riparian zone is an important element in a river aquifer system controlling water exchange and other chemical and biological processes between a river and an aquifer complex groundwater flow patterns may occur due to aquifer heterogeneity within a riparian zone the purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of layered heterogeneity on water exchange in the riparian zone using a mathematical model for groundwater flow in a two layer aquifer that is recharged by precipitation and floods a semi analytical solution is derived for the hydraulic head lateral discharge and fluxes between the layers results demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity difference between the two layers enhances lateral flow in the higher permeable layer and more importantly generates vertical flow between the two layers the vertical flow induced by the recharge event is downward while it could be upward or downward induced by the flood event which is determined by the contrast in permeabilities of the two layers using an equivalent hydraulic conductivity approach underestimates discharge of the two layer aquifer due to recharge or flood the analytical solution closely matched the observed hydraulic heads in riparian zone well of white clay creek and provided reasonable estimates of aquifer parameters the present solution provides a valuable basis for further study of chemical and biological processes in riparian zone keywords heterogeneity unconfined aquifer riparian zones analytical solution data availability data used in preparing fig 10 of this manuscript are from sawyer et al 2014 no new data are used 1 introduction the riparian zone constitutes an important landscape element in a river aquifer system due to its location in a catchment robert 1997 webster et al 1976 it possesses a unique spatial structure and ecological function and plays a significant role in regulating water quantity and quality exchanges in a river aquifer system for example a riparian forest may reduce recharge from precipitation or agricultural chemicals applied riparian crops may contaminate groundwater and river water gonzales inca et al 2015 krutz et al 2005 oliveira et al 2010 ou et al 2016 the hyporheic zone within the riparian zone is defined by shallow subsurface pathways through river beds and river banks beginning and ending at the river boano et al 2014 and this area is considered a hot spot for hydrologic geologic geomorphic geochemical and biological processes fox et al 2016 groundwater flow is the controlling factor for many processes in the riparian and hyporheic zones and it is greatly influenced by natural events and human activities flooding is one of the most important natural events affecting groundwater flow in the riparian and hyporheic zone as rapid water level fluctuations give rise to lateral propagation of river water into the riparian zone that changes the local flow field curry et al 1994 liu et al 2020 in addition large scale human activities e g damming river channelization artificial flow regulation can reduce the flood pulse of natural rivers and make the river level fluctuate more intermittently arias et al 2013 liu et al 2020 nilsson and berggren 2000 which may substantially impact hydrologic exchange in the riparian zone fritz and arntzen 2007 and groundwater flow ferencz et al 2019 moreover human society especially coastal mega cities will face increasing flood risk under the current protection standard because of future climate change hu et al 2019 huang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 variable recharge from precipitation further impacts riparian zone hydrology schilling et al 2004 and it should be considered along with flooding to obtain a better understanding of the complex patterns of groundwater flow in the riparian zone spatiotemporal responses to hydrological events with riparian or hyporheic zones and impacts on surface groundwater exchanges have been investigated in extant literature chen and chen 2003 hantush 2005 mccallum and shanafield 2016 zlotnik and huang 1999 singh 2004 considered stream boundary resistance and presented a 1 d analytical solution for semi infinite aquifer responses to a sinusoidal river stage fluctuation liang et al 2017b developed a semi analytical solution for base flow recession caused by recharge by considering lateral unsaturated discharge and aquifer compressibility their results showed that the unsaturated zone imparts a damping effect on the saturated flow these studies however only considered groundwater flow in a cross section of a river aquifer system to explore the plane view of the surface groundwater exchange liang et al 2018 presented an analytical solution for the spatiotemporal response of horizontal 2 d groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer and surface water and groundwater exchanges due to a flood event the results demonstrated that the 1 d cross section aquifer river model overestimates both the hydraulic head and discharge in the upstream aquifer and underestimates the hydraulic head in the downstream aquifer because it neglects groundwater flow parallel to the river channel one of the limitations in the above mentioned studies is the assumption of the homogeneous condition in fact heterogeneity is intrinsic in natural aquifers and has been studied extensively in hydrogeology e g chang and yeh 2016 feng et al 2020 hsieh and yeh 2014 li et al 2020 2021 liang et al 2019 sedghi and zhan 2021b the riverbank often has two layers structure which is composed of non cohesive and cohesive materials thorne and tovey 1981 heterogeneity in riverbank sediments not only controls water exchange by deflecting flow downward into the sediment or upward into the channel ward et al 2011 but it also alters groundwater paths fluxes and residence times in the riparian zone earon et al 2020 gomez velez et al 2014 pryshlak et al 2015 sawyer and cardenas 2009 sawyer and cardenas 2009 conducted numerical simulations of hyporheic flow and solute transport through immobile bed forms composed of heterogeneous sediments their findings showed that the sediment heterogeneity created longer hyporheic mixing paths than the case with homogeneous sediments liang and zhang 2013 presented an analytical solution for the water table and lateral discharge in a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer with a time dependent source and fluctuating river stage the heterogeneity that they considered consists of a number of sections of different hydraulic conductivity values more recently su et al 2020 evaluated the scale issues inherent in concentration mixing heterogeneity and modelling approaches in hyporheic flow based on a numerical model and monte carlo simulations their results revealed that flux variance in the streambed is an appropriate metric for assessing the magnitude of hyporheic mixing at all scales previous work evaluating the heterogeneity of aquifers in analytical models is summarized in table 1 to the best of our knowledge a 2 d analytical model describing groundwater flow in the riparian zone or hyporheic zone with a two layer structure has not been reported therefore this study aims to fill this knowledge gap by presenting a semi analytical solution for this 2 d model in the semi analytical model groundwater flow in the two layers is coupled with the continuity of the hydraulic head and water fluxes across the interface we anticipate that the proposed semi analytical model could be used to investigate changes of the hydraulic head and lateral discharge caused by a recharge or flood event in a layered aquifer system the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model and its solution are presented in section 2 and section 3 respectively the comparison of the solution with a high resolution numerical model built with comsol is given in section 4 the results and discussion are presented in section 5 and application of the solution to field data is described in section 6 section 7 presents the summary and conclusions from this work 2 conceptual and mathematical models a schematic diagram of groundwater flow along a transect of the riparian zone in a two layer unconfined aquifer is displayed in fig 1 the layered aquifer is laterally bounded by a watershed divide and a river that fully penetrates the aquifer fig 1a which is conceptualized in two dimensions fig 1b in fig 1b the x axis is along the groundwater flow direction toward the divide and the z axis is vertically upward the top of the aquifer is the water table which receives time dependent recharge from rainfall events the bottom of the aquifer is horizontal and impermeable the upper and lower layers have a uniform initial thickness of b 1 l and b 2 l respectively the upper

storage l 1 h is the hydraulic head l k x and k z are hydraulic conductivity in x direction horizontal and z direction vertical respectively ξ is the instantaneous location of the moving water table h 0 is the initial head which is the same as water table l and h b t is the fluctuating river stage l eqs 1a and 1b are coupled by the interface conditions representing the continuity of the hydraulic

recharge term is a free surface moving water table that can be described by the following equation bear 1979 4a k z 1 w t h 1 z s y h 1 t w t k x 1 h 1 x 2 k z 1 h 1 z 2 z ξ where s y is the specific yield and w t is the time dependent recharge rate lt 1 the coupled equations 1 3 are difficult to solve analytically because of the nonlinear nature of upper boundary condition 4a and the unknown location of the moving water table ξ to resolve this issue eq 4a is linearized by using the perturbation technique dagan 1964 which is widely adopted to simulate water flow in unconfined aquifers e g malama et al 2011 neuman 1972 zhan and zlotnik 2002 first the water table is imposed on a fixed position z b 1 by assuming that the magnitude of water table fluctuation is much less than the aquifer thickness second the two quadratic terms are ignored because they are much smaller than the other terms of eq 4a finally the recharge term on the left side of eq 4a is also ignored because the aquifer recharge rate w is usually orders of magnitude smaller than the hydraulic conductivity k z 1 based on the above assumptions the water table boundary can be simplified to the linearized form 4b k z 1 h 1 z s y h 1 t w t z b 1 to test the validity of the linearized boundary condition 4b we conduct a numerical experiment to compare the nonlinear 4a and linearized boundary conditions 4b specifically the coupled equations 1 3 with the boundary conditions 4a and 4b are solved numerically respectively then the hydraulic heads predicted by the model with the nonlinear boundary 4a is compared to that of the model with the linearized boundary 4b it should be noted that the nonlinear boundary in the numerical model is fixed at z b 1 rather than the moving water table which requires the magnitude of water table fluctuation to be much less than the aquifer thickness the details are presented in the supporting information s4 the results indicate that the error caused by ignoring the quadratic terms and the recharge term on the left side of eq 4a is very small when the recharge rate is less than one tenth of the vertically hydraulic conductivity which is widespread in the real world it implies that the linearized boundary 4b is an appropriate approximation to the moving water table boundary 3 solutions 3 1 solutions for hydraulic head the governing equation 1 are solved by the laplace and

varying river stage h b t and recharge rate w t both river stage and recharge should be specified if one aims to evaluate the head and discharge in this study the river stage is presented by a piecewise linear function with time and the recharge rate is presented by a piecewise constant function with time therefore h b t and w t can be written in the following forms 13a h b t h bi h bi 1 t i t i 1 t t i 1 h bi 1 t i 1 t t i 13b w t w j t i 1 t t i where h bi is the observed river stage at time t i and w j is a constant for the time interval t i 1 t t i with t 0 0 the piecewise linear approximation is the most practical approach for treating the actual river stage because it permits approximation of any river hydrograph with desired accuracy if small time increments are used liang

technique crump 1976 talbot algorithm talbot 1979 and de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 we choose the de hoog algorithm to invert the laplace solutions into the time domain because a solution involving the piecewise functions eqs 13a and 13b commonly requires complex versions of the numerical inverse laplace method liang et al 2017b 4 comparison with numerical solutions to test the

inc burlington ma u s a a galerkin finite element software package that includes a partial differential equation pde solver for modelling the type of governing equations of this study triangulations are used for the elements of the 2 d cross section domain to ensure sufficient accuracy of the simulation the elements near the water table the interface between two layers and the river are refined with the minimum mesh size of 0 002 and the maximum mesh size of 0 01 which includes 28 860 triangular elements and 14 799 nodes the time step δ t d is 0 0025 for the two scenarios fig 2c and 2d show the responses of the hydraulic heads in the upper layer and the lower layer to the recharge and the flood events respectively fig 2e and 2f also present the lateral discharge induced by the recharge and the flood events respectively these figures indicate that the analytical solutions solid curves for both hydraulic head and discharge well agree with those of numerical solutions circle symbols over the entire simulation period through the above comparison the analytical solutions of this study appear to be acceptable to predict the hydraulic heads and the discharges for the model 5 results and discussion 5 1 effects of layered heterogeneity on hydraulic heads in this study the layered heterogeneity is mainly represented by a dimensionless parameter r k k x 2 k x 1 that quantifies the contrast in hydraulic properties of the two layers we first investigate how the layered heterogeneity impacts the responses of hydraulic heads to the time varying recharge and the fluctuating river stage to clearly demonstrate the impacts of r k we assume that the aquifer is isotropic and the specific storage of two layers are equal the other parameters of the aquifer are as follows k 1 d 1 k 2 d 1 r s 1 b 1 d 0 04 b 2 d 0 04 a n d s yd 0 8 fig 3 displays the responses of the hydraulic heads to a recharge event w d 0 25 during 0 5 t d 1 0 and a flood wave for different values of r k 0 01 1 0 and 100 fig 3b and 3c show that r k has a significant impact on the responses of hydraulic heads to the recharge event for the large r k 100 the hydraulic head in the upper layer blue solid curve is markedly larger than that of the lower layer blue triangle symbol for the small r k 0 01 the hydraulic head in the upper layer red solid curve is close to that of the lower layer red triangle symbol furthermore for the homogeneous case r k 1 the hydraulic head in the upper layer cyan solid curve is the same as that of the lower layer cyan triangle symbol these observations indicate that the aquifer has a significantly downward hydraulic gradient induced by the recharge when the upper layer has a smaller permeability in contrast for the case of the larger permeability in the upper layer the aquifer has no obvious vertical hydraulic gradient which is similar to the homogeneous case these observations imply that the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity regulates the groundwater flow path the upper layer with the low permeability hinders groundwater lateral discharging into the river in the upper layer and forces water to flow downward into the highly permeable layer in contrast when the upper layer has a high permeability it provides a fast flow path for the lateral discharge in the upper layer and prevents water from flowing downward into the lower layer fig 3e presents the response of the hydraulic heads to the flood event similar to the case of the recharge event there is little difference in hydraulic heads between the upper and lower layers for the homogenous case r k 1 and the case in which the upper layer has a higher permeability r k 0 01 for the case in which the upper layer has a lower permeability r k 100 however the hydraulic head in the upper layer blue solid curve is significantly lower than that of the lower layer blue triangle symbol in the early time t d 0 3 and the hydraulic head in the upper layer becomes higher in the later time the hydraulic head profile fig 3f further illustrates that for the case of r k 100 the aquifer has a markedly upward hydraulic gradient at t d 0 1 the rise phase of heads and it has a markedly downward hydraulic gradient at t d 0 4 the decline phase of heads for the cases of r k 0 01 and 1 the vertical hydraulic gradients are small which is in accordance with the observations in fig 3d the diverse hydraulic gradients reflect the impacts of heterogeneity on the water flow path when the upper layer has a lower permeability most of the river water initially infiltrates into the lower layer during the flood period and then flows upward into the upper layer the flow pattern changes in reverse during the recession period when the upper layer has a higher permeability the vertical flow in the aquifer is not obvious which will be further illustrated later to clearly illustrate the effects of the layered heterogeneity the vertical profiles of the hydraulic heads for the different r k 0 01 1 and 100 induced by the recharge event and the flood event based on our semi analytical solution are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the other parameter values are the same as those in fig 3 fig 4 indicates that there is no significant vertical hydraulic gradient when r k 1 while the downward hydraulic gradient is evident when r k 1 this means that the heterogeneity does not necessarily cause the discrepancies in hydraulic heads between the two layers the differences in hydraulic heads between the two layers only occur when the upper layer is less permeable than the lower layer in the other case the difference in hydraulic heads is miniscule in addition fig 4 also shows that the hydraulic heads of both cases of r k 0 01 and r k 100 are generally larger than that of the case of r k 1 for the different times this implies that the heterogeneity leads to faster recession processes for the aquifer and results in the lower hydraulic heads for the flood event the impacts of the heterogeneity are similar to the case of the recharge event the hydraulic heads between the two layers differ only when the upper layer is less permeable than the lower layer however the difference with the case of the recharge event is that the aquifer has an upward hydraulic gradient during the rising phase of the hydraulic heads and a downward hydraulic gradient during the declining phase this means that there is a significant water interaction between the two layers induced by the flood event when the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer is lower than that of the lower layer 5 2 effects of layered heterogeneity on lateral discharge in this section we investigate the effects of layered heterogeneity on the recession processes induced by a recharge event and the river aquifer exchange induced by a flood event fig 6 b displays the discharge baseflow recession induced by a recharge event fig 6a for the different r k 0 01 1 and 100 the other parameters are the same as those in fig 3 fig 6b shows that the discharge has a larger peak value and a faster recession process when r k is small for the large r k 100 the discharge has a smaller peak value and a slower recession process this means that when the upper layer has a high permeability water from the recharge event will be quickly discharged into the river when the upper layer has a low permeability most of the water from the recharge event will infiltrate into the lower layer meanwhile for the homogeneous case r k 1 the discharge has the smallest peak value and the slowest recession process this is because we use the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity in the heterogeneous case to describe the hydraulic conductivity in the homogeneous case which would be controlled by the minimum value fig 6d shows the response of river aquifer exchanges to a flood event fig 6c for different r k 0 01 1 and 100 the discharge is negative in the early phase and positive in the later phase which means that the aquifer receives water from the river at the beginning and then releases it to the river for the small r k 0 01 however the interaction between river and aquifer is much greater and more water migrates into the aquifer and then back into the river for the large r k 100 the interaction is less than that in the small r k case and the arrival time of peak inflow and peak discharge lags compared with that in the small r k case this indicates that when the upper layer has a high permeability the exchange between aquifer and river is more rapid when the lower layer has a high permeability there is a marked vertical hydraulic gradient which can be found in fig 5 in the early phase the vertical hydraulic gradient causes some water in the lower layer to migrate to the upper layer which reduces peak inflow and delays the arrival time of peak inflow in the later phase the hydraulic gradient and exchange flow reverse and water from the upper layer migrates to the lower layer reduces peak discharge and delays the arrival time of peak discharge for the homogeneous case r k 1 the discharge has the smallest peak inflow and peak discharge the reason for this is the same as that for the recharge event equivalent hydraulic conductivity is often employed to simplify heterogeneity for groundwater flow parallel to aquifer layers the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is equal to the arithmetic mean of all individual hydraulic conductivities of the layers eq 15a for groundwater flow perpendicular to aquifer layers the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is equal to the harmonic mean of all individual hydraulic conductivities of the layers eq 15b 15a k p 1 n k i b i 1 n b i 15b k v 1 n b i 1 n b i k i where k i is the hydraulic conductivity of layer i and b i is the thickness of layer i however the equivalent method is derived based on a steady flow in order to verify the applicability of the equivalent formula in the riparian zone we employ the equivalent hydraulic conductivity on transient lateral discharge it should be noted that the result has to be discussed with dimension as the hydraulic conductivity influences the dimensionless form of time in this part the hydraulic conductivities are 1 m d and 10 m d for the upper layer and the lower layer respectively therefore the arithmetic mean would be 5 5 m d and the harmonic mean would be 1 8 m d the other parameters of the aquifer are as follows s s 1 s s 2 0 001 m 1 s y 0 2 b 1 b 2 10 m l 250 m these parameters would be the same as those in fig 2 if we transform them into dimensionless form fig 7 a presents the responses of lateral discharge to a recharge event for arithmetic mean harmonic mean and the heterogeneous aquifer when the arithmetic mean red curve is employed the lateral discharge is remarkably smaller than that in the heterogeneous case meanwhile in the recession process the difference between them decreases when the harmonic mean blue curve is employed the lateral discharge is similar to that in the heterogenous case at the beginning but the lateral discharge based on harmonic mean decreases more slowly than that in the heterogenous case after 60 d fig 7b shows the responses to a flood event when the arithmetic mean red curve is employed the interaction between river and aquifer is much less and the arrival time of peak value is earlier than that in heterogeneous case when the harmonic mean blue curve is used the interaction would be overestimated and the arrival time of peak value for the harmonic mean is slightly earlier than that in the heterogeneous case these observations indicate that for both the recharge event and flood event the harmonic mean would overestimate the discharge and the arithmetic mean would underestimate it the reason for this is that the arithmetic mean depends on the large hydraulic conductivity and would overestimate the overall hydraulic conductivity in comparison the harmonic mean depends on the small hydraulic conductivity and would underestimate the overall hydraulic conductivity 5 3 exchange fluxes between two layers the dimensionless exchange flux across the interface between the two layers q d is the direct reflection of the impacts of the contrast in properties between the two considered layers on groundwater flow to gain insight into the pattern of the exchange flux fig 8 displays the spatial distribution of q d along the interface at different times for a recharge event fig 8a and flood event fig 8b the parameters used in fig 8 are the same as those in fig 2 for a recharge event fig 8a all q d values are negative which means that the groundwater in the upper layer migrates into the lower layer there is a peak of q d close to the left boundary in the early phase this peak value increases over time and the location of the peak value moves toward the right as time progresses as well when the recharge process ends t d 1 the flux from the upper layer decreases however some groundwater in the upper layer still flows across the interface into the lower layer for a flood event fig 8b all q d values are positive in the early phase which means that water in the lower layer migrates into the upper layer in addition q d varies with x d and the peak of q d is close to the left boundary this peak value increases by t d 0 1 before decreasing and the location of the peak value moves toward the right as time progresses in the flood recession process the flux at the left region gently becomes negative which means that the water in the upper zone migrates into the lower layer in this region however some water in the lower layer still flows across the interface into the upper layer at the right regions as time passes q d gradually becomes negative at more locations of the interface which indicates that the water flowing from the upper layer into the lower layer gradually dominates the exchange flux between the two regions to investigate the impacts of the distinction in properties between the two considered layers on the total exchange flux between the two regions the response of dimensionless total exchange flux over the interface q exd t d to a recharge event and a flood event for different r k 0 01 1 and 100 are presented in fig 9 q exd is evaluated using the integration of q exd over the interface i e q exd t d 0 1 q exd d x d the other parameters used in fig 9 are the same as those in fig 3 for the recharge event fig 9a exchange flow from the upper layer to the lower layer increases as the recharge event occurs and then decreases to zero gradually after the recharge it can also be noticed that for a larger r k there is more water migrating into the lower layer these observations are consistent with the conclusions reached above namely that an upper layer with the low permeability forces water to flow downward into the highly permeable layer when the upper layer has a high permeability it would provide a fast flow path for the lateral discharge and the lower layer would function as an aquitard for the flood event fig 9b the total exchange between layers is maximized when r k increases for a small r k the amount of water being exchanged between layers is small for a large r k the upper layer releases more water to the lower layer in the early phase and then the water moves back there is a slight downward vertical exchange for the homogeneous case the mechanism of exchange flow is similar to that for a large r k with a smaller peak and bottom these findings suggest that when the upper layer has a high permeability the vertical hydraulic gradient becomes smaller and the upper layer with the low permeability would result in a larger vertical hydraulic gradient although the direction is opposite 6 application to field data the present solution is applied to observed hydraulic heads in a riparian zone on white clay creek within the christina river basin critical zone observatory in southeastern pennsylvania sawyer et al 2014 the riparian zone has a two layer structure the upper layer includes organic rich silt and silty clay whose hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 47 10 6 m s to 4 7 10 6 m s the lower layer is silty gravel whose hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 59 10 6 m s to 59 10 6 m s five observation wells referred to as well 110 119 120 121 and 122 are installed in the west bank the details of the field are provided in sawyer et al 2014 the measured precipitation and river stage are presented in fig 10 a the analytical model is applied to simulate the response of the hydraulic head to the storm the change of the hydraulic head δ h relative to its initial value is employed to fit the present model the aquifer recharge is difficult to estimate directly but it is usually proportional to the precipitation which is helpful in estimating recharge here we assume that the recharge is proportional linearly to the precipitation with an unknown ratio r pi thus the recharge can be obtained by estimating the ratio of the recharge and precipitation r pi the aquifer parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between simulated and observed heads the estimated parameters are k 1 0 1 m d k 2 2 m d s y 0 021 s s 1 s s 2 1 10 5 1 m b 1 1 0 m b 2 6 0 m l 60 m and r pi 0 2 the initial water table is equal to the river stage h 101 4 m and the interface between the two layers is located at 100 9 m it should be noted that the thicknesses of the upper and lower layers are presumed by combining the distribution of soils and comparing of the analytical solutions with the observation data fig 10b shows that the present solution agrees with the observed hydraulic heads of four wells while it performs poorly for well 122 the reason for this is that the observed values in well 122 might be affected by the unsaturated zone which is not considered in the present solution furthermore the change of hydraulic head in well 122 is the highest which implies that the recharge event has a greater impact on the hydraulic head than does the flood event this is because the upper layer with the lower permeability has a higher hydraulic head in the recharge event and a lower hydraulic head in the flood event as displayed in figs 4 and 5 respectively furthermore a clear tail phenomenon exists in each well and when the well is further away from the river this phenomenon is more obvious this is attributable to the fact that a well that is far from the river needs more time to discharge the water received from precipitation to further investigate the effect of a two layer structure on this case for the recharge event precipitation exchange flux and discharge are shown in fig 11 fig 11a presents precipitation total exchange flux between the two layers and discharge from both layers against time to make the difference between total exchange flow and discharge clearer the absolute value of total exchange flow is presented in fig 11a it can be seen in fig 11a that the peak of precipitation and total exchange flux between the two layers appear in chronological order and total exchange flux between the two layers is almost same as discharge from the lower layer the time difference between precipitation and total exchange flux is 0 6 d the discharge from the upper layer is minimal compared with that from the lower layer these phenomena reflect the path of groundwater flow in white clay creek with the recharge by precipitation most of the groundwater would flow into the lower layer and discharge to the river four specific times are selected to examine the exchange flux i e before the storm t 0 5 d during the storm t 1 22 d at the peak of total exchange flux t 1 75 d and after the storm t 3 75 d as shown in fig 11b before the storm the exchange flux is almost zero everywhere during the storm t 1 22 d the location of the peak values of exchange flux are near the left boundary moreover the exchange flux is positive at the left region and negative at the other regions this means that the water in the lower layer migrates into the upper layer at the left region due to the stage of the rising river at the other regions the recharge event and the upper layer with lower permeability cause a downward vertical exchange flow when the total exchange flow reaches its maximum t 1 75 d the flux at all regions is negative and there is a trough near the left boundary this means that the water in the upper layer migrates into the lower layer and the decreasing stage of the river would result in a higher exchange flux near the left boundary after the storm t 3 75 d the flux at all regions is both negative and small this indicates that the upper layer with the low permeability exerts a damping effect on downward exchange flow and the small and longstanding discharge to the lower layer would lead to the tailing phenomenon observed in fig 11a results from the case study shown above clearly show that the 2 d semi analytical model is capable of capturing the dynamic interactions of a two layered aquifer in response to recharge and flooding here we comment on the utility of the approach more broadly and potential implications two layered aquifer systems are commonly found in floodplains and riparian zones and in many areas the upper fine textured layer is intensely cropped e g devito et al 2000 wang and squillace 1994 kalkhoff et al 1992 applications of nitrogen fertilizer kalkhoff et al 1992 and herbicides wang and squillace 1994 applied to the upper layer are potentially mobilized to the more permeable lower layer during recharge and flood events similarly two layered systems occurring in riparian zones will have implications for implementing conservation practices designed to remediate subsurface contamination such as riparian buffers mayer et al 2007 and saturated buffers jaynes and isenhart 2014 these riparian buffer practices are most effective when groundwater flow high in nitrogen interacts with the organic rich sediments hence two layered alluvial aquifers and riparian zones found along many rivers and streams may be severely compromised by variable hydraulic gradients imposed from periodic recharge and flood events and more work is needed to apply the 2 d semi analytical model to these conditions finally there are a number of limitations that should be addressed for better application of the semi analytical solution of this study first the present solution does not consider the impacts of the semipervious riverbed the hydraulic conductivity of riverbed is usually lower than that of the aquifer and it will dampen surface groundwater exchanges depending on the riverbed hydraulic conductance huang et al 2014 sun zhan 2007 the impacts of the semipervious riverbed can be considered by replacing the dirichlet boundary condition on the river with a robin or third type boundary condition second the heterogeneous aquifer we considered is caused by the layered structure of the riparian zone the heterogeneity of the realistic riparian zone however is more complicated for example the macropores will provide preferential vertical flow paths the lens and plant roots in riparian zone will obstruct groundwater flow these all enhance the heterogeneity of the aquifer and limit application of the present solution third the linearized water table boundary 4b requires that the magnitude of water table fluctuation is much less than the aquifer thickness however it is difficult to address exactly how small is much less this question may be addressed by comparison the present model with a numerical model that considers free moving water table however such model will involve complicated moving mesh treating and iterative solving on unknown water table which could be the future work 7 conclusion in this study groundwater responses to recharge and flood in the riparian zone of a two layer aquifer were investigated and a 2 d semi analytical model describing groundwater flow in the layered heterogeneous medium was developed groundwater flow in the two layers is governed by the 2 d transient groundwater flow equation and is coupled by the continuity of the hydraulic head and groundwater fluxes across the interface between the two layers the semi analytical solutions for the hydraulic heads in the two layers are derived and compared with a finite element solution using comsol multiphysics and applied to field data in white clay creek the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the two layer structure has a significant effect on the responses of groundwater flow to hydrological events for recharge events when the upper layer is less permeable lateral discharge to the river in this layer is impeded and more groundwater flows downward into the more permeable lower layer in contrast when the upper layer is more permeable more groundwater flows laterally into the river and less downward into the less permeable lower layer for a flood event when the upper layer is less permeable river water infiltrates mostly into the more permeable lower layer during the initial time of the flood period and then flows upward into the upper layer creating a vertical flow from the more permeable lower layer to the less permeable upper layer the direction of the vertical flow is reversed during the recession period however this phenomenon is not evident when the upper layer is more permeable than the lower layer 2 the comparison of discharge for the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity shows that the equivalent hydraulic conductivity method can lead to large errors in discharge for the recharge event the peak discharge simulated with the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivities is reasonable but the discharge is overestimated during the recession process the peak discharge simulated with the arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivities would underestimate the peak discharge for the flood event the discharge simulated with the equivalent hydraulic conductivity method peaks earlier than it should be moreover the interaction between river and aquifer simulated with the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivities is overestimated and that with the arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivities is underestimated 3 the present solution is applied to model the observed hydraulic head and discharge in white clay creek within the christina river basin critical zone observatory in southeastern pennsylvania and the

2746,a riparian zone is an important element in a river aquifer system controlling water exchange and other chemical and biological processes between a river and an aquifer complex groundwater flow patterns may occur due to aquifer heterogeneity within a riparian zone the purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of layered heterogeneity on water exchange in the riparian zone using a mathematical model for groundwater flow in a two layer aquifer that is recharged by precipitation and floods a semi analytical solution is derived for the hydraulic head lateral discharge and fluxes between the layers results demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity difference between the two layers enhances lateral flow in the higher permeable layer and more importantly generates vertical flow between the two layers the vertical flow induced by the recharge event is downward while it could be upward or downward induced by the flood event which is determined by the contrast in permeabilities of the two layers using an equivalent hydraulic conductivity approach underestimates discharge of the two layer aquifer due to recharge or flood the analytical solution closely matched the observed hydraulic heads in riparian zone well of white clay creek and provided reasonable estimates of aquifer parameters the present solution provides a valuable basis for further study of chemical and biological processes in riparian zone keywords heterogeneity unconfined aquifer riparian zones analytical solution data availability data used in preparing fig 10 of this manuscript are from sawyer et al 2014 no new data are used 1 introduction the riparian zone constitutes an important landscape element in a river aquifer system due to its location in a catchment robert 1997 webster et al 1976 it possesses a unique spatial structure and ecological function and plays a significant role in regulating water quantity and quality exchanges in a river aquifer system for example a riparian forest may reduce recharge from precipitation or agricultural chemicals applied riparian crops may contaminate groundwater and river water gonzales inca et al 2015 krutz et al 2005 oliveira et al 2010 ou et al 2016 the hyporheic zone within the riparian zone is defined by shallow subsurface pathways through river beds and river banks beginning and ending at the river boano et al 2014 and this area is considered a hot spot for hydrologic geologic geomorphic geochemical and biological processes fox et al 2016 groundwater flow is the controlling factor for many processes in the riparian and hyporheic zones and it is greatly influenced by natural events and human activities flooding is one of the most important natural events affecting groundwater flow in the riparian and hyporheic zone as rapid water level fluctuations give rise to lateral propagation of river water into the riparian zone that changes the local flow field curry et al 1994 liu et al 2020 in addition large scale human activities e g damming river channelization artificial flow regulation can reduce the flood pulse of natural rivers and make the river level fluctuate more intermittently arias et al 2013 liu et al 2020 nilsson and berggren 2000 which may substantially impact hydrologic exchange in the riparian zone fritz and arntzen 2007 and groundwater flow ferencz et al 2019 moreover human society especially coastal mega cities will face increasing flood risk under the current protection standard because of future climate change hu et al 2019 huang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 variable recharge from precipitation further impacts riparian zone hydrology schilling et al 2004 and it should be considered along with flooding to obtain a better understanding of the complex patterns of groundwater flow in the riparian zone spatiotemporal responses to hydrological events with riparian or hyporheic zones and impacts on surface groundwater exchanges have been investigated in extant literature chen and chen 2003 hantush 2005 mccallum and shanafield 2016 zlotnik and huang 1999 singh 2004 considered stream boundary resistance and presented a 1 d analytical solution for semi infinite aquifer responses to a sinusoidal river stage fluctuation liang et al 2017b developed a semi analytical solution for base flow recession caused by recharge by considering lateral unsaturated discharge and aquifer compressibility their results showed that the unsaturated zone imparts a damping effect on the saturated flow these studies however only considered groundwater flow in a cross section of a river aquifer system to explore the plane view of the surface groundwater exchange liang et al 2018 presented an analytical solution for the spatiotemporal response of horizontal 2 d groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer and surface water and groundwater exchanges due to a flood event the results demonstrated that the 1 d cross section aquifer river model overestimates both the hydraulic head and discharge in the upstream aquifer and underestimates the hydraulic head in the downstream aquifer because it neglects groundwater flow parallel to the river channel one of the limitations in the above mentioned studies is the assumption of the homogeneous condition in fact heterogeneity is intrinsic in natural aquifers and has been studied extensively in hydrogeology e g chang and yeh 2016 feng et al 2020 hsieh and yeh 2014 li et al 2020 2021 liang et al 2019 sedghi and zhan 2021b the riverbank often has two layers structure which is composed of non cohesive and cohesive materials thorne and tovey 1981 heterogeneity in riverbank sediments not only controls water exchange by deflecting flow downward into the sediment or upward into the channel ward et al 2011 but it also alters groundwater paths fluxes and residence times in the riparian zone earon et al 2020 gomez velez et al 2014 pryshlak et al 2015 sawyer and cardenas 2009 sawyer and cardenas 2009 conducted numerical simulations of hyporheic flow and solute transport through immobile bed forms composed of heterogeneous sediments their findings showed that the sediment heterogeneity created longer hyporheic mixing paths than the case with homogeneous sediments liang and zhang 2013 presented an analytical solution for the water table and lateral discharge in a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer with a time dependent source and fluctuating river stage the heterogeneity that they considered consists of a number of sections of different hydraulic conductivity values more recently su et al 2020 evaluated the scale issues inherent in concentration mixing heterogeneity and modelling approaches in hyporheic flow based on a numerical model and monte carlo simulations their results revealed that flux variance in the streambed is an appropriate metric for assessing the magnitude of hyporheic mixing at all scales previous work evaluating the heterogeneity of aquifers in analytical models is summarized in table 1 to the best of our knowledge a 2 d analytical model describing groundwater flow in the riparian zone or hyporheic zone with a two layer structure has not been reported therefore this study aims to fill this knowledge gap by presenting a semi analytical solution for this 2 d model in the semi analytical model groundwater flow in the two layers is coupled with the continuity of the hydraulic head and water fluxes across the interface we anticipate that the proposed semi analytical model could be used to investigate changes of the hydraulic head and lateral discharge caused by a recharge or flood event in a layered aquifer system the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model and its solution are presented in section 2 and section 3 respectively the comparison of the solution with a high resolution numerical model built with comsol is given in section 4 the results and discussion are presented in section 5 and application of the solution to field data is described in section 6 section 7 presents the summary and conclusions from this work 2 conceptual and mathematical models a schematic diagram of groundwater flow along a transect of the riparian zone in a two layer unconfined aquifer is displayed in fig 1 the layered aquifer is laterally bounded by a watershed divide and a river that fully penetrates the aquifer fig 1a which is conceptualized in two dimensions fig 1b in fig 1b the x axis is along the groundwater flow direction toward the divide and the z axis is vertically upward the top of the aquifer is the water table which receives time dependent recharge from rainfall events the bottom of the aquifer is horizontal and impermeable the upper and lower layers have a uniform initial thickness of b 1 l and b 2 l respectively the upper and lower layers are both homogeneous but their hydraulic conductivities are different the governing equation for groundwater flow in the aquifer is given as follows 1a s s 1 h 1 t k x 1 2 h 1 x 2 k z 1 2 h 1 z 2 0 z ξ 0 x l 1b s s 2 h 2 t k x 2 2 h 2 x 2 k z 2 2 h 2 z 2 b 2 z 0 0 x l the initial head is defined as a uniform value 2a h 1 x z t h 2 x z t h 0 t 0 and the boundary conditions are defined as 2b h 1 x z t h 2 x z t h b t x 0 2c h 1 x x z t h 2 x x z t 0 x l 2d h 2 z x z t 0 z b 2 where subscripts 1 and 2 represent the upper and lower layer respectively s s is the specific storage l 1 h is the hydraulic head l k x and k z are hydraulic conductivity in x direction horizontal and z direction vertical respectively ξ is the instantaneous location of the moving water table h 0 is the initial head which is the same as water table l and h b t is the fluctuating river stage l eqs 1a and 1b are coupled by the interface conditions representing the continuity of the hydraulic head and vertical fluxes respectively liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b 3a h 1 x z 0 t h 2 x z 0 t z 0 3b k z 1 h 1 z x z t k z 2 h 2 z x z t z 0 the upper boundary of the unconfined aquifer with a recharge term is a free surface moving water table that can be described by the following equation bear 1979 4a k z 1 w t h 1 z s y h 1 t w t k x 1 h 1 x 2 k z 1 h 1 z 2 z ξ where s y is the specific yield and w t is the time dependent recharge rate lt 1 the coupled equations 1 3 are difficult to solve analytically because of the nonlinear nature of upper boundary condition 4a and the unknown location of the moving water table ξ to resolve this issue eq 4a is linearized by using the perturbation technique dagan 1964 which is widely adopted to simulate water flow in unconfined aquifers e g malama et al 2011 neuman 1972 zhan and zlotnik 2002 first the water table is imposed on a fixed position z b 1 by assuming that the magnitude of water table fluctuation is much less than the aquifer thickness second the two quadratic terms are ignored because they are much smaller than the other terms of eq 4a finally the recharge term on the left side of eq 4a is also ignored because the aquifer recharge rate w is usually orders of magnitude smaller than the hydraulic conductivity k z 1 based on the above assumptions the water table boundary can be simplified to the linearized form 4b k z 1 h 1 z s y h 1 t w t z b 1 to test the validity of the linearized boundary condition 4b we conduct a numerical experiment to compare the nonlinear 4a and linearized boundary conditions 4b specifically the coupled equations 1 3 with the boundary conditions 4a and 4b are solved numerically respectively then the hydraulic heads predicted by the model with the nonlinear boundary 4a is compared to that of the model with the linearized boundary 4b it should be noted that the nonlinear boundary in the numerical model is fixed at z b 1 rather than the moving water table which requires the magnitude of water table fluctuation to be much less than the aquifer thickness the details are presented in the supporting information s4 the results indicate that the error caused by ignoring the quadratic terms and the recharge term on the left side of eq 4a is very small when the recharge rate is less than one tenth of the vertically hydraulic conductivity which is widespread in the real world it implies that the linearized boundary 4b is an appropriate approximation to the moving water table boundary 3 solutions 3 1 solutions for hydraulic head the governing equation 1 are solved by the laplace and the fourier sine transforms and the details of the derivation are presented in the supporting information s1 the laplace domain solutions of eqs 1a and 1b with the initial condition 2a and boundary

varying river stage h b t and recharge rate w t both river stage and recharge should be specified if one aims to evaluate the head and discharge in this study the river stage is presented by a piecewise linear function with time and the recharge rate is presented by a piecewise constant function with time therefore h b t and w t can be written in the following forms 13a h b t h bi h bi 1 t i t i 1 t t i 1 h bi 1 t i 1 t t i 13b w t w j t i 1 t t i where h bi is the observed river stage at time t i and w j is a constant for the time interval t i 1 t t i with t 0 0 the piecewise linear approximation is the most practical approach for treating the actual river stage because it permits approximation of any river hydrograph with desired accuracy if small time increments are used liang

table 1 eqs 5 9 11 and 12 are the laplace domain solutions due to the complicated mathematical expressions it is challenging to obtain closed form solutions by inverse laplace transforms analytically there are however several numerical inverse laplace methods that fix this problem such as the zakian method zakian 1969 fourier series method dubner and abate 1968 stehfest method stehfest 1970 crump technique crump 1976 talbot algorithm talbot 1979 and de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 we choose the de hoog algorithm to invert the laplace solutions into the time domain because a solution involving the piecewise functions eqs 13a and 13b commonly requires complex versions of the numerical inverse laplace method liang et al 2017b 4 comparison with numerical solutions to test the validity of the semi analytical solutions eqs 5 and 9 we compared them with the numerical solutions of the dimensionless governing eq s1 the dimensionless parameter values of the model are k 1 d 1 k 2

dimensionless river hydrograph is described with a diffusive type flood wave fig 2b and no recharge or w d 0 the dimensionless governing eqs s1 are numerically solved using comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma u s a a galerkin finite element software package that includes a partial differential equation pde solver for modelling the type of governing equations of this study triangulations are used for the elements of the 2 d cross section domain to ensure sufficient accuracy of the simulation the elements near the water table the interface between two layers and the river are refined with the minimum mesh size of 0 002 and the maximum mesh size of 0 01 which includes 28 860 triangular elements and 14 799 nodes the time step δ t d is 0 0025 for the two scenarios fig 2c and 2d show the responses of the hydraulic heads in the upper layer and the lower layer to the recharge and the flood events respectively fig 2e and 2f also present the lateral discharge induced by the recharge and the flood events respectively these figures indicate that the analytical solutions solid curves for both hydraulic head and discharge well agree with those of numerical solutions circle symbols over the entire simulation period through the above comparison the analytical solutions of this study appear to be acceptable to predict the hydraulic heads and the discharges for the model 5 results and discussion 5 1 effects of layered heterogeneity on hydraulic heads in this study the layered heterogeneity is mainly represented by a dimensionless parameter r k k x 2 k x 1 that quantifies the contrast in hydraulic properties of the two layers we first investigate how the layered heterogeneity impacts the responses of hydraulic heads to the time varying recharge and the fluctuating river stage to clearly demonstrate the impacts of r k we assume that the aquifer is isotropic and the specific storage of two layers are equal the other parameters of the aquifer are as follows k 1 d 1 k 2 d 1 r s 1 b 1 d 0 04 b 2 d 0 04 a n d s yd 0 8 fig 3 displays the responses of the hydraulic heads to a recharge event w d 0 25 during 0 5 t d 1 0 and a flood wave for different values of r k 0 01 1 0 and 100 fig 3b and 3c show that r k has a significant impact on the responses of hydraulic heads to the recharge event for the large r k 100 the hydraulic head in the upper layer blue solid curve is markedly larger than that of the lower layer blue triangle symbol for the small r k 0 01 the hydraulic head in the upper layer red solid curve is close to that of the lower layer red triangle symbol furthermore for the homogeneous case r k 1 the hydraulic head in the upper layer cyan solid curve is the same as that of the lower layer cyan triangle symbol these observations indicate that the aquifer has a significantly downward hydraulic gradient induced by the recharge when the upper layer has a smaller permeability in contrast for the case of the larger permeability in the upper layer the aquifer has no obvious vertical hydraulic gradient which is similar to the homogeneous case these observations imply that the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity regulates the groundwater flow path the upper layer with the low permeability hinders groundwater lateral discharging into the river in the upper layer and forces water to flow downward into the highly permeable layer in contrast when the upper layer has a high permeability it provides a fast flow path for the lateral discharge in the upper layer and prevents water from flowing downward into the lower layer fig 3e presents the response of the hydraulic heads to the flood event similar to the case of the recharge event there is little difference in hydraulic heads between the upper and lower layers for the homogenous case r k 1 and the case in which the upper layer has a higher permeability r k 0 01 for the case in which the upper layer has a lower permeability r k 100 however the hydraulic head in the upper layer blue solid curve is significantly lower than that of the lower layer blue triangle symbol in the early time t d 0 3 and the hydraulic head in the upper layer becomes higher in the later time the hydraulic head profile fig 3f further illustrates that for the case of r k 100 the aquifer has a markedly upward hydraulic gradient at t d 0 1 the rise phase of heads and it has a markedly downward hydraulic gradient at t d 0 4 the decline phase of heads for the cases of r k 0 01 and 1 the vertical hydraulic gradients are small which is in accordance with the observations in fig 3d the diverse hydraulic gradients reflect the impacts of heterogeneity on the water flow path when the upper layer has a lower permeability most of the river water initially infiltrates into the lower layer during the flood period and then flows upward into the upper layer the flow pattern changes in reverse during the recession period when the upper layer has a higher permeability the vertical flow in the aquifer is not obvious which will be further illustrated later to clearly illustrate the effects of the layered heterogeneity the vertical profiles of the hydraulic heads for the different r k 0 01 1 and 100 induced by the recharge event and the flood event based on our semi analytical solution are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the other parameter values are the same as those in fig 3 fig 4 indicates that there is no significant vertical hydraulic gradient when r k 1 while the downward hydraulic gradient is evident when r k 1 this means that the heterogeneity does not necessarily cause the discrepancies in hydraulic heads between the two layers the differences in hydraulic heads between the two layers only occur when the upper layer is less permeable than the lower layer in the other case the difference in hydraulic heads is miniscule in addition fig 4 also shows that the hydraulic heads of both cases of r k 0 01 and r k 100 are generally larger than that of the case of r k 1 for the different times this implies that the heterogeneity leads to faster recession processes for the aquifer and results in the lower hydraulic heads for the flood event the impacts of the heterogeneity are similar to the case of the recharge event the hydraulic heads between the two layers differ only when the upper layer is less permeable than the lower layer however the difference with the case of the recharge event is that the aquifer has an upward hydraulic gradient during the rising phase of the hydraulic heads and a downward hydraulic gradient during the declining phase this means that there is a significant water interaction between the two layers induced by the flood event when the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer is lower than that of the lower layer 5 2 effects of layered heterogeneity on lateral discharge in this section we investigate the effects of layered heterogeneity on the recession processes induced by a recharge event and the river aquifer exchange induced by a flood event fig 6 b displays the discharge baseflow recession induced by a recharge event fig 6a for the different r k 0 01 1 and 100 the other parameters are the same as those in fig 3 fig 6b shows that the discharge has a larger peak value and a faster recession process when r k is small for the large r k 100 the discharge has a smaller peak value and a slower recession process this means that when the upper layer has a high permeability water from the recharge event will be quickly discharged into the river when the upper layer has a low permeability most of the water from the recharge event will infiltrate into the lower layer meanwhile for the homogeneous case r k 1 the discharge has the smallest peak value and the slowest recession process this is because we use the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity in the heterogeneous case to describe the hydraulic conductivity in the homogeneous case which would be controlled by the minimum value fig 6d shows the response of river aquifer exchanges to a flood event fig 6c for different r k 0 01 1 and 100 the discharge is negative in the early phase and positive in the later phase which means that the aquifer receives water from the river at the beginning and then releases it to the river for the small r k 0 01 however the interaction between river and aquifer is much greater and more water migrates into the aquifer and then back into the river for the large r k 100 the interaction is less than that in the small r k case and the arrival time of peak inflow and peak discharge lags compared with that in the small r k case this indicates that when the upper layer has a high permeability the exchange between aquifer and river is more rapid when the lower layer has a high permeability there is a marked vertical hydraulic gradient which can be found in fig 5 in the early phase the vertical hydraulic gradient causes some water in the lower layer to migrate to the upper layer which reduces peak inflow and delays the arrival time of peak inflow in the later phase the hydraulic gradient and exchange flow reverse and water from the upper layer migrates to the lower layer reduces peak discharge and delays the arrival time of peak discharge for the homogeneous case r k 1 the discharge has the smallest peak inflow and peak discharge the reason for this is the same as that for the recharge event equivalent hydraulic conductivity is often employed to simplify heterogeneity for groundwater flow parallel to aquifer layers the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is equal to the arithmetic mean of all individual hydraulic conductivities of the layers eq 15a for groundwater flow perpendicular to aquifer layers the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is equal to the harmonic mean of all individual hydraulic conductivities of the layers eq 15b 15a k p 1 n k i b i 1 n b i 15b k v 1 n b i 1 n b i k i where k i is the hydraulic conductivity of layer i and b i is the thickness of layer i however the equivalent method is derived based on a steady flow in order to verify the applicability of the equivalent formula in the riparian zone we employ the equivalent hydraulic conductivity on transient lateral discharge it should be noted that the result has to be discussed with dimension as the hydraulic conductivity influences the dimensionless form of time in this part the hydraulic conductivities are 1 m d and 10 m d for the upper layer and the lower layer respectively therefore the arithmetic mean would be 5 5 m d and the harmonic mean would be 1 8 m d the other parameters of the aquifer are as follows s s 1 s s 2 0 001 m 1 s y 0 2 b 1 b 2 10 m l 250 m these parameters would be the same as those in fig 2 if we transform them into dimensionless form fig 7 a presents the responses of lateral discharge to a recharge event for arithmetic mean harmonic mean and the heterogeneous aquifer when the arithmetic mean red curve is employed the lateral discharge is remarkably smaller than that in the heterogeneous case meanwhile in the recession process the difference between them decreases when the harmonic mean blue curve is employed the lateral discharge is similar to that in the heterogenous case at the beginning but the lateral discharge based on harmonic mean decreases more slowly than that in the heterogenous case after 60 d fig 7b shows the responses to a flood event when the arithmetic mean red curve is employed the interaction between river and aquifer is much less and the arrival time of peak value is earlier than that in heterogeneous case when the harmonic mean blue curve is used the interaction would be overestimated and the arrival time of peak value for the harmonic mean is slightly earlier than that in the heterogeneous case these observations indicate that for both the recharge event and flood event the harmonic mean would overestimate the discharge and the arithmetic mean would underestimate it the reason for this is that the arithmetic mean depends on the large hydraulic conductivity and would overestimate the overall hydraulic conductivity in comparison the harmonic mean depends on the small hydraulic conductivity and would underestimate the overall hydraulic conductivity 5 3 exchange fluxes between two layers the dimensionless exchange flux across the interface between the two layers q d is the direct reflection of the impacts of the contrast in properties between the two considered layers on groundwater flow to gain insight into the pattern of the exchange flux fig 8 displays the spatial distribution of q d along the interface at different times for a recharge event fig 8a and flood event fig 8b the parameters used in fig 8 are the same as those in fig 2 for a recharge event fig 8a all q d values are negative which means that the groundwater in the upper layer migrates into the lower layer there is a peak of q d close to the left boundary in the early phase this peak value increases over time and the location of the peak value moves toward the right as time progresses as well when the recharge process ends t d 1 the flux from the upper layer decreases however some groundwater in the upper layer still flows across the interface into the lower layer for a flood event fig 8b all q d values are positive in the early phase which means that water in the lower layer migrates into the upper layer in addition q d varies with x d and the peak of q d is close to the left boundary this peak value increases by t d 0 1 before decreasing and the location of the peak value moves toward the right as time progresses in the flood recession process the flux at the left region gently becomes negative which means that the water in the upper zone migrates into the lower layer in this region however some water in the lower layer still flows across the interface into the upper layer at the right regions as time passes q d gradually becomes negative at more locations of the interface which indicates that the water flowing from the upper layer into the lower layer gradually dominates the exchange flux between the two regions to investigate the impacts of the distinction in properties between the two considered layers on the total exchange flux between the two regions the response of dimensionless total exchange flux over the interface q exd t d to a recharge event and a flood event for different r k 0 01 1 and 100 are presented in fig 9 q exd is evaluated using the integration of q exd over the interface i e q exd t d 0 1 q exd d x d the other parameters used in fig 9 are the same as those in fig 3 for the recharge event fig 9a exchange flow from the upper layer to the lower layer increases as the recharge event occurs and then decreases to zero gradually after the recharge it can also be noticed that for a larger r k there is more water migrating into the lower layer these observations are consistent with the conclusions reached above namely that an upper layer with the low permeability forces water to flow downward into the highly permeable layer when the upper layer has a high permeability it would provide a fast flow path for the lateral discharge and the lower layer would function as an aquitard for the flood event fig 9b the total exchange between layers is maximized when r k increases for a small r k the amount of water being exchanged between layers is small for a large r k the upper layer releases more water to the lower layer in the early phase and then the water moves back there is a slight downward vertical exchange for the homogeneous case the mechanism of exchange flow is similar to that for a large r k with a smaller peak and bottom these findings suggest that when the upper layer has a high permeability the vertical hydraulic gradient becomes smaller and the upper layer with the low permeability would result in a larger vertical hydraulic gradient although the direction is opposite 6 application to field data the present solution is applied to observed hydraulic heads in a riparian zone on white clay creek within the christina river basin critical zone observatory in southeastern pennsylvania sawyer et al 2014 the riparian zone has a two layer structure the upper layer includes organic rich silt and silty clay whose hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 47 10 6 m s to 4 7 10 6 m s the lower layer is silty gravel whose hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 59 10 6 m s to 59 10 6 m s five observation wells referred to as well 110 119 120 121 and 122 are installed in the west bank the details of the field are provided in sawyer et al 2014 the measured precipitation and river stage are presented in fig 10 a the analytical model is applied to simulate the response of the hydraulic head to the storm the change of the hydraulic head δ h relative to its initial value is employed to fit the present model the aquifer recharge is difficult to estimate directly but it is usually proportional to the precipitation which is helpful in estimating recharge here we assume that the recharge is proportional linearly to the precipitation with an unknown ratio r pi thus the recharge can be obtained by estimating the ratio of the recharge and precipitation r pi the aquifer parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between simulated and observed heads the estimated parameters are k 1 0 1 m d k 2 2 m d s y 0 021 s s 1 s s 2 1 10 5 1 m b 1 1 0 m b 2 6 0 m l 60 m and r pi 0 2 the initial water table is equal to the river stage h 101 4 m and the interface between the two layers is located at 100 9 m it should be noted that the thicknesses of the upper and lower layers are presumed by combining the distribution of soils and comparing of the analytical solutions with the observation data fig 10b shows that the present solution agrees with the observed hydraulic heads of four wells while it performs poorly for well 122 the reason for this is that the observed values in well 122 might be affected by the unsaturated zone which is not considered in the present solution furthermore the change of hydraulic head in well 122 is the highest which implies that the recharge event has a greater impact on the hydraulic head than does the flood event this is because the upper layer with the lower permeability has a higher hydraulic head in the recharge event and a lower hydraulic head in the flood event as displayed in figs 4 and 5 respectively furthermore a clear tail phenomenon exists in each well and when the well is further away from the river this phenomenon is more obvious this is attributable to the fact that a well that is far from the river needs more time to discharge the water received from precipitation to further investigate the effect of a two layer structure on this case for the recharge event precipitation exchange flux and discharge are shown in fig 11 fig 11a presents precipitation total exchange flux between the two layers and discharge from both layers against time to make the difference between total exchange flow and discharge clearer the absolute value of total exchange flow is presented in fig 11a it can be seen in fig 11a that the peak of precipitation and total exchange flux between the two layers appear in chronological order and total exchange flux between the two layers is almost same as discharge from the lower layer the time difference between precipitation and total exchange flux is 0 6 d the discharge from the upper layer is minimal compared with that from the lower layer these phenomena reflect the path of groundwater flow in white clay creek with the recharge by precipitation most of the groundwater would flow into the lower layer and discharge to the river four specific times are selected to examine the exchange flux i e before the storm t 0 5 d during the storm t 1 22 d at the peak of total exchange flux t 1 75 d and after the storm t 3 75 d as shown in fig 11b before the storm the exchange flux is almost zero everywhere during the storm t 1 22 d the location of the peak values of exchange flux are near the left boundary moreover the exchange flux is positive at the left region and negative at the other regions this means that the water in the lower layer migrates into the upper layer at the left region due to the stage of the rising river at the other regions the recharge event and the upper layer with lower permeability cause a downward vertical exchange flow when the total exchange flow reaches its maximum t 1 75 d the flux at all regions is negative and there is a trough near the left boundary this means that the water in the upper layer migrates into the lower layer and the decreasing stage of the river would result in a higher exchange flux near the left boundary after the storm t 3 75 d the flux at all regions is both negative and small this indicates that the upper layer with the low permeability exerts a damping effect on downward exchange flow and the small and longstanding discharge to the lower layer would lead to the tailing phenomenon observed in fig 11a results from the case study shown above clearly show that the 2 d semi analytical model is capable of capturing the dynamic interactions of a two layered aquifer in response to recharge and flooding here we comment on the utility of the approach more broadly and potential implications two layered aquifer systems are commonly found in floodplains and riparian zones and in many areas the upper fine textured layer is intensely cropped e g devito et al 2000 wang and squillace 1994 kalkhoff et al 1992 applications of nitrogen fertilizer kalkhoff et al 1992 and herbicides wang and squillace 1994 applied to the upper layer are potentially mobilized to the more permeable lower layer during recharge and flood events similarly two layered systems occurring in riparian zones will have implications for implementing conservation practices designed to remediate subsurface contamination such as riparian buffers mayer et al 2007 and saturated buffers jaynes and isenhart 2014 these riparian buffer practices are most effective when groundwater flow high in nitrogen interacts with the organic rich sediments hence two layered alluvial aquifers and riparian zones found along many rivers and streams may be severely compromised by variable hydraulic gradients imposed from periodic recharge and flood events and more work is needed to apply the 2 d semi analytical model to these conditions finally there are a number of limitations that should be addressed for better application of the semi analytical solution of this study first the present solution does not consider the impacts of the semipervious riverbed the hydraulic conductivity of riverbed is usually lower than that of the aquifer and it will dampen surface groundwater exchanges depending on the riverbed hydraulic conductance huang et al 2014 sun zhan 2007 the impacts of the semipervious riverbed can be considered by replacing the dirichlet boundary condition on the river with a robin or third type boundary condition second the heterogeneous aquifer we considered is caused by the layered structure of the riparian zone the heterogeneity of the realistic riparian zone however is more complicated for example the macropores will provide preferential vertical flow paths the lens and plant roots in riparian zone will obstruct groundwater flow these all enhance the heterogeneity of the aquifer and limit application of the present solution third the linearized water table boundary 4b requires that the magnitude of water table fluctuation is much less than the aquifer thickness however it is difficult to address exactly how small is much less this question may be addressed by comparison the present model with a numerical model that considers free moving water table however such model will involve complicated moving mesh treating and iterative solving on unknown water table which could be the future work 7 conclusion in this study groundwater responses to recharge and flood in the riparian zone of a two layer aquifer were investigated and a 2 d semi analytical model describing groundwater flow in the layered heterogeneous medium was developed groundwater flow in the two layers is governed by the 2 d transient groundwater flow equation and is coupled by the continuity of the hydraulic head and groundwater fluxes across the interface between the two layers the semi analytical solutions for the hydraulic heads in the two layers are derived and compared with a finite element solution using comsol multiphysics and applied to field data in white clay creek the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the two layer structure has a significant effect on the responses of groundwater flow to hydrological events for recharge events when the upper layer is less permeable lateral discharge to the river in this layer is impeded and more groundwater flows downward into the more permeable lower layer in contrast when the upper layer is more permeable more groundwater flows laterally into the river and less downward into the less permeable lower layer for a flood event when the upper layer is less permeable river water infiltrates mostly into the more permeable lower layer during the initial time of the flood period and then flows upward into the upper layer creating a vertical flow from the more permeable lower layer to the less permeable upper layer the direction of the vertical flow is reversed during the recession period however this phenomenon is not evident when the upper layer is more permeable than the lower layer 2 the comparison of discharge for the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity shows that the equivalent hydraulic conductivity method can lead to large errors in discharge for the recharge event the peak discharge simulated with the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivities is reasonable but the discharge is overestimated during the recession process the peak discharge simulated with the arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivities would underestimate the peak discharge for the flood event the discharge simulated with the equivalent hydraulic conductivity method peaks earlier than it should be moreover the interaction between river and aquifer simulated with the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivities is overestimated and that with the arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivities is underestimated 3 the present solution is applied to model the observed hydraulic head and discharge in white clay creek within the christina river basin critical zone observatory in southeastern pennsylvania and the estimated values of the aquifer parameters are reasonable 4 riparian flow controls the active chemical and biological processes in riparian zone the present solution is a convenient calculation method for riparian flow in two layer aquifer and will provide a valuable and solid foundation to clarify chemical and biological reactions in riparian zones and alluvial aquifers credit authorship

2747,in this study we modelled the xaj xin anjiang hydrologic model parameters for the lushi basin of china an important tributary of the yellow river time series of daily precipitation evaporation and runoff data from 1976 to 1995 were used to calibrate the model while the data from 1996 to 2000 were used for validation thereafter the future climate variability was projected from 2021 to 2100 for 0 22 grids under cmip6 cordex east asia coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment east asia rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios the non parametric quantile mapping qm bias correction method was used to minimize the large differences between climate variability directly derived from the regional circulation model rcm and the historical observations and the results were also compared with the baseline period 1976 2000 overall when compared to the baseline case results showed a decline in the annual precipitation by 7 22 and 5 01 while an increase was observed for the annual evaporation by 2 03 and 3 58 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the 21st century annual runoff projection by xaj model indicate reduction with 9 3 and 31 2 fall for short term 2021 2040 31 5 and 41 2 fall for mid term 2051 2070 and 32 3 and 77 4 fall for long term 2081 2100 respectively the extreme streamflow projects increase during the dry period november to june with 76 5 m3 s and 84 6 m3 s under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 compared to 45 6 m3 s from the baseline period in contrast there is a decrease during the wet period july to october by 390 m3 s and 237 m3 s compared to 405 m3 s in the baseline data of the same period such projections become more pronounced toward the end of the 21st century and the reduction is likely to continue if future climate projections occur the hydrological parameters can be applied to adjacent and similar landscape basins for disaster forecasting and early warning the qm method is effective in bias correction the findings can also be used

mean square error 1 introduction global warming has resulted in significant variability of global climate especially the variation in precipitation and evaporation as a result it is expected that river flow regimes will also become varied historical data show that climate variability leads to significant changes in the hydrological cycle resulting in recurring extreme hydrological events such as floods and droughts allen et al 2009 field et al 2012 hydrological models help us better understand hydrological dynamics and processes allowing for simulation and forecasting of floods and management of water resources abbass 2003 global and regional climate model projections are frequently used to quantify hydrological impacts of future climate changes whereas bias correction is indispensable as general discrepancy would exist between the data directly from climate models and historical observations vörösmarty et al 2000 haddeland et al 2014 schewe et al 2014 fentaw et al 2018 thus it is significant to correctly understand the response of basin runoff to climate variability and use the bias correction method to revise the outputs provided by climate models to drive hydrological models to develop strategies against disasters and water shortages runoff observation records are important for hydrological research and practices such as flood forecasting hydraulic engineering design drought risk assessment and water resources planning and management however runoff observations are in many cases limited or incomplete while in many parts of the world the data is simply unavailable sivapalan 2003 wagener et al 2004 missing or incomplete runoff observations impede hydrological research and practice several methods have been proposed for estimating runoff in ungauged basins and most of them involve the use of hydrological models mcintyre et al 2005 castiglioni et al 2010 ahiablame et al 2012 booker and snelder 2012 the earliest rational precipitation runoff model was proposed to calculate flood peak volume based on designed precipitation afterward superposition principles were put forward including the unit line theory sherman 1932 infiltration theory horton 1933 evaporation theory etc later on other concepts and factors were introduced into hydrological models making them more complex and representative of the real phenomena xu and singh 2005 prasad 1967 and o connell et al 1970 proposed the concept of reservoir series to solve the volume error problem models during this period were collectively known as black box models such as the total linear response model tlr linear perturbation model lpm artificial neural network model ann etc nash and barsi 1980 wen 1985 dibike and solomatine 2000 these models lacked a description of the internal mechanism and the parameters did not have specific physical meaning instead the relationship between multiple factors was found by establishing statistical characteristics of meteorological data input and runoff output the next generation of models were the conceptual lumped models which combined measured data with natural hydrological processes including the soil conservation service model scs hydrologiska fyrans vattenbalan model hbv xin anjiang model xaj etc mockus 1964 crawford and linsley 1966 zhao 1984 singh 1995 such models followed the energy conservation and actual water cycle process considering the interaction between the basin units and the vertical structure on the other hand distributed models are more complex and advanced including the soil and water assessment tool swat variable infiltration capacity model vic etc arnold et al 1998 liang et al 1994 zhang et al 2018 becker et al 2019 li et al 2019 they consider the spatial distribution of hydrological processes into discrete spatial components and detailed observations are needed abbott et al 1986 as the high precision distributed hydrological parameters and observations are the bottlenecks for the development of distributed models the conceptual lumped models are still full of vitality nonki et al 2021 the xaj model is a representative conceptual lumped model that has been tested and applied extensively zhou et al 2019 kim et al 2021 zang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 it contains four modules i e runoff generation three layer evapotranspiration separation of runoff components and runoff routing with the advantages of basin sub units evapotranspiration sub levels runoff generation sub sources and confluence sub stages the theory of full storage runoff explains the phenomenon that secondary flood precipitation has nothing to do with precipitation intensity and coincides with the theory of hillslope hydrology the model improved the water source division and solved the nonlinear problem of stream confluence it also attaches importance to flood elements in the parameter setting because the xaj model has strong spatial portability it has been employed and well verified by the china national flood forecasting system with extensive studies on han river basin yangtze river basin yellow river basin hai river basin huai river basin etc zhu and zhang 2004 wmo 2011 li et al 2013 li et al 2013 yao et al 2014 besides there are several cases of related applications in basins outside china for instance nirupama et al 2010 tested its simulation performance in the yodo river basin of japan ahirwar et al 2018 simulated precipitation and runoff in six river basins in india humid moderate and arid the xaj model has been applied for precipitation and runoff simulation flood forecasting water resources planning and management disaster prevention agriculture and other water related fields li et al 2009 li et al 2020 most assessments of hydrological responses to climate variability have been conducted based on a coupling approach between global atmospheric general circulation models gcms designed to simulate past and current climates and then used to predict the future state of global climate based on specific scenarios of greenhouse gas emission smagorinsky 1963 to harmonize experimental criteria for climate model design and share data formats the working group on coupled modelling wgcm has implemented six coupled model intercomparison projects cmip1 6 compared with cmip5 cmip6 improves the resolution and increases the bidirectional coupling of the carbon and nitrogen cycle and atmospheric chemistry the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reports 112 coupled models based on the climate variability simulations and projections provided by cmip much research on climate change ecological environment and hydrological events has been reported taylor et al 2012 mcsweeney et al 2012 jiang and tian 2013 zhou and han 2018 zhou et al 2019 huang et al 2013 li et al 2015 bao and feng 2016 reported that gcms were generally operational with very coarse spatial resolution in the order of hundreds of kilometers given the limitation of computational capacity small scale effects of the land surface as a result are not resolved by gcms application of model output directly often results in large discrepancies of runoff simulations nam et al 2012 provided by the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex the regional climate models rcms can supplement localized spatiotemporal high resolution and long term meteorological series for hydrological research especially for the regions with complex topographies dickinson et al 1989 giorgi 1990 shukla and lettenmaier 2013 boulard et al 2016 ba et al 2018 li et al 2018 tang et al 2019 concerning future climate projections the rcms simulate several climate scenarios in line with different estimates of greenhouse gas and co2 concentration including rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rcp8 5 respectively concentration pathways among others and rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios are very likely scenarios that keep the maximum and minimum balance consumption among all energy sources bias correction methods are necessary as using the data output from rcms directly to drive the hydrological model would result in greater deviations and uncertain results due to imperfect conceptualization discretization and spatial averaging within grids feddersen and andersen 2005 eutschbein and seibert 2012 prasanna 2016 investigated 29 performances of the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm using the cmip5 and the results showed that the original precipitation evaporation and sea surface temperature errors were up to 50 from the actual observed values and each model performed poorly however many studies neglected the bias correction process zheng et al 2018 piniewski et al 2018 muelchi et al 2021 besides even though bias correction was used in future climate variability before runoff projections from hydrological modelling the majority of bias correction methods can t correct the frequency of projected daily climate variability and the correction effect can t function effectively under extreme circumstances hay et al 2000 graham et al 2007 lenderink et al 2007 the quantile mapping qm a typical frequency correction can use cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the observed and projected climatic variables to form a bias correction function gudmundsson et al 2012 cannon et al 2015 guo et al 2019 the method holds that meteorological and hydrological data would have a relatively stable probability distribution function over a long time series and the simulated probability distribution should follow the observed probability distribution in a similar variation piani et al 2010 themeβl et al 2011 justine et al 2017 enayati et al 2021 climate variability affects various geological domains and could change the conditions of local and regional water circulation affecting the spatio temporal distribution of water resources in recent years many variability variabilities were observed in about 31 of annual runoff from 145 major rivers worldwide some of these rivers exhibited a rising tendency of up to 9 while others exhibited a falling tendency by up to 22 walling and fang 2003 it is worthy to mention that runoff from many major rivers in china has been reported to have decreased two important cases are the hai river basin and the yellow river basin wang et al 2010 bao et al 2012 feng et al 2016 similarly the frequency of flooding and drought has increased in these basins in recent years lindner et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 these geo hazards have caused severe damage to lives properties and ecosystems xu et al 2010 wang et al 2019 more recently the yellow river stage has decreased enormously affecting crop production and other economic activities li et al 2004 the luo river an important tributary of the yellow river has declined due to climate variability the lushi basin has become a hotspot for flood drought rainstorm continuous rain and other extreme weather events zhang et al 2003 wang 2011 jia 2020 several studies have been conducted to determine the causes and impacts of these geo hazards to provide some mitigation strategy for sustainable development for instance xing and zhang 2006 che et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 investigated the geological disasters caused by mineral exploitation and proposed its countermeasures gu and gu 2008 and mo 2018 analyzed the meteorological causes of the massive mountain floods and debris flow disasters therefore it is of great significance to understand the changing hydrological conditions and processes to ensure more comprehensive water and environmental management strategy in this study the hydrological parameters of the xaj model were calibrated and validated based on the hydrologic and meteorological time series data from 1976 to 2000 in the lushi basin also the projections of the future climate variability dataset 2021 2100 for 0 22 grids were explored under the cmip6 cordex east asia rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios these have proven to be adequate to determine the results of local climatic studies cook et al 2019 tokarska et al 2020 su et al 2021 furthermore we elucidated the qm method for correcting the bias of meteorological variables the hydrological model was also adopted to simulate the outcome of the climate variability on runoff in the 21st century the findings of this study can help expand the capability and applicability of cordex project and promote the ability of qm method in bias correction similarly the hydrological parameters of xaj model can be employed and transplanted to adjacent and similar basins the results of climate and runoff projection characteristics provide a strong basis for flood and drought mitigation and control plans in the short medium and long term use of water resources in the yellow river basin and can help make reliable projections on flooding events and support early warning systems in other similar basins 2 study area the catchment selected is the upper reach of the luo river which belongs to the yellow river system as illustrated in fig 1 a and b the study area lushi basin is located in north latitude 33 45 34 30 east longitude 109 40 110 10 encompassing an area of 4 562 km2 with an average annual streamflow of 25 97 m3 s during the period 1976 2000 the geomorphic type can be simply grouped into hills and lowlands elevation ranges from approximately 356 m to 2638 m above sea level fig 1c the study area is characterized by a warm temperate humid mountainous monsoon climate with abundant sunshine the annual temperature ranges between 12 1 c and 14 5 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 850 mm increasing from 500 mm in the north west to 1100 mm or more in the south east 50 60 of the precipitation occurs mainly from july to october with the format of a rainstorm and 20 30 occurs between march and june large scale flooding events typically occur between july and october these floods were usually caused by intense widespread precipitation on the other hand low river runoff in the remaining months often leads to droughts there are two hydrometric stations and seven meteorological stations as shown in fig 1c in which a representative lushi hydrometric station is located at the outlet of the catchment the maximum precipitation reported is 1459 8 mm shimenyu station and the minimum precipitation is 447 4 mm lingkou station the average annual evaporation is 1001 mm the non frost season is around 182 245 days the basin is covered by a network of rivers including luo river wuguan river and 17 other large rivers as well many small tributaries the flow directions of surface water phreatic groundwater and confined groundwater are controlled by the regional topography all heading in similar directions from north west to south east and discharging into the luo river the river gradient is greater than 7 8 in shanxi province and decreasing to about 2 3 in henan province yang et al 2003 shu et al 2008 3 methods 3 1 trend definition and abrupt changes detection trend definitions have received considerable interest recently in hydrological meteorological water quality etc the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 sen s slope sen 1968 linear regression trend haan 1977 tests are widely implemented for trend detection as the mk is a typically non parametric statistical procedure for trend possibility identification which considers outliers and accepts independent data it has been commonly used on hydro meteorological data analysis silva et al 2015 in this method the kendall sum statistic s is given as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i the differences between each sequential value are calculated so as to depict increasing 1 decreasing 1 and neutral 0 signs which is defined as 2 sgn x j x i 1 0 1 xj x i 0 xj x i 0 xj x i 0 where xj and xi are time series values at jth and ith time instances in n observations there is a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend in the series which depends on the value of s 0 or s 0 when n 8 the statistic s has a normal distribution with the following mean and variance 3 e s 0 4 v s n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 g t p t p 1 2 t p 5 18 where g is the number of tied groups tp is the number of observations in the pth group if there is no dependence then v s can be expressed as 5 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 finally the mk test statistic zc is calculated as 6 z c s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 the trend is considered insignificant if z 1 α 0 2 z c z 1 α 0 2 but significant if z c z 1 α 0 2 decreasing

developed by leading climate modeling centers in the world including europe america and asia these models generally provide experimental global climate simulations with relatively coarse spatiotemporal resolution model output is usually monthly for a grid cell distance of 2 5 however each modeling center has its own simulation purposes and is very much dependent on computational capability the models therefore might be different in terms of physical parameterization time slice and spatiotemporal resolution the meteorological data needs to go through statistical and dynamic downscaling to meet the accuracy requirements for designated research areas rcms based on cordex project are currently considered one of the most advanced dynamic downscaling methods that reproduce the past present and future climate patterns with high confidence for most scenarios thomson et al 2011 riahi et al 2011 there is great evidence from several studies showing that the rcms can describe different types of underlying surface and regional physical characteristics which have better accuracy and have been applied to north america central asia south asia east asia and other regions sanjay et al 2017 li et al 2018 stanzel and kling 2018 ganguli and coulibaly 2019 adeyeri et al 2019 the rcms divide east asia into 417 255 grids with a high spatial resolution of 0 22 0 22 approximately 25 km 25 km data is stored in the form of f x y z at each grid point where x y z represent longitude latitude time respectively and f represents the function value of precipitation evaporation or runoff the data series extractions were completed using the matlab software in addition this study assumes that precipitation obtained from rain gauges is referenced precipitation true precipitation and the evaporation is measured in an evaporating dish a stream gauge at the catchment outlet lushi station is used for a runoff simulation and variation assessment 3 3 hydrological model the xaj model has shown great capacity to simulate runoff especially for hydrologic station network design and water availability estimation zhao 1992 as presented in fig 2 the model structure generally shows that evapotranspiration et occurs in the top three soil layers similarly the actual evapotranspiration aet is estimated as a function of potential evapotranspiration pet and available soil moisture the xaj model uses a parabolic curve to describe the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture storage capacity and assumes that the runoff is not produced until the soil moisture storage reaches field capacity zhao et al 1992 cheng et al 2006 the generated runoff is separated into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater according to different free water storage structures the surface runoff directly flows into the river the interflow and groundwater are released slowly through a linear reservoir to river channels finally the muskingum routing equation is adopted to calculate the discharge at the watershed outlet bai et al 2017 detailed descriptions of model structures parameters and state variables can be found in fig 2 and table 1 despite being a conceptual lumped model the xaj model has many parameters that require calibration table 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse multi year mean relative error er and qualification rate qr were selected as evaluation indexes for model simulation the description of the formulas is provided in the supporting information nse describes the coincidence degree between the predicted process and the measured observation the smaller the absolute value of er is the smaller error between measured and predicted runoff is runoff prediction takes the measured value less than 20 0 as the allowable error if the error of the primary prediction is less than the allowable error it is a qualified prediction 3 4 bias correction of climate model data errors may increase between rcms outputs and the historical observations of the same period due to a couple of reasons including the collection of data from different sources spatial resolution underlying surface information and parameterization schemes as well as the error of the model itself teutschbein and seibert 2012 wood et al 2004 feddersen and andersen 2005 and hagemann et al 2011 noted that applying outputs directly from rcms to hydrological studies without any bias correction would amplify data biases leading to more uncertainty several different bias correction techniques are available which aim at eliminating errors in the climate model data when compared against historical observations hellström and chen 2003 teutschbein et al 2011 johnson and sharma 2012 kling et al 2012 fowler et al 2015 in this work we considered the well established non parametric qm method for bias correction to keep the analysis precise the qm method effectively avoids the defect of the delta change method dca linear scaling method ls etc which are difficult to be applied to the processing of daily scale data and cannot have applicability of error in probability distribution baigorria et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the qm bias correction method considers that historical and predicted values under climate variability scenarios should be consistent in the frequency distribution firstly the cdf should be calculated the predicted and historical data should be divided into 100 intervals and ranked in an ascending order the sequence in the modeling period is then applied to calculate the probability density function pdf of each grid point in the interpolation of the predicted and historical values respectively the calculation is expressed as follows 11 p d f x a b f x d x 12 cdf x 0 xp pdf x d x where x is the historical data pdf x is the probability density function of x in a b cdf x is the cumulative probability distribution function when x is less than a certain threshold xp when xp is the maximum cdf x equals to 1 secondly the transfer function tf x has to be established the bias of normal and extrema should be segmented by a probability threshold and revised accordingly as it would reflect poorly on the extremum if the entire sequence be performed directly consequently the bias correction parameters can be used to construct the tf x for the entire data series theoretically the revised cdf would be the same as the historical series the mathematical model can be expressed as 13 tf x a 0 x x x 95 t h a 0 a 1 2 x x 95 t h x x 98 t h a 1 x x x 98 t h 14 c d f h i s tf x c f d p r e x where x 95th and x 98th are x in the 95th and 98th quartile a 0 and a 1 represent the correction coefficients of less than 95 and more than 98 respectively cdf his and cdf pre represent the cdf of historical and predicted data thirdly tf x of the modeling period could be used to revise the predicted value in the validation period grid by the grid as the formula of 15 and finally the correction results of the whole basin can be obtained 15 xcor t f x p r e where x cor is the corrected value and xpre is the predicted value the accuracy of the qm in the various configurations presented above was evaluated via the calculation of the deviations predicted observed and using statistical indices rbias and rrmse the formulas of quantitative statistical criteria can be found in the supporting information 4 data sources the required inputs to the hydrological model are daily values of precipitation and evaporation meanwhile the observed streamflow data was obtained for calibration and validation the following sections discuss the preparation of these data for predictions under historical conditions and bias corrected climate scenarios 4 1 historical data 4 1 1 trend analysis the annual precipitation and streamflow series and their mk test results are shown in table 2 for precipitation it can be seen that there is a slight increasing trend in the lushi and maping stations with mk test zc value of 0 397 and 0 300 and a less prominent decreasing trend in the remaining stations decadal variability of precipitation indicated that there was a most obvious drought period for the basin during 1976 2000 for streamflow there was a significant increasing trend in the lushi station with mk test zc value of 1 57 while essentially no decreasing trend in the lingkou station with mk test zc value of 0 09 4 1 2 abrupt change analysis change points of the precipitation and streamflow were also investigated in this study and the results are shown in fig 3 a and b and fig 4 a and b for precipitation there was no obvious abrupt change point while a declining trend was exhibited since 1985 unlike precipitation the annual streamflow series in the lingkou and lushi stations both had intersection points in 1978 and 1995 whereas the intersection point in 1978 was located at the front of the sequence which was not sufficient to determine if it made sense therefore there was an abrupt change that occurred in 1995 table 3 shows the statistical characteristic of average annual precipitation evaporation and streamflow under the historical climate at nine stations observed streamflow fluctuated slightly at the same station each year exhibiting a declining growth trend however it showed an increasing trend along the direction of the luo river for example maping station is located in the upper reaches which had the smallest average annual streamflow in contrast lushi station had the greatest streamflow as it is situated in the drainage area there seemed to be an observable decrease in precipitation starting around 1995 except for shimenyu station similar conclusions applied for evaporation except for lingkou station 4 2 evaluation of rcm data with historical observations as mentioned above the precipitation was obtained from rain gauges undoubtedly it would cause a certain amount of rain loss including evaporation loss wetting loss micro precipitation and dynamic loss which caused the observed precipitation usually less than the actual value especially in high mountain areas as the observation accuracy of the standard rain gauge is 0 1 mm the micro precipitation with the output results of rcms less than 0 1 mm is regarded as a dry day similarly precipitation greater than 0 1 mm is considered as captured precipitation the feasible method was also verified by ye et al 2004 the comparison of average catchment values clearly shows that there is a considerable deviation between the rcm outputs and the observations table 4 compared to the observed precipitation in the same time series the deviation rate of maximum daily value decreased from 32 50 before bias correction to 4 29 after bias correction the maximum three day value decreased from 69 88 to 23 84 and the multi year average value decreased from 54 86 to 1 89 as well the seasonal comparison also decreased the deviation range of evaporation from the rcm output is not very wide but the data corrected is closer to the historical value when compared to the observed evaporation the deviation rate of maximum daily value decreased from 27 35 to 0 the maximum three day value decreased from 22 30 to 1 74 and the multi year average value decreased from 27 83 to 0 14 comparing the monthly variability with the direct outputs under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of the future periods with the historically observed values fig 5 and the cdfs of daily precipitation at nine stations fig s1 in the supporting information as the data comparison and correction process were too similar only the precipitation was taken as an example it can be seen that the biases are very strong the observed precipitation exhibits seasonality but there have been difficulties in reproducing this observed pattern under scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the historical precipitation peaked in july and gradually attenuated from the peak to both sides and the minimum value appeared from december to january under rcp2 6 the maximum value occurred in august or september more importantly the predicted precipitation is almost above the observation during the entire year under rcp8 5 the trend of change is different from the historical value and it is overestimated in the early stage and undervalued in the later stage the two scenarios over estimate precipitation from january to june the future trends of the two scenarios from 2020 to 2100 fig 6 are also very different from those of historical observations precipitation output for both climate scenarios is generally higher than historical values the reason is that there is a great deviation in the frequency distribution of precipitation of various intensities from fig 5 in monthly and fig 6 in yearly it is clear that the data of two climate scenarios cannot be applied for hydrological modelling without bias correction therefore the frequency distribution of rcm data needs to be reasonably revised for evaluation of rcm data it has to be considered that due to the randomness in weather one cannot directly compare the time series of rcm simulations with historical observations however long term properties such as empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf should be similar between the two in the correction process by qm the first half of the simulation period 1991 1995 was used as the reference period to establish the tf x and the latter period 1996 2000 was used for revision for precipitation and evaporation simulations undertaken we compared both the estimates against the daily observations and the estimates corrected with the qm against the daily observations as shown in fig 7 a and b the relative precipitation bias improved markedly from 39 before qm correction to 2 5 after qm correction the qm correction is effective for intensities less than 0 2 i e about 99 of precipitation the ecdf of the corrected evaporation shows better agreement with the observations than the ecdf of evaporation before qm correction indeed the relative bias is improved from 134 8 to 2 2 for intensities smaller than 0 8 the qm correction shows very good results it also can be seen in fig 8 a and b the difference between pre and post revision data and daily historical values the closer the simulated value is to the historical value the closer the circle should be to the line with the slope of 1 1 conversely if the bias between the simulated and the historical value is larger the circle is further away from the 1 1 line there is no doubt that the corrected data are all near the 1 1 line while the data before bias correction shows different degrees of deviation taylor diagram taylor 2001 frequently serves as the primary tool to evaluate the accuracy of different models scatter points represent the models radiation lines represent the standard correlation coefficient scor and horizontal and vertical axes represent standard deviation sd as well the dashed lines represent standard root mean square error srmse the principle of taylor diagram and its related formulas have been expressed in the supporting information sd indicates the ability of the model to simulate the central amplitude the closer the sd is to 1 the better the simulation ability the srmse is the distance between the observation and the simulation and is represented in fig 9 as a dotted black semi arc with the ref point as the center it has been normalized and its semicircle radius only goes to 1 the correction effect is accurate when the point is infinitely close to ref the scor is determined by the azimuth position of the model when the model simulation results are consistent with the observed values the closer the model points are to the observation points in the x axis from fig 9 a and b the effect of bias correction can be seen more clearly before bias correction the scor of the seasonal precipitation and evaporation simulations is below 0 6 after bias correction scor is significantly enhanced even close to 1 in autumn the rmse after bias correction is also closer to ref point in four seasons than that of before bias correction and it is closer to 1 in winter it shows that the effect after bias correction is better than before besides the values of the four seasons also hover around 1 compared with the sd before bias correction given all that the transfer function established this time is appropriate the qm method is efficient and the simulations have been significantly improved in both spatial distribution and absolute value as well the simulated data after bias correction could be used to run a hydrological model 5 results and discussion 5 1 historical simulation 5 1 1 calibration of the hydrological model observed daily streamflow from january 1 1976 to december 31 1995 were used to calibrate the parameters of the hydrological model the remaining data from january 1 1996 to december 31 2000 were used to validate the model s performance individual stations based on the thiessen polygon method were assigned to the hydrological response units of the hydrological model to obtain a temporal pattern fig 1c those hydrological response units were used to impose a spatial pattern within a sub basin on the temporal pattern of the precipitation and evaporation this ensured that the complex local effects of orographic meteorological patterns in the ridges and gullies were correctly preserved the specific geographical location elevation sub watershed area weight of each station and its control area as well as the statistical characteristic of average annual precipitation evaporation and streamflow under historical climate are shown in table 3 the parameters were calibrated separately on a sub basin level from upstream to downstream the sensitivity of various parameters was analyzed and presented in table 1 definition of these calibration parameters and their minimum and maximum thresholds were detailed and introduced by zhao 1983 among them evapotranspiration directly affects the calculation of the flow yield in which the k is the most influential parameter and controls the water balance and k 0 97 satisfied the minimum error of water balance calibration as the c has little influence on the model results and is an insensitive factor 0 15 was selected as the empirical value ahirwar et al 2018 based on the analysis of the original hydrologic data and the underlying surface of the basin after selecting and optimizing within the empirical ranges it was determined that wm is 136 mm wum is 14 mm and wlm is 52 mm yuan et al 2018 guan et al 2020 hu et al 2021 the value of nse was the largest and er was smallest when b selected 0 35 imp value picked 0 02 this time as the study area is located in the upper reaches and has little influence from human activities beyond that other parameters including insensitivity and sensitivity have been described in table 1 through continuous manual optimization 5 1 2 validation of the hydrological model the comparison of observed and predicted annual streamflow for the calibration and validation periods has shown in table 5 it can be seen that the prediction errors were within 20 a maximum of 16 26 appeared in 1976 whereas 84 of this indicator fluctuated within 10 the peak accuracy error only reached 17 08 in 1976 and 92 were within 11 for the calibration and validation periods the value of nse were 0 90 and 0 88 and the absolute value of er always fluctuated within 20 respectively table 6 fig 10 showed that the model performed well against the daily streamflow the nse and er were 87 78 6 23 87 63 and 4 24 in the calibration and validation respectively besides the qr performs better in calibration 90 than that in validation 80 all of them are considerably acceptable thus the xaj hydrological model established can depict the water cycle process and provide a basis for analyzing runoff evolution and the effects of climate variability on runoff in this typical region 5 2 simulation under climate scenarios 5 2 1 variability of precipitation the monthly and yearly average variation under the observation 1976 2000 projected periods 2020 2100 by revised rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the nine gauging stations were plotted on the same chart as shown in fig s2 a and b of the supporting information each hydrological station s average monthly variation trend is basically similar under the three conditions the rcp8 5 is higher than the historical value in the former six months and lower in the latter half of the year whereas the variation trend in rcp2 6 is closer to the historical value trend lines were added to the multi year average annual precipitation maps to facilitate the variation of historical and projected periods as shown in fig s2b it is observed that although the average annual precipitation fluctuates up and down to different degrees it is undeniable that both the historical and predicted precipitation under the two scenarios show different degrees of attenuation a summary of historical precipitation in the contributing catchments for the observed period and its changes during the projected periods compared to the observation is presented in table 7 it can be observed that the historical precipitation exhibits a decreasing trend from 1976 to 2000 with average annual precipitation decreasing by 2 from 679 25 mm to 665 67 mm projected periods are 7 22 under rcp2 6 and 5 01 under rcp8 5 lower than historical data which decreased to 637 00 mm and 645 22 mm at lushi station the contributing catchment has the lowest precipitation area with an annual historical average precipitation of 594 70 mm the projected period is 2 under rcp2 6 and 1 under rcp8 5 decreasing into 570 91 mm and 588 76 mm respectively the mutonggou station another low precipitation part of the catchment experienced the highest precipitation reduction 5 under rcp2 6 and 4 under rcp8 5 the contributing catchment at maping and guanpo stations belong to the high precipitation parts with historical and predicted average annual precipitations under the two scenarios of 752 51 mm to 722 41 mm and 729 94 mm and 774 35 mm to 766 60 mm and 758 86 mm at shimenyu sangping and lingkou stations reduction has projected both scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 for instance projections for scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 indicate 90th percentile precipitation reduction by 13 9 13 and 15 12 9 50th percentile precipitation reduction by 9 11 8 and 13 5 10 and 10th percentile precipitation decrease by 6 15 14 and 3 6 10 hence during the 21st century all high medium and low precipitations in these catchments are expected to decrease compared to that of the observed past under both scenarios at boyusi and sanyao stations under scenario rcp8 5 the 50th percentiles of precipitation are projected to reduce by 9 and 10 respectively while the 90th percentile are projected to increase by 4 and 5 resulting in an overall 1 increase of precipitation 5 2 2 variability of evaporation the historical period and projected average monthly and yearly evaporation for the 21st century at nine stations are presented in fig s3 a and b of the supporting information details of variability for contributing catchment at nine stations for observed and projected periods are also presented in table 7 the variation trend of evaporation is significantly smaller than that of precipitation whether monthly or yearly the average monthly evaporation under the two scenarios is in good agreement with the historical value however there is a remarkable difference in the average annual variation despite the gradual upward trend the growth trend of rcp8 5 is gentler than that of rcp2 6 the historical evaporation exhibits a decreasing trend from 1976 to 2000 by 2 07 from 990 79 mm to 970 21 mm in contrast projected periods are 2 03 and 3 58 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 higher than historical data which increased to 1010 90 mm and 1026 26 mm at sanyao and shimenyu stations under the future climate scenarios there are having the highest average annual evaporation coefficient in the study area at 3 and 2 under the historical climate the 90th percentile evaporation increased by 5 1 and 1 2 and 50th percentile evaporation increased by 3 1 and 1 1 respectively several stations including maping sangping boyusi lingkou and guanpo stations have almost the same trend of average annual evaporation for example except for the slight ascent of 1 and 2 at lingkou station the average annual evaporation increases for the remaining sites are 2 and 1 under the two scenarios at guanpo station the 90th percentile evaporation falls to 5 and 4 the largest lift in the area at mutonggou and lushi stations the average annual evaporation under the projected climates is simultaneously rising by 1 of that upper the historical climate in contrast the 90th and 50th percentile evaporation increased to varying degrees while only the 10th percentile of evaporation decreased 5 2 3 variability of projected runoff the hydrological model was applied with the bias correction data to simulate runoff conditions under future climate scenarios as shown in fig 11 the xaj model results of runoff were considered for comparative analysis of observed runoff with projection periods short term 2021 2040 mid term 2051 2070 long term 2081 2100 under both climate scenarios changes in average annual distribution are presented in fig 12 for all future periods under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 both climate scenarios produced a drastically decrease which is mainly due to a projected moderate decrease in precipitation with a varied range of 9 3 to 77 4 including short term by 9 3 and 31 2 mid term by 31 5 and 41 2 and long term by 32 3 and 77 4 undoubtedly the decreasing trend of runoff under rcp2 6 climate scenario 9 3 32 3 is smaller than that under rcp8 5 climate scenario 31 2 77 4 and such a trend tends to be incomparably stable in the mid term and long term the quantitative evaluation of average monthly runoff variation relative to the baseline period is presented in fig 13 a and c in the short term projection of under rcp2 6 fig 13a the runoff generation depicts a similar behavior to those observed in the baseline period except for a slower acclivity towards the uptrend while there is a slight downward trend since september due to the late withdrawal of the wet period inversely under rcp8 5 the runoff increased significantly 150 200 in spring compared with the baseline period while there is a recession about 70 in summer and autumn this is perhaps due to the increased precipitation rate over time with the corresponding increment in evaporation during the mid term projection fig 13b the runoff in spring and winter has a slightly increasing trend by 30 under rcp2 6 and a significant increase of 140 under rcp8 5 whereas a moderately decreasing appeared 50 80 in summer and autumn it indicates that there will be significant changes in the middle of the 21st century with a considerable runoff reduction during the wet season and an increasing trend during the dry period during the long term projection all monthly runoff is projected to fall significantly under the two scenarios fig 13c with the largest average annual flow reduction of around 55 in july under rcp2 6 and 93 in october under rcp8 5 there is a tendency that climate variability will cause impacts on the runoff regimes toward a decline in summer and autumn and a longer duration of low runoff which implies that the risk of water shortage would be faced in the late 21st century historical and projected streamflow frequency distribution curves of the wet period july to october and dry period november to june in the 21st century are presented in fig 14 a and b it can be seen that the frequency of the same floods falls significantly relative to the baseline period in the wet period fig 14a the extreme value of streamflow in the wet period under rcp2 6 is changing significantly compared with the baseline period 405 m3 s in the baseline period and 390 m3 s under rcp2 6 while the extreme streamflow under rcp8 5 decreased significantly 237 m3 s however in the dry period fig 14b the occurrence frequency of floods of the same size is projected to reduce relative to the baseline period but the extreme value of the streamflow is projected to increase in varying degrees 45 6 m3 s in the baseline period 76 5 m3 s under rcp2 6 and 84 6 m3 s under rcp8 5 projections of extreme streamflow changes indicate further complexity for the 21st century in the wet period table 8 the reductions of 95th 90th 10th 5th and 1st percentile of extreme streamflow under the historical observation and rcp2 6 scenario are 31 02 38 22 73 58 72 97 and 68 75 from 213 7 m3 s to 147 4 m3 s 126 9 m3 s to 78 4 m3 s 5 3 m3 s to 1 4 m3 s 3 7 m3 s to 1 0 m3 s and 1 6 m3 s to 0 5 m3 s respectively while the 99th percentile of extreme streamflow increased by around 0 12 from 415 9 m3 s to 416 4 m3 s similarly the reductions of 95th 90th 10th 5th and 1st percentile of extreme streamflow under the historical observation and rcp8 5 scenario are 66 50 70 69 88 68 89 19 and 87 50 from 213 7 m3 s to 71 6 m3 s 126 9 m3 s to 37 2 m3 s 5 3 m3 s to 0 6 m3 s 3 7 m3 s to 0 4 m3 s and 1 6 m3 s to 0 2 m3 s respectively unlike the rcp2 6 scenario the 99th percentile of extreme streamflow also decreases from 415 9 m3 s to 247 9 m3 s with 40 39 during the dry period all extreme streamflow are projected to rise significantly in the 99th 95th and 90th percentiles under scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the 99th percentile by 69 23 and 90 38 the 95th percentile by 36 87 and 58 99 and 27 97 and 50 35 nonetheless all extreme streamflow is projected to fall in the 10th percentile 5th percentile and 1st percentile the 10th percentile by 46 67 and 60 00 the 5th percentile by 57 14 and 71 43 the 1st percentile by 63 64 and 81 82 the overwhelming majority of extreme streamflow in wet period in the 21st century is smaller than that in the baseline period while only half of the extreme streamflow in the dry season is larger than that in the baseline period it indicates that the streamflow distribution will change greatly in the future and the basin will face some water shortage risks in the late 21st century the decadal moving average can measure the variability trends over a long period fig 15 a and c are ten year moving average curves of precipitation evaporation and runoff between historical and future periods the trend of precipitation is decreasing in both historical periods and two climate scenarios evaporation in the historical period has a decreasing trend while it has an increasing trend under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 except for a trend change in the middle of the 21st century about 2060 s the historical runoff as a whole shows a downward trend so as the predictions however through the cumulative departure curves of the streamflow in the historical period and the two scenarios fig 16 it is evident that rcp2 6 shows a decline while rcp8 5 is continuously rising in the middle of the 21st century it shows that the rcp8 5 scenario based on the assumption that carbon dioxide concentration in the air will be 3 4 times higher than before the industrial revolution by 2100 and no engage in active suppression by humans is difficult to achieve as water resources managers and policy makers are interested in knowing about climate variability s impact on precipitation evaporation and runoff in the longer term interannual and monthly variations presented here could be used to meet the needs to develop tools that would be useful for planning future water resources 6 conclusions in this study future climate and runoff projection characteristics of lushi basin were determined the work applies the xaj hydrological model which was calibrated and validated using daily observed precipitation evaporation and runoff data from 1976 to 2000 obtained from nine gauging stations the projections of the future climate variability dataset 2021 2100 were explored under the cmip6 cordex rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios furthermore the non parametric qm bias correction method was effectively used to minimize the large differences between climate variability directly derived from rcm and the historical observations the projections will be useful for water resources planning and management and mitigating and planning for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods the key findings are summarized as follows 1 scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 were chosen as they are the more likely scenarios that keep the maximum and minimum balance consumption among all energy sources the qm method effectively consisted of the historical and predicted values in a similar frequency distribution after bias correction the predicted average annual precipitation was found to decrease against the baseline by about 7 22 and 5 01 while the average annual evaporation was found to increase by 2 03 and 3 58 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the 21st century 2 within the 21st century projections of average annual runoff of the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios exhibited a decreasing trend the short term period is estimated at 9 3 and 31 2 the mid term at 31 5 and 41 2 and the long term at 32 3 and 77 4 respectively during the short term period the runoff increases significantly 150 200 in spring under rcp8 5 and there is congruity with those observed in the baseline period under rcp2 6 during the mid term the runoff slightly increased during the spring and winter seasons by 30 under rcp2 6 and a significant increase of 140 was observed under rcp8 5 as for the summer and autumn periods only a moderate decrease was observed 50 80 during the long term projection the largest average annual runoff was reduced by about 55 in july under rcp2 6 and 93 in october under rcp8 5 3 the extreme value of streamflow during the wet period slightly declined under rcp2 6 390 m3 s and decreased significantly under rcp8 5 237 m3 s compared with the baseline period 405 m3 s as for the dry period the extreme streamflow was found to increase in varying degrees 45 6 m3 s in the baseline period 76 5 m3 s under rcp2 6 and 84 6 m3 s under rcp8 5 the overwhelming majority of extreme streamflow in the wet period is smaller compared to the baseline period while only half of the extreme streamflow in the dry period is larger than the baseline period decadal moving averages show varying degrees of decline in precipitation and runoff except for evaporation they all indicate that the runoff distribution will change greatly in the future and the basin will face some water shortage risks in the late 21st century this study has used standard techniques and methods appropriate for regional scale assessments and provides plausible projections after effective qm bias correction to determine the impact of climate variability on water resources future research on impact assessments should focus on integrated approaches linking climate hydrology water resources and ecosystem models to sustain and improve the development of

2747,in this study we modelled the xaj xin anjiang hydrologic model parameters for the lushi basin of china an important tributary of the yellow river time series of daily precipitation evaporation and runoff data from 1976 to 1995 were used to calibrate the model while the data from 1996 to 2000 were used for validation thereafter the future climate variability was projected from 2021 to 2100 for 0 22 grids under cmip6 cordex east asia coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment east asia rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios the non parametric quantile mapping qm bias correction method was used to minimize the large differences between climate variability directly derived from the regional circulation model rcm and the historical observations and the results were also compared with the baseline period 1976 2000 overall when compared to the baseline case results showed a decline in the annual precipitation by 7 22 and 5 01 while an increase was observed for the annual evaporation by 2 03 and 3 58 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the 21st century annual runoff projection by xaj model indicate reduction with 9 3 and 31 2 fall for short term 2021 2040 31 5 and 41 2 fall for mid term 2051 2070 and 32 3 and 77 4 fall for long term 2081 2100 respectively the extreme streamflow projects increase during the dry period november to june with 76 5 m3 s and 84 6 m3 s under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 compared to 45 6 m3 s from the baseline period in contrast there is a decrease during the wet period july to october by 390 m3 s and 237 m3 s compared to 405 m3 s in the baseline data of the same period such projections become more pronounced toward the end of the 21st century and the reduction is likely to continue if future climate projections occur the

indispensable as general discrepancy would exist between the data directly from climate models and historical observations vörösmarty et al 2000 haddeland et al 2014 schewe et al 2014 fentaw et al 2018 thus it is significant to correctly understand the response of basin runoff to climate variability and use the bias correction method to revise the outputs provided by climate models to drive hydrological models to develop strategies against disasters and water shortages runoff observation records are important for hydrological research and practices such as flood forecasting hydraulic engineering design drought risk assessment and water resources planning and management however runoff observations are in many cases limited or incomplete while in many parts of the world the data is simply unavailable sivapalan 2003 wagener et al 2004 missing or incomplete runoff observations impede hydrological research and practice several methods have been proposed for estimating runoff in ungauged basins and most of them involve the use of hydrological models mcintyre et al 2005 castiglioni et al 2010 ahiablame et al 2012 booker and snelder 2012 the earliest rational precipitation runoff model was proposed to calculate flood peak volume based on designed precipitation afterward superposition principles were put forward including the unit line theory sherman 1932 infiltration theory horton 1933 evaporation theory etc later on other concepts and factors were introduced into hydrological models making them more complex and representative of the real phenomena xu and singh 2005 prasad 1967 and o connell et al 1970 proposed the concept of reservoir series to solve the volume error problem models during this period were collectively known as black box models such as the total linear response model tlr linear perturbation model lpm artificial neural network model ann etc nash and barsi 1980 wen 1985 dibike and solomatine 2000 these models lacked a description of the internal mechanism and the parameters did not have specific physical meaning instead the relationship between multiple factors was found by establishing statistical characteristics of meteorological data input and runoff output the next generation of models were the conceptual lumped models which combined measured data with natural hydrological processes including the soil conservation service model scs hydrologiska fyrans vattenbalan model hbv xin anjiang model xaj etc mockus 1964 crawford and linsley 1966 zhao 1984 singh 1995 such models followed the energy conservation and actual water cycle process considering the interaction between the basin units and the vertical structure on the other hand distributed models are more complex and advanced including the soil and water assessment tool swat variable infiltration capacity model vic etc arnold et al 1998 liang et al 1994 zhang et al 2018 becker et al 2019 li et al 2019 they consider the spatial distribution of hydrological processes into discrete spatial components and detailed observations are needed abbott et al 1986 as the high precision distributed hydrological parameters and observations are the bottlenecks for the development of distributed models the conceptual lumped models are still full of vitality nonki et al 2021 the xaj model is a representative conceptual lumped model that has been tested and applied extensively zhou et al 2019 kim et al 2021 zang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 it contains four modules i e runoff generation three layer evapotranspiration separation of runoff components and runoff routing with the advantages of basin sub units evapotranspiration sub levels runoff generation sub sources and confluence sub stages the theory of full storage runoff explains the phenomenon that secondary flood precipitation has nothing to do with precipitation intensity and coincides with the theory of hillslope hydrology the model improved the water source division and solved the nonlinear problem of stream confluence it also attaches importance to flood elements in the parameter setting because the xaj model has strong spatial portability it has been employed and well verified by the china national flood forecasting system with extensive studies on han river basin yangtze river basin yellow river basin hai river basin huai river basin etc zhu and zhang 2004 wmo 2011 li et al 2013 li et al 2013 yao et al 2014 besides there are several cases of related applications in basins outside china for instance nirupama et al 2010 tested its simulation performance in the yodo river basin of japan ahirwar et al 2018 simulated precipitation and runoff in six river basins in india humid moderate and arid the xaj model has been applied for precipitation and runoff simulation flood forecasting water resources planning and management disaster prevention agriculture and other water related fields li et al 2009 li et al 2020 most assessments of hydrological responses to climate variability have been conducted based on a coupling approach between global atmospheric general circulation models gcms designed to simulate past and current climates and then used to predict the future state of global climate based on specific scenarios of greenhouse gas emission smagorinsky 1963 to harmonize experimental criteria for climate model design and share data formats the working group on coupled modelling wgcm has implemented six coupled model intercomparison projects cmip1 6 compared with cmip5 cmip6 improves the resolution and increases the bidirectional coupling of the carbon and nitrogen cycle and atmospheric chemistry the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reports 112 coupled models based on the climate variability simulations and projections provided by cmip much research on climate change ecological environment and hydrological events has been reported taylor et al 2012 mcsweeney et al 2012 jiang and tian 2013 zhou and han 2018 zhou et al 2019 huang et al 2013 li et al 2015 bao and feng 2016 reported that gcms were generally operational with very coarse spatial resolution in the order of hundreds of kilometers given the limitation of computational capacity small scale effects of the land surface as a result are not resolved by gcms application of model output directly often results in large discrepancies of runoff simulations nam et al 2012 provided by the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex the regional climate models rcms can supplement localized spatiotemporal high resolution and long term meteorological series for hydrological research especially for the regions with complex topographies dickinson et al 1989 giorgi 1990 shukla and lettenmaier 2013 boulard et al 2016 ba et al 2018 li et al 2018 tang et al 2019 concerning future climate projections the rcms simulate several climate scenarios in line with different estimates of greenhouse gas and co2 concentration including rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rcp8 5 respectively concentration pathways among others and rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios are very likely scenarios that keep the maximum and minimum balance consumption among all energy sources bias correction methods are necessary as using the data output from rcms directly to drive the hydrological model would result in greater deviations and uncertain results due to imperfect conceptualization discretization and spatial averaging within grids feddersen and andersen 2005 eutschbein and seibert 2012 prasanna 2016 investigated 29 performances of the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm using the cmip5 and the results showed that the original precipitation evaporation and sea surface temperature errors were up to 50 from the actual observed values and each model performed poorly however many studies neglected the bias correction process zheng et al 2018 piniewski et al 2018 muelchi et al 2021 besides even though bias correction was used in future climate variability before runoff projections from hydrological modelling the majority of bias correction methods can t correct the frequency of projected daily climate variability and the correction effect can t function effectively under extreme circumstances hay et al 2000 graham et al 2007 lenderink et al 2007 the quantile mapping qm a typical frequency correction can use cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the observed and projected climatic variables to form a bias correction function gudmundsson et al 2012 cannon et al 2015 guo et al 2019 the method holds that meteorological and hydrological data would have a relatively stable probability distribution function over a long time series and the simulated probability distribution should follow the observed probability distribution in a similar variation piani et al 2010 themeβl et al 2011 justine et al 2017 enayati et al 2021 climate variability affects various geological domains and could change the conditions of local and regional water circulation affecting the spatio temporal distribution of water resources in recent years many variability variabilities were observed in about 31 of annual runoff from 145 major rivers worldwide some of these rivers exhibited a rising tendency of up to 9 while others exhibited a falling tendency by up to 22 walling and fang 2003 it is worthy to mention that runoff from many major rivers in china has been reported to have decreased two important cases are the hai river basin and the yellow river basin wang et al 2010 bao et al 2012 feng et al 2016 similarly the frequency of flooding and drought has increased in these basins in recent years lindner et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 these geo hazards have caused severe damage to lives properties and ecosystems xu et al 2010 wang et al 2019 more recently the yellow river stage has decreased enormously affecting crop production and other economic activities li et al 2004 the luo river an important tributary of the yellow river has declined due to climate variability the lushi basin has become a hotspot for flood drought rainstorm continuous rain and other extreme weather events zhang et al 2003 wang 2011 jia 2020 several studies have been conducted to determine the causes and impacts of these geo hazards to provide some mitigation strategy for sustainable development for instance xing and zhang 2006 che et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 investigated the geological disasters caused by mineral exploitation and proposed its countermeasures gu and gu 2008 and mo 2018 analyzed the meteorological causes of the massive mountain floods and debris flow disasters therefore it is of great significance to understand the changing hydrological conditions and processes to ensure more comprehensive water and environmental management strategy in this study the hydrological parameters of the xaj model were calibrated and validated based on the hydrologic and meteorological time series data from 1976 to 2000 in the lushi basin also the projections of the future climate variability dataset 2021 2100 for 0 22 grids were explored under the cmip6 cordex east asia rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios these have proven to be adequate to determine the results of local climatic studies cook et al 2019 tokarska et al 2020 su et al 2021 furthermore we elucidated the qm method for correcting the bias of meteorological variables the hydrological model was also adopted to simulate the outcome of the climate variability on runoff in the 21st century the findings of this study can help expand the capability and applicability of cordex project and promote the ability of qm method in bias correction similarly the hydrological parameters of xaj model can be employed and transplanted to adjacent and similar basins the results of climate and runoff projection characteristics provide a strong basis for flood and drought mitigation and control plans in the short medium and long term use of water resources in the yellow river basin and can help make reliable projections on flooding events and support early warning systems in other similar basins 2 study area the catchment selected is the upper reach of the luo river which belongs to the yellow river system as illustrated in fig 1 a and b the study area lushi basin is located in north latitude 33 45 34 30 east longitude 109 40 110 10 encompassing an area of 4 562 km2 with an average annual streamflow of 25 97 m3 s during the period 1976 2000 the geomorphic type can be simply grouped into hills and lowlands elevation ranges from approximately 356 m to 2638 m above sea level fig 1c the study area is characterized by a warm temperate humid mountainous monsoon climate with abundant sunshine the annual temperature ranges between 12 1 c and 14 5 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 850 mm increasing from 500 mm in the north west to 1100 mm or more in the south east 50 60 of the precipitation occurs mainly from july to october with the format of a rainstorm and 20 30 occurs between march and june large scale flooding events typically occur between july and october these floods were usually caused by intense widespread precipitation on the other hand low river runoff in the remaining months often leads to droughts there are two hydrometric stations and seven meteorological stations as shown in fig 1c in which a representative lushi hydrometric station is located at the outlet of the catchment the maximum precipitation reported is 1459 8 mm shimenyu station and the minimum precipitation is 447 4 mm lingkou station the average annual evaporation is 1001 mm the non frost season is around 182 245 days the basin is covered by a network of rivers including luo river wuguan river and 17 other large rivers as well many small tributaries the flow directions of surface water phreatic groundwater and confined groundwater are controlled by the regional topography all heading in similar directions from north west to south east and discharging into the luo river the river gradient is greater than 7 8 in shanxi province and decreasing to about 2 3 in henan province yang et al 2003 shu et al 2008 3 methods 3 1 trend definition and abrupt changes detection trend definitions have received considerable interest recently in hydrological meteorological water quality etc the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 sen s slope sen 1968 linear regression trend haan 1977 tests are widely implemented for trend detection as the mk is a typically non parametric statistical procedure for trend possibility identification which considers outliers and accepts independent data it has been commonly used on hydro meteorological data analysis silva et al 2015 in this method the kendall sum statistic s is given as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i the differences between each sequential value are calculated so as to depict increasing 1 decreasing 1 and neutral 0 signs which is defined as 2 sgn x j x i 1 0 1 xj x i 0 xj x i 0 xj x i 0 where xj and xi are time series values at jth and ith time instances in n observations there is a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend in the series which depends on the value of s 0 or s 0 when n 8 the statistic s has a normal distribution with the following mean and variance 3 e s 0 4 v s n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 g t p t p 1 2 t p 5 18 where g is the number of tied groups tp is the number of observations in the pth group if there is no dependence then v s can be expressed as 5 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 finally the mk test statistic zc is calculated as 6 z c s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 the trend is considered insignificant if z 1 α 0 2 z c z 1 α 0 2 but significant if z c z 1 α 0 2 decreasing and z c z 1 α 0 2 increasing α 0 is the confidence level α 0 5 the mk test is also suitable to detect abrupt changes in time series of anomalies that are independent and gaussian distributed assume that the hydrological series is in a progressive sequence x 1 x 2 x 3 xn for a given sample size n the accumulated total of values xj smaller than xi for j i up to i is denoted as mi the sum of the first of these terms is the rank statistic dk and its mean and variance can be expressed as 7 d k i 1 k m i 2 k n 8 e d k k k 1 4 9 v d k k k 1 2 k 5 72 2 k n the sum is standardized to a normal

series but with the retrograde sequence and yields ubk an abrupt change is initiated at the intersection of ufk and ubk 3 2 regional climate model regarding the contribution to cmip6 many gcms were developed by leading climate modeling centers in the world including europe america and asia these models generally provide experimental global climate simulations with relatively coarse spatiotemporal resolution model output is usually monthly for a grid cell distance of 2 5 however each modeling center has its own simulation purposes and is very much dependent on computational capability the models therefore might be different in terms of physical parameterization time slice and spatiotemporal resolution the meteorological data needs to go through statistical and dynamic downscaling to meet the accuracy requirements for designated research areas rcms based on cordex project are currently considered one of the most advanced dynamic downscaling methods that reproduce the past present and future climate patterns with high confidence for most scenarios thomson et al 2011 riahi et al 2011 there is great evidence from several studies showing that the rcms can describe different types of underlying surface and regional physical characteristics which have better accuracy and have been applied to north america central asia south asia east asia and other regions sanjay et al 2017 li et al 2018 stanzel and kling 2018 ganguli and coulibaly 2019 adeyeri et al 2019 the rcms divide east asia into 417 255 grids with a high spatial resolution of 0 22 0 22 approximately 25 km 25 km data is stored in the form of f x y z at each grid point where x y z represent longitude latitude time respectively and f represents the function value of precipitation evaporation or runoff the data series extractions were completed using the matlab software in addition this study assumes that precipitation obtained from rain gauges is referenced precipitation true precipitation and the evaporation is measured in an evaporating dish a stream gauge at the catchment outlet lushi station is used for a runoff simulation and variation assessment 3 3 hydrological model the xaj model has shown great capacity to simulate runoff especially for hydrologic station network design and water availability estimation zhao 1992 as presented in fig 2 the model structure generally shows that evapotranspiration et occurs in the top three soil layers similarly the actual evapotranspiration aet is estimated as a function of potential evapotranspiration pet and available soil moisture the xaj model uses a parabolic curve to describe the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture storage capacity and assumes that the runoff is not produced until the soil moisture storage reaches field capacity zhao et al 1992 cheng et al 2006 the generated runoff is separated into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater according to different free water storage structures the surface runoff directly flows into the river the interflow and groundwater are released slowly through a linear reservoir to river channels finally the muskingum routing equation is adopted to calculate the discharge at the watershed outlet bai et al 2017 detailed descriptions of model structures parameters and state variables can be found in fig 2 and table 1 despite being a conceptual lumped model the xaj model has many parameters that require calibration table 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse multi year mean relative error er and qualification rate qr were selected as evaluation indexes for model simulation the description of the formulas is provided in the supporting information nse describes the coincidence degree between the predicted process and the measured observation the smaller the absolute value of er is the smaller error between measured and predicted runoff is runoff prediction takes the measured value less than 20 0 as the allowable error if the error of the primary prediction is less than the allowable error it is a qualified prediction 3 4 bias correction of climate model data errors may increase between rcms outputs and the historical observations of the same period due to a couple of reasons including the collection of data from different sources spatial resolution underlying surface information and parameterization schemes as well as the error of the model itself teutschbein and seibert 2012 wood et al 2004 feddersen and andersen 2005 and hagemann et al 2011 noted that applying outputs directly from rcms to hydrological studies without any bias correction would amplify data biases leading to more uncertainty several different bias correction techniques are available which aim at eliminating errors in the climate model data when compared against historical observations hellström and chen 2003 teutschbein et al 2011 johnson and sharma 2012 kling et al 2012 fowler et al 2015 in this work we considered the well established non parametric qm method for bias correction to keep the analysis precise the qm method effectively avoids the defect of the delta change method dca linear scaling method ls etc which are difficult to be applied to the processing of daily scale data and cannot have applicability of error in probability distribution baigorria et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the qm bias correction method considers that historical and predicted values under climate variability scenarios should be consistent in the frequency distribution firstly the cdf should be calculated the predicted and historical data should be divided into 100 intervals and ranked in an ascending order the sequence in the modeling period is then applied to calculate the probability density function pdf of each grid point in the interpolation of the predicted and historical values respectively the calculation is expressed as follows 11 p d f x a b f x d x 12 cdf x 0 xp pdf x d x where x is the historical data pdf x is the probability density function of x in a b cdf x is the cumulative probability distribution function when x is less than a certain threshold xp when xp is the maximum cdf x equals to 1 secondly the transfer function tf x has to be established the bias of normal and extrema should be segmented by a probability threshold and revised accordingly as it would reflect poorly on the extremum if the entire sequence be performed directly consequently the bias correction parameters can be used to construct the tf x for the entire data series theoretically the revised cdf would be the same as the historical series the mathematical model can be expressed as 13 tf x a 0 x x x 95 t h a 0 a 1 2 x x 95 t h x x 98 t h a 1 x x x 98 t h 14 c d f h i s tf x c f d p r e x where x 95th and x 98th are x in the 95th and 98th quartile a 0 and a 1 represent the correction coefficients of less than 95 and more than 98 respectively cdf his and cdf pre represent the cdf of historical and predicted data thirdly tf x of the modeling period could be used to revise the predicted value in the validation period grid by the grid as the formula of 15 and finally the correction results of the whole basin can be obtained 15 xcor t f x p r e where x cor is the corrected value and xpre is the predicted value the accuracy of the qm in the various configurations presented above was evaluated via the calculation of the deviations predicted observed and using statistical indices rbias and rrmse the formulas of quantitative statistical criteria can be found in the supporting information 4 data sources the required inputs to the hydrological model are daily values of precipitation and evaporation meanwhile the observed streamflow data was obtained for calibration and validation the following sections discuss the preparation of these data for predictions under historical conditions and bias corrected climate scenarios 4 1 historical data 4 1 1 trend analysis the annual precipitation and streamflow series and their mk test results are shown in table 2 for precipitation it can be seen that there is a slight increasing trend in the lushi and maping stations with mk test zc value of 0 397 and 0 300 and a less prominent decreasing trend in the remaining stations decadal variability of precipitation indicated that there was a most obvious drought period for the basin during 1976 2000 for streamflow there was a significant increasing trend in the lushi station with mk test zc value of 1 57 while essentially no decreasing trend in the lingkou station with mk test zc value of 0 09 4 1 2 abrupt change analysis change points of the precipitation and streamflow were also investigated in this study and the results are shown in fig 3 a and b and fig 4 a and b for precipitation there was no obvious abrupt change point while a declining trend was exhibited since 1985 unlike precipitation the annual streamflow series in the lingkou and lushi stations both had intersection points in 1978 and 1995 whereas the intersection point in 1978 was located at the front of the sequence which was not sufficient to determine if it made sense therefore there was an abrupt change that occurred in 1995 table 3 shows the statistical characteristic of average annual precipitation evaporation and streamflow under the historical climate at nine stations observed streamflow fluctuated slightly at the same station each year exhibiting a declining growth trend however it showed an increasing trend along the direction of the luo river for example maping station is located in the upper reaches which had the smallest average annual streamflow in contrast lushi station had the greatest streamflow as it is situated in the drainage area there seemed to be an observable decrease in precipitation starting around 1995 except for shimenyu station similar conclusions applied for evaporation except for lingkou station 4 2 evaluation of rcm data with historical observations as mentioned above the precipitation was obtained from rain gauges undoubtedly it would cause a certain amount of rain loss including evaporation loss wetting loss micro precipitation and dynamic loss which caused the observed precipitation usually less than the actual value especially in high mountain areas as the observation accuracy of the standard rain gauge is 0 1 mm the micro precipitation with the output results of rcms less than 0 1 mm is regarded as a dry day similarly precipitation greater than 0 1 mm is considered as captured precipitation the feasible method was also verified by ye et al 2004 the comparison of average catchment values clearly shows that there is a considerable deviation between the rcm outputs and the observations table 4 compared to the observed precipitation in the same time series the deviation rate of maximum daily value decreased from 32 50 before bias correction to 4 29 after bias correction the maximum three day value decreased from 69 88 to 23 84 and the multi year average value decreased from 54 86 to 1 89 as well the seasonal comparison also decreased the deviation range of evaporation from the rcm output is not very wide but the data corrected is closer to the historical value when compared to the observed evaporation the deviation rate of maximum daily value decreased from 27 35 to 0 the maximum three day value decreased from 22 30 to 1 74 and the multi year average value decreased from 27 83 to 0 14 comparing the monthly variability with the direct outputs under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of the future periods with the historically observed values fig 5 and the cdfs of daily precipitation at nine stations fig s1 in the supporting information as the data comparison and correction process were too similar only the precipitation was taken as an example it can be seen that the biases are very strong the observed precipitation exhibits seasonality but there have been difficulties in reproducing this observed pattern under scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the historical precipitation peaked in july and gradually attenuated from the peak to both sides and the minimum value appeared from december to january under rcp2 6 the maximum value occurred in august or september more importantly the predicted precipitation is almost above the observation during the entire year under rcp8 5 the trend of change is different from the historical value and it is overestimated in the early stage and undervalued in the later stage the two scenarios over estimate precipitation from january to june the future trends of the two scenarios from 2020 to 2100 fig 6 are also very different from those of historical observations precipitation output for both climate scenarios is generally higher than historical values the reason is that there is a great deviation in the frequency distribution of precipitation of various intensities from fig 5 in monthly and fig 6 in yearly it is clear that the data of two climate scenarios cannot be applied for hydrological modelling without bias correction therefore the frequency distribution of rcm data needs to be reasonably revised for evaluation of rcm data it has to be considered that due to the randomness in weather one cannot directly compare the time series of rcm simulations with historical observations however long term properties such as empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf should be similar between the two in the correction process by qm the first half of the simulation period 1991 1995 was used as the reference period to establish the tf x and the latter period 1996 2000 was used for revision for precipitation and evaporation simulations undertaken we compared both the estimates against the daily observations and the estimates corrected with the qm against the daily observations as shown in fig 7 a and b the relative precipitation bias improved markedly from 39 before qm correction to 2 5 after qm correction the qm correction is effective for intensities less than 0 2 i e about 99 of precipitation the ecdf of the corrected evaporation shows better agreement with the observations than the ecdf of evaporation before qm correction indeed the relative bias is improved from 134 8 to 2 2 for intensities smaller than 0 8 the qm correction shows very good results it also can be seen in fig 8 a and b the difference between pre and post revision data and daily historical values the closer the simulated value is to the historical value the closer the circle should be to the line with the slope of 1 1 conversely if the bias between the simulated and the historical value is larger the circle is further away from the 1 1 line there is no doubt that the corrected data are all near the 1 1 line while the data before bias correction shows different degrees of deviation taylor diagram taylor 2001 frequently serves as the primary tool to evaluate the accuracy of different models scatter points represent the models radiation lines represent the standard correlation coefficient scor and horizontal and vertical axes represent standard deviation sd as well the dashed lines represent standard root mean square error srmse the principle of taylor diagram and its related formulas have been expressed in the supporting information sd indicates the ability of the model to simulate the central amplitude the closer the sd is to 1 the better the simulation ability the srmse is the distance between the observation and the simulation and is represented in fig 9 as a dotted black semi arc with the ref point as the center it has been normalized and its semicircle radius only goes to 1 the correction effect is accurate when the point is infinitely close to ref the scor is determined by the azimuth position of the model when the model simulation results are consistent with the observed values the closer the model points are to the observation points in the x axis from fig 9 a and b the effect of bias correction can be seen more clearly before bias correction the scor of the seasonal precipitation and evaporation simulations is below 0 6 after bias correction scor is significantly enhanced even close to 1 in autumn the rmse after bias correction is also closer to ref point in four seasons than that of before bias correction and it is closer to 1 in winter it shows that the effect after bias correction is better than before besides the values of the four seasons also hover around 1 compared with the sd before bias correction given all that the transfer function established this time is appropriate the qm method is efficient and the simulations have been significantly improved in both spatial distribution and absolute value as well the simulated data after bias correction could be used to run a hydrological model 5 results and discussion 5 1 historical simulation 5 1 1 calibration of the hydrological model observed daily streamflow from january 1 1976 to december 31 1995 were used to calibrate the parameters of the hydrological model the remaining data from january 1 1996 to december 31 2000 were used to validate the model s performance individual stations based on the thiessen polygon method were assigned to the hydrological response units of the hydrological model to obtain a temporal pattern fig 1c those hydrological response units were used to impose a spatial pattern within a sub basin on the temporal pattern of the precipitation and evaporation this ensured that the complex local effects of orographic meteorological patterns in the ridges and gullies were correctly preserved the specific geographical location elevation sub watershed area weight of each station and its control area as well as the statistical characteristic of average annual precipitation evaporation and streamflow under historical climate are shown in table 3 the parameters were calibrated separately on a sub basin level from upstream to downstream the sensitivity of various parameters was analyzed and presented in table 1 definition of these calibration parameters and their minimum and maximum thresholds were detailed and introduced by zhao 1983 among them evapotranspiration directly affects the calculation of the flow yield in which the k is the most influential parameter and controls the water balance and k 0 97 satisfied the minimum error of water balance calibration as the c has little influence on the model results and is an insensitive factor 0 15 was selected as the empirical value ahirwar et al 2018 based on the analysis of the original hydrologic data and the underlying surface of the basin after selecting and optimizing within the empirical ranges it was determined that wm is 136 mm wum is 14 mm and wlm is 52 mm yuan et al 2018 guan et al 2020 hu et al 2021 the value of nse was the largest and er was smallest when b selected 0 35 imp value picked 0 02 this time as the study area is located in the upper reaches and has little influence from human activities beyond that other parameters including insensitivity and sensitivity have been described in table 1 through continuous manual optimization 5 1 2 validation of the hydrological model the comparison of observed and predicted annual streamflow for the calibration and validation periods has shown in table 5 it can be seen that the prediction errors were within 20 a maximum of 16 26 appeared in 1976 whereas 84 of this indicator fluctuated within 10 the peak accuracy error only reached 17 08 in 1976 and 92 were within 11 for the calibration and validation periods the value of nse were 0 90 and 0 88 and the absolute value of er always fluctuated within 20 respectively table 6 fig 10 showed that the model performed well against the daily streamflow the nse and er were 87 78 6 23 87 63 and 4 24 in the calibration and validation respectively besides the qr performs better in calibration 90 than that in validation 80 all of them are considerably acceptable thus the xaj hydrological model established can depict the water cycle process and provide a basis for analyzing runoff evolution and the effects of climate variability on runoff in this typical region 5 2 simulation under climate scenarios 5 2 1 variability of precipitation the monthly and yearly average variation under the observation 1976 2000 projected periods 2020 2100 by revised rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the nine gauging stations were plotted on the same chart as shown in fig s2 a and b of the supporting information each hydrological station s average monthly variation trend is basically similar under the three conditions the rcp8 5 is higher than the historical value in the former six months and lower in the latter half of the year whereas the variation trend in rcp2 6 is closer to the historical value trend lines were added to the multi year average annual precipitation maps to facilitate the variation of historical and projected periods as shown in fig s2b it is observed that although the average annual precipitation fluctuates up and down to different degrees it is undeniable that both the historical and predicted precipitation under the two scenarios show different degrees of attenuation a summary of historical precipitation in the contributing catchments for the observed period and its changes during the projected periods compared to the observation is presented in table 7 it can be observed that the historical precipitation exhibits a decreasing trend from 1976 to 2000 with average annual precipitation decreasing by 2 from 679 25 mm to 665 67 mm projected periods are 7 22 under rcp2 6 and 5 01 under rcp8 5 lower than historical data which decreased to 637 00 mm and 645 22 mm at lushi station the contributing catchment has the lowest precipitation area with an annual historical average precipitation of 594 70 mm the projected period is 2 under rcp2 6 and 1 under rcp8 5 decreasing into 570 91 mm and 588 76 mm respectively the mutonggou station another low precipitation part of the catchment experienced the highest precipitation reduction 5 under rcp2 6 and 4 under rcp8 5 the contributing catchment at maping and guanpo stations belong to the high precipitation parts with historical and predicted average annual precipitations under the two scenarios of 752 51 mm to 722 41 mm and 729 94 mm and 774 35 mm to 766 60 mm and 758 86 mm at shimenyu sangping and lingkou stations reduction has projected both scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 for instance projections for scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 indicate 90th percentile precipitation reduction by 13 9 13 and 15 12 9 50th percentile precipitation reduction by 9 11 8 and 13 5 10 and 10th percentile precipitation decrease by 6 15 14 and 3 6 10 hence during the 21st century all high medium and low precipitations in these catchments are expected to decrease compared to that of the observed past under both scenarios at boyusi and sanyao stations under scenario rcp8 5 the 50th percentiles of precipitation are projected to reduce by 9 and 10 respectively while the 90th percentile are projected to increase by 4 and 5 resulting in an overall 1 increase of precipitation 5 2 2 variability of evaporation the historical period and projected average monthly and yearly evaporation for the 21st century at nine stations are presented in fig s3 a and b of the supporting information details of variability for contributing catchment at nine stations for observed and projected periods are also presented in table 7 the variation trend of evaporation is significantly smaller than that of precipitation whether monthly or yearly the average monthly evaporation under the two scenarios is in good agreement with the historical value however there is a remarkable difference in the average annual variation despite the gradual upward trend the growth trend of rcp8 5 is gentler than that of rcp2 6 the historical evaporation exhibits a decreasing trend from 1976 to 2000 by 2 07 from 990 79 mm to 970 21 mm in contrast projected periods are 2 03 and 3 58 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 higher than historical data which increased to 1010 90 mm and 1026 26 mm at sanyao and shimenyu stations under the future climate scenarios there are having the highest average annual evaporation coefficient in the study area at 3 and 2 under the historical climate the 90th percentile evaporation increased by 5 1 and 1 2 and 50th percentile evaporation increased by 3 1 and 1 1 respectively several stations including maping sangping boyusi lingkou and guanpo stations have almost the same trend of average annual evaporation for example except for the slight ascent of 1 and 2 at lingkou station the average annual evaporation increases for the remaining sites are 2 and 1 under the two scenarios at guanpo station the 90th percentile evaporation falls to 5 and 4 the largest lift in the area at mutonggou and lushi stations the average annual evaporation under the projected climates is simultaneously rising by 1 of that upper the historical climate in contrast the 90th and 50th percentile evaporation increased to varying degrees while only the 10th percentile of evaporation decreased 5 2 3 variability of projected runoff the hydrological model was applied with the bias correction data to simulate runoff conditions under future climate scenarios as shown in fig 11 the xaj model results of runoff were considered for comparative analysis of observed runoff with projection periods short term 2021 2040 mid term 2051 2070 long term 2081 2100 under both climate scenarios changes in average annual distribution are presented in fig 12 for all future periods under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 both climate scenarios produced a drastically decrease which is mainly due to a projected moderate decrease in precipitation with a varied range of 9 3 to 77 4 including short term by 9 3 and 31 2 mid term by 31 5 and 41 2 and long term by 32 3 and 77 4 undoubtedly the decreasing trend of runoff under rcp2 6 climate scenario 9 3 32 3 is smaller than that under rcp8 5 climate scenario 31 2 77 4 and such a trend tends to be incomparably stable in the mid term and long term the quantitative evaluation of average monthly runoff variation relative to the baseline period is presented in fig 13 a and c in the short term projection of under rcp2 6 fig 13a the runoff generation depicts a similar behavior to those observed in the baseline period except for a slower acclivity towards the uptrend while there is a slight downward trend since september due to the late withdrawal of the wet period inversely under rcp8 5 the runoff increased significantly 150 200 in spring compared with the baseline period while there is a recession about 70 in summer and autumn this is perhaps due to the increased precipitation rate over time with the corresponding increment in evaporation during the mid term projection fig 13b the runoff in spring and winter has a slightly increasing trend by 30 under rcp2 6 and a significant increase of 140 under rcp8 5 whereas a moderately decreasing appeared 50 80 in summer and autumn it indicates that there will be significant changes in the middle of the 21st century with a considerable runoff reduction during the wet season and an increasing trend during the dry period during the long term projection all monthly runoff is projected to fall significantly under the two scenarios fig 13c with the largest average annual flow reduction of around 55 in july under rcp2 6 and 93 in october under rcp8 5 there is a tendency that climate variability will cause impacts on the runoff regimes toward a decline in summer and autumn and a longer duration of low runoff which implies that the risk of water shortage would be faced in the late 21st century historical and projected streamflow frequency distribution curves of the wet period july to october and dry period november to june in the 21st century are presented in fig 14 a and b it can be seen that the frequency of the same floods falls significantly relative to the baseline period in the wet period fig 14a the extreme value of streamflow in the wet period under rcp2 6 is changing significantly compared with the baseline period 405 m3 s in the baseline period and 390 m3 s under rcp2 6 while the extreme streamflow under rcp8 5 decreased significantly 237 m3 s however in the dry period fig 14b the occurrence frequency of floods of the same size is projected to reduce relative to the baseline period but the extreme value of the streamflow is projected to increase in varying degrees 45 6 m3 s in the baseline period 76 5 m3 s under rcp2 6 and 84 6 m3 s under rcp8 5 projections of extreme streamflow changes indicate further complexity for the 21st century in the wet period table 8 the reductions of 95th 90th 10th 5th and 1st percentile of extreme streamflow under the historical observation and rcp2 6 scenario are 31 02 38 22 73 58 72 97 and 68 75 from 213 7 m3 s to 147 4 m3 s 126 9 m3 s to 78 4 m3 s 5 3 m3 s to 1 4 m3 s 3 7 m3 s to 1 0 m3 s and 1 6 m3 s to 0 5 m3 s respectively while the 99th percentile of extreme streamflow increased by around 0 12 from 415 9 m3 s to 416 4 m3 s similarly the reductions of 95th 90th 10th 5th and 1st percentile of extreme streamflow under the historical observation and rcp8 5 scenario are 66 50 70 69 88 68 89 19 and 87 50 from 213 7 m3 s to 71 6 m3 s 126 9 m3 s to 37 2 m3 s 5 3 m3 s to 0 6 m3 s 3 7 m3 s to 0 4 m3 s and 1 6 m3 s to 0 2 m3 s respectively unlike the rcp2 6 scenario the 99th percentile of extreme streamflow also decreases from 415 9 m3 s to 247 9 m3 s with 40 39 during the dry period all extreme streamflow are projected to rise significantly in the 99th 95th and 90th percentiles under scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the 99th percentile by 69 23 and 90 38 the 95th percentile by 36 87 and 58 99 and 27 97 and 50 35 nonetheless all extreme streamflow is projected to fall in the 10th percentile 5th percentile and 1st percentile the 10th percentile by 46 67 and 60 00 the 5th percentile by 57 14 and 71 43 the 1st percentile by 63 64 and 81 82 the overwhelming majority of extreme streamflow in wet period in the 21st century is smaller than that in the baseline period while only half of the extreme streamflow in the dry season is larger than that in the baseline period it indicates that the streamflow distribution will change greatly in the future and the basin will face some water shortage risks in the late 21st century the decadal moving average can measure the variability trends over a long period fig 15 a and c are ten year moving average curves of precipitation evaporation and runoff between historical and future periods the trend of precipitation is decreasing in both historical periods and two climate scenarios evaporation in the historical period has a decreasing trend while it has an increasing trend under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 except for a trend change in the middle of the 21st century about 2060 s the historical runoff as a whole shows a downward trend so as the predictions however through the cumulative departure curves of the streamflow in the historical period and the two scenarios fig 16 it is evident that rcp2 6 shows a decline while rcp8 5 is continuously rising in the middle of the 21st century it shows that the rcp8 5 scenario based on the assumption that carbon dioxide concentration in the air will be 3 4 times higher than before the industrial revolution by 2100 and no engage in active suppression by humans is difficult to achieve as water resources managers and policy makers are interested in knowing about climate variability s impact on precipitation evaporation and runoff in the longer term interannual and monthly variations presented here could be used to meet the needs to develop tools that would be useful for planning future water resources 6 conclusions in this study future climate and runoff projection characteristics of lushi basin were determined the work applies the xaj hydrological model which was calibrated and validated using daily observed precipitation evaporation and runoff data from 1976 to 2000 obtained from nine gauging stations the projections of the future climate variability dataset 2021 2100 were explored under the cmip6 cordex rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios furthermore the non parametric qm bias correction method was effectively used to minimize the large differences between climate variability directly derived from rcm and the historical observations the projections will be useful for water resources planning and management and mitigating and planning for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods the key findings are summarized as follows 1 scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 were chosen as they are the more likely scenarios that keep the maximum and minimum balance consumption among all energy sources the qm method effectively consisted of the historical and predicted values in a similar frequency distribution after bias correction the predicted average annual precipitation was found to decrease against the baseline by about 7 22 and 5 01 while the average annual evaporation was found to increase by 2 03 and 3 58 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the 21st century 2 within the 21st century projections of average annual runoff of the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios exhibited a decreasing trend the short term period is estimated at 9 3 and 31 2 the mid term at 31 5 and 41 2 and the long term at 32 3 and 77 4 respectively during the short term period the runoff increases significantly 150 200 in spring under rcp8 5 and there is congruity with those observed in the baseline period under rcp2 6 during the mid term the runoff slightly increased during the spring and winter seasons by 30 under rcp2 6 and a significant increase of 140 was observed under rcp8 5 as for the summer and autumn periods only a moderate decrease was observed 50 80 during the long term projection the largest average annual runoff was reduced by about 55 in july under rcp2 6 and 93 in october under rcp8 5 3 the extreme value of streamflow during the wet period slightly declined under rcp2 6 390 m3 s and decreased significantly under rcp8 5 237 m3 s compared with the baseline period 405 m3 s as for the dry period the extreme streamflow was found to increase in varying degrees 45 6 m3 s in the baseline period 76 5 m3 s under rcp2 6 and 84 6 m3 s under rcp8 5 the overwhelming majority of extreme streamflow in the wet period is smaller compared to the baseline period while only half of the extreme streamflow in the dry period is larger than the baseline period decadal moving averages show varying degrees of decline in precipitation and runoff except for evaporation they all indicate that the runoff distribution will change greatly in the future and the basin will face some water shortage risks in the late 21st century this study has used standard techniques and methods appropriate for regional scale assessments and provides plausible projections after effective qm bias correction to determine the impact of climate variability on water resources future research on impact assessments should focus on integrated approaches linking climate hydrology water resources and ecosystem models to sustain and improve the development of

2748,an often overlooked impact of rising sea levels is the concurrent rise in coastal groundwater tables which can result in subsurface inundation of below ground infrastructure this is an important consideration for rural coastal communities many of which rely on on site wastewater treatment systems owts subsurface inundation and flooding of owts leads to treatment performance issues potentially resulting in enhanced contaminant transport to coastal groundwater resources and the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge we use seawat to develop a variable density groundwater flow model for the groundwater system underlying a densely populated rural community on the north shore of nova scotia canada we then impose various climate change scenarios sea level rise changes in recharge to evaluate the risk of owts inundation from rising groundwater we find that under current conditions as many as 9 of owts in this small but densely populated watershed are either inundated or completely flooded this number that could grow to 27 of owts for the climate change scenario with the highest recharge and sea level rise as a secondary objective we track the location of the modeled saltwater freshwater interface and investigate the potential salinization of groundwater resources used for drinking water supply the modeled interface moved landward by 20 m and proved to be less of a concern than owts inundation except for shoreline dwellings we also use the modelling results to develop adaptation recommendations for owts installation regulations this research contributes to an increasing number of groundwater modelling studies focusing on the impacts of sea level rise on coastal subsurface infrastructure and provides important insight for rural coastal communities keywords groundwater table rise climate change impacts on groundwater subsurface infrastructure inundation submarine groundwater discharge coastal contamination saltwater intrusion data availability see supplementary section 1 introduction accelerating sea level rise slr is threatening coastal communities globally kulp and strauss 2019 oppenheimer et al 2019 for example in much of the us and canada sea levels are predicted to rise more than 1 m by 2100 oppenheimer et al 2019 james et al 2021 which poses new threats to coastal infrastructure and freshwater resources while the impacts of slr on land surface conditions e g coastal flooding and erosion are widely recognized less public attention has been placed on the unseen impacts of slr on groundwater quantity and quality michael et al 2017 currently more than 10 625 million people of the global population live in low elevation coastal zones defined as contiguous land along the coast within 10 m of mean sea level mcgranahan et al 2007 an estimate projected to nearly double by 2100 neumann et al 2015 these oceanic and human population projections provide the impetus for research focused on slr and the impacts to groundwater and coastal water

coastal zones sawyer et al 2016 consequently there are both seaward contaminated sgd and landward saltwater intrusion contamination processes that occur along the subsurface coastal transition zone

with a predominant focus on saltwater intrusion processes e g werner et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 for coastal aquifers with an unsaturated zone as sea level rises the groundwater table rises in unison which decreases the unsaturated zone thickness werner and simmons 2009 bjerklie et al 2012 rotzoll and fletcher 2013 water tables rising above desired levels is referred to as groundwater flooding which is of concern in areas with dense coastal populations as subsurface infrastructure e g foundations sewer networks water distribution pipes drains septic systems may be impacted by flooding or corrosion resulting in costly damages de almeida and mostafavi 2016 habel et al 2017 knott et al 2017 mckenzie et al 2021 unusually high tides and storm surges can compound the effects of slr propagating elevated sea levels through coastal aquifers and temporarily elevating groundwater tables by tens of centimeters mao et al 2006 in general coastal groundwater flooding can be caused by superimposed climate slr changes in recharge and anthropogenic coastal zone development changes that exacerbate existing threats to coastal infrastructure on site wastewater treatment systems owts often referred to as septic systems are uniquely threatened by slr cooper et al 2015 cox et al 2019 owts are common in rural or underdeveloped areas where municipal wastewater treatment services do not exist they function by distributing primary treated wastewater to a subsurface disposal field comprised of filter sand or native soils contaminants are treated by physical chemical and biological processes as the effluent flows through the disposal field adequate attenuation of many contaminants of concern relies on some prescribed depth of unsaturated sand soil materials cogger et al 1988 lusk et al 2017 for example when an owts becomes partially inundated there is a corresponding decrease in the removal of many microbial colloids such as e coli which are typically strained in the air portion of soil pores during unsaturated flow morales et al 2015 cox et al 2019 modern owts design standards e g nova scotia environment 2017 specify minimum separation distances between groundwater tables and the bottom of the owts drain field typically on the order of 1 m to ensure unsaturated flow however these guidelines do not account for potential groundwater table rise due to slr and typically do not apply to systems installed before the adoption of modern design standards in addition to long term persistent threats imposed by slr owts in low elevation coastal zones have been shown to become temporarily inundated during storm surges and high tides cox et al 2020 previous studies have modelled the projected impacts of slr on groundwater table elevation notably along the east and west coasts of the united states cox et al 2019 befus et al 2020 and bench scale experiments have been conducted to evaluate the impact of elevated water tables on owts performance cooper et al 2016 modelling studies have evaluated colloid filtration under changing climate scenarios morales et al 2015 while analytical studies and numerical simulations have been used to predict ground surface inundation with projected slr rotzoll and fletcher 2013 mckenzie et al 2021 however in general much of the past slr modelling research in the broader coastal zone research field has focused on ground surface inundation and only a few studies have employed the use of groundwater flow models to predict groundwater table dynamics under changing marine conditions to our knowledge no 3d variable density groundwater modelling studies have evaluated the impact of slr on owts inundation anywhere globally further no studies focused on slr and owts performance have been conducted in canada which has the world s longest coastline and is characterized by some of the highest projected slr rates globally e g atlantic canada james et al 2021 and high rates 50 in some provinces of owts use nova scotia environment 2013 in the present study we use a variable density groundwater flow and solute salt transport model to investigate the impact of slr on groundwater table elevation and owts inundation in a rural but densely populated coastal community in eastern canada that relies on both owts and residential water supply wells our primary objectives were to 1 evaluate the impact of various slr and groundwater recharge scenarios on groundwater table elevation at our study site 2 assess owts inundation under these same corresponding groundwater table elevations based on the distribution of residential dwellings and 3 propose new considerations for owts guidelines to proactively design future systems with climate change in mind as a secondary objective we also investigate potential saltwater intrusion subsurface saltwater freshwater interface movement due to climate change and consider the implications for groundwater resources 2 study site our study site is located on the north shore of the province of nova scotia canada approximately 150 km north of the city of halifax fig 1 this site was selected due to recent indicators of coastal contaminant transport from owts threndyle et al 2022 this area primarily consists of farmland forests a provincial park and rural residential properties close to the coast fig 1 nova scotia department of natural resources and renewables 2021a b the park includes an upland area a forested area and a wetland complex nearer the ocean the region is underlain by sedimentary bedrock that is part of the pictou group and includes the cape john and tatamagouche formations ryan 1985 these formations consist of primarily interbedded sandstones and mudstones with groundwater flow taking place via intergranular flow and along fractures and bedding planes hennigar 1968 rivard et al 2008 overburden material consists primarily of 0 6 to 10 m of coarse to fine grained glacial tills the shoreline along the northumberland strait is a public sandy beach frequented during the summer months the beach has a tidal range of 2 5 m and is a relatively low energy wave environment the climate is typical of southeastern canada with mean daily air temperatures ranging from 19 c during the summer to 3 c in the winter government of canada 2021 eccc station 8205774 the region receives close to 1000 mm of precipitation annually with recharge to the underlying bedrock estimated to range between 180 and 220 mm year based on analysis of baseflow data kennedy et al 2010 government of canada 2021 eccc station 8205774 the provincial park is surrounded by private cottages and residential properties all of which rely on owts for wastewater treatment and groundwater wells for drinking water fig 1 a recent provincial gis based analysis classified this region as a mid high risk zone for saltwater intrusion kennedy 2012 but no process based modeling of coastal groundwater processes has been conducted for this site field observations and gis analysis indicate that many of these properties are within meters of the current high water mark suggesting their owts could already be threatened during high tides and storm surges current owts standards for nova scotia nova scotia environment 2013 indicate that many of these systems should be raised or at grade based on soil permeability and water table position however some of the older properties in the area were constructed prior to 1975 when on site sewage disposal system regulations first came into effect province of nova scotia 1975 previous research using conventional and novel crassphage fecal indicators measured in submarine groundwater discharge and in coastal waters indicated that owts at this site are likely already contributing contaminants into the ocean threndyle et al 2022 making the study of elevated groundwater tables in this region specifically intriguing 3 methods and data 3 1 data sources data for model development and calibration were collected from provincial online databases regional reports and multiple field campaigns in the study area the horizontal extents of the model domain are informed by watershed divides which were assumed to represent groundwater divides anderson et al 2015 pp 35 and the vertical extent is based on the maximum depth of 34 available borehole logs from the nova scotia groundwater atlas nova scotia department of natural resources and renewables 2021a b ground surface elevation 1 m horizontal resolution 0 1 m vertical resolution was downloaded from the geonova provincial lidar database digital elevation model and was combined with offshore ocean floor elevation data from the canadian hydrographic service s non navigational bathymetric database nova scotia geonova 2020 fisheries and oceans canada 2020 owts locations were inferred from residential property locations downloaded from the nova scotia geographic data directory nova scotia department of internal services 2021a b and assumed to be collocated with the property id s coordinates groundwater head and sea level data e g horizontal hydraulic gradients and tidal fluctuations were recorded during multiple field campaigns and through continuous data logging of four piezometers and a tidal logger fig 1 as described in more detail in threndyle et al 2022 hydrogeological parameters used in the model were estimated from literature including local sources hennigar 1968 and pumping tests and adjusted within constraints during model calibration 3 2 overview of numerical model of groundwater flow and solute transport the visual modflow flex interface waterloo hydrogeologic waterloo on canada was used to develop and run the groundwater flow simulations using the variable density coupled groundwater flow and solute transport code seawat guo and langevin 2002 visual modflow flex provides a graphical user interface to parameterize a gridded model domain on a cell by cell basis and assign boundary and initial conditions seawat effectively links modflow groundwater flow and mt3dms solute transport bedekar et al 2016 and is commonly applied in coastal groundwater studies langevin et al 2008 to account for coupled solute salt transport variable density flow and related saltwater freshwater dynamics that occur in the coastal zone the groundwater flow engine employed by this version of seawat is modflow 2000 which is a saturated zone model the elevation of the groundwater table is taken as the hydraulic head in the uppermost active grid cell changes to groundwater storage due to water table fluctuations specific yield are accounted for in the layer with the water table modflow has been employed to evaluate coastal groundwater table dynamics in previous studies habel et al 2017 sukop et al 2018 befus et al 2020 we advance beyond many prior coastal groundwater table studies by also including seawat given our desire to represent the freshwater saltwater interface and its influence on coastal groundwater discharge patterns under present and future climate conditions 3 3 geological model well logs from the nova scotia groundwater atlas were used in combination with field data to create a representative geologic model using leapfrog software seequent limited christchurch new zealand this tool uses imported borehole data and interpolates contact surfaces between associated units before creating 3d volumes representing the different bedrock units modelled stratigraphy is shown in fig 2 the surficial geology is represented in the model as fine grained glacial till which was also observed during our piezometer installation the underlying sandstone and shale units were interpreted from borehole data from the nova scotia groundwater atlas nova scotia department of mines 2021 borehole information was simplified to generate a reasonable number of units to accurately represent groundwater flow in the model the digital leapfrog file is included as supplementary material s 1 3 4 model grid leapfrog was also used to discretize the model domain which was imported into visual modflow flex our grid consists of cells that are 20 m wide longshore by 40 m long cross shore fining down to 20 m wide by 10 m long near the saltwater freshwater interface grid refinement around the interface was required to enable model convergence where solute concentration gradients were high our model has 14 layers spaced closer together near the ground surface 3 m vertical thickness and further apart at depth 6 m thickness the model base is 63 m below present sea level which corresponds to the depth of the deepest geologic information in the available well logs 3 5 boundary conditions the model sides and bottom boundaries were set as no flow conditions fig 2 in accordance with expected groundwater divides along the sides regional watershed and predominantly horizontal flow at depth anderson et al 2015 pp 148 a recharge boundary condition with constant freshwater flux was applied across the land surface of the domain with the recharge flux initially informed by reported baseflow data kennedy et al 2010 drain boundaries were assigned to swamps streams and agricultural drains across the site the swamps had leakance values of 50 day m 1 and the agricultural drains and streams had leakance values of 25 and 50 day 1 respectively the top layer of the portion of the model representing the ocean was assigned a constant head and constant concentration boundary corresponding to measured mean sea level at the site and seawater concentration 32 000 mg l of dissolved salts respectively hussain 2015 to evaluate potential impacts of the vertical no flow boundary at the seaward extent of the model fig 2 we ran an additional simulation with this boundary converted to a constant head boundary at the same head as the nodes at the base of the ocean strait minimal change was observed results not shown as only 0 3 of the surface layer experienced a change in water table elevation that was 1 cm or greater also the location of the saltwater freshwater interface did not appreciably change which suggests that our default vertical offshore boundary is located sufficiently offshore to reasonably impose a no flow condition additionally the effect of variable density flow conditions on the water table elevations was considered by turning off the variable density dynamics as discussed more later when modelling climate change scenarios the ocean boundary condition specified head was raised at a constant rate in transient simulations between 2020 and 2100 such that the 2100 sea level was in accordance with ensemble slr projections downscaled to the site james et al 2021 slr rates for rcp4 5 and 8 5 at the 5th and 95th percentiles were used to inform the slr rates imposed in the modeled climate scenarios table 1 in two runs r4 1 and r4 2 with the highest slr the recharge boundary condition was also adjusted in equal intervals every 20 years future recharge rates were considered to investigate the sensitivity of the groundwater table dynamics to paired changes in sea level and recharge future recharge rates were obtained from future local precipitation projections lines et al 2006 by invoking the simplifying assumption that the recharge precipitation ratio remains constant as future recharge estimates are highly variable and uncertain even in terms of the direction of change kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 we have modelled a high and low recharge scenario with changes in recharge equal in magnitude but opposite in direction 39 mm year change table 1 the influence of tides was ignored in this study as our purpose was to study long term changes in groundwater table elevations and the potential impacts to fresh submarine groundwater discharge flowing under owts rather than recirculated submarine groundwater discharge leroux et al 2021 3 6 initial conditions initial groundwater heads were assigned to match observed mean annual heads in the installed piezometers fig 1 a model simulation of 50 years was run repeatedly to allow groundwater flow to reach steady state and model parameters were continuously adjusted until calculated and observed head conditions agreed hydraulic conductivity of the overburden shale and sandstone units were initially estimated based on literature values rivard et al 2008 and field measurements and then adjusted within limits during calibration rivers swamps and farms drains which were delineated from aerial imagery of the site were included in the model as drain boundary conditions to better represent surface drainage the default recharge boundary condition 165 mm year table 1 at the terrestrial surface was determined by adjusting the value in small increments to help match calculated and observed head data following calibration a 50 year model spin up period was employed to allow the saltwater freshwater interface to reach steady state before any climate change forcing was introduced a block of saltwater 32 000 mg l was imposed vertically below the constant head sea level boundary to the bottom of the model domain to decrease the time needed for the saltwater freshwater interface to reach steady state conditions attempts were made to calibrate the wedge location to collected local time domain electromagnetic walktem abem geophysical data following pavlovskii et al 2022 but interpretation was challenging due to the stratigraphic changes that obscured resistivity changes due to porewater salinity difficulty locating an onshore saltwater freshwater interface was further validated in our model results that indicated an offshore wedge location fig 6 3 7 transient runs and post processing calibrated steady state groundwater head and salt concentration distributions were used as initial conditions to run six transient climate change scenarios table 1 groundwater table elevation data for each model grid cell was exported from visual modflow flex at various timesteps and imported into arcgis pro to evaluate the impact on residential properties and associated owts the model ground surface raster was subtracted from the groundwater table elevation raster to reveal the depth to the groundwater table and areas of ground surface flooding for each climate change scenario fig 3 there are 472 septic systems in the modelling domain one for each property id reported by the province fig 1 inundation for each septic system was evaluated based on the depth to groundwater in the grid cell corresponding to the location of the septic system we assumed the bottom of the drain field unsaturated zone of each septic system was 1 6 m below ground surface as is required by provincial guidelines for septic systems to ensure adequate filtration of wastewater nova scotia environment 2013 any location where the simulated water table was within 1 6 m of the ground surface was considered inundated and any location where the simulated groundwater table was above the ground surface was considered flooded seawater tds concentration including the location of the saltwater freshwater interface was visualised using postprocessing capabilities in visual modflow flex a 50 concentration line 16 000 mg l was plotted along a designated column of cells for calibrated initial conditions and the transient climate chance scenarios saltwater intrusion was investigated and quantified by the landward movement of this modeled interface isoconcentration line 4 results 4 1 numerical modelling calibration results several iterations of calibration fig 3 were required to achieve agreement between measured and observed heads across the domain calibrated values for recharge storage drains river leakance and hydraulic conductivity of the different geologic units are shown in table 2 and the visual modflow flex files are supplied in the supplement s2 hydraulic conductivity of the overburden and shale units and recharge were the most sensitive parameters and as such were the primary focus of model calibration hydraulic parameters were also the most uncertain as is common in groundwater modelling anderson et al 2015 pp 223 observed vs calculated head values are shown later in fig 5d while calibration points are limited modelled head in the piezometers nearest to the beach are in closest agreement with observed head lending confidence to our calibration in the areas most susceptible to slr our calibrated recharge of 165 mm year was in general agreement with baseflow derived estimates of 180 mm year kennedy et al 2010 the final hydraulic conductivity of the shale layer is orders of magnitude higher than a typical shale e g freeze and cherry 1979 however there is documented local evidence of primary groundwater flow occurring along bedding planes and between bedrock fractures gibb and mcmullin 1980 further the geology of the region is characterized by interbedded sandstone and shale units hennigar 1968 ryan 1985 this interbedded geology was excluded from the model fig 2 to limit complexity but its net effect is likely represented in the higher calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the shale unit the conductivity of the overburden layer reflected the soils present in the provincial park where piezometers were installed and was also adjusted during calibration with the calibrated value 2 0 10 6 m s typical of glacial till for the region rivard et al 2008 based on observations of borehole cuttings during well installation the overburden was predominantly silty clay with varying amounts of sand which is in agreement with provincial surficial geology maps stea and finck 1988 4 2 impact of slr on groundwater table elevation and owts the calibrated steady state salinity and head distributions were perturbed by the climate scenarios to investigate impacts to the water table elevation and saltwater freshwater interface fig 4 shows areas of owts inundation and ground surface flooding across the modelling domain for the calibrated current conditions r0 and the r1 r3 r4 r4 1 and r4 2 scenarios table 1 areas where groundwater flooding occurs under current conditions include the wetlands and low lying areas adjacent to the river channels across the domain which all have imposed drain boundaries each climate scenario with higher slr rates results in progressively more surface flooding and near surface inundation of owts across the domain fig 4 while much of the impacted owts are along the coast the high and low recharge scenarios r4 1 r4 2 also impact the upland owts systems south of the wetland fig 4e f this model result is expected as slr would have a reduced effect on groundwater table elevations further from the coast while elevated recharge would affect groundwater tables across the entire domain while fig 4 illustrates the general spatial pattern of flooding fig 5 a c presents the integrated impacts of slr on the owts across the domain the grouped bar chart fig 5a shows that each progressive increase in mean sea level leads to more owts being inundated and a greater extent of flooding for example under current conditions the model and subsequent gis workflow fig 3 suggest 40 owts have their filters inundated while 3 owts are flooded with 100 cm of slr and recharge left unchanged 83 filters are inundated and 16 are flooded and with 120 cm of slr and higher recharge 99 filters are inundated and 29 are flooded fig 5a in addition scenarios with higher slr and recharge shift the distribution of the elevation difference between the land surface and groundwater table fig 5b which indicates a transition to more inundated and flooded owts with progressive slr and enhanced recharge fig 5c shows owts status colors and difference between the water table and surface elevations vs the ground surface elevation of all properties in the modelling domain following 120 cm of slr and high recharge demonstrating unsurprisingly that lower elevation owts are at higher risk of inundation 4 3 saltwater intrusion due to slr and changing recharge the saltwater freshwater interface moved landward in response to slr and reduced recharge and moved seaward in response to increased recharge fig 6 shows the saltwater freshwater interface under current conditions 2020 mean sea level and 165 mm year recharge and for 2100 for each climate change scenario table 1 where each interface line represents a salt concentration that is 50 that of seawater 16 000 mg l the high recharge scenario r4 1 has a significant impact on the wedge movement with increasing sgd from the enhanced recharge overcoming the impacts of slr and driving the salt wedge 10 m seaward compared to current conditions the low recharge r4 2 scenario had the opposite effect with lowered recharge and 120 cm of slr moving the saltwater freshwater interface 20 m landward each progressively higher slr scenario r1 r4 resulted in additional landward interface movement at the ground surface and variable conditions at the interface toe although only the location of the 50 interface is shown not all water to the landward side of the interface is 100 fresh and 100 saline to the seaward side rather a transition zone is present thus not all water to the left of the 50 concentration line is potable further the impact of tidal pumping was not modelled here which would alter the salinity distribution transition zone width particularly close to the surface along the coastal interface 5 discussion 5 1 implications of slr on groundwater table elevation and owts the modelling results demonstrate that progressive slr has an impact on the number and degree to which owts in the region are inundated by elevated groundwater tables figs 4 5 even under current conditions model results suggest that as many as 43 systems in the region are compromised though filter inundation or surface flooding fig 5a which could explain elevated levels of fecal indicator bacteria and enteric viruses detected in samples of coastal water and sgd at this site in 2021 threndyle et al 2022 this aligns with studies by cox et al 2019 and mckenzie et al 2021 that highlighted presently compromised owts and other subsurface infrastructure and linked this inundation to enhanced seaward contaminant transport owts inundation and ground surface flooding increases steadily with each slr scenario with up to 110 compromised systems for 120 cm of slr inundation maps fig 4 and plots fig 5c reveal that much of this inundation occurs at low elevation and near the ocean as well as within the vicinity of the provincial park fig 1 which intersects a tidally influenced wetland this is in agreement with slr and groundwater table modelling results by habel et al 2017 that pointed to inundation in low lying and near shore areas with progressive slr the influence of recharge on groundwater table elevations was also investigated the high recharge high slr scenario r4 1 compromises 128 owts across the domain and significantly impacts the flooding locations in the model upland compared to the scenarios modelling strictly slr fig 4d vs 4f 5a by contrast the low recharge scenario with high slr produced a significant decrease in upland inundation even compared to current conditions fig 4a vs 4e however more owts are still compromised in the 120 cm slr plus low recharge scenario r4 2 than in the 60 cm slr scenario r3 with the compromised owts existing mostly along the shoreline this indicates that recharge changes have an important but different impact on owts inundation compared to slr the results also demonstrate that decreased recharge will not fully counteract the impact of rising sea levels on subsurface inundation and flooding at least for the limited recharge scenarios considered herein alternatively a series of high recharge years in the absence of slr could still have significant impacts on groundwater table elevations and thus owts inundation across the entire domain these findings expand our understanding from previous studies examining the impacts of mainly slr on groundwater table elevation habel et al 2017 befus et al 2020 and suggest that recharge should be considered in future studies as incorporated in some recent studies examining the compound effects of slr tides and rainfall sukop et al 2018 use of a variable density flow model like seawat to evaluate changes in groundwater table elevation provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of variable density dynamics on the water table elevation and saltwater freshwater interface response to slr when run as a uniform density model accomplished by setting seawater concentration to 0 in seawat and setting all density boundary and initial conditions to that of freshwater the majority of water table elevations across the domain remained largely unchanged less than 5 cm difference a few select nearshore locations showed differences of greater than 1 m however these very localized changes were attributed to numerical issues where contrasting boundary conditions converged and did not appreciably change the number of safe inundated or flooded owts when density effects were turned off the number of safe owts in the model domain for climate change scenario r4 1 changed by 3 calculated as a of all owts the inundated owts changed by 2 and the flooded owts changed by 1 see supplementary figs s1 and s2 these results suggest that if owts performance water table elevation in response to slr is the only consideration uniform density models like modflow may be appropriate although this approach cannot evaluate concurrent saltwater intrusion dynamics as in the present study fig 7 presents a conceptual model of the impacts of slr and changing recharge on groundwater elevations and the associated impacts to owts and sgd borne coastal contamination the results of our modeling indicate that an increased number of owts in our study area will be impacted by these processes although not explicitly studied here in our modelling framework the ability of a soil filtration system to remove contaminants is strongly influenced by moisture content i e degree of saturation cooper et al 2016 morales et al 2016 inundated disposal fields limit the adsorption and straining of many colloids mobilizing these contaminants towards coastal waters through sgd mckenzie et al 2021 the removal of other wastewater constituents e g nitrogen could also be impacted but will likely vary depending on severity and timing of groundwater inundation morales et al 2016 as the households in the study area also rely on groundwater for their domestic water supply contaminants that reach the saturated zone could be intercepted by drinking water wells impacting domestic water quality for residents 5 2 impacts of slr and changing recharge on the saltwater freshwater interface the locations of the saltwater freshwater interface under present day conditions and climate change scenarios are shown in fig 6 the offshore location of the interface is in agreement with our lack of detection of an interface in onshore geophysical measurements movement of the interface for the highest slr scenario 120 cm by 2100 occurs primarily at the groundwater table the relatively minor movement of the salt wedge in response to slr is because this aquifer is a recharge limited aquifer michael et al 2013 as the water table can rise with the sea level and maintain the same hydraulic gradient if recharge is unchanged werner and simmons 2009 recharge however does have a significant impact on the interface location increases and decreases in recharge impact the flux of sgd towards the ocean which in turn influences the position of the interface green and macquarrie 2014 the high recharge scenario r4 1 results in the furthest seaward interface even when coupled with the highest slr in this way recharge and slr act as opposing forces on the interface position the contrasting impacts of slr and recharge on both groundwater table and interface movement saltwater intrusion have implications for evaluating what a best case or worst case scenario may be from an owts contaminant transport perspective high recharge and high slr would elevate the groundwater table the most and inundate the maximum number of filters driving a high volume of contaminants from owts seaward in contrast from a saltwater intrusion perspective scenarios with low recharge and high slr would result in the most landward interface movement and a greater risk of saltwater intrusion into domestic water supply wells while our model results indicate that the interface location is sufficiently distanced from the shoreline so as not to impact the salinity of drinking water resources fig 6 the salinity distribution could be impacted by both tidal mixing and pumping of residential wells which were not considered in the model it is also important to note that the impacts of saltwater intrusion and owts generated groundwater contamination may be related because porewater salinity can influence biogeochemical processes and contaminant mobility for example the introduction of more saltwater into the subsurface could increase the adsorption of viral and bacterial colloids as increased ionic strength can supress the electrical double layer surrounding porous media knappett et al 2008 5 3 model limitations model calibration was limited by the number of monitoring wells installed across the study site our calibration points were concentrated mainly within the provincial park fig 1 as options for drilling on private property were limited and access to unpumped private domestic wells was limited calibration of groundwater table elevation in the upland was facilitated by comparing visual observations of low lying and wet areas from field trips and satellite imagery with flooded areas in our model outputs we did not model groundwater pumping from the estimated 472 homes in the study site which use between 680 and 1360 l day of groundwater nova scotia environment and labour 2004 this pumping could both lower the groundwater table and bring the saltwater freshwater interface landward however as these homes also rely on owts for waste disposal it is reasonable to assume that this water would be returned to the ground at roughly the same rate it is extracted furthermore the pumped volume from the homes is only 6 8 of recharge across the model domain may be higher locally even during the limited summer occupancy based on mean values for household water usage in this area 1020 l day nova scotia environment and labour 2004 groundwater inundation in the model occurs when groundwater rises above the land surface seawat however does not simulate overland flow runoff ponding evapotranspiration or unsaturated flow as a result estimates of groundwater table elevation were limited to flow within the saturated zone finally as is the case for all groundwater models anderson et al 2015 pp 223 our model is limited due to the uncertainty associated with estimating and calibrating for hydraulic conductivity 5 4 implications for guidelines and coastal owts our modelling suggests that 43 owts 9 in the region are compromised under current conditions a number that may increase up to 128 owts 27 with slr and recharge increases fig 5a these findings coupled with evidence of present fecal pollution from owts in the region threndyle et al 2022 suggest that water quality along this coastline which is also near a popular provincial park and swimming area could be further degraded in the future the modelling results have direct application for provincial owts guidelines and guidelines for owts globally in low elevation areas with high projected rates of slr although re design of current systems is likely challenging areas that are demonstrated to be at increased risk of inundation due to slr should be considered in guidelines for future owts replacement and new system installation in some cases conventional disposal fields may not be feasible and homeowners will need to use alternative treatment systems such as mechanically aerated treatment units which have additional operation and maintenance requirements fig 5c dashed vertical line demonstrates that at the study site households where the ground surface is within approximately 6 25 m of current local mean sea level could be at increased risk of owts inundation under climate change scenario r4 1 41 of properties below 6 25 m of local mean sea level have their owts inundated which is true for only 9 of properties above 6 25 m owts guidelines could be revised for this region to include increased vertical separation distances between the bottom of disposal fields and the groundwater table applying this standard to other regions globally should be done in conjunction with the use of high resolution dem s as done in this study to ensure proper vulnerability assessment of low elevation coastal communities to slr given issues with global coarse scale dems kulp and strauss 2019 similar recommendations could be made for property and infrastructure development in the region and in other low elevation coastlines globally basements foundations water supply and other below grade utilities should consider how elevated groundwater tables from rising sea levels would impact their long term viability de almeida and mostafavi 2016 knott et al 2017 hummel et al 2018 finally these recommendations should be considered elsewhere where high slr and low lying densely populated coastal areas relying on owts intersect much of the east coast of the united states is predicted to experience between 0 5 m and over 2 m of slr by 2100 sweet et al 2022 the atlantic coast of the u s also has some of the highest rates of owts use nationally particularly in maine virginia and north carolina us census bureau 1990 studies by cox et al 2019 already show inundation of owts in rhode island and similar slr studies by walter et al 2016 cape cod ma and manda et al 2015 bogue banks nc show dramatically reduced unsaturated zones and projected impacts to owts the protections discussed in this study are relatively simple yet effective safeguards against key impacts of climate change enclosed or semi enclosed coastal water bodies used for swimming fishing and aquaculture are of particular interest as less mixing and more population density enhances the chances of contamination from sgd derived pollution a phenomenon which could be accelerated with slr 6 conclusions as climate change increasingly threatens coastal communities and water resources our ability to assess the potential impacts that climate change will have on key infrastructure e g owts is increasingly important our study uses numerical modelling to demonstrate that as many as 27 of owts in our study region could be inundated or flooded under 120 cm of slr and high recharge conditions vs 9 under current conditions we also show how recharge changes impact the spatial distribution of owts inundation having greater effect than slr further from the coastline and thereby highlight the importance of considering recharge changes in concert with slr in future owts inundation studies finally we propose that the installation of owts at properties in our study area where the surface elevation is within 6 25 m of local mean sea level should consider design modifications to increase the vertical distance between the bottom of their owts drain fields and the water table these findings have applications outside of the study site particularly where high slr rates are projected along low elevation coastal communities that rely on owts for wastewater treatment and where groundwater and surface water quality are important to community health and recreational use of the area in these zones owts design guidelines may need to incorporate local predictions of potential water table changes under climate change scenarios the model results also highlight the contrasting risks to coastal groundwater from either salinization or owts for example despite the significant impacts to the water table elevation and associated owts performance the results reveal that this aquifer is relatively resilient to climate change from a saltwater intrusion perspective as the freshwater saltwater interface movement due to the climate change scenarios is limited to 20 m and generally remains offshore this aquifer is used for drinking water supply and in general increasing groundwater pumping would draw the water table down and protect against owts contamination of sgd but could result in lateral saltwater intrusion also changes in precipitation and resultant recharge would likely have counteracting effects on owts performance and salinization with increased precipitation leading to more sgd and pushing the saltwater freshwater interface seaward but simultaneously elevating the water table and potentially inundating owts future studies could focus on coupled groundwater flow and contaminant transport modelling evaluating the impact of contaminant transport from inundated owts filters towards recreational and drinking water supplies critical pathways for owts contaminant transport should be determined to identify potential areas of rapid contaminant transport finally continued monitoring of shoreline water quality in vulnerable regions will be useful for understanding contaminant sources and adaptations required to limit future

2748,an often overlooked impact of rising sea levels is the concurrent rise in coastal groundwater tables which can result in subsurface inundation of below ground infrastructure this is an important consideration for rural coastal communities many of which rely on on site wastewater treatment systems owts subsurface inundation and flooding of owts leads to treatment performance issues potentially resulting in enhanced contaminant transport to coastal groundwater resources and the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge we use seawat to develop a variable density groundwater flow model for the groundwater system underlying a densely populated rural community on the north shore of nova scotia canada we then impose various climate change scenarios sea level rise changes in recharge to evaluate the risk of owts inundation from rising groundwater we find that under current conditions as many as 9 of owts in this small but densely populated watershed are either inundated or completely flooded this number that could grow to 27 of owts for the climate change scenario with the highest recharge and sea level rise as a secondary objective we track the location of the modeled saltwater freshwater interface and investigate the potential salinization of groundwater resources used for drinking water supply the modeled interface moved landward by 20 m and proved to be less of a concern than owts inundation except for shoreline dwellings we also use the modelling results to develop adaptation recommendations for owts installation regulations this research contributes to an increasing number of groundwater modelling studies focusing on the impacts of sea level rise on coastal subsurface infrastructure and provides important insight for rural coastal communities keywords groundwater table rise climate change impacts on groundwater subsurface infrastructure inundation submarine groundwater discharge coastal contamination saltwater intrusion data availability see supplementary section 1 introduction accelerating sea level rise slr is threatening coastal communities globally kulp and strauss 2019 oppenheimer et al 2019 for example in much of the us and canada sea levels are predicted to rise more than 1 m by 2100 oppenheimer et al 2019 james et al 2021 which poses new threats to coastal infrastructure and freshwater resources while the impacts of slr on land surface conditions e g coastal flooding and erosion are widely recognized less public attention has been placed on the unseen impacts of slr on groundwater quantity and quality michael et al 2017 currently more than 10 625 million people of the global population live in low elevation coastal zones defined as contiguous land along the coast within 10 m of mean sea level mcgranahan et al 2007 an estimate projected to nearly double by 2100 neumann et al 2015 these oceanic and human population projections provide the impetus for research focused on slr and the impacts to groundwater and coastal water

coastal zones sawyer et al 2016 consequently there are both seaward contaminated sgd and landward saltwater intrusion contamination processes that occur along the subsurface coastal transition zone

with a predominant focus on saltwater intrusion processes e g werner et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 for coastal aquifers with an unsaturated zone as sea level rises the groundwater table rises in unison which decreases the unsaturated zone thickness werner and simmons 2009 bjerklie et al 2012 rotzoll and fletcher 2013 water tables rising above desired levels is referred to as groundwater flooding which is of concern in areas with dense coastal populations as subsurface infrastructure e g foundations sewer networks water distribution pipes drains septic systems may be impacted by flooding or corrosion resulting in costly damages de almeida and mostafavi 2016 habel et al 2017 knott et al 2017 mckenzie et al 2021 unusually high tides and storm surges can compound the effects of slr propagating elevated sea levels through coastal aquifers and temporarily elevating groundwater tables by tens of centimeters mao et al 2006 in general coastal groundwater flooding can be caused by superimposed climate slr changes in recharge and anthropogenic coastal zone development changes that exacerbate existing threats to coastal infrastructure on site wastewater treatment systems owts often referred to as septic systems are uniquely threatened by slr cooper et al 2015 cox et al 2019 owts are common in rural or underdeveloped areas where municipal wastewater treatment services do not exist they function by distributing primary treated wastewater to a subsurface disposal field comprised of filter sand or native soils contaminants are treated by physical chemical and biological processes as the effluent flows through the disposal field adequate attenuation of many contaminants of concern relies on some prescribed depth of unsaturated sand soil materials cogger et al 1988 lusk et al 2017 for example when an owts becomes partially inundated there is a corresponding decrease in the removal of many microbial colloids such as e coli which are typically strained in the air portion of soil pores during unsaturated flow morales et al 2015 cox et al 2019 modern owts design standards e g nova scotia environment 2017 specify minimum separation distances between groundwater tables and the bottom of the owts drain field typically on the order of 1 m to ensure unsaturated flow however these guidelines do not account for potential groundwater table rise due to slr and typically do not apply to systems installed before the adoption of modern design standards in addition to long term persistent threats imposed by slr owts in low elevation coastal zones have been shown to become temporarily inundated during storm surges and high tides cox et al 2020 previous studies have modelled the projected impacts of slr on groundwater table elevation notably along the east and west coasts of the united states cox et al 2019 befus et al 2020 and bench scale experiments have been conducted to evaluate the impact of elevated water tables on owts performance cooper et al 2016 modelling studies have evaluated colloid filtration under changing climate scenarios morales et al 2015 while analytical studies and numerical simulations have been used to predict ground surface inundation with projected slr rotzoll and fletcher 2013 mckenzie et al 2021 however in general much of the past slr modelling research in the broader coastal zone research field has focused on ground surface inundation and only a few studies have employed the use of groundwater flow models to predict groundwater table dynamics under changing marine conditions to our knowledge no 3d variable density groundwater modelling studies have evaluated the impact of slr on owts inundation anywhere globally further no studies focused on slr and owts performance have been conducted in canada which has the world s longest coastline and is characterized by some of the highest projected slr rates globally e g atlantic canada james et al 2021 and high rates 50 in some provinces of owts use nova scotia environment 2013 in the present study we use a variable density groundwater flow and solute salt transport model to investigate the impact of slr on groundwater table elevation and owts inundation in a rural but densely populated coastal community in eastern canada that relies on both owts and residential water supply wells our primary objectives were to 1 evaluate the impact of various slr and groundwater recharge scenarios on groundwater table elevation at our study site 2 assess owts inundation under these same corresponding groundwater table elevations based on the distribution of residential dwellings and 3 propose new considerations for owts guidelines to proactively design future systems with climate change in mind as a secondary objective we also investigate potential saltwater intrusion subsurface saltwater freshwater interface movement due to climate change and consider the implications for groundwater resources 2 study site our study site is located on the north shore of the province of nova scotia canada approximately 150 km north of the city of halifax fig 1 this site was selected due to recent indicators of coastal contaminant transport from owts threndyle et al 2022 this area primarily consists of farmland forests a provincial park and rural residential properties close to the coast fig 1 nova scotia department of natural resources and renewables 2021a b the park includes an upland area a forested area and a wetland complex nearer the ocean the region is underlain by sedimentary bedrock that is part of the pictou group and includes the cape john and tatamagouche formations ryan 1985 these formations consist of primarily interbedded sandstones and mudstones with groundwater flow taking place via intergranular flow and along fractures and bedding planes hennigar 1968 rivard et al 2008 overburden material consists primarily of 0 6 to 10 m of coarse to fine grained glacial tills the shoreline along the northumberland strait is a public sandy beach frequented during the summer months the beach has a tidal range of 2 5 m and is a relatively low energy wave environment the climate is typical of southeastern canada with mean daily air temperatures ranging from 19 c during the summer to 3 c in the winter government of canada 2021 eccc station 8205774 the region receives close to 1000 mm of precipitation annually with recharge to the underlying bedrock estimated to range between 180 and 220 mm year based on analysis of baseflow data kennedy et al 2010 government of canada 2021 eccc station 8205774 the provincial park is surrounded by private cottages and residential properties all of which rely on owts for wastewater treatment and groundwater wells for drinking water fig 1 a recent provincial gis based analysis classified this region as a mid high risk zone for saltwater intrusion kennedy 2012 but no process based modeling of coastal groundwater processes has been conducted for this site field observations and gis analysis indicate that many of these properties are within meters of the current high water mark suggesting their owts could already be threatened during high tides and storm surges current owts standards for nova scotia nova scotia environment 2013 indicate that many of these systems should be raised or at grade based on soil permeability and water table position however some of the older properties in the area were constructed prior to 1975 when on site sewage disposal system regulations first came into effect province of nova scotia 1975 previous research using conventional and novel crassphage fecal indicators measured in submarine groundwater discharge and in coastal waters indicated that owts at this site are likely already contributing contaminants into the ocean threndyle et al 2022 making the study of elevated groundwater tables in this region specifically intriguing 3 methods and data 3 1 data sources data for model development and calibration were collected from provincial online databases regional reports and multiple field campaigns in the study area the horizontal extents of the model domain are informed by watershed divides which were assumed to represent groundwater divides anderson et al 2015 pp 35 and the vertical extent is based on the maximum depth of 34 available borehole logs from the nova scotia groundwater atlas nova scotia department of natural resources and renewables 2021a b ground surface elevation 1 m horizontal resolution 0 1 m vertical resolution was downloaded from the geonova provincial lidar database digital elevation model and was combined with offshore ocean floor elevation data from the canadian hydrographic service s non navigational bathymetric database nova scotia geonova 2020 fisheries and

assumed to be collocated with the property id s coordinates groundwater head and sea level data e g horizontal hydraulic gradients and tidal fluctuations were recorded during multiple field campaigns and through continuous data logging of four piezometers and a tidal logger fig 1 as described in more detail in threndyle et al 2022 hydrogeological parameters used in the model were estimated from literature including local sources hennigar 1968 and pumping tests and adjusted within constraints during model calibration 3 2 overview of numerical model of groundwater flow and solute transport the

conditions seawat effectively links modflow groundwater flow and mt3dms solute transport bedekar et al 2016 and is commonly applied in coastal groundwater studies langevin et al 2008 to account for coupled solute salt transport variable density flow and related saltwater freshwater dynamics that occur in the coastal zone the groundwater flow engine employed by this version of seawat is modflow 2000 which is a saturated zone model the elevation of the groundwater table is taken as the hydraulic head in the uppermost active grid cell changes to groundwater storage due to water table fluctuations specific yield are accounted for in the layer with the water table modflow has been employed to evaluate coastal groundwater table dynamics in previous studies habel et al 2017 sukop et al 2018 befus et al 2020 we advance beyond many prior coastal groundwater table studies by also including seawat given our desire to represent the freshwater saltwater interface and its influence on coastal groundwater discharge patterns under present and future climate conditions 3 3 geological model well logs from the nova scotia groundwater atlas were used in combination with field data to create a representative geologic model using leapfrog software seequent limited christchurch new zealand this tool uses imported borehole data and interpolates contact surfaces between associated units before creating 3d volumes representing the different bedrock units modelled stratigraphy is shown in fig 2 the surficial geology is represented in the model as fine grained glacial till which was also observed during our piezometer installation the underlying sandstone and shale units were interpreted from borehole data from the nova scotia groundwater atlas nova scotia department of mines 2021 borehole information was simplified to generate a reasonable number of units to accurately represent groundwater flow in the model the digital leapfrog file is included as supplementary material s 1 3 4 model grid leapfrog was also used to discretize the model domain which was imported into visual modflow flex our grid consists of cells that are 20 m wide longshore by 40 m long cross shore fining down to 20 m wide by 10 m long near the saltwater freshwater interface grid refinement around the interface was required to enable model convergence where solute concentration gradients were high our model has 14 layers spaced closer together near the ground surface 3 m vertical thickness and further apart at depth 6 m thickness the model base is 63 m below present sea level which corresponds to the depth of the deepest geologic information in the available well logs 3 5 boundary conditions the model sides and bottom boundaries were set as no flow conditions fig 2 in accordance with expected groundwater divides along the sides regional watershed and predominantly horizontal flow at depth anderson et al 2015 pp 148 a recharge boundary condition with constant freshwater flux was applied across the land surface of the domain with the recharge flux initially informed by reported baseflow data kennedy et al 2010 drain boundaries were assigned to swamps streams and agricultural drains across the site the swamps had leakance values of 50 day m 1 and the agricultural drains and streams had leakance values of 25 and 50 day 1 respectively the top layer of the portion of the model representing the ocean was assigned a constant head and constant concentration boundary corresponding to measured mean sea level at the site and seawater concentration 32 000 mg l of dissolved salts respectively hussain 2015 to evaluate potential impacts of the vertical no flow boundary at the seaward extent of the model fig 2 we ran an additional simulation with this boundary converted to a constant head boundary at the same head as the nodes at the base of the ocean strait minimal change was observed results not shown as only 0 3 of the surface layer experienced a change in water table elevation that was 1 cm or greater also the location of the saltwater freshwater interface did not appreciably change which suggests that our default vertical offshore boundary is located sufficiently offshore to reasonably impose a no flow condition additionally the effect of variable density flow conditions on the water table elevations was considered by turning off the variable density dynamics as discussed more later when modelling climate change scenarios the ocean boundary condition specified head was raised at a constant rate in transient simulations between 2020 and 2100 such that the 2100 sea level was in accordance with ensemble slr projections downscaled to the site james et al 2021 slr rates for rcp4 5 and 8 5 at the 5th and 95th percentiles were used to inform the slr rates imposed in the modeled climate scenarios table 1 in two runs r4 1 and r4 2 with the highest slr the recharge boundary condition was also adjusted in equal intervals every 20 years future recharge rates were considered to investigate the sensitivity of the groundwater table dynamics to paired changes in sea level and recharge future recharge rates were obtained from future local precipitation projections lines et al 2006 by invoking the simplifying assumption that the recharge precipitation ratio remains constant as future recharge estimates are highly variable and uncertain even in terms of the direction of change kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 we have modelled a high and low recharge scenario with changes in recharge equal in magnitude but opposite in direction 39 mm year change table 1 the influence of tides was ignored in this study as our purpose was to study long term changes in groundwater table elevations and the potential impacts to fresh submarine groundwater discharge flowing under owts rather than recirculated submarine groundwater discharge leroux et al 2021 3 6 initial conditions initial groundwater heads were assigned to match observed mean annual heads in the installed piezometers fig 1 a model simulation of 50 years was run repeatedly to allow groundwater flow to reach steady state and model parameters were continuously adjusted until calculated and observed head conditions agreed hydraulic conductivity of the overburden shale and sandstone units were initially estimated based on literature values rivard et al 2008 and field measurements and then adjusted within limits during calibration rivers swamps and farms drains which were delineated from aerial imagery of the site were included in the model as drain boundary conditions to better represent surface drainage the default recharge boundary condition 165 mm year table 1 at the terrestrial surface was determined by adjusting the value in small increments to help match calculated and observed head data following calibration a 50 year model spin up period was employed to allow the saltwater freshwater interface to reach steady state before any climate change forcing was introduced a block of saltwater 32 000 mg l was imposed vertically below the constant head sea level boundary to the bottom of the model domain to decrease the time needed for the saltwater freshwater interface to reach steady state conditions attempts were made to calibrate the wedge location to collected local time domain electromagnetic walktem abem geophysical data following pavlovskii et al 2022 but interpretation was challenging due to the stratigraphic changes that obscured resistivity changes due to porewater salinity difficulty locating an onshore saltwater freshwater interface was further validated in our model results that indicated an offshore wedge location fig 6 3 7 transient runs and post processing calibrated steady state groundwater head and salt concentration distributions were used as initial conditions to run six transient climate change scenarios table 1 groundwater table elevation data for each model grid cell was exported from visual modflow flex at various timesteps and imported into arcgis pro to evaluate the impact on residential properties and associated owts the model ground surface raster was subtracted from the groundwater table elevation raster to reveal the depth to the groundwater table and areas of ground surface flooding for each climate change scenario fig 3 there are 472 septic systems in the modelling domain one for each property id reported by the province fig 1 inundation for each septic system was evaluated based on the depth to groundwater in the grid cell corresponding to the location of the septic system we assumed the bottom of the drain field unsaturated zone of each septic system was 1 6 m below ground surface as is required by provincial guidelines for septic systems to ensure adequate filtration of wastewater nova scotia environment 2013 any location where the simulated water table was within 1 6 m of the ground surface was considered inundated and any location where the simulated groundwater table was above the ground surface was considered flooded seawater tds concentration including the location of the saltwater freshwater interface was visualised using postprocessing capabilities in visual modflow flex a 50 concentration line 16 000 mg l was plotted along a designated column of cells for calibrated initial conditions and the transient climate chance scenarios saltwater intrusion was investigated and quantified by the landward movement of this modeled interface isoconcentration line 4 results 4 1 numerical modelling calibration results several iterations of calibration fig 3 were required to achieve agreement between measured and observed heads across the domain calibrated values for recharge storage drains river leakance and hydraulic conductivity of the different geologic units are shown in table 2 and the visual modflow flex files are supplied in the supplement s2 hydraulic conductivity of the overburden and shale units and recharge were the most sensitive parameters and as such were the primary focus of model calibration hydraulic parameters were also the most uncertain as is common in groundwater modelling anderson et al 2015 pp 223 observed vs calculated head values are shown later in fig 5d while calibration points are limited modelled head in the piezometers nearest to the beach are in closest agreement with observed head lending confidence to our calibration in the areas most susceptible to slr our calibrated recharge of 165 mm year was in general agreement with baseflow derived estimates of 180 mm year kennedy et al 2010 the final hydraulic conductivity of the shale layer is orders of magnitude higher than a typical shale e g freeze and cherry 1979 however there is documented local evidence of primary groundwater flow occurring along bedding planes and between bedrock fractures gibb and mcmullin 1980 further the geology of the region is characterized by interbedded sandstone and shale units hennigar 1968 ryan 1985 this interbedded geology was excluded from the model fig 2 to limit complexity but its net effect is likely represented in the higher calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the shale unit the conductivity of the overburden layer reflected the soils present in the provincial park where piezometers were installed and was also adjusted during calibration with the calibrated value 2 0 10 6 m s typical of glacial till for the region rivard et al 2008 based on observations of borehole cuttings during well installation the overburden was predominantly silty clay with varying amounts of sand which is in agreement with provincial surficial geology maps stea and finck 1988 4 2 impact of slr on groundwater table elevation and owts the calibrated steady state salinity and head distributions were perturbed by the climate scenarios to investigate impacts to the water table elevation and saltwater freshwater interface fig 4 shows areas of owts inundation and ground surface flooding across the modelling domain for the calibrated current conditions r0 and the r1 r3 r4 r4 1 and r4 2 scenarios table 1 areas where groundwater flooding occurs under current conditions include the wetlands and low lying areas adjacent to the river channels across the domain which all have imposed drain boundaries each climate scenario with higher slr rates results in progressively more surface flooding and near surface inundation of owts across the domain fig 4 while much of the impacted owts are along the coast the high and low recharge scenarios r4 1 r4 2 also impact the upland owts systems south of the wetland fig 4e f this model result is expected as slr would have a reduced effect on groundwater table elevations further from the coast while elevated recharge would affect groundwater tables across the entire domain while fig 4 illustrates the general spatial pattern of flooding fig 5 a c presents the integrated impacts of slr on the owts across the domain the grouped bar chart fig 5a shows that each progressive increase in mean sea level leads to more owts being inundated and a greater extent of flooding for example under current conditions the model and subsequent gis workflow fig 3 suggest 40 owts have their filters inundated while 3 owts are flooded with 100 cm of slr and recharge left unchanged 83 filters are inundated and 16 are flooded and with 120 cm of slr and higher recharge 99 filters are inundated and 29 are flooded fig 5a in addition scenarios with higher slr and recharge shift the distribution of the elevation difference between the land surface and groundwater table fig 5b which indicates a transition to more inundated and flooded owts with progressive slr and enhanced recharge fig 5c shows owts status colors and difference between the water table and surface elevations vs the ground surface elevation of all properties in the modelling domain following 120 cm of slr and high recharge demonstrating unsurprisingly that lower elevation owts are at higher risk of inundation 4 3 saltwater intrusion due to slr and changing recharge the saltwater freshwater interface moved landward in response to slr and reduced recharge and moved seaward in response to increased recharge fig 6 shows the saltwater freshwater interface under current conditions 2020 mean sea level and 165 mm year recharge and for 2100 for each climate change scenario table 1 where each interface line represents a salt concentration that is 50 that of seawater 16 000 mg l the high recharge scenario r4 1 has a significant impact on the wedge movement with increasing sgd from the enhanced recharge overcoming the impacts of slr and driving the salt wedge 10 m seaward compared to current conditions the low recharge r4 2 scenario had the opposite effect with lowered recharge and 120 cm of slr moving the saltwater freshwater interface 20 m landward each progressively higher slr scenario r1 r4 resulted in additional landward interface movement at the ground surface and variable conditions at the interface toe although only the location of the 50 interface is shown not all water to the landward side of the interface is 100 fresh and 100 saline to the seaward side rather a transition zone is present thus not all water to the left of the 50 concentration line is potable further the impact of tidal pumping was not modelled here which would alter the salinity distribution transition zone width particularly close to the surface along the coastal interface 5 discussion 5 1 implications of slr on groundwater table elevation and owts the modelling results demonstrate that progressive slr has an impact on the number and degree to which owts in the region are inundated by elevated groundwater tables figs 4 5 even under current conditions model results suggest that as many as 43 systems in the region are compromised though filter inundation or surface flooding fig 5a which could explain elevated levels of fecal indicator bacteria and enteric viruses detected in samples of coastal water and sgd at this site in 2021 threndyle et al 2022 this aligns with studies by cox et al 2019 and mckenzie et al 2021 that highlighted presently compromised owts and other subsurface infrastructure and linked this inundation to enhanced seaward contaminant transport owts inundation and ground surface flooding increases steadily with each slr scenario with up to 110 compromised systems for 120 cm of slr inundation maps fig 4 and plots fig 5c reveal that much of this inundation occurs at low elevation and near the ocean as well as within the vicinity of the provincial park fig 1 which intersects a tidally influenced wetland this is in agreement with slr and groundwater table modelling results by habel et al 2017 that pointed to inundation in low lying and near shore areas with progressive slr the influence of recharge on groundwater table elevations was also investigated the high recharge high slr scenario r4 1 compromises 128 owts across the domain and significantly impacts the flooding locations in the model upland compared to the scenarios modelling strictly slr fig 4d vs 4f 5a by contrast the low recharge scenario with high slr produced a significant decrease in upland inundation even compared to current conditions fig 4a vs 4e however more owts are still compromised in the 120 cm slr plus low recharge scenario r4 2 than in the 60 cm slr scenario r3 with the compromised owts existing mostly along the shoreline this indicates that recharge changes have an important but different impact on owts inundation compared to slr the results also demonstrate that decreased recharge will not fully counteract the impact of rising sea levels on subsurface inundation and flooding at least for the limited recharge scenarios considered herein alternatively a series of high recharge years in the absence of slr could still have significant impacts on groundwater table elevations and thus owts inundation across the entire domain these findings expand our understanding from previous studies examining the impacts of mainly slr on groundwater table elevation habel et al 2017 befus et al 2020 and suggest that recharge should be considered in future studies as incorporated in some recent studies examining the compound effects of slr tides and rainfall sukop et al 2018 use of a variable density flow model like seawat to evaluate changes in groundwater table elevation provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of variable density dynamics on the water table elevation and saltwater freshwater interface response to slr when run as a uniform density model accomplished by setting seawater concentration to 0 in seawat and setting all density boundary and initial conditions to that of freshwater the majority of water table elevations across the domain remained largely unchanged less than 5 cm difference a few select nearshore locations showed differences of greater than 1 m however these very localized changes were attributed to numerical issues where contrasting boundary conditions converged and did not appreciably change the number of safe inundated or flooded owts when density effects were turned off the number of safe owts in the model domain for climate change scenario r4 1 changed by 3 calculated as a of all owts the inundated owts changed by 2 and the flooded owts changed by 1 see supplementary figs s1 and s2 these results suggest that if owts performance water table elevation in response to slr is the only consideration uniform density models like modflow may be appropriate although this approach cannot evaluate concurrent saltwater intrusion dynamics as in the present study fig 7 presents a conceptual model of the impacts of slr and changing recharge on groundwater elevations and the associated impacts to owts and sgd borne coastal contamination the results of our modeling indicate that an increased number of owts in our study area will be impacted by these processes although not explicitly studied here in our modelling framework the ability of a soil filtration system to remove contaminants is strongly influenced by moisture content i e degree of saturation cooper et al 2016 morales et al 2016 inundated disposal fields limit the adsorption and straining of many colloids mobilizing these contaminants towards coastal waters through sgd mckenzie et al 2021 the removal of other wastewater constituents e g nitrogen could also be impacted but will likely vary depending on severity and timing of groundwater inundation morales et al 2016 as the households in the study area also rely on groundwater for their domestic water supply contaminants that reach the saturated zone could be intercepted by drinking water wells impacting domestic water quality for residents 5 2 impacts of slr and changing recharge on the saltwater freshwater interface the locations of the saltwater freshwater interface under present day conditions and climate change scenarios are shown in fig 6 the offshore location of the interface is in agreement with our lack of detection of an interface in onshore geophysical measurements movement of the interface for the highest slr scenario 120 cm by 2100 occurs primarily at the groundwater table the relatively minor movement of the salt wedge in response to slr is because this aquifer is a recharge limited aquifer michael et al 2013 as the water table can rise with the sea level and maintain the same hydraulic gradient if recharge is unchanged werner and simmons 2009 recharge however does have a significant impact on the interface location increases and decreases in recharge impact the flux of sgd towards the ocean which in turn influences the position of the interface green and macquarrie 2014 the high recharge scenario r4 1 results in the furthest seaward interface even when coupled with the highest slr in this way recharge and slr act as opposing forces on the interface position the contrasting impacts of slr and recharge on both groundwater table and interface movement saltwater intrusion have implications for evaluating what a best case or worst case scenario may be from an owts contaminant transport perspective high recharge and high slr would elevate the groundwater table the most and inundate the maximum number of filters driving a high volume of contaminants from owts seaward in contrast from a saltwater intrusion perspective scenarios with low recharge and high slr would result in the most landward interface movement and a greater risk of saltwater intrusion into domestic water supply wells while our model results indicate that the interface location is sufficiently distanced from the shoreline so as not to impact the salinity of drinking water resources fig 6 the salinity distribution could be impacted by both tidal mixing and pumping of residential wells which were not considered in the model it is also important to note that the impacts of saltwater intrusion and owts generated groundwater contamination may be related because porewater salinity can influence biogeochemical processes and contaminant mobility for example the introduction of more saltwater into the subsurface could increase the adsorption of viral and bacterial colloids as increased ionic strength can supress the electrical double layer surrounding porous media knappett et al 2008 5 3 model limitations model calibration was limited by the number of monitoring wells installed across the study site our calibration points were concentrated mainly within the provincial park fig 1 as options for drilling on private property were limited and access to unpumped private domestic wells was limited calibration of groundwater table elevation in the upland was facilitated by comparing visual observations of low lying and wet areas from field trips and satellite imagery with flooded areas in our model outputs we did not model groundwater pumping from the estimated 472 homes in the study site which use between 680 and 1360 l day of groundwater nova scotia environment and labour 2004 this pumping could both lower the groundwater table and bring the saltwater freshwater interface landward however as these homes also rely on owts for waste disposal it is reasonable to assume that this water would be returned to the ground at roughly the same rate it is extracted furthermore the pumped volume from the homes is only 6 8 of recharge across the model domain may be higher locally even during the limited summer occupancy based on mean values for household water usage in this area 1020 l day nova scotia environment and labour 2004 groundwater inundation in the model occurs when groundwater rises above the land surface seawat however does not simulate overland flow runoff ponding evapotranspiration or unsaturated flow as a result estimates of groundwater table elevation were limited to flow within the saturated zone finally as is the case for all groundwater models anderson et al 2015 pp 223 our model is limited due to the uncertainty associated with estimating and calibrating for hydraulic conductivity 5 4 implications for guidelines and coastal owts our modelling suggests that 43 owts 9 in the region are compromised under current conditions a number that may increase up to 128 owts 27 with slr and recharge increases fig 5a these findings coupled with evidence of present fecal pollution from owts in the region threndyle et al 2022 suggest that water quality along this coastline which is also near a popular provincial park and swimming area could be further degraded in the future the modelling results have direct application for provincial owts guidelines and guidelines for owts globally in low elevation areas with high projected rates of slr although re design of current systems is likely challenging areas that are demonstrated to be at increased risk of inundation due to slr should be considered in guidelines for future owts replacement and new system installation in some cases conventional disposal fields may not be feasible and homeowners will need to use alternative treatment systems such as mechanically aerated treatment units which have additional operation and maintenance requirements fig 5c dashed vertical line demonstrates that at the study site households where the ground surface is within approximately 6 25 m of current local mean sea level could be at increased risk of owts inundation under climate change scenario r4 1 41 of properties below 6 25 m of local mean sea level have their owts inundated which is true for only 9 of properties above 6 25 m owts guidelines could be revised for this region to include increased vertical separation distances between the bottom of disposal fields and the groundwater table applying this standard to other regions globally should be done in conjunction with the use of high resolution dem s as done in this study to ensure proper vulnerability assessment of low elevation coastal communities to slr given issues with global coarse scale dems kulp and strauss 2019 similar recommendations could be made for property and infrastructure development in the region and in other low elevation coastlines globally basements foundations water supply and other below grade utilities should consider how elevated groundwater tables from rising sea levels would impact their long term viability de almeida and mostafavi 2016 knott et al 2017 hummel et al 2018 finally these recommendations should be considered elsewhere where high slr and low lying densely populated coastal areas relying on owts intersect much of the east coast of the united states is predicted to experience between 0 5 m and over 2 m of slr by 2100 sweet et al 2022 the atlantic coast of the u s also has some of the highest rates of owts use nationally particularly in maine virginia and north carolina us census bureau 1990 studies by cox et al 2019 already show inundation of owts in rhode island and similar slr studies by walter et al 2016 cape cod ma and manda et al 2015 bogue banks nc show dramatically reduced unsaturated zones and projected impacts to owts the protections discussed in this study are relatively simple yet effective safeguards against key impacts of climate change enclosed or semi enclosed coastal water bodies used for swimming fishing and aquaculture are of particular interest as less mixing and more population density enhances the chances of contamination from sgd derived pollution a phenomenon which could be accelerated with slr 6 conclusions as climate change increasingly threatens coastal communities and water resources our ability to assess the potential impacts that climate change will have on key infrastructure e g owts is increasingly important our study uses numerical modelling to demonstrate that as many as 27 of owts in our study region could be inundated or flooded under 120 cm of slr and high recharge conditions vs 9 under current conditions we also show how recharge changes impact the spatial distribution of owts inundation having greater effect than slr further from the coastline and thereby highlight the importance of considering recharge changes in concert with slr in future owts inundation studies finally we propose that the installation of owts at properties in our study area where the surface elevation is within 6 25 m of local mean sea level should consider design modifications to increase the vertical distance between the bottom of their owts drain fields and the water table these findings have applications outside of the study site particularly where high slr rates are projected along low elevation coastal communities that rely on owts for wastewater treatment and where groundwater and surface water quality are important to community health and recreational use of the area in these zones owts design guidelines may need to incorporate local predictions of potential water table changes under climate change scenarios the model results also highlight the contrasting risks to coastal groundwater from either salinization or owts for example despite the significant impacts to the water table elevation and associated owts performance the results reveal that this aquifer is relatively resilient to climate change from a saltwater intrusion perspective as the freshwater saltwater interface movement due to the climate change scenarios is limited to 20 m and generally remains offshore this aquifer is used for drinking water supply and in general increasing groundwater pumping would draw the water table down and protect against owts contamination of sgd but could result in lateral saltwater intrusion also changes in precipitation and resultant recharge would likely have counteracting effects on owts performance and salinization with increased precipitation leading to more sgd and pushing the saltwater freshwater interface seaward but simultaneously elevating the water table and potentially inundating owts future studies could focus on coupled groundwater flow and contaminant transport modelling evaluating the impact of contaminant transport from inundated owts filters towards recreational and drinking water supplies critical pathways for owts contaminant transport should be determined to identify potential areas of rapid contaminant transport finally continued monitoring of shoreline water quality in vulnerable regions will be useful for understanding contaminant sources and adaptations required to limit future

2749,there are extensive and fragile mountain oasis desert ecosystems in central asia lakes are not only the most important water resources in arid central asia but also important resources for maintaining the unique ecosystem of the region as most lakes in central asia lack in situ monitoring data and satellite altimetry records are relatively short term the continuous long term monitoring of lake water storage change lwsc in central asia is inadequate to this end shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model data were used in conjunction with all available landsat images to construct an empirical model of area elevation storage changes and estimate the maximum lwsc maxlwsc and minimum lwsc minlwsc of 9 619 lakes watershed area 10 km2 in central asia from 1990 to 2020 subsequently the random forest rf algorithm was used to quantitatively evaluate the associations among climate change human activities and lwsc it was revealed that maxlwsc and minlwsc decreased by 27 94 and 144 21 gt respectively the results also revealed that lwsc varied by elevation whereby lakes below 3 500 m shrunk and those above 3 500 m expanded the rf findings demonstrated that human activities are more important than climate change for lwsc in central asia up to 96 of lwsc can be explained by human activities this study comprehensively evaluates the characteristics of lwsc in central asia providing the latest data to help alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand in central asia and resolve cross border water resource disputes so as to realize the

available on request 1 introduction lakes are an essential component of the hydrological cycle pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2015 as they not only provide water for local residents but play a critical role in sustaining human habitats and stabilizing ecosystems particularly in arid areas with fragile environments klein et al 2014 tan et al 2018 an abundance of such lakes is located in central asia ca among which 15 000 of them are 0 01 km2 the total lake area in ca exceeds 90 000 km2 making it one of the densest regions for lakes in the world lehner and döll 2004 in addition to providing an important regional water resource in the arid semi arid regions of ca lakes are sensitive indicators of climate and environmental changes adrian et al 2009 over the past few decades water levels surface water area and lake water storage lws in ca have undergone drastic changes due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities ultimately causing a series of ecological disasters huang et al 2021a narama et al 2018 yang et al 2020 lws shows obvious spatiotemporal patterns reflecting the stability of the regional environment including climate hydrology topography and human disturbance additionally water conflicts in ca are amongst the most serious in the world duan et al 2020 zhupankhan et al 2018 and the reduction in surface water resources e g lws may exacerbate these disputes chen et al 2018 didovets et al 2021 threatening regional progress accordingly an accurate estimation of lake water storage change lwsc over time can help decipher the local hydrological cycle dynamics assess the corresponding impacts of climate change and human activities and assist with resolving water conflicts through more efficient and orderly resource use present studies on ca lakes have primarily focused on monitoring surface water dynamics for example yang et al 2020 analyzed the lake area dynamics of the aral sea based on multi source satellite images including landsat modis and spot in 2020 revealing that the aral sea area decreased sharply by 60 000 km2 from 1960 to 2018 elsewhere a 30 m surface water dataset was used to investigate the dynamics of water bodies in ca from 1990 to 2019 huang et al 2021a although these studies promoted the application of remote sensing in surface water monitoring they primarily focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water bodies however because of differences in surrounding topography the dynamics of lake surface area lsa alone cannot fully reflect a lake s response to climate change alternatively the dynamics of lws more adequately represent the actual changes under different climatic conditions qiao et al 2019 yet the spatiotemporal lws dynamics of ca have not been fully assessed such a detailed assessment of lwscs would help inform the sustainable management of water resources in ca and provide new ideas for arid and semi arid regions to address the challenges brought about by climate change changes in lws are most commonly estimated by combining the lake level and lsa but a lack or discontinuity of in situ water level measurements inhibits this process on site monitoring of lake water levels is both time and labor intensive with lakes often located sporadically throughout areas with harsh environments in developing countries gao 2015 recently the rapid development of remote sensing technology has proliferated products that can measure surface water areas and levels offering efficient and cost effective methods for evaluating lws crétaux et al 2016 because of their relatively high spatial resolution and the long term continuity of the landsat satellite series in addition to the open access of radar and laser altimeter satellite data including jason 1 icesat glas and envisat these imagers have been widely used for mapping lakes and other surface water bodies in addition to monitoring water level changes in lakes and reservoirs carabajal and boy 2021 jiang et al 2017 okeowo et al 2017 shu et al 2021 presently most methods of estimating lws involve combining the water surface area identified by the spectral sensor with the water level data obtained by the altimeter satellite for example song et al 2013 estimated the lws of the tibetan plateau regional water bodies based on water level data 2003 2009 provided by icesat glas combined with landsat imagery luo et al 2021 similarly performed fine scale estimations of lake levels and lwscs on the tibetan plateau based on icesat and icesat 2 satellite data although these studies have made important contributions to the estimation of lws their application in lwsc assessment is limited by the remote sensing data fang et al 2019 for example lidar altimeter satellite data have high applicability for monitoring large lakes but over a relatively short timescale e g icesat data are only available from 2003 to 2009 in addition because of the complexity of lake environments fully monitoring lwscs through radar altimetry data alone is difficult to summarize previous lws research has mainly focused on lakes in a single area and the study timescales were relatively short nasa successfully launched the shuttle radar topography mission srtm in 2000 and has modeled 80 of the global land surface elevation including ca as the derived digital elevation models dems include bathymetric data they have been widely employed for lws estimation fang et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 qiao and zhu 2019 through the extraction of lsa and water levels from the dem and the construction of an empirical relationship model to estimate lwscs indeed the use of dems for estimating lwscs has recently garnered increased attention for example bonnema and hossain 2017 evaluated the lwscs of 20 reservoirs in the mekong river basin tan et al 2020 similarly explored lwscs in poyang lake based on landsat modis and dem data and zhang et al 2021 estimated the lwscs of 1 132 lakes of the tibetan plateau based on landsat and dem data in addition grace satellite data are basically composed of soil moisture glaciers snow water equivalent lake water and groundwater in the region xiang et al 2016 and changes in a certain factor will cause changes in mass in the region for instance zhang et al 2013 estimated the water storage changes of 117 lakes in the tibetan plateau and the findings showed that the increase in lws contributed 61 to the increase in mass provided by grace therefore it is necessary to explore the relationship between changes in lws and grace data previous studies using satellite images to estimate lws usually used quadratic equations to fit the relationship between lsa and water storage changes and this method is more suitable to areas characterized by increased water storage however under the combined influence of climate change and human activities the water storage of many lakes in ca has decreased our study found that quadratic function fitting is not suitable for study areas where lake storage has decreased significantly the quadratic function is not monotonic and cannot guarantee monotonic changes in the area and storage of a lake therefore considering the environmental specificity of the arid region of ca this study adjusted the fitting method for lsa and lws from a quadratic function to a linear function to obtain a more accurate estimation of lwsc the overall objectives of the present study were to 1 construct a lake surface area elevation storage model based on multi source remote sensing data for the estimation of lwsc in ca using high precision datasets with a longer time series 2 evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in lws from multiple dimensions and correlate environmental effects across ca and 3 quantitatively assess the response mechanism of lwsc to climate change and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study ca refers to five countries kazakhstan tajikistan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan and the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in northwestern china fig 1 covering a total area of 5 7 106 km2 ca is deeply landlocked and forms the largest arid semi arid region in the northern hemisphere this region contains fragile ecosystems and a scarcity of freshwater resources li et al 2021 ca has a large number of lakes the larger of which are mainly distributed in alpine basins and piedmont areas such as the kunlun pamirs tianshan and altai mountains there are also a number of inland lakes in the lowlands and northern plains of kazakhstan the weather in ca is arid and rainless and lakes are primarily formed via glacial meltwater and montane precipitation in particular inland lakes located in arid or semi arid areas like those in ca are highly sensitive to climate change and small changes in physical and geographical environments can lead to dramatic changes in lws song et al 2014 lakes in ca are typical inland lakes in arid areas and the changes in water level and storage reflect the characteristics of global climate change to analyze the spatial variation in lws the study area was divided into nine watersheds according to hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org irtysh river basin irb manas river basin mrb baiyang river basin brb tarim river basin trb ural river basin urb syr darya basin sdb balkhash lake basin blb amu darya basin adb and uzboy river basin uzrb 2 2 multi temporal landsat images since 1984 multi temporal images from the series of landsat satellites have been used to map surface water pekel et al 2016 thus providing the longest and most comprehensive earth observation data worldwide in the present study all available landsat images from 1990 to 2020 on google earth engine gee were used to map lsa across ca the entire study area contained 364 scenes among which 64 683 landsat 5 101 493 landsat 7 and 53 436 landsat 8 images were acquired total of 219 612 images fig s1 the number of high quality observations in ca varied spatially fig s2 occurring most frequently at the east west extremes lower in the north of kazakhstan and lowest in the tianshan and kunlun mountains statistically the effective observation area for each watershed was relatively high reaching 100 in some locations adb and brb and accounting for 80 of each watershed at different times within the entire study area ultimately the quality of the ca landsat images was high successfully meeting the requirements of this study due to interference from clouds cloud shadows snow cover and other factors some areas or periods were excluded the interpolation method of adjacent years was used to obtain missing images huang et al 2021a and obtain a high quality long time series set of lsa monitoring data details of the datasets used in this study are shown in table s1 2 2 1 srtm data the srtm dem is the first free global dem zhang et al 2019 with a resolution of 1 arc second 30 m the srtm sensor uses c band synthetic aperture radar sar to measure the heights of ground and non ground features because c band cannot penetrate dense vegetation or buildings srtm dem data represents either the top of the canopy elevations in these areas or that of the bare ground zhang et al 2019 the absolute height error of srtm dem data ranges from 5 6 to 9 0 m globally and is 6 6 m in eurasia rodríguez et al 2006 therefore the actual performance of the srtm data was much better than the expected results the dem characterized the elevation in ca as high in the east and low in the west fig s3 reaching a maximum in the kunlun and tianshan mountains 7 700 m qiao et al 2019 evaluated the consistency between the lsa estimated by srtm and landsat images finding that the correlation between the two across different sized areas was approximately 0 9 with most of them distributed near the 1 1 line in the present study only the relative elevation change was used to estimate the lwsc thus the srtm data were deemed sufficiently reliable 2 2 2 climate data the monthly terraclimate dataset resolution 1 24 was used to analyze historical climate change characteristics temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and snow water equivalent across ca from 1990 to 2020 fig s4 terraclimate uses climatically aided interpolation combining a high spatial resolution climatological normal from the worldclim dataset with coarser resolution time varying i e monthly data from other sources to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed vapor pressure and solar radiation abatzoglou et al 2018 terraclimate has been widely used in climate change and hydrological processes dubey et al 2021 kallio and kummu 2021 tian et al 2021 precipitation in most parts of ca has increased especially in kazakhstan fig s5a furthermore ca has warmed over the past 31 years particularly in western kazakhstan fig s5b simultaneously pet in western kazakhstan increased significantly p 0 05 while that in northern kazakhstan parts of turkmenistan and parts of the trb decreased the snow water equivalent in most parts of ca increased especially in the northeastern part of kazakhstan 2 2 3 land cover and population in addition to climate change increasing populations and croplands place tremendous stress on water demand in ca annual land cover data from 1992 to 2020 were acquired from the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci https www esa landcover cci org this commonly employed dataset maintains a 300 m spatial resolution and is divided into 22 categories according to the classification system of the united nations food and agriculture organization unfao duan et al 2020 liu et al 2018 reinhart et al 2021 population densities were obtained from the global human settlement layer ghsl dataset provided by the european commission https ghsl jrc ec europa eu index php and the population density v 4 11 dataset provided by nasa https sedac ciesin columbia edu both with a spatial resolution of 1 km 2 3 methods 2 3 1 lsa extraction the modified normalized difference water index mndwi has been shown to be the most effective method for extracting surface water information based on green and short wave infrared reflectance values xu 2006 because of its ability to effectively reduce underlying noise this method has been widely employed in surface water body research huang et al 2021b wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 however this index has difficulty distinguishing between water bodies and vegetation ji et al 2009 primarily creating vegetation based classification errors santoro et al 2015 accordingly a combination of the three indices mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi has obtained higher precision surface water information mcfeeters 1996 xiao et al 2005 xu 2006 an evi 0 1 can eliminate the interference of vegetation on water bodies thus a combination of two constraints was used in the present study for identifying surface water bodies mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi and evi 0 1 the above indices were calculated as follows eqs 1 3 1 mndwi ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ re d ρ nir ρ re d 3 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ re d 1 0 ρ nir 6 0 ρ re d 7 5 ρ blue where ρ blue ρ green ρ re d ρ nir and ρ swir are the surface reflectance values of the blue 0 45 0 52 μm green 0 52 0 60 μm red 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared nir 0 77 0 90 μm and shortwave infrared swir 1 55 1 75 μm bands of landsat imagery the following formula was used to calculate the annual water frequency fw 4 f y 1 n y i 1 n y ω y i 100 where f is the water frequency of the pixel y is the specified year ny is the number of total landsat observations of the pixel in that year and i indicates whether an observation of the pixel is water where 1 means water and 0 means non water to analyze changes in maximum lws maxlws and minimum lws minlws the maximum lsa maxlsa and minimum lsa minlsa of all lakes in different basins of ca were assessed according to previous research zou et al 2017 when the water frequency fw is 25 the pixel is classified as effective surface water i e the maximum surface water area for that year the latest study on surface water bodies in ca found that 68 of the fw threshold was applicable to the classification of permanent and seasonal water bodies in ca huang et al 2021a therefore 25 and 68 thresholds were used to differentiate ca maximum 25 fw 100 and minimum 68 fw 100 lake water bodies further existing research has shown that the extraction of surface water areas in ca based on landsat imagery has high accuracy huang et al 2021a to further determine the accuracy of the data in this study we compared the lsa obtained in this study with the joint research centre jrc data text s1 2 3 2 estimation model for lwsc there is a strong correlation between lake water levels and lsa qiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 assuming that there is a regular lake basin underwater conical or cup shaped the lake topography can be regarded as a continuation of the water topography with similar characteristics song et al 2013 conducted a pearson correlation analysis of 13 sample points on the tibetan plateau revealing a tight relationship between the water level and lsa 0 964 99 confidence level therefore by constructing a functional relationship between the lake elevation above the water surface water surface area and the changes in lws a functional relationship model between lws and the corresponding surface area can be derived fig 2 the specific model construction steps were as follows 1 boundaries of 9 619 lakes in ca were extracted based on hydrosheds 2 the lsas of ca in 2000 ssrtm were extracted based on the srtm dem data and the corresponding height represented as h0 3 based on the dem of a single lake basin the area ssrtm i i represents the height from h0 i 1 2 n of different elevation planes with 1 m intervals above the lake surface h0 was calculated and a functional relationship between the area ssrtm i and hi was established table 1 columns 1 3 and 4 the increment of the lws from hi to h0 table 1 columns 3 5 was calculated according to eq 5 5 δ v 1 3 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 δ h where δ v represents the change in lws over the two periods s1 and s2 represent the lsa in each of the two periods and δh represents the change in lake water level accordingly the change in lws relative to the year 2000 was estimated 5 an empirical linear relationship between the lsa and lwsc was constructed δ v a s b fig 3 6 the annual surface water areas of all lakes in ca were extracted based on the time series of landsat images and 7 by substituting the lsa data extracted in step 6 into the formula fitted in step 5 the annual changes in lws in ca were estimated the accuracy verification of the lws estimation based on srtm is shown text s2 2 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis sen s slope can be used as a nonparametric method for evaluating the trends in a univariate time series fernandes et al 2005 and owing to its lack of sensitivity to outliers has been widely employed in hydrological and meteorological research gocic and trajkovic 2013 huang et al 2021b mullick et al 2019 therefore sen s slope methods were used for analyzing the trends in historic climate change in ca and correlated lwscs random forest rf is a tree based machine learning algorithm that not only classifies and regresses datasets but also evaluates the importance of variables and explains the effect of independent variables on dependent variables breiman 2001 the rf algorithm was used in this study to assess the importance of six environmental factors to lwsc in ca fig s10 the importance of feature variables was calculated as follows 6 im p var i 1 n j 1 n erroob 2 ij e r r o o b 1 ij where im p var i is the importance of feature variable i erroob 1 ij is the out of bag data error of variable i erroob 2 ij is the error calculated from the out of bag data altered by added noise and n is the total number of trees 3 results 3 1 lsa and lws changes 3 1 1 characteristics of lsa variations a total of 9 619 lakes were investigated overall the lake water area in ca varies greatly but the confluence area of most lakes is 1 km2 5 907 lakes lake area 1 km2 there are four large lakes balkhash lake 18 000 km2 aral sea 8 700 km2 issyk kul lake 6 200 km2 and bosten lake 1 600 km2 which are located in the blb adb sdb and trb respectively at the watershed scale table s2 the irb has the largest number of lakes 3 394 covering a total area of 11 080 5 km2 the urb has the second greatest number 2 224 lakes spanning 8433 3 km2 the largest lsa among the nine watersheds the lake area in the sdb is the largest at approximately 12 131 1 km2 the number of lakes in the brb is the smallest 23 encompassing a total lake area of only 53 3 km2 the time series trend figures of maxlsa and minlsa in ca from 1990 to 2020 are presented in fig 4 at the watershed scale the lsa trends for each period in most basins were consistent except for sdb irb and mrb the maxlsa and minlsa of urb mrb brb and adb all showed a decreasing trend with adb showing the greatest shrinkage rate approximately 280 23 and 556 72 km2 yr 1 respectively this elevated rate of shrinkage was driven by the rapid losses of the aral sea in recent years su et al 2021 in comparison the observed maxlsa and minlsa shrinkage rate in the brb was relatively slow 0 43 and 0 72 km2 yr 1 respectively in contrast the maxlsa and minlsa of the blb trb and uzrb all showed an increasing trend with the latter basin showing the fastest rate of increase among them the lsa of the uzrb increased the fastest expanding by 1 253 27 and 1 666 57 km2 over the past 31 years at rates of 40 43 km2 yr 1 maxlsa and 53 76 km2 yr 1 minlsa respectively the lsa of the trb had the slowest expansion rate at 3 98 and 1 56 km2 yr 1 in maxlsa and minlsa respectively overall the maxlsa of ca decreased by 6 171 72 km2 over the analysis period fig s11 largely driven by the significant decrease observed in the adb a similar decreasing trend was observed for the minlsa 18 626 63 km2 3 1 2 characteristics of lwsc overall the maxlws in ca showed a fluctuating decrease of 27 94 gt from 1990 to 2020 fig 5 with a shrinkage rate of 0 9 gt yr 1 1 gt 1 km3 with the assumption that lake water density 1000 kg m 3 whereas the minlws decreased by 144 21 gt at a rate of 4 65 gt yr 1 5 times that of maxlws more specifically the maxlws increased at a rate of 4 72 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 2003 after which it began to decrease at a rate of 1 81 gt yr 1 the maximum lwsc maxlwsc in 2003 120 gt maintained the largest proportion of the total change in maxlwsc 2017 34 gt 5 95 followed by that in 2000 5 33 in terms of minlws this increased rapidly from 1990 to 1997 at a rate of 13 34 gt yr 1 and then began to shrink at a rate of 7 32 gt yr 1 among them the minimum lwsc minlwsc in 2020 172 17 gt accounted for the largest proportion of the total change in minlwsc 2013 65 gt 8 55 followed by that in 2014 8 38 spatially the maxlws of 4 499 lakes nearly half of them decreased from 1990 to 2020 fig 6 primarily distributed across four basins urb blb brb and adb this trend was most prominent in the adb where the total lsa lost was 8 687 06 km2 table s3 at a rate of 280 23 km2 yr 1 fig s12 the lws of adb decreased by 106 02 gt over the past 31 years equating to a rate of 3 42 gt yr 1 the maxlsa of blb increased by 184 29 km2 5 94 km2 yr 1 while its lws decreased by 0 38 gt 0 01 gt yr 1 additionally the maxlws of some small lakes along the coast of the caspian sea and northern kazakhstan shrank by various degrees over the analysis period however the maxlws of sdb irb mrb trb and uzrb expanded among them the maxlws in the uzrb increased the most totaling 71 76 gt 2 31 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 2020 whereas the maxlws in the mrb expanded the least totaling 0 031 gt 0 001 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 2020 notably the lsa over the same period decreased by 11 82 km2 0 38 km2 yr 1 in the mrb at the same time since lake water is an important part of terrestrial water storage changes in lws are closely related to changes in mass in the region for the correlation analysis between lwscs and mass in ca see text s3 from 1990 to 2020 the minlws of 6 954 lakes 75 of them decreased mainly distributed in the urb irb sdb blb brb and adb among them the adb underwent the largest reduction 186 31 gt 6 01 gt yr 1 during the same period the minlsa decreased by 17 258 38 km2 556 72 km2 yr 1 in contrast the minlws reduction in the urb sdb irb blb and brb decreased by 13 50 15 89 12 61 0 64 and 0 91 gt respectively 0 02 to 0 51 gt yr 1 over the same period the minlsa of the urb sdb irb mrb and brb also decreased with the urb showing the greatest decrease 1 525 06 km2 49 20 km yr 1 the minlsa of the irb decreased by 1 342 59 km2 43 31 km2 yr 1 whereas the brb maintained the lowest level of minlws reduction at 22 41 km2 0 72 km2 yr 1 although the minlws of the blb declined the basin s lsa increased 54 8 km2 1 77 km2 yr 1 over the same period consistent with the basin changes observed in the maxlws the maxlws and minlws also had significant changes over the investigated timeframe fig s13 see supplementary material for details text s4 in summary the lws of ca showed a decreasing trend the reduction rate of minlws was much higher than that of maxlws in addition the reduction rates of both maxlws and minlws in the adb were the highest among the nine basins examined primarily because of the continuous shrinkage of the aral sea area under the combined effects of climate change and human activities since the 1960 s jia et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in addition regardless of the maximum or minimum surface area and water storage change the lsa and lws of the blb changed in opposite directions this phenomenon is likely the result of the expansion of lsa in shallow sloping small lakes thus no accompanying increase in lws was observed accordingly it is difficult for changes in lsa to truly reflect the response of lakes to climate change and the topographical characteristics of lakes must be considered for an accurate representation to analyze the weight of each basin s contribution to the total changes observed in ca the percent changes in lsa and lws both maximum and minimum for each basin were compared with their respective total changes in terms of maxlsa its change in the adb constituted 58 50 of the total across ca 511 33 km2 followed by that in the sdb 12 95 while changes in the brb accounted for the smallest proportion 0 08 fig s15a similarly for minlsa the change in the adb constituted 63 25 of the total followed by that in the sdb 9 72 and the brb accounted for the least 0 08 fig s15b the changes in maxlws across ca were also concentrated in the adb 47 00 followed by those in the uzrb 29 16 and the brb again accounted for the smallest proportion 0 21 fig s15c the changes in minlws were primarily concentrated in the adb accounting for 53 72 of the total change followed by those in the sdb 21 68 the brb contributed the least 0 25 fig s15d overall the dominance of the adb to the total changes observed in ca indicates the importance of the aral sea and its sensitivity to climate change and human activities 3 2 lwsc by altitude to analyze the patterns of lws by elevation all lakes in ca were categorized into nine different altitudinal groups as shown in table s4 the number of lakes varied by altitude with the most being distributed between 120 and 200 m 1729 lakes and the least being above 3 500 m 204 lakes the maxlws in lakes at altitudes of 0 200 m and 400 1000 m shrank fig 7 a and lakes with altitudes of 0 80 m and 80 120 m saw the largest reductions from 1990 to 2020 41 02 gt 1 32 gt yr 1 and 14 99 gt 0 48 gt yr 1 respectively comparatively the maxlws of lakes situated at 400 1000 m showed a lesser degree of reduction 1 94 gt 0 06 gt yr 1 the maxlws of lakes at altitudes of 200 400 m and 1 000 m increased in particular lakes above 3 500 m experienced the greatest increase over the analysis period at 9 69 gt 0 31 gt yr 1 additionally with an increase in altitude the reduction rate of maxlws gradually slowed fig 7a the minlws increased only in lakes above 3 500 m by 12 77 gt 0 41 gt yr 1 whereas in lakes below 3 500 m the minlws shrank at different rates with the reduction rate gradually decreasing at higher altitudes lakes at an elevation of 0 80 m experienced the greatest decrease 122 44 gt 3 95 gt yr 1 the minlws reduction rate at elevations of 200 300 m was relatively low 0 13 gt 0 004 gt yr 1 in summary both maxlws and minlws in the 0 80 m elevation range had the highest reductions there are likely three main reasons for this phenomenon first there are many oases distributed at altitudes of 200 400 m and as the agricultural water consumption levels here are large less water is available downstream second lakes in ca mostly rely on alpine ice and snow melt for replenishment and the lower the altitude the greater the evaporation thus evaporation loss at the lowest altitudes is greatest resulting in less replenishment water finally as the aral sea is within the altitude range of 0 80 m its rapid lws loss drives a significant proportion of the shrinkage observed in this range in addition the lwsc rate gradually increased with altitude and the maxlws and minlws of lakes located above 3500 m expanded during 1990 2020 with a total expansion of approximately 22 46 gt this is likely driven by the increasing summer temperatures in tianshan since 1970 resulting in a total loss of glacial area of 10 wang et al 2019a b moreover the number of snow days in the middle of the tianshan mountains also decreased from 2001 to 2015 tang et al 2017 further increasing the water supply of the upper montane the percentage of lwsc observed at each altitudinal range was then compared to the total lwsc observed across ca fig 7b and c for maxlws changes at 0 80 m accounted for the greatest proportion 50 1 followed by those at 80 120 m 18 3 while changes between 1000 and 3500 m accounted for the lowest proportion 1 similarly minlwsc between 0 and 80 m accounted for the largest proportion of the total change observed 67 5 while lakes at 200 300 m accounted for the lowest proportion 0 1 the percentage of lwsc at other altitudes was relatively low 9 maximum above 3500 m temporally the lws at different altitudes presented different trends fig s16 see supplementary material for details text s5 3 3 lwsc of typical inland lakes according to the basin type and water supply the lakes were divided into mountain tail end and throughput lakes in order to discuss the lws patterns of these different lake types in ca 18 representative lakes within the region were selected six mountain lakes seven tail end lakes and five throughput lakes table s5 mountain lakes occur in high mountains or low lying plateaus and some are supplied by stable mountain glaciers these lakes are relatively less affected by human activities and can thus truly reflect the process of regional climate change tail end lakes are mainly distributed in plain areas with frequent human activities and these lakes are mainly supplied by river runoff throughput lakes are located at junctions of mountains and plains and lake water storage here is mainly affected by regional precipitation and the inflow volumes of upstream rivers from 1990 to 2020 the mountain lws expanded while the lws of tail end and throughput lakes shrank fig 8 the montane maxlws initially shrank 0 96 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 1997 before fluctuating and expanding 0 28 gt yr 1 thereafter achieving a total increase of 6 02 gt over the past 31 years fig 8a the montane minlws shrank 1 23 gt yr 1 before 1997 and then began to continuously expand increasing by 7 16 gt over the analysis period fig 8b since 1990 the average temperature in the tianshan mountains has increased by 0 36 0 42 c decade 1 hu et al 2014 and regional glaciers have rapidly melted as a result huang et al 2021c hence the minlws has increased in regions more reliant on glacial melt water replenishment wang et al 2016 the maxlws minlws of tail end lakes expanded rapidly by 7 62 gt yr 1 7 79 gt yr 1 before 2000 fig 8c d and continuously decreased thereafter ultimately shrinking by 35 54 gt 109 35 gt over the entire analysis period accounting for 59 66 of the total changes recorded in ca fig s17 it can be seen that the reduction in lws in ca mainly occurred in tail end lakes as shown in fig s18 the water supply in uzbekistan has been decreasing continuously since 2004 with an average annual decrease of approximately 33 106 m3 the adb in uzbekistan is facing severe water supply and demand contradictions threatening the regional ecological environment especially in the aral sea basin wang et al 2022 the rapid reduction in the tail end lakes further accelerated the reduction in adb water supply intensifying the regional water supply and demand contradiction cropland areas and populations have increased in ca especially after 2000 fig s19 large scale farming activities in the plains and oases have intensified a large number of rivers have been blocked or diverted for irrigation and substantial alterations have occurred in the amount of water entering lakes in the middle and lower reaches of basins ultimately resulting in a significant reduction in tail end lws together the amu darya and syr darya account for 90 of the annual runoff into the aral sea and 75 of the agricultural water consumed in ca with the continuous expansion of cotton planting in ca throughout the 1960 s the area of water diversion and irrigation in the aral sea basin expanded from 4 51 104 km2 in the 1960 s to 7 61 104 km2 by the 1990 s saiko and zonn 2000 exacerbating the hydrological imbalance of the aral sea basin and causing rapid shrinkage of its lws the maxlws and minlws of throughput lakes was relatively stable over the analysis period fig 8e f decreasing by 2 2 gt 0 07 gt yr 1 and 1 82 gt 0 06 gt yr 1 respectively bosten lake is the largest inland freshwater throughput lake in china and its lws constitutes 72 of the total lws of the typical throughput lake in ca fig s20 both the maxlws and minlws of bosten lake have decreased over the past 31 years 3 4 relationships between lwsc and lake size to explore the internal relationships between lwscs and lake size the lakes were divided into six categories according to their lake area namely 50 km2 9493 lakes 50 100 km2 59 lakes 100 200 km2 26 lakes 200 500 km2 20 lakes 500 1000 km2 9 lakes and 1000 km2 12 lakes according to the lake area data provided by hydrolakes lakes with an area of 50 km2 comprise approximately 20 632 28 km2 accounting for 15 84 of the total lake area while lakes with an area of 1000 km2 comprise approximately 88 533 km2 accounting for 67 96 of the total area of lakes in ca as shown in fig s21 from 1990 to 2020 the maxlsa of lakes of 50 100 km2 200 500 km2 and 1000 km2 decreased over the past 31 years the reductions were 38 44 km2 232 81 km2 and 6156 29 km2 respectively of which lakes with an area 1000 km2 accounted for the largest change 92 12 during the same period the maxlsa of 50 km2 100 200 km2 and 500 1000 km2 lakes showed an increasing trend of which the 100 200 km2 lakes increased the fastest with an average annual increase of approximately 4 49 km2 this increase accounted for approximately 2 08 of the total increase in lake surface area in ca similarly from 1990 to 2020 only lakes with areas of 200 500 km2 and 1000 km2 experienced a decreasing maxlws among them lakes with an area of 200 500 km2 experienced the fastest decrease in maxlws with an average annual reduction of approximately 0 24 gt and a reduction of approximately 7 44 gt over the past 31 years accounting for 35 29 fig 10 of the maxlws change in ca during the same period except for lakes with areas of 100 200 km2 and 500 1000 km2 the minlws of lakes of all sizes showed a shrinking trend fig 9 among these the minlws of lakes with an area of 1000 km2 shrank the fastest with an average annual decrease of approximately 3 47 gt and a total reduction of approximately 107 57 gt from 1990 to 2020 this decrease accounts for 68 58 of the total decrease in the minlws in ca in summary the changes in lakes in ca are mainly reflected by the changes in large lakes and the changes in lakes having areas 1000 km2 account for up to 92 12 of the total changes in ca 3 5 key driving factors of lwscs to quantitatively assess the impact of climate changes and human activities on lwsc in ca the rf algorithm was used to rank factor importance the extent to which the above six environmental factors explain the changes in the maximum fig 11 a and minimum fig 11b water storage of lakes in ca was determined as shown in fig 11 there are significant spatial differences in the importance of the six driving factors of lwsc in ca overall human activities are more important than climate change for lwscs specifically population explains 96 of lwsc in the brb precipitation is the climatic factor that has the greatest impact on lwsc but only explains 48 of maxlwsc in the mrb on the watershed scale pet temperature and precipitation together explained 65 of the maxlwsc in the urb precipitation and population explained 49 of the maxlwsc in the sdb and population and pet explained 43 of the maxlwsc in the irb in the blb population and temperature explained 47 of the maxlwsc precipitation was the most important factor for maxlwsc in the mrb explaining 48 of the maxlwsc within the basin population had the greatest impact on maxlwsc in the brb trb adb and uzrb particularly in the brb population explained 94 of the maxlwsc in the basin the responses of maxlwsc and minlwsc to climate change and human activities are different compared with maxlwsc the importance of human activities to minlwsc was relatively high especially in the urb srb brb trb adb and uzrb population explained up to 96 of the minlwsc in these basins brb in the mrb population precipitation and cropland area together explained 69 of the minlwsc generally population is the key driving factor affecting lwsc in ca and cropland and precipitation are main factors affecting lwsc temperature snow water equivalent and pet have relatively little influence on lwsc in ca 4 discussion 4 1 innovations and uncertainty in estimating lwsc in previous studies on estimating lws qiao et al 2019 qiao and zhu 2019 yang et al 2017 quadratic functions were generally used for fitting however this method is not necessarily applicable in arid areas for example fig 12 shows the fitting results of the water body area and lws of seletyteniz lake fig 12a shows the quadratic polynomial fitting result and fig 12b shows the linear fitting result it can be seen from the results that the r2 of the quadratic polynomial is 0 99 which is slightly higher than that of the linear fitting r2 0 93 however during the storage estimation process fig 12c when the surface area of seletyteniz lake is lower than that in 2000 881 km2 when using the quadratic polynomial model lws decreases erroneously with an increase in lsa however the linear fitting result fig 12d ensures that lws keeps increasing as the lake area increases therefore the linear function was used to fit the relationship between the water area and lws of ca lakes in this study this study is not a simple repetition of existing research methods but improves upon existing estimation methods by considering the environmental characteristics of the ca arid region thereby providing a scientific and reliable method for estimating lws in arid regions of ca in addition table 2 reveals that compared with existing studies the estimation of lws demand in this study not only guarantees long term timeframes but also achieves annual scale resolution and enables discussion of the variation characteristics of both maxlws and minlws thus systematic monitoring and evaluation of lws in ca have been realized two main sources of uncertainty were present in this study first the number of available landsat images was spatiotemporally dependent negatively impacting the results for example 34 982 images were available from 1990 to 1999 while that number increased nearly fivefold from 2000 to 2020 to 184 630 additionally the number of high quality images in the eastern and western parts of the study area was significantly higher than that in the southern high mountains and northern kazakhstan due to the influence of clouds cloud shadows glaciers snow and the sensor itself although we used the interpolation method of adjacent years to compensate for the lack of image quality as much as possible it was still difficult to achieve 100 restoration of the actual situation which may reduce the accuracy of the surface water dataset we obtained therefore further efforts are needed in the future to overcome the low quality of the images second the accuracy of the lws estimation data in this study needs to be improved because the accuracy of srtm dem data is relatively low the continuity of data grid points is relatively poor which will have some impact on the estimation accuracy of water storage therefore higher precision elevation data are required in future water storage research work 4 2 variation in water storage in typical lakes and its possible causes according to the lsa extracted from landsat the map of annual scale water body inundation frequency if the minlwsc over the past 31 years and the minlsa of the lake in different periods are depicted in fig 13 the changes in different types of lakes in ca have obvious spatial differences the aral sea is a typical tail end lake in ca the if in the northern and western parts of the aral sea is relatively high and that in the central and eastern parts is relatively low indicating that the changes in the aral sea during the whole period mainly occurred in the central and eastern regions in 2000 the aral sea began to shrink rapidly the average reduction in its minlws was as high as 85 gt and its minlsa shrank by approximately 67 6 the temperature in the aral sea basin was rising rapidly and the temperature rate increase was as high as 0 35 c 10 yr 1 yang et al 2020 the rapid increase in temperature accelerated the evaporation of the lake surface which led to the rapid shrinkage of the aral sea moreover since 1960 23 dams have been constructed in the adb and sdb yang et al 2020 mainly for agricultural irrigation by 2000 the irrigated areas in the aral sea basin had increased to 8 1 104 km2 the construction of dams and the large scale increase in the irrigated areas have led to a sharp decrease in the amount of water entering the aral sea fig s22 which may be the main reason for its dramatic shrinkage bosten lake is one of the most important throughput lakes in ca the main body of bosten lake has a high if while there is a low if in the huangshuigou and small lake areas the changes in bosten lake are mainly affected by the ecological water conveyance project since the 1990 s the gradual warming and humidification of the xinjiang climate have driven the kaidu river into a wet period the runoff from 1996 to 2000 was 4 24 109 m3 yr 1 yao et al 2018b while the amount of agricultural water intake was only one quarter of that value 1 053 109 m3 yr 1 yao et al 2018a and the minlsa increased by an average of 2 47 from april 2000 to november 2020 21 ecological water transfers to the lower reaches of the tarim river through bosten lake were performed with an average water transfer of approximately 40 22 107 m3 and a cumulative water transfer of 84 46 108 m3 fig s23 successful implementation of the water delivery project caused bosten lake to shrink dramatically and the minlws decreased by 30 57 gt on average an average reduction of 2 91 compared with that before implementation of the project issyk kul lake is a typical alpine lake in ca the if of the lake is high overall and only the fracturing small water bodies in the marginal area have a relatively small if which indicates that the changes in the lake are relatively small from 1990 to 1997 the minlws of the lake decreased slowly with an average reduction of approximately 6 06 gt after 1997 the lake began to expand especially in 2005 the lake expansion was relatively large with the minlws increasing by 7 35 gt from 2002 to 2005 the glacier area in the issyk kul basin decreased from 520 km2 to 458 km2 zhang et al 2022 the massive shrinking of the glacier area could have led to the expansion of lake issyk kul therefore glacier meltwater is a key factor affecting the changes in lake issyk kul 4 3 lake environmental changes and their ecological impact the natural ecology in ca changes with regional water resources and climate change cropland expansion rapid population growth and changes in water consuming economic activities have altered the regional hydrological environment over the past decades changing the operation of the regional social ecosystem in the present study typical watersheds such as the asb elb and blb portray the impacts of human activity on regional lws and the environment the aral sea plays an important role in the socioeconomic development and ecosystem stability of ca first it is essential for irrigation of wheat rice and cotton in ca and the total irrigated area in the basin has also been increasing similarly a large number of dams and reservoirs have been built in the basin since 1960 and these reservoirs are mostly used for irrigation only a fraction are used for power generation and flood control yang et al 2020 therefore the increases in irrigated area and dam reservoir construction may be driving the sudden drop in lws of the aral sea after 2000 additionally the population of ca has grown from 24 to 98 million since 1960 increasing residential water demand and further accelerating the reduction in lws the aral sea is the tail end lake of the amu darya and syr darya and its lws varies with the amount of water entering the lake exacerbating its shrinkage in addition to socioeconomic impacts ecological consequences have resulted from the reductions in aral sea lws most notably the formation of the aral kum desert it is estimated that 43 75 million tons of sand and dust blow out of the aral sea every year saiko and zonn 2000 making it one of the most important sources of dust in the world groll et al 2013 this not only worsens global desertification but also threatens global ecological balance ebinur lake is the largest saltwater lake in xinjiang and together with the surrounding wetlands is regarded as the core area of the oasis desert system on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains ge et al 2016 at present ebinur lake relies on the jinghe and bortala rivers for water recharge wang et al 2019a b however climate change increasing population and the continuous expansion of the oasis area have led to a decrease in regional surface runoff liu et al 2015 and reduced ebinur lws this decline in lws has caused a serious ecological degradation of the fragile ecosystem ge et al 2016 and presently serves as a prime example of ecological degradation in xinjiang jing et al 2020 wang et al 2017a b although the ebinur lws reached its maximum in 2017 the ecological effects require further study for example research has shown that soil salinity in the elb decreases with increasing lake levels wang et al 2019a b the elb soil types are primarily sand and sandy loam liu et al 2011 and under the strong winds of the alataw pass evapotranspiration in the elb has increased therefore lws shrinkage in ebinur lake may lead to intensified local soil salinization furthermore the prevailing westerly winds have caused salty sand and dust to move eastwards damaging the ecology of the hexi corridor and the entire north china plain liu et al 2015 the rapid reduction in the ebinur lws has also threatened local socioeconomic development hao et al 2019 wang et al 2017a b to help protect the regional and oasis ecosystems in the junggar basin the ebinur lake wetland nature reserve of xinjiang has been included in the list of china s national nature reserves jing et al 2020 and this has gradually improved the lws reductions in ebinur lake in recent years bosten lake is one of china s most populous inland lakes with the highest water resource utilization rate in the country owing to the continuous development and utilization of water resources in recent decades the environment of the blb has gradually deteriorated guo et al 2015 threatening the stability of the ecological system regional agricultural development outside of the oases has resulted in an associated increase in water diversion for irrigation additionally the built up area of the blb in 2000 was 0 2 but rapid urbanization doubled this value by 2015 yang et al 2019 this rapid urbanization has intensified regional water consumption contributing to the sharp decline in the bosten lws from 2011 to 2013 fig s20 in addition the shrinkage of bosten lake was closely related to the ecological water transport project proposed by the chinese government in 2000 to alleviate the environmental crisis caused by the disappearing tarim river 2 552 109 m3 of water was transported from bosten lake between 2000 and 2019 zhang et al 2020 during this project the bosten lws shrank significantly resulting in a series of ecological problems such as lake eutrophication soil salinization in irrigation areas wetland degradation and increasing lake water salinity dai et al 2020 y liu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 detrimentally affecting the stability and ecological service functions of the river basin although the project was concluded in 2011 and ecological conditions in the blb improved the project was reimplemented in 2019 accordingly environmental monitoring and protection of the blb should be strengthened in the coming years to guard the ecosystem from further secondary damage 5 conclusions based on srtm dem data and a time series of landsat images from 1990 to 2020 the current study investigated 9 619 lakes watersheds area 10 km2 in ca the spatiotemporal dynamics of maxlws and minlws in ca were quantitatively assessed as were the influences of environmental factors and their interannual variability on lws the changing characteristics of lws according to lake type and altitude were also examined ultimately providing a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and influencing factors of lws in ca over the past 31 years first from 1990 to 2020 the maxlws of 4 499 lakes and minlws of 6 954 lakes decreased by approximately 27 94 and 144 21 gt respectively moreover lws above 3 500 m expanded while that below 3 500 m shrunk second human activities were highly associated with the changing trends in both maxlws and minlws specifically human activities were more important than climate change in lwsc with population explaining 96 of lwsc in the brb finally lws shrinkage primarily occurred in the tail end lakes because of the continuous expansion of croplands rapidly growing populations increasing scales of farming activities in the plains and oasis areas and diversion for irrigation of a substantial amount of water destined to recharge lakes all of these factors have the potential to further intensify the contradiction between water supply and demand in ca intensify the competition for surface water resources and trigger a series of water conflicts if socioeconomic development in ca continues in accordance with current population growth models and agricultural production methods a series of ecological and environmental issues could threaten the hydrological and ecological stability of the region hindering future sustainable development therefore the results of this study provide a thorough scientific reference for the comprehensive planning and management of regional water resources in ca which is conducive to solving the contradiction between water supply and demand and maintaining the balance of

2749,there are extensive and fragile mountain oasis desert ecosystems in central asia lakes are not only the most important water resources in arid central asia but also important resources for maintaining the unique ecosystem of the region as most lakes in central asia lack in situ monitoring data and satellite altimetry records are relatively short term the continuous long term monitoring of lake water storage change lwsc in central asia is inadequate to this end shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model data were used in conjunction with all available landsat images to construct an empirical model of area elevation storage changes and estimate the maximum lwsc maxlwsc and minimum lwsc minlwsc of 9 619 lakes watershed area 10 km2 in central asia from 1990 to 2020 subsequently the random forest rf algorithm was used to quantitatively evaluate the associations among climate change human activities and lwsc it was revealed that maxlwsc and minlwsc decreased by 27 94 and 144 21 gt respectively the results also revealed that lwsc varied by elevation whereby lakes below 3 500 m shrunk and those above 3 500 m expanded the rf findings demonstrated that human activities are more important than climate change for lwsc in central asia up to 96 of lwsc can be explained by human activities this study comprehensively evaluates the characteristics of lwsc in central asia providing the latest data to help alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand in central asia and resolve cross border water resource disputes so as to realize the

available on request 1 introduction lakes are an essential component of the hydrological cycle pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2015 as they not only provide water for local residents but play a critical role in sustaining human habitats and stabilizing ecosystems particularly in arid areas with fragile environments klein et al 2014 tan et al 2018 an abundance of such lakes is located in central asia ca among which 15 000 of them are 0 01 km2 the total lake area in ca exceeds 90 000 km2 making it one of the densest regions for lakes in the world lehner and döll 2004 in addition to providing an important regional water resource in the arid semi arid regions of ca lakes are sensitive indicators of climate and environmental changes adrian et al 2009 over the past few decades water levels surface water area and lake water storage lws in ca have undergone drastic changes due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities ultimately causing a series of ecological disasters huang et al 2021a narama et al 2018 yang et al 2020 lws shows obvious spatiotemporal patterns reflecting the stability of the regional environment including climate hydrology topography and human disturbance additionally water conflicts in ca are amongst the most serious in the world duan et al 2020 zhupankhan et al 2018 and the reduction in surface water resources e g lws may exacerbate these disputes chen et al 2018 didovets et al 2021 threatening regional progress accordingly an accurate estimation of lake water storage change lwsc over time can help decipher the local hydrological cycle dynamics assess the corresponding impacts of climate change and human activities and assist with resolving water conflicts through more efficient and orderly resource use present studies on ca lakes have primarily focused on monitoring surface water dynamics for example yang et al 2020 analyzed the lake area dynamics of the aral sea based on multi source satellite images including landsat modis and spot in 2020 revealing that the aral sea area decreased sharply by 60 000 km2 from 1960 to 2018 elsewhere a 30 m surface water dataset was used to investigate the dynamics of water bodies in ca from 1990 to 2019 huang et al 2021a although these studies promoted the application of remote sensing in surface water monitoring they primarily focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water bodies however because of differences in surrounding topography the dynamics of lake surface area lsa alone cannot fully reflect a lake s response to climate change alternatively the dynamics of lws more adequately represent the actual changes under different climatic conditions qiao et al 2019 yet the spatiotemporal lws dynamics of ca have not been fully assessed such a detailed assessment of lwscs would help inform the sustainable management of water resources in ca and provide new ideas for arid and semi arid regions to address the challenges brought about by climate change changes in lws are most commonly estimated by combining the lake level and lsa but a lack or discontinuity of in situ water level measurements inhibits this process on site monitoring of lake water levels is both time and labor intensive with lakes often located sporadically throughout areas with harsh environments in developing countries gao 2015 recently the rapid development of remote sensing technology has proliferated products that can measure surface water areas and levels offering efficient and cost effective methods for evaluating lws crétaux et al 2016 because of their relatively high spatial resolution and the long term continuity of the landsat satellite series in addition to the open access of radar and laser altimeter satellite data including jason 1 icesat glas and envisat these imagers have been widely used for mapping lakes and other surface water bodies in addition to monitoring water level changes in lakes and reservoirs carabajal and boy 2021 jiang et al 2017 okeowo et al 2017 shu et al 2021 presently most methods of estimating lws involve combining the water surface area identified by the spectral sensor with the water level data obtained by the altimeter satellite for example song et al 2013 estimated the lws of the tibetan plateau regional water bodies based on water level data 2003 2009 provided by icesat glas combined with landsat imagery luo et al 2021 similarly performed fine scale estimations of lake levels and lwscs on the tibetan plateau based on icesat and icesat 2 satellite data although these studies have made important contributions to the estimation of lws their application in lwsc assessment is limited by the remote sensing data fang et al 2019 for example lidar altimeter satellite data have high applicability for monitoring large lakes but over a relatively short timescale e g icesat data are only available from 2003 to 2009 in addition because of the complexity of lake environments fully monitoring lwscs through radar altimetry data alone is difficult to summarize previous lws research has mainly focused on lakes in a single area and the study timescales were relatively short nasa successfully launched the shuttle radar topography mission srtm in 2000 and has modeled 80 of the global land surface elevation including ca as the derived digital elevation models dems include bathymetric data they have been widely employed for lws estimation fang et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 qiao and zhu 2019 through the extraction of lsa and water levels from the dem and the construction of an empirical relationship model to estimate lwscs indeed the use of dems for estimating lwscs has recently garnered increased attention for example bonnema and hossain 2017 evaluated the lwscs of 20 reservoirs in the mekong river basin tan et al 2020 similarly explored lwscs in poyang lake based on landsat modis and dem data and zhang et al 2021 estimated the lwscs of 1 132 lakes of the tibetan plateau based on landsat and dem data in addition grace satellite data are basically composed of soil moisture glaciers snow water equivalent lake water and groundwater in the region xiang et al 2016 and changes in a certain factor will cause changes in mass in the region for instance zhang et al 2013 estimated the water storage changes of 117 lakes in the tibetan plateau and the findings showed that the increase in lws contributed 61 to the increase in mass provided by grace therefore it is necessary to explore the relationship between changes in lws and grace data previous studies using satellite images to estimate lws usually used quadratic equations to fit the relationship between lsa and water storage changes and this method is more suitable to areas characterized by increased water storage however under the combined influence of climate change and human activities the water storage of many lakes in ca has decreased our study found that quadratic function fitting is not suitable for study areas where lake storage has decreased significantly the quadratic function is not monotonic and cannot guarantee monotonic changes in the area and storage of a lake therefore considering the environmental specificity of the arid region of ca this study adjusted the fitting method for lsa and lws from a quadratic function to a linear function to obtain a more accurate estimation of lwsc the overall objectives of the present study were to 1 construct a lake surface area elevation storage model based on multi source remote sensing data for the estimation of lwsc in ca using high precision datasets with a longer time series 2 evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in lws from multiple dimensions and correlate environmental effects across ca and 3 quantitatively assess the response mechanism of lwsc to climate change and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study ca refers to five countries kazakhstan tajikistan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan and the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in northwestern china fig 1 covering a total area of 5 7 106 km2 ca is deeply landlocked and forms the largest arid semi arid region in the northern hemisphere this region contains fragile ecosystems and a scarcity of freshwater resources li et al 2021 ca has a large number of lakes the larger of which are mainly distributed in alpine basins and piedmont areas such as the kunlun pamirs tianshan and altai mountains there are also a number of inland lakes in the lowlands and northern plains of kazakhstan the weather in ca is arid and rainless and lakes are primarily formed via glacial meltwater and montane precipitation in particular inland lakes located in arid or semi arid areas like those in ca are highly sensitive to climate change and small changes in physical and geographical environments can lead to dramatic changes in lws song et al 2014 lakes in ca are typical inland lakes in arid areas and the changes in water level and storage reflect the characteristics of global climate change to analyze the spatial variation in lws the study area was divided into nine watersheds according to hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org irtysh river basin irb manas river basin mrb baiyang river basin brb tarim river basin trb ural river basin urb syr darya basin sdb balkhash lake basin blb amu darya basin adb and uzboy river basin uzrb 2 2 multi temporal landsat images since 1984 multi temporal images from the series of landsat satellites have been used to map surface water pekel et al 2016 thus providing the longest and most comprehensive earth observation data worldwide in the present study all available landsat images from 1990 to 2020 on google earth engine gee were used to map lsa across ca the entire study area contained 364 scenes among which 64 683 landsat 5 101 493 landsat 7 and 53 436 landsat 8 images were acquired total of 219 612 images fig s1 the number of high quality observations in ca varied spatially fig s2 occurring most frequently at the east west extremes lower in the north of kazakhstan and lowest in the tianshan and kunlun mountains statistically the effective observation area for each watershed was relatively high reaching 100 in some locations adb and brb and accounting for 80 of each watershed at different times within the entire study area ultimately the quality of the ca landsat images was high successfully meeting the requirements of this study due to interference from clouds cloud shadows snow cover and other factors some areas or periods were excluded the interpolation method of adjacent years was used to obtain missing images huang et al 2021a and obtain a high quality long time series set of lsa monitoring data details of the datasets used in this study are shown in table s1 2 2 1 srtm data the srtm dem is the first free global dem zhang et al 2019 with a resolution of 1 arc second 30 m the srtm sensor uses c band synthetic aperture radar sar to measure the heights of ground and non ground features because c band cannot penetrate dense vegetation or buildings srtm dem data represents either the top of the canopy elevations in these areas or that of the bare ground zhang et al 2019 the absolute height error of srtm dem data ranges from 5 6 to 9 0 m globally and is 6 6 m in eurasia rodríguez et al 2006 therefore the actual performance of the srtm data was much better than the expected results the dem characterized the elevation in ca as high in the east and low in the west fig s3 reaching a maximum in the kunlun and tianshan mountains 7 700 m qiao et al 2019 evaluated the consistency between the lsa estimated by srtm and landsat images finding that the correlation between the two across different sized areas was approximately 0 9 with most of them distributed near the 1 1 line in the present study only the relative elevation change was used to estimate the lwsc thus the srtm data were deemed sufficiently reliable 2 2 2 climate data the monthly terraclimate dataset resolution 1 24 was used to analyze historical climate change characteristics temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and snow water equivalent across ca from 1990 to 2020 fig s4 terraclimate uses climatically aided interpolation combining a high spatial resolution climatological normal from the worldclim dataset with coarser resolution time varying i e monthly data from other sources to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed vapor pressure and solar radiation abatzoglou et al 2018 terraclimate has been widely used in climate change and hydrological processes dubey et al 2021 kallio and kummu 2021 tian et al 2021 precipitation in most parts of ca has increased especially in kazakhstan fig s5a furthermore ca has warmed over the past 31 years particularly in western kazakhstan fig s5b simultaneously pet in western kazakhstan increased significantly p 0 05 while that in northern kazakhstan parts of turkmenistan and parts of the trb decreased the snow water equivalent in most parts of ca increased especially in the northeastern part of kazakhstan 2 2 3 land cover and population in addition to climate change increasing populations and croplands place tremendous stress on water demand in ca annual land cover data from 1992 to 2020 were acquired from the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci https www esa landcover cci org this commonly employed dataset maintains a 300 m spatial resolution and is divided into 22 categories according to the classification system of the united nations food and agriculture organization unfao duan et al 2020 liu et al 2018 reinhart et al 2021 population densities were obtained from the global human settlement layer ghsl dataset provided by the european commission https ghsl jrc ec europa eu index php and the population density v 4 11 dataset provided by nasa https sedac ciesin columbia edu both with a spatial resolution of 1 km 2 3 methods 2 3 1 lsa extraction the modified normalized difference water index mndwi has been shown to be the most effective method for extracting surface water information based on green and short wave infrared reflectance values xu 2006 because of its ability to effectively reduce underlying noise this method has been widely employed in surface water body research huang et al 2021b wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 however this index has difficulty distinguishing between water bodies and vegetation ji et al 2009 primarily creating vegetation based classification errors santoro et al 2015 accordingly a combination of the three indices mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi has obtained higher precision surface water information mcfeeters 1996 xiao et al 2005 xu 2006 an evi 0 1 can eliminate the interference of vegetation on water bodies thus a combination of two constraints

1 n y i 1 n y ω y i 100 where f is the water frequency of the pixel y is the specified year ny is the number of total landsat observations of the pixel in that year and i indicates whether an observation of the pixel is water where 1 means water and 0 means non water to analyze changes in maximum lws maxlws and minimum lws minlws the maximum lsa maxlsa and minimum lsa minlsa of all lakes in different basins of ca were assessed according to previous research zou et al 2017 when the water frequency fw is 25 the pixel is classified as effective surface water i e the maximum surface water area for that year the latest study on surface water bodies in ca found that 68 of the fw threshold was applicable to the classification of permanent and seasonal water bodies in ca huang et al 2021a therefore 25 and 68 thresholds were used to differentiate ca maximum 25 fw 100 and minimum 68 fw 100 lake water bodies further existing research has shown that the extraction of surface water areas in ca based on landsat imagery has high accuracy huang et al 2021a to further determine the accuracy of the data in this study we compared the lsa obtained in this study with the joint research centre jrc data text s1 2 3 2 estimation model for lwsc there is a strong correlation between lake water levels and lsa qiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 assuming that there is a regular lake basin underwater conical or cup shaped the lake topography can be regarded as a continuation of the water topography with similar characteristics song et al 2013 conducted a pearson correlation analysis of 13 sample points on the tibetan plateau revealing a tight relationship between the water level and lsa 0 964 99 confidence level therefore by constructing a functional relationship between the lake elevation above the water surface water surface area and the changes in lws a functional relationship model between lws and the corresponding surface area can be derived fig 2 the specific model construction steps were as follows 1 boundaries of 9 619 lakes in ca were extracted based on hydrosheds 2 the lsas of ca in 2000 ssrtm were extracted based on the srtm dem data and the corresponding height represented as h0 3 based on the dem of a single lake basin the area ssrtm i i represents the height from h0 i 1 2 n of different elevation planes with 1 m intervals above the lake surface h0 was calculated and a functional relationship between the area ssrtm i and hi was established table 1 columns 1 3 and 4 the increment of the lws from hi to h0 table 1 columns 3 5 was calculated according to eq 5 5 δ v 1 3 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 δ h where δ v represents the change in lws over the two periods s1 and s2 represent the lsa in each of the two periods and δh represents the change in lake water level accordingly the change in lws relative to the year 2000 was estimated 5 an empirical linear relationship between the lsa and lwsc was constructed δ v a s b fig 3 6 the annual surface water areas of all lakes in ca were extracted based on the time series of landsat images and 7 by substituting the lsa data extracted in step 6 into the formula fitted in step 5 the annual changes in lws in ca were estimated the accuracy verification of the lws estimation based on srtm is shown text s2 2 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis sen s slope can be used as a nonparametric method for evaluating the trends in a univariate time series fernandes et al 2005 and owing to its lack of sensitivity to outliers has been widely employed in hydrological and meteorological research gocic and trajkovic 2013 huang et al 2021b mullick et al 2019 therefore sen s slope methods were used for analyzing the trends in historic climate change in ca and correlated lwscs random forest rf is a tree based machine learning algorithm that not only classifies and regresses datasets but also evaluates the importance of variables and explains the effect of independent variables on dependent variables breiman 2001 the rf algorithm was used in this study to assess the importance of six environmental factors to lwsc in ca fig s10 the importance of feature variables was calculated as follows 6 im p var i 1 n j 1 n erroob 2 ij e r r o o b 1 ij where im p var i is the importance of feature variable i erroob 1 ij is the out of bag data error of variable i erroob 2 ij is the error calculated from the out of bag data altered by added noise and n is the total number of trees 3 results 3 1 lsa and lws changes 3 1 1 characteristics of lsa variations a total of 9 619 lakes were investigated overall the lake water area in ca varies greatly but the confluence area of most lakes is 1 km2 5 907 lakes lake area 1 km2 there are four large lakes balkhash lake 18 000 km2 aral sea 8 700 km2 issyk kul lake 6 200 km2 and bosten lake 1 600 km2 which are located in the blb adb sdb and trb respectively at the watershed scale table s2 the irb has the largest number of lakes 3 394 covering a total area of 11 080 5 km2 the urb has the second greatest number 2 224 lakes spanning 8433 3 km2 the largest lsa among the nine watersheds the lake area in the sdb is the largest at approximately 12 131 1 km2 the number of lakes in the brb is the smallest 23 encompassing a total lake area of only 53 3 km2 the time series trend figures of maxlsa and minlsa in ca from 1990 to 2020 are presented in fig 4 at the watershed scale the lsa trends for each period in most basins were consistent except for sdb irb and mrb the maxlsa and minlsa of urb mrb brb and adb all showed a decreasing trend with adb showing the greatest shrinkage rate approximately 280 23 and 556 72 km2 yr 1 respectively this elevated rate of shrinkage was driven by the rapid losses of the aral sea in recent years su et al 2021 in comparison the observed maxlsa and minlsa shrinkage rate in the brb was relatively slow 0 43 and 0 72 km2 yr 1 respectively in contrast the maxlsa and minlsa of the blb trb and uzrb all showed an increasing trend with the latter basin showing the fastest rate of increase among them the lsa of the uzrb increased the fastest expanding by 1 253 27 and 1 666 57 km2 over the past 31 years at rates of 40 43 km2 yr 1 maxlsa and 53 76 km2 yr 1 minlsa respectively the lsa of the trb had the slowest expansion rate at 3 98 and 1 56 km2 yr 1 in maxlsa and minlsa respectively overall the maxlsa of ca decreased by 6 171 72 km2 over the analysis period fig s11 largely driven by the significant decrease observed in the adb a similar decreasing trend was observed for the minlsa 18 626 63 km2 3 1 2 characteristics of lwsc overall the maxlws in ca showed a fluctuating decrease of 27 94 gt from 1990 to 2020 fig 5 with a shrinkage rate of 0 9 gt yr 1 1 gt 1 km3 with the assumption that lake water density 1000 kg m 3 whereas the minlws decreased by 144 21 gt at a rate of 4 65 gt yr 1 5 times that of maxlws more specifically the maxlws increased at a rate of 4 72 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 2003 after which it began to decrease at a rate of 1 81 gt yr 1 the maximum lwsc maxlwsc in 2003 120 gt maintained the largest proportion of the total change in maxlwsc 2017 34 gt 5 95 followed by that in 2000 5 33 in terms of minlws this increased rapidly from 1990 to 1997 at a rate of 13 34 gt yr 1 and then began to shrink at a rate of 7 32 gt yr 1 among them the minimum lwsc minlwsc in 2020 172 17 gt accounted for the largest proportion of the total change in minlwsc 2013 65 gt 8 55 followed by that in 2014 8 38 spatially the maxlws of 4 499 lakes nearly half of them decreased from 1990 to 2020 fig 6 primarily distributed across four basins urb blb brb and adb this trend was most prominent in the adb where the total lsa lost was 8 687 06 km2 table s3 at a rate of 280 23 km2 yr 1 fig s12 the lws of adb decreased by 106 02 gt over the past 31 years equating to a rate of 3 42 gt yr 1 the maxlsa of blb increased by 184 29 km2 5 94 km2 yr 1 while its lws decreased by 0 38 gt 0 01 gt yr 1 additionally the maxlws of some small lakes along the coast of the caspian sea and northern kazakhstan shrank by various degrees over the analysis period however the maxlws of sdb irb mrb trb and uzrb expanded among them the maxlws in the uzrb increased the most totaling 71 76 gt 2 31 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 2020 whereas the maxlws in the mrb expanded the least totaling 0 031 gt 0 001 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 2020 notably the lsa over the same period decreased by 11 82 km2 0 38 km2 yr 1 in the mrb at the same time since lake water is an important part of terrestrial water storage changes in lws are closely related to changes in mass in the region for the correlation analysis between lwscs and mass in ca see text s3 from 1990 to 2020 the minlws of 6 954 lakes 75 of them decreased mainly distributed in the urb irb sdb blb brb and adb among them the adb underwent the largest reduction 186 31 gt 6 01 gt yr 1 during the same period the minlsa decreased by 17 258 38 km2 556 72 km2 yr 1 in contrast the minlws reduction in the urb sdb irb blb and brb decreased by 13 50 15 89 12 61 0 64 and 0 91 gt respectively 0 02 to 0 51 gt yr 1 over the same period the minlsa of the urb sdb irb mrb and brb also decreased with the urb showing the greatest decrease 1 525 06 km2 49 20 km yr 1 the minlsa of the irb decreased by 1 342 59 km2 43 31 km2 yr 1 whereas the brb maintained the lowest level of minlws reduction at 22 41 km2 0 72 km2 yr 1 although the minlws of the blb declined the basin s lsa increased 54 8 km2 1 77 km2 yr 1 over the same period consistent with the basin changes observed in the maxlws the maxlws and minlws also had significant changes over the investigated timeframe fig s13 see supplementary material for details text s4 in summary the lws of ca showed a decreasing trend the reduction rate of minlws was much higher than that of maxlws in addition the reduction rates of both maxlws and minlws in the adb were the highest among the nine basins examined primarily because of the continuous shrinkage of the aral sea area under the combined effects of climate change and human activities since the 1960 s jia et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in addition regardless of the maximum or minimum surface area and water storage change the lsa and lws of the blb changed in opposite directions this phenomenon is likely the result of the expansion of lsa in shallow sloping small lakes thus no accompanying increase in lws was observed accordingly it is difficult for changes in lsa to truly reflect the response of lakes to climate change and the topographical characteristics of lakes must be considered for an accurate representation to analyze the weight of each basin s contribution to the total changes observed in ca the percent changes in lsa and lws both maximum and minimum for each basin were compared with their respective total changes in terms of maxlsa its change in the adb constituted 58 50 of the total across ca 511 33 km2 followed by that in the sdb 12 95 while changes in the brb accounted for the smallest proportion 0 08 fig s15a similarly for minlsa the change in the adb constituted 63 25 of the total followed by that in the sdb 9 72 and the brb accounted for the least 0 08 fig s15b the changes in maxlws across ca were also concentrated in the adb 47 00 followed by those in the uzrb 29 16 and the brb again accounted for the smallest proportion 0 21 fig s15c the changes in minlws were primarily concentrated in the adb accounting for 53 72 of the total change followed by those in the sdb 21 68 the brb contributed the least 0 25 fig s15d overall the dominance of the adb to the total changes observed in ca indicates the importance of the aral sea and its sensitivity to climate change and human activities 3 2 lwsc by altitude to analyze the patterns of lws by elevation all lakes in ca were categorized into nine different altitudinal groups as shown in table s4 the number of lakes varied by altitude with the most being distributed between 120 and 200 m 1729 lakes and the least being above 3 500 m 204 lakes the maxlws in lakes at altitudes of 0 200 m and 400 1000 m shrank fig 7 a and lakes with altitudes of 0 80 m and 80 120 m saw the largest reductions from 1990 to 2020 41 02 gt 1 32 gt yr 1 and 14 99 gt 0 48 gt yr 1 respectively comparatively the maxlws of lakes situated at 400 1000 m showed a lesser degree of reduction 1 94 gt 0 06 gt yr 1 the maxlws of lakes at altitudes of 200 400 m and 1 000 m increased in particular lakes above 3 500 m experienced the greatest increase over the analysis period at 9 69 gt 0 31 gt yr 1 additionally with an increase in altitude the reduction rate of maxlws gradually slowed fig 7a the minlws increased only in lakes above 3 500 m by 12 77 gt 0 41 gt yr 1 whereas in lakes below 3 500 m the minlws shrank at different rates with the reduction rate gradually decreasing at higher altitudes lakes at an elevation of 0 80 m experienced the greatest decrease 122 44 gt 3 95 gt yr 1 the minlws reduction rate at elevations of 200 300 m was relatively low 0 13 gt 0 004 gt yr 1 in summary both maxlws and minlws in the 0 80 m elevation range had the highest reductions there are likely three main reasons for this phenomenon first there are many oases distributed at altitudes of 200 400 m and as the agricultural water consumption levels here are large less water is available downstream second lakes in ca mostly rely on alpine ice and snow melt for replenishment and the lower the altitude the greater the evaporation thus evaporation loss at the lowest altitudes is greatest resulting in less replenishment water finally as the aral sea is within the altitude range of 0 80 m its rapid lws loss drives a significant proportion of the shrinkage observed in this range in addition the lwsc rate gradually increased with altitude and the maxlws and minlws of lakes located above 3500 m expanded during 1990 2020 with a total expansion of approximately 22 46 gt this is likely driven by the increasing summer temperatures in tianshan since 1970 resulting in a total loss of glacial area of 10 wang et al 2019a b moreover the number of snow days in the middle of the tianshan mountains also decreased from 2001 to 2015 tang et al 2017 further increasing the water supply of the upper montane the percentage of lwsc observed at each altitudinal range was then compared to the total lwsc observed across ca fig 7b and c for maxlws changes at 0 80 m accounted for the greatest proportion 50 1 followed by those at 80 120 m 18 3 while changes between 1000 and 3500 m accounted for the lowest proportion 1 similarly minlwsc between 0 and 80 m accounted for the largest proportion of the total change observed 67 5 while lakes at 200 300 m accounted for the lowest proportion 0 1 the percentage of lwsc at other altitudes was relatively low 9 maximum above 3500 m temporally the lws at different altitudes presented different trends fig s16 see supplementary material for details text s5 3 3 lwsc of typical inland lakes according to the basin type and water supply the lakes were divided into mountain tail end and throughput lakes in order to discuss the lws patterns of these different lake types in ca 18 representative lakes within the region were selected six mountain lakes seven tail end lakes and five throughput lakes table s5 mountain lakes occur in high mountains or low lying plateaus and some are supplied by stable mountain glaciers these lakes are relatively less affected by human activities and can thus truly reflect the process of regional climate change tail end lakes are mainly distributed in plain areas with frequent human activities and these lakes are mainly supplied by river runoff throughput lakes are located at junctions of mountains and plains and lake water storage here is mainly affected by regional precipitation and the inflow volumes of upstream rivers from 1990 to 2020 the mountain lws expanded while the lws of tail end and throughput lakes shrank fig 8 the montane maxlws initially shrank 0 96 gt yr 1 from 1990 to 1997 before fluctuating and expanding 0 28 gt yr 1 thereafter achieving a total increase of 6 02 gt over the past 31 years fig 8a the montane minlws shrank 1 23 gt yr 1 before 1997 and then began to continuously expand increasing by 7 16 gt over the analysis period fig 8b since 1990 the average temperature in the tianshan mountains has increased by 0 36 0 42 c decade 1 hu et al 2014 and regional glaciers have rapidly melted as a result huang et al 2021c hence the minlws has increased in regions more reliant on glacial melt water replenishment wang et al 2016 the maxlws minlws of tail end lakes expanded rapidly by 7 62 gt yr 1 7 79 gt yr 1 before 2000 fig 8c d and continuously decreased thereafter ultimately shrinking by 35 54 gt 109 35 gt over the entire analysis period accounting for 59 66 of the total changes recorded in ca fig s17 it can be seen that the reduction in lws in ca mainly occurred in tail end lakes as shown in fig s18 the water supply in uzbekistan has been decreasing continuously since 2004 with an average annual decrease of approximately 33 106 m3 the adb in uzbekistan is facing severe water supply and demand contradictions threatening the regional ecological environment especially in the aral sea basin wang et al 2022 the rapid reduction in the tail end lakes further accelerated the reduction in adb water supply intensifying the regional water supply and demand contradiction cropland areas and populations have increased in ca especially after 2000 fig s19 large scale farming activities in the plains and oases have intensified a large number of rivers have been blocked or diverted for irrigation and substantial alterations have occurred in the amount of water entering lakes in the middle and lower reaches of basins ultimately resulting in a significant reduction in tail end lws together the amu darya and syr darya account for 90 of the annual runoff into the aral sea and 75 of the agricultural water consumed in ca with the continuous expansion of cotton planting in ca throughout the 1960 s the area of water diversion and irrigation in the aral sea basin expanded from 4 51 104 km2 in the 1960 s to 7 61 104 km2 by the 1990 s saiko and zonn 2000 exacerbating the hydrological imbalance of the aral sea basin and causing rapid shrinkage of its lws the maxlws and minlws of throughput lakes was relatively stable over the analysis period fig 8e f decreasing by 2 2 gt 0 07 gt yr 1 and 1 82 gt 0 06 gt yr 1 respectively bosten lake is the largest inland freshwater throughput lake in china and its lws constitutes 72 of the total lws of the typical throughput lake in ca fig s20 both the maxlws and minlws of bosten lake have decreased over the past 31 years 3 4 relationships between lwsc and lake size to explore the internal relationships between lwscs and lake size the lakes were divided into six categories according to their lake area namely 50 km2 9493 lakes 50 100 km2 59 lakes 100 200 km2 26 lakes 200 500 km2 20 lakes 500 1000 km2 9 lakes and 1000 km2 12 lakes according to the lake area data provided by hydrolakes lakes with an area of 50 km2 comprise approximately 20 632 28 km2 accounting for 15 84 of the total lake area while lakes with an area of 1000 km2 comprise approximately 88 533 km2 accounting for 67 96 of the total area of lakes in ca as shown in fig s21 from 1990 to 2020 the maxlsa of lakes of 50 100 km2 200 500 km2 and 1000 km2 decreased over the past 31 years the reductions were 38 44 km2 232 81 km2 and 6156 29 km2 respectively of which lakes with an area 1000 km2 accounted for the largest change 92 12 during the same period the maxlsa of 50 km2 100 200 km2 and 500 1000 km2 lakes showed an increasing trend of which the 100 200 km2 lakes increased the fastest with an average annual increase of approximately 4 49 km2 this increase accounted for approximately 2 08 of the total increase in lake surface area in ca similarly from 1990 to 2020 only lakes with areas of 200 500 km2 and 1000 km2 experienced a decreasing maxlws among them lakes with an area of 200 500 km2 experienced the fastest decrease in maxlws with an average annual reduction of approximately 0 24 gt and a reduction of approximately 7 44 gt over the past 31 years accounting for 35 29 fig 10 of the maxlws change in ca during the same period except for lakes with areas of 100 200 km2 and 500 1000 km2 the minlws of lakes of all sizes showed a shrinking trend fig 9 among these the minlws of lakes with an area of 1000 km2 shrank the fastest with an average annual decrease of approximately 3 47 gt and a total reduction of approximately 107 57 gt from 1990 to 2020 this decrease accounts for 68 58 of the total decrease in the minlws in ca in summary the changes in lakes in ca are mainly reflected by the changes in large lakes and the changes in lakes having areas 1000 km2 account for up to 92 12 of the total changes in ca 3 5 key driving factors of lwscs to quantitatively assess the impact of climate changes and human activities on lwsc in ca the rf algorithm was used to rank factor importance the extent to which the above six environmental factors explain the changes in the maximum fig 11 a and minimum fig 11b water storage of lakes in ca was determined as shown in fig 11 there are significant spatial differences in the importance of the six driving factors of lwsc in ca overall human activities are more important than climate change for lwscs specifically population explains 96 of lwsc in the brb precipitation is the climatic factor that has the greatest impact on lwsc but only explains 48 of maxlwsc in the mrb on the watershed scale pet temperature and precipitation together explained 65 of the maxlwsc in the urb precipitation and population explained 49 of the maxlwsc in the sdb and population and pet explained 43 of the maxlwsc in the irb in the blb population and temperature explained 47 of the maxlwsc precipitation was the most important factor for maxlwsc in the mrb explaining 48 of the maxlwsc within the basin population had the greatest impact on maxlwsc in the brb trb adb and uzrb particularly in the brb population explained 94 of the maxlwsc in the basin the responses of maxlwsc and minlwsc to climate change and human activities are different compared with maxlwsc the importance of human activities to minlwsc was relatively high especially in the urb srb brb trb adb and uzrb population explained up to 96 of the minlwsc in these basins brb in the mrb population precipitation and cropland area together explained 69 of the minlwsc generally population is the key driving factor affecting lwsc in ca and cropland and precipitation are main factors affecting lwsc temperature snow water equivalent and pet have relatively little influence on lwsc in ca 4 discussion 4 1 innovations and uncertainty in estimating lwsc in previous studies on estimating lws qiao et al 2019 qiao and zhu 2019 yang et al 2017 quadratic functions were generally used for fitting however this method is not necessarily applicable in arid areas for example fig 12 shows the fitting results of the water body area and lws of seletyteniz lake fig 12a shows the quadratic polynomial fitting result and fig 12b shows the linear fitting result it can be seen from the results that the r2 of the quadratic polynomial is 0 99 which is slightly higher than that of the linear fitting r2 0 93 however during the storage estimation process fig 12c when the surface area of seletyteniz lake is lower than that in 2000 881 km2 when using the quadratic polynomial model lws decreases erroneously with an increase in lsa however the linear fitting result fig 12d ensures that lws keeps increasing as the lake area increases therefore the linear function was used to fit the relationship between the water area and lws of ca lakes in this study this study is not a simple repetition of existing research methods but improves upon existing estimation methods by considering the environmental characteristics of the ca arid region thereby providing a scientific and reliable method for estimating lws in arid regions of ca in addition table 2 reveals that compared with existing studies the estimation of lws demand in this study not only guarantees long term timeframes but also achieves annual scale resolution and enables discussion of the variation characteristics of both maxlws and minlws thus systematic monitoring and evaluation of lws in ca have been realized two main sources of uncertainty were present in this study first the number of available landsat images was spatiotemporally dependent negatively impacting the results for example 34 982 images were available from 1990 to 1999 while that number increased nearly fivefold from 2000 to 2020 to 184 630 additionally the number of high quality images in the eastern and western parts of the study area was significantly higher than that in the southern high mountains and northern kazakhstan due to the influence of clouds cloud shadows glaciers snow and the sensor itself although we used the interpolation method of adjacent years to compensate for the lack of image quality as much as possible it was still difficult to achieve 100 restoration of the actual situation which may reduce the accuracy of the surface water dataset we obtained therefore further efforts are needed in the future to overcome the low quality of the images second the accuracy of the lws estimation data in this study needs to be improved because the accuracy of srtm dem data is relatively low the continuity of data grid points is relatively poor which will have some impact on the estimation accuracy of water storage therefore higher precision elevation data are required in future water storage research work 4 2 variation in water storage in typical lakes and its possible causes according to the lsa extracted from landsat the map of annual scale water body inundation frequency if the minlwsc over the past 31 years and the minlsa of the lake in different periods are depicted in fig 13 the changes in different types of lakes in ca have obvious spatial differences the aral sea is a typical tail end lake in ca the if in the northern and western parts of the aral sea is relatively high and that in the central and eastern parts is relatively low indicating that the changes in the aral sea during the whole period mainly occurred in the central and eastern regions in 2000 the aral sea began to shrink rapidly the average reduction in its minlws was as high as 85 gt and its minlsa shrank by approximately 67 6 the temperature in the aral sea basin was rising rapidly and the temperature rate increase was as high as 0 35 c 10 yr 1 yang et al 2020 the rapid increase in temperature accelerated the evaporation of the lake surface which led to the rapid shrinkage of the aral sea moreover since 1960 23 dams have been constructed in the adb and sdb yang et al 2020 mainly for agricultural irrigation by 2000 the irrigated areas in the aral sea basin had increased to 8 1 104 km2 the construction of dams and the large scale increase in the irrigated areas have led to a sharp decrease in the amount of water entering the aral sea fig s22 which may be the main reason for its dramatic shrinkage bosten lake is one of the most important throughput lakes in ca the main body of bosten lake has a high if while there is a low if in the huangshuigou and small lake areas the changes in bosten lake are mainly affected by the ecological water conveyance project since the 1990 s the gradual warming and humidification of the xinjiang climate have driven the kaidu river into a wet period the runoff from 1996 to 2000 was 4 24 109 m3 yr 1 yao et al 2018b while the amount of agricultural water intake was only one quarter of that value 1 053 109 m3 yr 1 yao et al 2018a and the minlsa increased by an average of 2 47 from april 2000 to november 2020 21 ecological water transfers to the lower reaches of the tarim river through bosten lake were performed with an average water transfer of approximately 40 22 107 m3 and a cumulative water transfer of 84 46 108 m3 fig s23 successful implementation of the water delivery project caused bosten lake to shrink dramatically and the minlws decreased by 30 57 gt on average an average reduction of 2 91 compared with that before implementation of the project issyk kul lake is a typical alpine lake in ca the if of the lake is high overall and only the fracturing small water bodies in the marginal area have a relatively small if which indicates that the changes in the lake are relatively small from 1990 to 1997 the minlws of the lake decreased slowly with an average reduction of approximately 6 06 gt after 1997 the lake began to expand especially in 2005 the lake expansion was relatively large with the minlws increasing by 7 35 gt from 2002 to 2005 the glacier area in the issyk kul basin decreased from 520 km2 to 458 km2 zhang et al 2022 the massive shrinking of the glacier area could have led to the expansion of lake issyk kul therefore glacier meltwater is a key factor affecting the changes in lake issyk kul 4 3 lake environmental changes and their ecological impact the natural ecology in ca changes with regional water resources and climate change cropland expansion rapid population growth and changes in water consuming economic activities have altered the regional hydrological environment over the past decades changing the operation of the regional social ecosystem in the present study typical watersheds such as the asb elb and blb portray the impacts of human activity on regional lws and the environment the aral sea plays an important role in the socioeconomic development and ecosystem stability of ca first it is essential for irrigation of wheat rice and cotton in ca and the total irrigated area in the basin has also been increasing similarly a large number of dams and reservoirs have been built in the basin since 1960 and these reservoirs are mostly used for irrigation only a fraction are used for power generation and flood control yang et al 2020 therefore the increases in irrigated area and dam reservoir construction may be driving the sudden drop in lws of the aral sea after 2000 additionally the population of ca has grown from 24 to 98 million since 1960 increasing residential water demand and further accelerating the reduction in lws the aral sea is the tail end lake of the amu darya and syr darya and its lws varies with the amount of water entering the lake exacerbating its shrinkage in addition to socioeconomic impacts ecological consequences have resulted from the reductions in aral sea lws most notably the formation of the aral kum desert it is estimated that 43 75 million tons of sand and dust blow out of the aral sea every year saiko and zonn 2000 making it one of the most important sources of dust in the world groll et al 2013 this not only worsens global desertification but also threatens global ecological balance ebinur lake is the largest saltwater lake in xinjiang and together with the surrounding wetlands is regarded as the core area of the oasis desert system on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains ge et al 2016 at present ebinur lake relies on the jinghe and bortala rivers for water recharge wang et al 2019a b however climate change increasing population and the continuous expansion of the oasis area have led to a decrease in regional surface runoff liu et al 2015 and reduced ebinur lws this decline in lws has caused a serious ecological degradation of the fragile ecosystem ge et al 2016 and presently serves as a prime example of ecological degradation in xinjiang jing et al 2020 wang et al 2017a b although the ebinur lws reached its maximum in 2017 the ecological effects require further study for example research has shown that soil salinity in the elb decreases with increasing lake levels wang et al 2019a b the elb soil types are primarily sand and sandy loam liu et al 2011 and under the strong winds of the alataw pass evapotranspiration in the elb has increased therefore lws shrinkage in ebinur lake may lead to intensified local soil salinization furthermore the prevailing westerly winds have caused salty sand and dust to move eastwards damaging the ecology of the hexi corridor and the entire north china plain liu et al 2015 the rapid reduction in the ebinur lws has also threatened local socioeconomic development hao et al 2019 wang et al 2017a b to help protect the regional and oasis ecosystems in the junggar basin the ebinur lake wetland nature reserve of xinjiang has been included in the list of china s national nature reserves jing et al 2020 and this has gradually improved the lws reductions in ebinur lake in recent years bosten lake is one of china s most populous inland lakes with the highest water resource utilization rate in the country owing to the continuous development and utilization of water resources in recent decades the environment of the blb has gradually deteriorated guo et al 2015 threatening the stability of the ecological system regional agricultural development outside of the oases has resulted in an associated increase in water diversion for irrigation additionally the built up area of the blb in 2000 was 0 2 but rapid urbanization doubled this value by 2015 yang et al 2019 this rapid urbanization has intensified regional water consumption contributing to the sharp decline in the bosten lws from 2011 to 2013 fig s20 in addition the shrinkage of bosten lake was closely related to the ecological water transport project proposed by the chinese government in 2000 to alleviate the environmental crisis caused by the disappearing tarim river 2 552 109 m3 of water was transported from bosten lake between 2000 and 2019 zhang et al 2020 during this project the bosten lws shrank significantly resulting in a series of ecological problems such as lake eutrophication soil salinization in irrigation areas wetland degradation and increasing lake water salinity dai et al 2020 y liu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 detrimentally affecting the stability and ecological service functions of the river basin although the project was concluded in 2011 and ecological conditions in the blb improved the project was reimplemented in 2019 accordingly environmental monitoring and protection of the blb should be strengthened in the coming years to guard the ecosystem from further secondary damage 5 conclusions based on srtm dem data and a time series of landsat images from 1990 to 2020 the current study investigated 9 619 lakes watersheds area 10 km2 in ca the spatiotemporal dynamics of maxlws and minlws in ca were quantitatively assessed as were the influences of environmental factors and their interannual variability on lws the changing characteristics of lws according to lake type and altitude were also examined ultimately providing a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and influencing factors of lws in ca over the past 31 years first from 1990 to 2020 the maxlws of 4 499 lakes and minlws of 6 954 lakes decreased by approximately 27 94 and 144 21 gt respectively moreover lws above 3 500 m expanded while that below 3 500 m shrunk second human activities were highly associated with the changing trends in both maxlws and minlws specifically human activities were more important than climate change in lwsc with population explaining 96 of lwsc in the brb finally lws shrinkage primarily occurred in the tail end lakes because of the continuous expansion of croplands rapidly growing populations increasing scales of farming activities in the plains and oasis areas and diversion for irrigation of a substantial amount of water destined to recharge lakes all of these factors have the potential to further intensify the contradiction between water supply and demand in ca intensify the competition for surface water resources and trigger a series of water conflicts if socioeconomic development in ca continues in accordance with current population growth models and agricultural production methods a series of ecological and environmental issues could threaten the hydrological and ecological stability of the region hindering future sustainable development therefore the results of this study provide a thorough scientific reference for the comprehensive planning and management of regional water resources in ca which is conducive to solving the contradiction between water supply and demand and maintaining the balance of
