3640,cascade hydropower development in the lancang river lcr basin has a complex and far reaching impact on river ecosystem which has always been the focus of international attention in this study diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was used to study the reactivation of arsenic as in the sediments of xiaowan xw and nuozhadu nzd cascade dams in lcr pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis rda were used to evaluate the bioavailability and spatial distribution characteristics of as the results showed that the vertical variation of as in dgt at different sampling points presented different activation trends the content of dgt labile as cdgt as in nzd reservoir 36 21 ng ml was less than that in xw reservoir 47 26 ng ml however the difference of total content of as between the two reservoirs was relatively small the results showed that the development of cascade reservoirs had no significant impact on total as but had a great impact on dgt labile as the diffusion fluxes of the two reservoirs indicated that most of the sediments in the reservoir area were the source of as similar distribution characteristics and correlation analysis indicated that the migration mechanism of as was related to iron fe and manganese mn in addition on the basis of the results the sources of as in sediments had certain spatial differences cascade dam projects had significant accumulation and interception effects on as in the sediments and at the same time strengthened the role of regional sediment and this role reduced the risk of as release in downstream nzd reservoir keywords arsenic cascade dam sediment dgt diffusion fluxes 1 introduction with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization large amounts of trace metals from anthropogenic sources have been discharged into water environments such as the world s rivers estuaries or reservoirs where they may be accumulated by aquatic organisms and biomagnified through the food chain thus causing potentially harmful effects on human health and even ecosystems wei et al 2016 li et al 2019 wang et al 2012 sediments disturbed by human activities are efficient reservoirs for various contaminants gao et al 2017 moreover due to different hydraulic conditions and various re mobilization processes elements bound to sediments may be released into water again li et al 2019 trace metals contamination has attracted great attention because of their content source and bioaccumulation in the environment gao et al 2018a arsenic as is a kind of trace element in the earth s crust arsenic is commonly found in groundwater soil and sediments due to natural processes such as mineral weathering and dissolution wang et al 2016c the main source of as in natural waters include minerals the atmosphere rocks sediments and soils smedley and kinniburgh 2002 some as compounds are highly toxic to organisms the world health organization has announced that endemic as poisoning is threatening 50 million people in at least 22 countries and regions wang et al 2016a the chemical forms and accumulation of as in the sediments may affect benthic organisms and pose a potential threat to water resources gao et al 2017 affected by microbial activity sediment type redox condition ph value iron minerals and other factors the distribution transformation and migration of as in sediments is an intricate process guo et al 2019 in the sediments metals may be combined with oxides of iron fe and manganese mn organic matter and other compounds by adsorption or coprecipitation gao et al 2009 huo et al 2015 for instance a reduction in redox state at the sediment water interface swi can promote the reduction and dissolution of fe and mn oxides resulting in the release of trace metals combined with them gao et al 2018b bioavailability of metal is the metal in the soil which can be absorbed and utilized by organisms and it is not the total content of metal conesa et al 2010 davison and zhang 2012 the chemical composition of metals has great influence on their mobility bioavailability and toxicity wang et al 2016c miranda et al 2021 in order to better control as pollution and evaluate sediment quality it is necessary to monitor the bioavailability of as in sediments gao et al 2017 guo et al 2019 the construction of hydroelectric dams on large rivers will have an impact on the natural environment such as hydrological conditions water quality local climate soil environment plants and animals and the society and economy of the surrounding areas guo et al 2020 chen et al 2011 according to the reports in order to develop and utilize water resources by 2025 the number of rivers controlled by the dam is expected to reach 70 cui et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 about half of all river reaches globally show diminished connectivity grill et al 2019 the construction of hydropower stations has brought great social and economic benefits to people but it also brought some adverse impact huyen et al 2019 banerji et al 2019 gu et al 2020 yi et al 2019 the hydropower dam regulates water flow intercepts suspended sediment in reservoir blocks hydrological continuity and reduces nutrient load downstream ouyang et al 2010 liu et al 2015 according to the report 80 or more of the sediments in almost half of the world s reservoirs have been intercepted liu et al 2015 previous studies have proved that the potential interception efficiency of sediment in eight reservoirs in the main stream of lcr is expected to reach 78 81 in the future liu et al 2017 as the largest cross border river in southeast asia the lancang mekong river supports the fisheries agriculture and hydropower sectors along the river the lcr basin as an important transportation hub has high economic social and ecological values and is attracting more and more attention which is also the focus of this study guo et al 2020 yun et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 nzd and xw hydropower station are the core hydropower stations and leading reservoirs of cascade reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches of lcr respectively most studies focus on the evaluation of as content in reservoir water or sediment or clarify the distribution and potential ecological risks of as baeyens et al 2019 che et al 2020b xiong et al 2020 however relatively few studies have focused on the mechanism of as release in the sediments of cascade dams in river systems which might be affected by the formation of reservoirs and prolonged water renewal time in the past few decades the bioavailability of elements in sediments was generally determined by sequential extraction and single step extraction deng et al 2014 wang et al 2016c nevertheless some studies have showed that ex situ measurements may lead to analysis errors wang et al 2016a in addition the chemical forms of as may change in different stages of the experiment gao et al 2017 diffusive gradients in thin films dgt can measure labile target elements in sediments water and soil with high spatial resolution gao et al 2017 liu et al 2019 gao et al 2020 dgt technique has been widely used to determine the bioavailability of metals in environmental media due to its in situ enrichment and speciation selectivity which can provide the average concentration of the monitored substances during the monitoring period dgt technology introduces a dynamic concept which can be used to study the bioavailability of heavy metals by simulating the absorption process of heavy metals by plants or other organisms guan 2019 dgt locally lowers metal concentrations in pore water to promotes the release of heavy metals from the solid phase to the liquid phase so as to study the dynamic replenishment of heavy metals from solid phase to liquid phase the results not only reflect the static process but also include the dynamic process which is the key point that distinguishes dgt technology from other measurement methods the behavior of as in the environment will be better understood by combining theoretical research with spatio temporal research the main purposes of this study are to 1 study the vertical distribution of dgt labile as and total as in the sediments of nzd and xw reservoirs of lcr 2 study the diffusion trend of dgt labile as at sediment water interface 3 clarify the migration mechanism of as and the relationship between as and some related elements such as fe and mn 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lcr originating in the northeast of t ang ku la mountains in qinghai province of china is one of the big rivers in southwest china the main stream is 4880 km long and the total catchment area of the basin is 8 1 105 km2 the whole lancang mekong river basin is also influenced by monsoons the source is the least affected by monsoons the downstream is the most affected wang et al 2012 in december 2019 sediment cores samples were collected from nzd reservoir and xw reservoir in lcr fig 1 the locations of sampling points are nzd a nzd b nzd c xw a xw b and xw c nzd and xw cascade reservoir are deep reservoirs the depth of sampling points are 162 40 112 41 45 31 161 03 160 87 and 75 91 m respectively 2 2 analytical procedure sediment samples were collected by peterson gravity sampler at six sampling points of the main stream and tributary in the middle of the river and the 10 cm of the overlying water above the swi were sampled the water temperature dissolved oxygen do and ph value were measured in situ by portable multi parameter water quality meter yellow springs instruments inc yellow springs oh usa arsenic was measured with 0 4 mm zirconium oxide zr oxide gel and fe and mn were measured with 0 4 mm chelex 100 gel two different deoxygenated dgt probes were placed back to back and then gently inserted into the sediment column until the probes were retained 5 cm in the overlying water the operating procedure was carried out in the dark after 24 h the probe was withdrawn and the surface was washed with milli q water then the binding gel was taken out from the dgt assembly and cut into 5 mm slices after eluting the bound metal on each slice metals in the eluate were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms chen et al 2016 and the content of dgt labile as in sediment and overlying water was obtained in the laboratory sediment samples were freeze dried and then passed through a 100 mesh nylon sieve the samples were digested with hno3 and hf after microwave digestion the total concentration of heavy metals was analyzed by icp ms zhang et al 2019 prior to particle size analysis sediment samples were dried in a vacuum freeze dryer the dried deposits were ground in a mortar and then passed through a 200 mesh nylon sieve 74 μm for fine chemical analysis of deposits after the sample was sieved the particle size of sediment sample was analyzed by laser optical particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk in addition the reagent used for heavy metal analysis had high purity the experimental water was ultrapure water and parallel samples blanks and reference materials gsd 9 and gsd 11 chinese geological reference materials were used for quality control the relative error of parallel samples of heavy metals is 5 2 3 data analysis the diffusion flux of as on the swi was calculated by dgt correlation numerical model ma et al 2020 the diffusion flux was calculated as follows j j w j s d w c dgt x w x 0 φ d s c dgt x s x 0 where j is the sum of the fluxes of the overlying water and surface sediment jw and js are the labile metal fluxes of the overlying water and the sediment to the swi respectively c dgt x w x 0 and c dgt x s x 0 are the concentration gradients in the overlying water and sediment respectively φ is the porosity of the surface sediment ma et al 2020 ullman and aller 1982 dw and ds are the diffusion coefficients of metals in the overlying water and sediment respectively 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis and correlations were performed using spss and origin 2019 software student s t test p 0 05 was used to evaluate the differences between data sets pearson correlation analysis was used to quantitatively explain the correlation in this study redundancy analysis rda was used to reveal the relationship between as and related factors such as metal content and particle size in sediments rda could rank the relationship between species and environmental factors so that the ordination axis reflect a certain ecological gradient monte carlo permutation test p 0 05 n 499 was used to identify axes with significant eigenvalues and species environment correlations the approximate results obtained after repeated sampling can reflect whether there is a significant relationship between environmental factors and species if p 0 05 it indicates that the environmental factor is not the main influencing factor the resulting ordination diagrams shows the as and related factors as vectors whose magnitude and angle indicate statistical significance and magnitude of the correlations with an ordination axis or another vector gabarrón et al 2018 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of overlying water the overlying water of the two reservoirs was weakly alkaline and the ph values of nzd reservoir and xw reservoir were 7 8 0 1 and 7 8 0 3 respectively table 1 the amount of dissolved oxygen in overlying water of nzd reservoir and xw reservoir was 4 0 2 9 mg l and 4 2 1 1 mg l respectively in the depth of the reservoir only a few areas are in a state of hypoxia the temperature of overlying water in xw reservoir was slightly lower than that in nzd reservoir and the average values of the two reservoirs are 14 7 1 3 and 17 8 0 2 c respectively because xw reservoir is closer to the upstream than nzd reservoir and receives lower temperature water from qinghai tibet plateau and the water temperature gradually rises with the longer flow time mu et al 2020 3 2 grain size distribution in sediments dam reservoirs changed the sediment budget of river systems and the particle size and composition of river transported particles matys grygar et al 2018 the structural classification of sediment samples was based on the relative percentages of clay 4μm silt 4 63 μm and sand 63 μ m liu et al 2019 the median particle sizes of the two reservoirs were 17 97 10 35 μm and 25 76 10 67 μm respectively and the variation along the depth was showed in the fig 2 the figure also showed the distribution characteristics of particle size of each sampling point varying with depth the grain size of sediments in xw and nzd reservoirs was mainly composed of silt 48 29 72 67 42 65 70 64 followed by sand 1 99 38 47 7 23 45 54 and clay 8 7 47 16 11 8 28 at two positions in front of the dam xw a and nzd a the grain size of sediments became finer with depth and the coarse sand accounted for less other points changed irregularly generally speaking the sediments particles of xw reservoir were finer than those of nzd reservoir the particle size distribution of sediments in two reservoirs was analyzed by t test the results shown that there are significant differences in the distribution of sand silt and median particle size at the level of p 0 05 compared with other points the grain size in front of the dam of the two reservoirs is larger which may be because the reservoir impoundment in the flooding season leads to sediment deposition in front of the dam at other points the relatively fine sediment may precipitate due to lower flow rate and longer residence time 3 3 total concentration of as in sediments the variation of total concentration of as in sediments at six sampling points along the depth was shown in fig 3 total concentration of as in surface sediments of nzd reservoir and xw reservoir ranged from 0 72 to 83 31 mg kg and 10 97 to 57 83 mg kg respectively the average values of the two reservoirs were 31 03 mg kg and 27 23 mg kg the concentration of as in sediments of nzd reservoir was slightly higher than that of xw reservoir the total concentration of as fluctuated with depth the concentrations of as in the sediments downstream of xw reservoir and nzd reservoir were different which may be related to sediment source and dam construction furthermore total content of as in sediments might be affected by other factors such as grain size mineralogy and redox of the sediments li et al 2019 in the xw and nzd reservoir sediment there was a strong positive correlation between as and mn the correlation between as and fe was not as significant as that between as and mn fig 4 the research of shiquan reservoir also reported this phenomenon zhao et al 2020 the concentration of as in the sediment of lcr was close to that in other reservoirs and rivers at home and abroad table 2 it was quite different from the estuary and the ocean the results showed that as pollution level of nzd and xw reservoir are comparable to those of lakes and rivers at home and abroad 3 4 vertical variation of the concentration of dgt labile as due to the surface sediments being greatly influenced by water environment the value of dgt labile as in sediments fluctuated greatly between 20 and 0 mm negative sign indicated the depth below the swi generally speaking as distribution measured by dgt showed different trends among different sampling points fig 5 in fig 5 we observed that cdgt as increased from 1 cm to 1 5 cm in nzd a then decreased to 28 01 ng ml at 2 5 cm and then the concentration began to increase reaching a peak at 4 cm then the fluctuation increased until the bottom of the probe for nzd b the cdgt as in overlying water increased then dropped sharply to the swi then rapidly increased to the position of 4 cm and then dropped to the bottom in nzd c it increased steadily and slowly from overlying water to sediment until it reached the bottom of the probe for xw a the cdgt as gradually increased with depth until 5cm and then gradually decreased until the bottom of the probe for xw b the cdgt as increased steadily until 5 cm reached the maximum then decreased to 5 5 cm then gradually increased to 7 5 cm and then fluctuated and decreased xw c was similar to nzd a except nzd b the cdgt as in overlying water at other five points was lower than that of sediment in overlying water the cdgt as decreased slightly the vertical variation trend of cdgt as in sediments can be divided into two patterns the first pattern cdgt as risen sharply to a peak value and then fluctuated to the bottom of sediment both nzd b and xw b belong to this pattern the second pattern was that the concentration fluctuant increases from the swi to the bottom of dgt probe such as nzd a nzd c xw a and xw c 3 5 the diffusion flux of as at the swi the diffusion flux of trace elements in the swi provided useful information on whether surface sediments were sinks or sources of elements the flux of as at the swi was calculated based on the concentration of elements in the surface sediments of dgt and overlying water within 5 mm of the swi fig 6 the diffusion flux of as was 10 83 pg cm 2s 1 the diffusion fluxes indicated that sediments can be used as sources or sinks of as the positive and negative values of flux vector indicated that as was likely to move upward to overlying water i e source and down to sediment i e sink respectively most of the diffusion flux of as was positive which indicated that as tended to migrate upward to overlying water the results showed that as in most sediments of the reservoir could be easily released into the overlying water and sediments are the source of as arsenic carries a potential toxicity risk to overlying water the diffusion flux of xw reservoir is larger than that of nzd reservoir compared with water the content of as in sediments is higher guo et al 2019 compared with other rivers and lakes the as diffusion flux in lcr basin is lower than that of oceans and higher than that of lakes table 3 previous studies have shown that there are differences in diffusion flux of as in bays reservoirs and lakes gao et al 2018a liu et al 2019 wang et al 2016a the flux of this study is similar to that of the three gorges reservoir which indicates that the as migration in the reservoir environment is similar 3 6 vertical variation of the concentration of dgt labile fe and mn the content of dgt labile fe cdgt fe and mn cdgt mn increases with depth fig 7 studies of taihu lake and the three gorges reservoir also described this phenomenon gao et al 2017 ouyang et al 2010 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2016b the distribution of cdgt as was similar to that of cdgt fe and cdgt mn some studies have pointed out that fe oxides and mn oxides are reduced and dissolved in deeper sediments under anoxic conditions li et al 2013 wang et al 2016b in the sediment profile the reduction dissolution of fe and mn oxides might be the cause of fe and mn release under hypoxia conditions gao et al 2018a li et al 2013 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2016b therefore in the oxidizing environment the cdgt as cdgt fe and cdgt mn in the overlying water were lower than those in the sediments 4 discussion 4 1 controls on as distribution in overlying water and sediment profiles the distribution of cdgt as in the profile of overlying water and sediment showed different trends in addition the change of cdgt as along the sediment profile were greater than that along the overlying water there were many turning points in the sediment profile the reasons for this situation may be as follows first due to the heterogeneity of the sediments the migration of elements in the sediments would change leading to the changes of the labile as in the dgt however because water was a homogeneous medium the migration of elements mainly depended on their physical and chemical characteristics such as temperature ph do redox conditions composition of sediments organic matter and so on atkinson et al 2007 especially at some sampling points such as nzd b the peak value of overlying water might be due to the gas produced by the respiration of microorganisms in the suspended particles of the sediments the vertical movement of rising bubbles increases the exchange between pore water and overlying water increases solute flux and enhances the circulation of other nearby substances such as nutrients and pollutants cheng et al 2014 secondly due to the interference of many factors the composition of sediments became complex elements in sediments might bind to some compounds by adsorption or co precipitation gao et al 2009 in addition the sediments at each depth could show formation processes at a specific time the inorganic compounds might be different between different sediments layers arsenic is a sensitive element to redox state which is strongly influenced by redox reaction in sediments in the sediments of most sampling points the deeper the depth the higher the cdgt as previous studies have shown when the redox conditions were changed inorganic compounds could be released into the pore water at the same time amato et al 2016 therefore this may lead to a peak value of sediment profile thirdly the interference of benthic organisms in sediments might also lead to the release of metal elements biological disturbance is a process of releasing elements in sediment and fixing elements in water which is produced by animal activities in the upper sediment layer this process will lead to the upward migration of sediment particles amato et al 2016 schaller 2014 even a small disturbance had a great impact on the migration of elements furthermore dgt can distinguish these small changes with high resolution very sensitively consequently compared with the change of overlying water the change of element concentration measured by dgt on sediment profile was more remarkable gao et al 2018a 4 2 influence of dam construction on distribution of heavy metals due to the construction of large cascade reservoirs sediments have been trapped by the dams studies have shown that xw and nzd reservoir have a large potential sediment trapping efficiency of up to 90 fan et al 2015 when the source of sediment in downstream reservoir decreases the role of regional sediment is highlighted regional sediment is the sediment which comes from the sub basin between the upstream reservoir and the downstream reservoir and in this study it refers to the area between xw dam and nzd dam so the upstream sediment input becomes a secondary contributor to the sediment source of the downstream reservoir on the contrary the section from xw a to nzd a may become the largest sediment source of nzd reservoir previous study has shown that the existing dams intercept much more substance in lcr xu et al 2020 the changes in sediment sources and the difference of environmental in the two reservoir sediment can be seen as the effect of cascade reservoir construction in this study there are differences in ph do and temperature of the overlying water in the two reservoirs among which do and temperature are quite different which may have great influence on the bioavailability of heavy metals in surface sediments the bioavailability of heavy metals near the swi mainly depends on their migration potential in surface sediments liu et al 2019 the mean value of cdgt as in xw reservoir 47 26 ng ml was higher than that in nzd reservoir 36 21 ng ml while the total content of as in xw reservoir 27 23 mg kg was lower than that in nzd reservoir 31 03 mg kg the diffusion flux of xw reservoir is larger than that of nzd reservoir therefore the low concentration of total as in sediments did not mean that the bioavailability of as is low the concentration of total as in sediment can not reflect the mobility of as in sediment the t test of as in sediments shows that there is no significant difference in total as between the two reservoirs but there is significant difference in dgt labile as at the level of p 0 05 the development of cascade reservoirs had no significant impact on total as but had a great impact on dgt labile as the proportion of cdgt as in total as in the xw reservoir was larger than that in the nzd reservoir which indicated that the regional sediment input will reduce the risk of dgt labile as in downstream nzd reservoir mu et al 2020 the source change of sediments is the main explanation for the spatial change of heavy metals distribution in sediments this is consistent with the research results of bing et al bing et al 2019 on heavy metals in sediments of three gorges reservoir 4 3 mechanisms for as distribution and remobilization the remobilization of heavy metal is a process of migration and transformation in which heavy metals adsorbed and bound to sediment particles may be released through reactions such as adsorption desorption equilibrium and redox reactions the mobility and bioavailability of elements in sediments are affected by organic matter ph fe mn hydroxides and other physical and chemical properties fang and chen 2015 liu et al 2019 at the sampling points of xw reservoir the linear regression trend of cdgt as and cdgt fe and the trend of cdgt as and cdgt mn were similar fig 8 at the sampling points of nzd reservoir the linear regression trend of cdgt as and cdgt fe and the trend of cdgt as and cdgt mn were also similar this similarity indicated that their remobilization mechanisms were similar the remobilization mechanism of as might be that the migration of as was closely related to fe and mn and as could be combined with fe and mn oxides and released simultaneously with fe and mn the remarkable positive correlation between cdgt as cdgt fe and cdgt mn of the two reservoirs further confirmed this point however in nzd b there is no positive correlation between cdgt as and cdgt fe and cdgt mn which may be related to the location of nzd b nzd b is located at the intersection of the tributary and main stream of lcr which is a transitional zone to a great extent the distribution of metals is controlled by the metal budgets and related external forces such as river input niu et al 2021 and the adsorption mechanism of metal may be affected therefore the diffusion flux and sediment profile of as are different from other points the studies have shown that mn oxide was more easily to control as than fe oxide gao et al 2017 in the two reservoirs the correlation between cdgt as and cdgt mn is more significant than that with cdgt as and cdgt fe this may reflect the stronger ability of labile mn oxides to control labile as ding et al 2016 however in xw reservoir and nzd reservoir the coupling trends of cdgt as with cdgt fe and cdgt mn were very different moreover in the downstream nzd reservoir the correlation between cdgt as and cdgt fe and cdgt mn decreased obviously which showed that the ability of labile fe and mn to capture labile as decreases and labile as may be released the increase of cdgt as in the nzd reservoir confirmed this point the development of cascade reservoirs made the circulation mechanism of as in the two reservoirs different 4 4 the relationship between as concentration and related factors the related structure of as and related factors at each sampling point was summarized as the related double diagram of rda of each reservoir as shown in the fig 9 in the figure blue arrows represent as concentration and red arrows represent different related factors the quadrant where the arrow is located indicated the positive and negative correlation between the environmental factors and the sorting axis circles represent different reservoirs at different points the longer the connecting line between the arrow and the origin the greater the influence on as and the greater the correlation the smaller the angle between the arrows the higher the correlation the rda was used to determine to what extent the seven parameters fe mn dgt labile fe dgt fe dgt labile mn dgt mn clay silt sand affected the migration and transformation of as in this study for xw reservoir the maximum explanation for the variation of total as and dgt labile as by the first canonical axes was 97 42 and the minimum explanation was 64 98 for nzd reservoir the maximum explanation for the variation of total as and dgt labile as by the first canonical axes was 82 82 and the minimum explanation was 56 68 rda analysis showed that the sources of as in sediments of two reservoirs were different table 4 it indicated that the seven physicochemical parameters occupy a significant amount of the variation for as fractions and play an important part in the migration and transformation of the as fractions in xw reservoir mn fe and silt are the key factors to explain the bioavailability of as in nzd reservoir dgt mn and mn were the key factors to reveal the bioavailability of as the comparison of the rda chart showed that the controlling factors of as in the sediments of the two reservoirs were not completely identical which indicated that there were differences in the as circulation mechanism between the two reservoirs under the influence of cascade reservoirs 5 conclusions the remobilization characteristics of as in xw reservoir and nzd reservoir were evaluated by dgt technique sediment samples from two reservoirs were collected in lcr basin for physical and chemical analysis in overlying water and sediment cores the distribution of cdgt as in xw and nzd reservoirs showed different trends along the depth profile the variation of as concentration in sediment profile was attributed to the change of environmental conditions in sediment seen from the apparent diffusion flux at most sampling points as had a potential tendency to be released from surface sediments to overlying water especially in front of the dam xw reservoir in addition as could also migrate and transform at the same time as fe and mn in sediments there is less labile mn and thus more mn is retained in the sediment the correlation between cdgt as cdgt fe and cdgt mn of the two reservoirs further confirmed this point the results showed that as had similar migration characteristics with fe and mn coupling as with grain size fe and mn elements the results showed that the factors affecting as cycling in the sediments of the two reservoirs were not completely the same in xw reservoir mn fe and silt are the key factors to affect the bioavailability of as in nzd reservoir dgt mn and mn were the key factors to reveal the bioavailability of as xw and nzd reservoirs are the two most important reservoirs on the lcr because of their annual regulation capacity and large water storage capacity due to the dam construction there are differences in as cycling of sediments in the two reservoirs the development of cascade reservoirs had a certain influence on the bioavailability of as in sediments of upper and lower reservoirs this highlights the role of reservoir interception and regional sediment which reduces the risk of as release in downstream nzd reservoir therefore the migration mechanism of trace metals in the sediments of cascade reservoirs into overlying water cannot be ignored credit authorship contribution statement yao cheng writing original draft conceptualization fengxia zhao

3640,cascade hydropower development in the lancang river lcr basin has a complex and far reaching impact on river ecosystem which has always been the focus of international attention in this study diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was used to study the reactivation of arsenic as in the sediments of xiaowan xw and nuozhadu nzd cascade dams in lcr pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis rda were used to evaluate the bioavailability and spatial distribution characteristics of as the results showed that the vertical variation of as in dgt at different sampling points presented different activation trends the content of dgt labile as cdgt as in nzd reservoir 36 21 ng ml was less than that in xw reservoir 47 26 ng ml however the difference of total content of as between the two reservoirs was relatively small the results showed that the development of cascade reservoirs had no significant impact on total as but had a great impact on dgt labile as the diffusion fluxes of the two reservoirs indicated that most of the sediments in the reservoir area were the source of as similar distribution characteristics and correlation analysis indicated that the migration mechanism of as was related to iron fe and manganese mn in addition on the basis of the results the sources of as in sediments had certain spatial differences cascade dam projects had significant accumulation and interception effects on as in the sediments and at the same time strengthened the role of regional sediment and this role reduced the risk of as release in downstream nzd

sources have been discharged into water environments such as the world s rivers estuaries or reservoirs where they may be accumulated by aquatic organisms and biomagnified through the food chain thus causing potentially harmful effects on human health and even ecosystems wei et al 2016 li et al 2019 wang et al 2012 sediments disturbed by human activities are efficient reservoirs for various contaminants gao et al 2017 moreover due to different hydraulic conditions and various re mobilization processes elements bound to sediments may be released into water again li et al 2019 trace metals

with them gao et al 2018b bioavailability of metal is the metal in the soil which can be absorbed and utilized by organisms and it is not the total content of metal conesa et al 2010 davison and zhang 2012 the chemical composition of metals has great influence on their mobility bioavailability and toxicity wang et al 2016c miranda et al 2021 in order to better control as pollution and evaluate sediment quality it is necessary to monitor the bioavailability of as in sediments gao et al 2017 guo et al 2019 the construction of hydroelectric dams on large rivers will have an impact on the natural environment such as hydrological conditions water quality local climate soil environment plants and animals and the society and economy of the surrounding areas guo et al 2020 chen et al 2011 according to the reports in order to develop and utilize water resources by 2025 the number of rivers controlled by the dam is expected to reach 70 cui et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 about half of all river reaches globally show diminished connectivity grill et al 2019 the construction of hydropower stations has brought great social and economic benefits to people but it also brought some adverse impact huyen et al 2019 banerji et al 2019 gu et al 2020 yi et al 2019 the hydropower dam regulates water flow intercepts suspended sediment in reservoir blocks hydrological continuity and reduces nutrient load downstream ouyang et al 2010 liu et al 2015 according to the report 80 or more of the sediments in almost half of the world s reservoirs have been intercepted liu et al 2015 previous studies have proved that the potential interception efficiency of sediment in eight reservoirs in the main stream of lcr is expected to reach 78 81 in the future liu et al 2017 as the largest cross border river in southeast asia the lancang mekong river supports the fisheries agriculture and hydropower sectors along the river the lcr basin as an important transportation hub has high economic social and ecological values and is attracting more and more attention which is also the focus of this study guo et al 2020 yun et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 nzd and xw hydropower station are the core hydropower stations and leading reservoirs of cascade reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches of lcr respectively most studies focus on the evaluation of as content in reservoir water or sediment or clarify the distribution and potential ecological risks of as baeyens et al 2019 che et al 2020b xiong et al 2020 however relatively few studies have focused on the mechanism of as release in the sediments of cascade dams in river systems which might be affected by the formation of reservoirs and prolonged water renewal time in the past few decades the bioavailability of elements in sediments was generally determined by sequential extraction and single step extraction deng et al 2014 wang et al 2016c nevertheless some studies have showed that ex situ measurements may lead to analysis errors wang et al 2016a in addition the chemical forms of as may change in different stages of the experiment gao et al 2017 diffusive gradients in thin films dgt can measure labile target elements in sediments water and soil with high spatial resolution gao et al 2017 liu et al 2019 gao et al 2020 dgt technique has been widely used to determine the bioavailability of metals in environmental media due to its in situ enrichment and speciation selectivity which can provide the average concentration of the monitored substances during the monitoring period dgt technology introduces a dynamic concept which can be used to study the bioavailability of heavy metals by simulating the absorption process of heavy metals by plants or other organisms guan 2019 dgt locally lowers metal concentrations in pore water to promotes the release of heavy metals from the solid phase to the liquid phase so as to study the dynamic replenishment of heavy metals from solid phase to liquid phase the results not only reflect the static process but also include the dynamic process which is the key point that distinguishes dgt technology from other measurement methods the behavior of as in the environment will be better understood by combining theoretical research with spatio temporal research the main purposes of this study are to 1 study the vertical distribution of dgt labile as and total as in the sediments of nzd and xw reservoirs of lcr 2 study the diffusion trend of dgt labile as at sediment water interface 3 clarify the migration mechanism of as and the relationship between as and some related elements such as fe and mn 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lcr originating in the northeast of t ang ku la mountains in qinghai province of china is one of the big rivers in southwest china the main stream is 4880 km long and the total catchment area of the basin is 8 1 105 km2 the whole lancang mekong river basin is also influenced by monsoons the source is the least affected by monsoons the downstream is the most affected wang et al 2012 in december 2019 sediment cores samples were collected from nzd reservoir and xw reservoir in lcr fig 1 the locations of sampling points are nzd a nzd b nzd c xw a xw b and xw c nzd and xw cascade reservoir are deep reservoirs the depth of sampling points are 162 40 112 41 45 31 161 03 160 87 and 75 91 m respectively 2 2 analytical procedure sediment samples were collected by peterson gravity sampler at six sampling points of the main stream and tributary in the middle of the river and the 10 cm of the overlying water above the swi were sampled the water temperature dissolved oxygen do and ph value were measured in situ by portable multi parameter water quality meter yellow springs instruments inc yellow springs oh usa arsenic was measured with 0 4 mm zirconium oxide zr oxide gel and fe and mn were measured with 0 4 mm chelex 100 gel two different deoxygenated dgt probes were placed back to back and then gently inserted into the sediment column until the probes were retained 5 cm in the overlying water the operating procedure was carried out in the dark after 24 h the probe was withdrawn and the surface was washed with milli q water then the binding gel was taken out from the dgt assembly and cut into 5 mm slices after eluting the bound metal on each slice metals in the eluate were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms chen et al 2016 and the content of dgt labile as in sediment and overlying water was obtained in the laboratory sediment samples were freeze dried and then passed through a 100 mesh nylon sieve the samples were digested with hno3 and hf after microwave digestion the total concentration of heavy metals was analyzed by icp ms zhang et al 2019 prior to particle size analysis sediment samples were dried in a vacuum freeze dryer the dried deposits were ground in a mortar and then passed through a 200 mesh nylon sieve 74 μm for fine chemical analysis of deposits after the sample was sieved the particle size of sediment sample was analyzed by laser optical particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk in addition the reagent used for heavy metal analysis had high purity the experimental water was ultrapure water and parallel samples blanks and reference materials gsd 9 and gsd 11 chinese geological reference materials were used for quality control the relative error of parallel samples of heavy metals is 5 2 3 data analysis the diffusion flux of as on the swi was calculated by dgt correlation numerical model ma et al 2020 the diffusion flux was calculated as follows j j w j s d w c dgt x w x 0 φ d s c dgt x s x 0 where j is the sum of the fluxes of the overlying water and surface sediment jw and js are the labile metal fluxes of the overlying water and the sediment to the swi respectively c dgt x w x 0 and c dgt x s x 0 are the concentration gradients in the overlying water and sediment respectively φ is the porosity of the surface sediment ma et al 2020 ullman and aller 1982 dw and ds are the diffusion coefficients of metals in the overlying water and sediment respectively 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis and correlations were performed using spss and origin 2019 software student s t test p 0 05 was used to evaluate the differences between data sets pearson correlation analysis was used to quantitatively explain the correlation in this study redundancy analysis rda was used to reveal the relationship between as and related factors such as metal content and particle size in sediments rda could rank the relationship between species and environmental factors so that the ordination axis reflect a certain ecological gradient monte carlo permutation test p 0 05 n 499 was used to identify axes with significant eigenvalues and species environment correlations the approximate results obtained after repeated sampling can reflect whether there is a significant relationship between environmental factors and species if p 0 05 it indicates that the environmental factor is not the main influencing factor the resulting ordination diagrams shows the as and related factors as vectors whose magnitude and angle indicate statistical significance and magnitude of the correlations with an ordination axis or another vector gabarrón et al 2018 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of overlying water the overlying water of the two reservoirs was weakly alkaline and the ph values of nzd reservoir and xw reservoir were 7 8 0 1 and 7 8 0 3 respectively table 1 the amount of dissolved oxygen in overlying water of nzd reservoir and xw reservoir was 4 0 2 9 mg l and 4 2 1 1 mg l respectively in the depth of the reservoir only a few areas are in a state of hypoxia the temperature of overlying water in xw reservoir was slightly lower than that in nzd reservoir and the average values of the two reservoirs are 14 7 1 3 and 17 8 0 2 c respectively because xw reservoir is closer to the upstream than nzd reservoir and receives lower temperature water from qinghai tibet plateau and the water temperature gradually rises with the longer flow time mu et al 2020 3 2 grain size distribution in sediments dam reservoirs changed the sediment budget of river systems and the particle size and composition of river transported particles matys grygar et al 2018 the structural classification of sediment samples was based on the relative percentages of clay 4μm silt 4 63 μm and sand 63 μ m liu et al 2019 the median particle sizes of the two reservoirs were 17 97 10 35 μm and 25 76 10 67 μm respectively and the variation along the depth was showed in the fig 2 the figure also showed the distribution characteristics of particle size of each sampling point varying with depth the grain size of sediments in xw and nzd reservoirs was mainly composed of silt 48 29 72 67 42 65 70 64 followed by sand 1 99 38 47 7 23 45 54 and clay 8 7 47 16 11 8 28 at two positions in front of the dam xw a and nzd a the grain size of sediments became finer with depth and the coarse sand accounted for less other points changed irregularly generally speaking the sediments particles of xw reservoir were finer than those of nzd reservoir the particle size distribution of sediments in two reservoirs was analyzed by t test the results shown that there are significant differences in the distribution of sand silt and median particle size at the level of p 0 05 compared with other points the grain size in front of the dam of the two reservoirs is larger which may be because the reservoir impoundment in the flooding season leads to sediment deposition in front of the dam at other points the relatively fine sediment may precipitate due to lower flow rate and longer residence time 3 3 total concentration of as in sediments the variation of total concentration of as in sediments at six sampling points along the depth was shown in fig 3 total concentration of as in surface sediments of nzd reservoir and xw reservoir ranged from 0 72 to 83 31 mg kg and 10 97 to 57 83 mg kg respectively the average values of the two reservoirs were 31 03 mg kg and 27 23 mg kg the concentration of as in sediments of nzd reservoir was slightly higher than that of xw reservoir the total concentration of as fluctuated with depth the concentrations of as in the sediments downstream of xw reservoir and nzd reservoir were different which may be related to sediment source and dam construction furthermore total content of as in sediments might be affected by other factors such as grain size mineralogy and redox of the sediments li et al 2019 in the xw and nzd reservoir sediment there was a strong positive correlation between as and mn the correlation between as and fe was not as significant as that between as and mn fig 4 the research of shiquan reservoir also reported this phenomenon zhao et al 2020 the concentration of as in the sediment of lcr was close to that in other reservoirs and rivers at home and abroad table 2 it was quite different from the estuary and the ocean the results showed that as pollution level of nzd and xw reservoir are comparable to those of lakes and rivers at home and abroad 3 4 vertical variation of the concentration of dgt labile as due to the surface sediments being greatly influenced by water environment the value of dgt labile as in sediments fluctuated greatly between 20 and 0 mm negative sign indicated the depth below the swi generally speaking as distribution measured by dgt showed different trends among different sampling points fig 5 in fig 5 we observed that cdgt as increased from 1 cm to 1 5 cm in nzd a then decreased to 28 01 ng ml at 2 5 cm and then the concentration began to increase reaching a peak at 4 cm then the fluctuation increased until the bottom of the probe for nzd b the cdgt as in overlying water increased then dropped sharply to the swi then rapidly increased to the position of 4 cm and then dropped to the bottom in nzd c it increased steadily and slowly from overlying water to sediment until it reached the bottom of the probe for xw a the cdgt as gradually increased with depth until 5cm and then gradually decreased until the bottom of the probe for xw b the cdgt as increased steadily until 5 cm reached the maximum then decreased to 5 5 cm then gradually increased to 7 5 cm and then fluctuated and decreased xw c was similar to nzd a except nzd b the cdgt as in overlying water at other five points was lower than that of sediment in overlying water the cdgt as decreased slightly the vertical variation trend of cdgt as in sediments can be divided into two patterns the first pattern cdgt as risen sharply to a peak value and then fluctuated to the bottom of sediment both nzd b and xw b belong to this pattern the second pattern was that the concentration fluctuant increases from the swi to the bottom of dgt probe such as nzd a nzd c xw a and xw c 3 5 the diffusion flux of as at the swi the diffusion flux of trace elements in the swi provided useful information on whether surface sediments were sinks or sources of elements the flux of as at the swi was calculated based on the concentration of elements in the surface sediments of dgt and overlying water within 5 mm of the swi fig 6 the diffusion flux of as was 10 83 pg cm 2s 1 the diffusion fluxes indicated that sediments can be used as sources or sinks of as the positive and negative values of flux vector indicated that as was likely to move upward to overlying water i e source and down to sediment i e sink respectively most of the diffusion flux of as was positive which indicated that as tended to migrate upward to overlying water the results showed that as in most sediments of the reservoir could be easily released into the overlying water and sediments are the source of as arsenic carries a potential toxicity risk to overlying water the diffusion flux of xw reservoir is larger than that of nzd reservoir compared with water the content of as in sediments is higher guo et al 2019 compared with other rivers and lakes the as diffusion flux in lcr basin is lower than that of oceans and higher than that of lakes table 3 previous studies have shown that there are differences in diffusion flux of as in bays reservoirs and lakes gao et al 2018a liu et al 2019 wang et al 2016a the flux of this study is similar to that of the three gorges reservoir which indicates that the as migration in the reservoir environment is similar 3 6 vertical variation of the concentration of dgt labile fe and mn the content of dgt labile fe cdgt fe and mn cdgt mn increases with depth fig 7 studies of taihu lake and the three gorges reservoir also described this phenomenon gao et al 2017 ouyang et al 2010 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2016b the distribution of cdgt as was similar to that of cdgt fe and cdgt mn some studies have pointed out that fe oxides and mn oxides are reduced and dissolved in deeper sediments under anoxic conditions li et al 2013 wang et al 2016b in the sediment profile the reduction dissolution of fe and mn oxides might be the cause of fe and mn release under hypoxia conditions gao et al 2018a li et al 2013 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2016b therefore in the oxidizing environment the cdgt as cdgt fe and cdgt mn in the overlying water were lower than those in the sediments 4 discussion 4 1 controls on as distribution in overlying water and sediment profiles the distribution of cdgt as in the profile of overlying water and sediment showed different trends in addition the change of cdgt as along the sediment profile were greater than that along the overlying water there were many turning points in the sediment profile the reasons for this situation may be as follows first due to the heterogeneity of the sediments the migration of elements in the sediments would change leading to the changes of the labile as in the dgt however because water was a homogeneous medium the migration of elements mainly depended on their physical and chemical characteristics such as temperature ph do redox conditions composition of sediments organic matter and so on atkinson et al 2007 especially at some sampling points such as nzd b the peak value of overlying water might be due to the gas produced by the respiration of microorganisms in the suspended particles of the sediments the vertical movement of rising bubbles increases the exchange between pore water and overlying water increases solute flux and enhances the circulation of other nearby substances such as nutrients and pollutants cheng et al 2014 secondly due to the interference of many factors the composition of sediments became complex elements in sediments might bind to some compounds by adsorption or co precipitation gao et al 2009 in addition the sediments at each depth could show formation processes at a specific time the inorganic compounds might be different between different sediments layers arsenic is a sensitive element to redox state which is strongly influenced by redox reaction in sediments in the sediments of most sampling points the deeper the depth the higher the cdgt as previous studies have shown when the redox conditions were changed inorganic compounds could be released into the pore water at the same time amato et al 2016 therefore this may lead to a peak value of sediment profile thirdly the interference of benthic organisms in sediments might also lead to the release of metal elements biological disturbance is a process of releasing elements in sediment and fixing elements in water which is produced by animal activities in the upper sediment layer this process will lead to the upward migration of sediment particles amato et al 2016 schaller 2014 even a small disturbance had a great impact on the migration of elements furthermore dgt can distinguish these small changes with high resolution very sensitively consequently compared with the change of overlying water the change of element concentration measured by dgt on sediment profile was more remarkable gao et al 2018a 4 2 influence of dam construction on distribution of heavy metals due to the construction of large cascade reservoirs sediments have been trapped by the dams studies have shown that xw and nzd reservoir have a large potential sediment trapping efficiency of up to 90 fan et al 2015 when the source of sediment in downstream reservoir decreases the role of regional sediment is highlighted regional sediment is the sediment which comes from the sub basin between the upstream reservoir and the downstream reservoir and in this study it refers to the area between xw dam and nzd dam so the upstream sediment input becomes a secondary contributor to the sediment source of the downstream reservoir on the contrary the section from xw a to nzd a may become the largest sediment source of nzd reservoir previous study has shown that the existing dams intercept much more substance in lcr xu et al 2020 the changes in sediment sources and the difference of environmental in the two reservoir sediment can be seen as the effect of cascade reservoir construction in this study there are differences in ph do and temperature of the overlying water in the two reservoirs among which do and temperature are quite different which may have great influence on the bioavailability of heavy metals in surface sediments the bioavailability of heavy metals near the swi mainly depends on their migration potential in surface sediments liu et al 2019 the mean value of cdgt as in xw reservoir 47 26 ng ml was higher than that in nzd reservoir 36 21 ng ml while the total content of as in xw reservoir 27 23 mg kg was lower than that in nzd reservoir 31 03 mg kg the diffusion flux of xw reservoir is larger than that of nzd reservoir therefore the low concentration of total as in sediments did not mean that the bioavailability of as is low the concentration of total as in sediment can not reflect the mobility of as in sediment the t test of as in sediments shows that there is no significant difference in total as between the two reservoirs but there is significant difference in dgt labile as at the level of p 0 05 the development of cascade reservoirs had no significant impact on total as but had a great impact on dgt labile as the proportion of cdgt as in total as in the xw reservoir was larger than that in the nzd reservoir which indicated that the regional sediment input will reduce the risk of dgt labile as in downstream nzd reservoir mu et al 2020 the source change of sediments is the main explanation for the spatial change of heavy metals distribution in sediments this is consistent with the research results of bing et al bing et al 2019 on heavy metals in sediments of three gorges reservoir 4 3 mechanisms for as distribution and remobilization the remobilization of heavy metal is a process of migration and transformation in which heavy metals adsorbed and bound to sediment particles may be released through reactions such as adsorption desorption equilibrium and redox reactions the mobility and bioavailability of elements in sediments are affected by organic matter ph fe mn hydroxides and other physical and chemical properties fang and chen 2015 liu et al 2019 at the sampling points of xw reservoir the linear regression trend of cdgt as and cdgt fe and the trend of cdgt as and cdgt mn were similar fig 8 at the sampling points of nzd reservoir the linear regression trend of cdgt as and cdgt fe and the trend of cdgt as and cdgt mn were also similar this similarity indicated that their remobilization mechanisms were similar the remobilization mechanism of as might be that the migration of as was closely related to fe and mn and as could be combined with fe and mn oxides and released simultaneously with fe and mn the remarkable positive correlation between cdgt as cdgt fe and cdgt mn of the two reservoirs further confirmed this point however in nzd b there is no positive correlation between cdgt as and cdgt fe and cdgt mn which may be related to the location of nzd b nzd b is located at the intersection of the tributary and main stream of lcr which is a transitional zone to a great extent the distribution of metals is controlled by the metal budgets and related external forces such as river input niu et al 2021 and the adsorption mechanism of metal may be affected therefore the diffusion flux and sediment profile of as are different from other points the studies have shown that mn oxide was more easily to control as than fe oxide gao et al 2017 in the two reservoirs the correlation between cdgt as and cdgt mn is more significant than that with cdgt as and cdgt fe this may reflect the stronger ability of labile mn oxides to control labile as ding et al 2016 however in xw reservoir and nzd reservoir the coupling trends of cdgt as with cdgt fe and cdgt mn were very different moreover in the downstream nzd reservoir the correlation between cdgt as and cdgt fe and cdgt mn decreased obviously which showed that the ability of labile fe and mn to capture labile as decreases and labile as may be released the increase of cdgt as in the nzd reservoir confirmed this point the development of cascade reservoirs made the circulation mechanism of as in the two reservoirs different 4 4 the relationship between as concentration and related factors the related structure of as and related factors at each sampling point was summarized as the related double diagram of rda of each reservoir as shown in the fig 9 in the figure blue arrows represent as concentration and red arrows represent different related factors the quadrant where the arrow is located indicated the positive and negative correlation between the environmental factors and the sorting axis circles represent different reservoirs at different points the longer the connecting line between the arrow and the origin the greater the influence on as and the greater the correlation the smaller the angle between the arrows the higher the correlation the rda was used to determine to what extent the seven parameters fe mn dgt labile fe dgt fe dgt labile mn dgt mn clay silt sand affected the migration and transformation of as in this study for xw reservoir the maximum explanation for the variation of total as and dgt labile as by the first canonical axes was 97 42 and the minimum explanation was 64 98 for nzd reservoir the maximum explanation for the variation of total as and dgt labile as by the first canonical axes was 82 82 and the minimum explanation was 56 68 rda analysis showed that the sources of as in sediments of two reservoirs were different table 4 it indicated that the seven physicochemical parameters occupy a significant amount of the variation for as fractions and play an important part in the migration and transformation of the as fractions in xw reservoir mn fe and silt are the key factors to explain the bioavailability of as in nzd reservoir dgt mn and mn were the key factors to reveal the bioavailability of as the comparison of the rda chart showed that the controlling factors of as in the sediments of the two reservoirs were not completely identical which indicated that there were differences in the as circulation mechanism between the two reservoirs under the influence of cascade reservoirs 5 conclusions the remobilization characteristics of as in xw reservoir and nzd reservoir were evaluated by dgt technique sediment samples from two reservoirs were collected in lcr basin for physical and chemical analysis in overlying water and sediment cores the distribution of cdgt as in xw and nzd reservoirs showed different trends along the depth profile the variation of as concentration in sediment profile was attributed to the change of environmental conditions in sediment seen from the apparent diffusion flux at most sampling points as had a potential tendency to be released from surface sediments to overlying water especially in front of the dam xw reservoir in addition as could also migrate and transform at the same time as fe and mn in sediments there is less labile mn and thus more mn is retained in the sediment the correlation between cdgt as cdgt fe and cdgt mn of the two reservoirs further confirmed this point the results showed that as had similar migration characteristics with fe and mn coupling as with grain size fe and mn elements the results showed that the factors affecting as cycling in the sediments of the two reservoirs were not completely the same in xw reservoir mn fe and silt are the key factors to affect the bioavailability of as in nzd reservoir dgt mn and mn were the key factors to reveal the bioavailability of as xw and nzd reservoirs are the two most important reservoirs on the lcr because of their annual regulation capacity and large water storage capacity due to the dam construction there are differences in as cycling of sediments in the two reservoirs the development of cascade reservoirs had a certain influence on the bioavailability of as in sediments of upper and lower reservoirs this highlights the role of reservoir interception and regional sediment which reduces the risk of as release in downstream nzd reservoir therefore the migration mechanism of trace metals in the sediments of cascade reservoirs into overlying water cannot be ignored credit authorship contribution statement yao cheng writing original draft conceptualization fengxia zhao

3641,to estimate the surface soil moisture sm using a combination of new spectral indices and methods of random forrest rf and multiple linear regression mlr 11 pedotransfer functions ptf1 11 were developed by combining basic soil properties clay silt sand and bulk density and spectral indices of sentinel 2 satellite in this study 124 surface soil samples were randomly taken from three regions including telo in tehran province ivaneki in semnan province and borujerd in lorestan province iran the results showed that the accuracy of the rf method was considerably higher compared to the mlr method the sm was better estimated using water spectral indices such as normalized difference water index ndwi and surface water capacity index swci along with the basic properties of soil as inputs of ptf7 in the training and testing steps the root mean square error rmse decreased from 0 041 and 0 05 cm3 cm 3 in ptf1 to 0 028 and 0 039 in ptf7 respectively the average values of rmse akaike information criterion aic coefficient of determination r2 and relative improvement ri of the rf method were 0 028 cm3 cm 3 559 0 79 and 0 001 and 0 038 cm3 cm 3 279 0 73 and 0 006 for the training and testing steps of all ptfs respectively while these values for the mlr method were 0 032 cm3 cm 3 542 0 69 and 0 0003 and 0 043 cm3 cm 3 269 0 63 and 0 002 for the training and testing steps respectively due to the low values of mbe it was possible to disregard the overestimation of the results the evaluation of results for predictor importance indicated that among the basic properties clay percent has a significant effect on estimation of sm these results show that spectral indices alone are not suitable estimators for sm estimation it suggests using basic soil properties and spectral indices to estimate the sm keywords soil moisture sentinel 2 spectral indices random forest 1 introduction soil moisture sm describes the amount of moisture in the surface layer first 5 15 cm of the soil wang and qu 2009 the sm can be estimated at local and global scales using three methods 1 in situ observations 2 remote sensing rs and 3 simulation models brocca et al 2017 a spatial pattern for factors affecting sm can determine the spatial variations in sm in which can vary greatly over space and time katuwal et al 2018 hence rs and simulation models are two important techniques for obtaining large scale sm rs is a popular method in the estimation of sm which was first reported by johannsen 1970 and utilized in other studies khellouk et al 2020 remote sensing is a promising method compared to the simulation models offering advantages such as relatively lower costs for large area applications jiang et al 2020 on the one hand most of the satellites with high temporal frequency offer coarse resolution 250 1 000 m xin et al 2013 on the other hand moderate resolution satellites such as landsat provide observations at 30 m spatial resolution which is fine enough to screen a range of landscape changes zhu et al 2019 however their temporal resolution is not sufficient for near real time monitoring fortunately the newly launched sentinel 2a and 2b have similar band designs as landsat drusch et al 2012 and together need five days to repeat observations at 10 20 60 m spatial resolution this makes it possible to observe the global land surface every two to four days by combining landsat and sentinel 2 satellites li and roy 2017 optical rs methods usually apply the visible vis near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir data for sm modeling ghulam et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 in rs methods thermal bands normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or their combinations estimate the surface sm yu et al 2013 amani et al 2016 swir is sensitive to leaf water content and offers a more sensitive indicator of sm changes compared to visible or nir for the sm content less than or equal to 50 of the volumetric water content lobell and asner 2002 gao et al 2013 estimated sm content using normalized difference spectral indices nd and simple ratio indices sr they reported that this method is reasonable and suitable for being widely applied in different temporal and spatial scaled fields some studies have recommended and examined a range of normalized difference indices and biophysical parameters for estimating the sm content attila et al 2014 khellouk et al 2020 professionals can significantly correlate drought indices to the spatial and temporal variability of sm and correct information on sm can offer a vision into drought conditions the rs is limited for sm estimation over vegetated surfaces due to the strong effects of surface roughness and vegetation on active microwaves zhan et al 2006 finn et al 2011 showed that rs methods can be relatively successful in determining sm in soils with low vegetation cover the pedotransfer functions ptfs are created using the available properties of soil such as soil texture bulk density geometric mean particle size diameter organic matter percent and geometric standard deviation of soil particles bouma 1989 researchers have studied the use of ptfs in various soil parameters worldwide this is important for parameters with difficult or time consuming direct measurement methods such as soil plasticity al masmoudi et al 2021 soil carbon percent keskin et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity bayat et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 bulk density souza et al 2016 and sm content santra et al 2018 rastgou et al 2020 tietje and hennings 1996 showed there are considerable deviations between the measured and estimated values of the various ptfs which were developed for estimating of soil hydraulic properties thus it is important to investigate methods for decreasing the deviation between the measured and estimated values therefore finding more effective estimators for developing ptfs is known as the best solution the complications related to the above methods have resulted in the use of data driven modeling tools such as artificial neural networks anns support vector machines svms relevance vector machines rvms random forest rf and decision trees for estimating the sm content kashif gill et al 2007 zaman et al 2012 multivariate linear regression is one of the most common statistical methods for determining the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables mcbratney et al 2002 scientists have used a regression method to develop ptfs in recent years merdun 2010 fodor et al 2011 kalkhajeh et al 2012 machine learning ml is a popular method for modeling different properties of soil such as sm szabó et al 2019 one of the main advantages of ml method for estimating of sm content is that it can provide estimates having resolutions commensurate with remotely sensed data zaman et al 2012 researchers have been using ml methods for estimating the sm content using remotely sensed data in semi arid regions bousbih et al 2018 due to their verified accuracy stability and ease of use rf method are among the most popular ml methods the rf method has several advantages over other ml methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy for the estimation of agronomic parameters of crops and other various applications from monitoring of forest growth and assessment of water resources to wetland biomass estimation abdel rahman et al 2014 belgiu and drăguţ 2016 some researchers developed an rf method that links surface biophysical and topographic properties for improving the spatial resolution of sm derived from radar images hajdu et al 2018 qu et al 2019 adab et al 2020 used ml method to estimate the surface sm using landsat data their results showed that the estimations had a significant correlation with the measurements from the rf svm and ann methods that were comparable to the pr2 field data a method for measuring sm on site with a portable multi sensor capacitive probe they concluded that the rf method had higher efficiency than the other two methods svm and ann in testing step for sm estimation fathololoumi et al 2020 studied landsat8 spectral indices and spatial based methods i e rf triangular regression tr and mlr to map the local variations in sm for a semi arid mountainous area they reported that the rf method had the highest efficiency in the modeling of sm in general the rs based models were more efficient for estimating sm than interpolation models because they used both topographic parameters and surface biophysical properties zhao et al 2017 developed a different model for estimating of sm based on the rf method by using time series radar data according to the researchers the rf method provides an estimate of sm that is reasonable and can capture the spatio temporal variability of sm jung et al 2017 estimated the sm using mlr and rs bousbih et al 2018 estimated the surface sm using sentinel 1 and 2 data and ml method they showed that the sm estimation results retrieved from remotely sensed data are accurate with a rmse of 5 between the two moisture products gunarathna et al 2019a evaluated ml methods including anns and rf to estimate sm at different matric suctions in the soils of sri lanka they then developed the ptfs using the rf method however few studies have assessed the feasibility of ptfs including regression or ml methods for estimating sm lamorski et al 2014 gunarathna et al 2019a gunarathna et al 2019b this is possibly due to the lack of suitable indicators used in modeling of surface sm resulting in the lack of thorough solutions in this sector to answer whether soil spectral information is effective in improving of sm estimations this study aims to introduce effective spectral indices vegetation moisture and soil to improve sm estimation at first the spectral indices obtained from sentinel 2 satellite data and then their correlation was evaluated with surface sm consequently the surface sm was estimated by creating a transfer function based on spectral indices and basic soil properties clay silt sand and bulk density using mlr and rf methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description in the present study 124 disturbed soil samples 0 to 10 cm were prepared from three regions of iran including telo in tehran province 35 47ˊ 35 48ˊ n 51 37ˊ 51 39ˊe 40 samples ivaneki in semnan province 35 28ˊ 35 34ˊ n 52 00ˊ to 52 05ˊe 30 samples and borujerd in lorestan province 33 45ˊ 33 55ˊ n 48 12ˊ 48 12ˊ e 54 samples based on the water requirement system of plants which was developed by soil and water research institute karaj iran http www swri ir en us douranportal 1 page home the annual precipitation for telo ivaneki and borujerd in 2019 was respectively 510 216 and 678 mm and the mean annual temperature for the studied regions was respectively about 14 27 c 20 42 c and 15 82 c most of the soils have developed profiles grading and construction and the subsurface diagnostic horizons cambic and calcic texture varies from medium to heavy the dominant soils of the areas of study were classified into two orders of entisols and inceptisols the vegetation in the telo region is forest and rangeland while ivaneki has rangeland cover and borujerd has the cultivation of rainfed cover of wheat and barley fig 1 shows a landcover map of these three areas the land cover maps of three areas were generated by processing sentinel imagery within the google earth engine gee platform for this purpose the images of seminal 2 used an object based rf classification method 2 2 experimental design of the samples the soil samples were obtained from different altitudes reflecting microclimate conditions adab et al 2020 and because of area s conditions i e mostly forested and the high slope and lack of access at some points regular network sampling was not possible however by examining the overlapping of the soil layer land use layer and elevation data the soil sampling was carried out randomly with a suitable distribution that represented the general properties of the region the soil samples were prepared based on the standard methods to measure their basic properties sm content was measured using gravimetric method gardner 1986 and then by using the method of lobell and asner 2002 the volumetric moisture was calculated the core cylinder method was used to measure the bulk density grossman and reinsch 2002 also the method of gee and or 2002 was used to determine the soil texture the distribution status of the 124 soil samples based on the usda textural triangle is presented in fig 2 based on this figure the soil samples were covered by ten textural classes and did not include sandy clay and silt classes 2 3 satellite data 2 3 1 sentinel 2 data and image analysis sentinel 2 offers images with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared sentinel 2 integrates an innovative wideband high spatial 10 to 60 m and temporal five days resolution multispectral imager with 13 spectral bands covering the visible nir and swir electromagnetic frequency domains the satellite images in this research were from the european space agency which was mainly synchronous with the sampling time and with no clouds in the study area the sentinel 2 data used in this research were level 2a products bottom of atmosphere reflectance images which were produced by the plug in sen2cor level 2a product can also be obtained directly from esa since december 2018 for the s2 level 2a images a simple scaling factor of 0 0001 was applied sadeghi et al 2017 fig 3 and fig 4 show the properties of spectral indices all the bands were then resampled to 20 m with the nearest neighbor method via the s2 resampling processor using snap software chen et al 2020 obviously compared with the sparse ground measurements 20 m remotely sensed images provided more spatial detail in estimating the surface sm along with the soil reflectance the surface sm has correlations with other spatial auxiliary data such as land use types and based on the results of adab et al 2020 this complicates the estimation of sm through reflectance images considering the ground sampling times three images without clouds and corrected them at the l2a level were used table 1 images were processed and analyzed using snap8 software and were plotted in the arcmap 10 7 software to generate maps and data outputs fig 5 shows the flowchart for this study 2 3 2 spectral response of plants and soil to water stress here is briefly explained how spectral indicators correlate with water stress in plants and soil zhang et al 2013 showed that plant reflectance near the red and swir spectra increases dramatically with the decrease in plant water content it is also possible to observe a variable pattern of nir reflectance but no significant change is apparent in the blue spectrum plant reflectance is largely controlled by pigments especially in the blue 0 4 0 52 µm and red 0 63 0 69 µm regions of the visible spectrum 0 4 0 74 µm ollinger 2011 soil reflectance tend to increase with increasing wavelength at a rate depending on other physical and chemical properties of soil attila et al 2014 the organic matter content moisture content parent material soil texture size of the soil particles and salt content are the most important factors which determine the reflectance these factors are complex changeable and often interconnected furthermore general observations show that increase in organic matter and moisture content of the soil will reduce the reflectance properties in the wavelength range of 0 4 2 5 µm attila et al 2014 sm and mineral composition usually affect the reflectance values the higher the moisture level of soils the lower the reflectance values furthermore the reflectance increases at higher wavelengths correlation and linear regression analysis showed a strong relationship between the sm content and the indices attila et al 2014 also the soil moisture indices smis have correlation with water content of vegetation and sm spectral indices have been applied to downscale passive microwave sm products and showed reasonable consistency with a situ measurement the correlation between spectral indices and sm increases the accuracy of ml method wei et al 2019 evangelides and nobajas 2020 reported that in most cases green blue red and nir spectral properties are more important than multiple band indices such as dvi rvi ndvi and msavi because these indicators have a red edge1 band 705 nm that shows the growth status of vegetation thus accurately measure surface sm a spectral transfer functions approach uses spectral data as cheap fast and accurate soil information and reduces the cost of measuring ptf input data however the addition of the spectral reflectance information can significantly improve the performance of ptfs the models can generally be classified as follows 1 surface sm indices spectral indices are mainly defined in the infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum mobasheri and bidkhan 2013 and increasing surface sm decreases reflectivity in the entire reflectance section 2 5 0 4 µm 2 models based on regression the surface sm is estimated using every correct combination of spectral bands and spectral indices gholami bidkhani and mobasheri 2018 the last type was used for estimating of sm in the present study 2 4 development of pedotransfer functions the kolmogorov smirnov normality test was carried out by minitab software ryan et al 1976 on all variables which were used in the ptfs and non normal variables were transformed as well figs 3 and 4 eleven functions were classified in 4 steps fig 6 the input functions were selected based on the availability of parameters the similar nature of spectral indices i e vegetation chlorophyll indices vegetation indices soil and water indices and the correlation between these indices and sm to increase the accuracy of the ptfs flexible equations and additional input parameters were used to show the relationships between sm soil properties and spectral indices ptfs have different applicability depending on their inputs ptfs were created using mlr and rf methods as they are among the most common mlr methods in rs lópez serrano et al 2016 the training set was applied to create the linear regression ptfs using datafit software and rf by statistica12 software in all four steps 80 and 44 samples were randomly selected from the 124 samples for training and testing steps respectively the ratio of silt sand in the ptfs was used to avoid multicollinearity for all ptfs the variance inflation factor criterion vif was used to test for multicollinearity the vif can be obtained by using the following equation eq 1 marquaridt 1970 vif 1 1 r i 2 1 where ri2 the coefficient of determination for regression with the ith variable considering all other independent variables generally variance inflation factors for ptf should not exceed ten which is usually for multicollinearity detection of regression variables ho 2006 table 2 shows the vif values for the eleven steps 2 5 multiple linear regression mlr mlr is usually in soil analysis as a multivariate statistical method by establishing the relationship between soil properties and a set of estimators this method can estimate soil properties 2 y p 0 p i x i p n x n here pi i 0 n parameters are usually estimated by least squares and xi i 1 n independent variables estimators the results of this method are usually acceptable when a linear relationship obtains between independent and dependent variables 2 6 random forest rf random forest is an ensemble based ml method comprised of n collections of de correlated decision trees hastie et al 2009 to build a tree a bootstrap sample a random sample with replacement is taken from observations to determine a split at a node in a tree a random subsample of estimator variables is taken to select the estimator that minimizes the regression error hastie et al 2009 nodes continue splitting until the error rate does not improve to calculate the regression errors for trees omitted observations were referred as out of bag samples hastie et al 2009 tyralis et al 2019 have recently used rs data to map different soil properties and water dynamics using the rf method 2 7 evaluation criteria akaike information criterion aic coefficient of determination r2 relative improvement ri root mean square error rmse and mean bias error mbe were used for investigating the accuracy and reliability of the developed ptfs 3 aic ln n i 1 n y i y i 2 n 2 n p 4 r 2 1 1 n y i y i 2 1 n y i y i 2 5 rmse 1 n y i y i 2 n 6 mbe 1 n i 1 n y i y i 7 ri r m s e 1 r m s e i r m s e 1 100 where np the number of parameters that need to be estimated n the number of soil samples y i yi and y i the average measured and estimated sm respectively rmse1 root mean square error of the first step and rmsei root mean square error of the second to the eleven steps the accuracy of the estimation was higher for smaller aic and rmse values akaike 1974 the variation between the estimated and the measured values is measured by rmse adab et al 2020 positive and negative values of mbe show over estimation and under estimation of the sm respectively gopinathan 1988 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical analysis of the variables the results showed that the lowest variability belonged to the bulk density figs 3 and 4 high variability of the input and output parameter enhances the model s generalization capabilities while low variability reduces it the coefficient of variation cv represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and it is a useful statistic for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another even if the means are drastically different from one another furthermore the mean and highest percent of clay were 29 7 and 46 2 respectively the bd varied from 1 30gr cm 3 to 1 46gr cm 3 with a mean of 1 38 gr cm 3 which was high because the texture in the studied soils varied from moderate to heavy the cv for the sm was 50 56 figs 3 and 4 which shows that the sm values are highly deviated around the mean thus the sampling points cover a wide range of sm values adab et al 2020 3 2 the results of correlation the results of the pearson correlation showed that there was a good correlation between soil properties and spectral indices and sm figs 7 and 8 there was a significant correlation between sm and input parameters of clay percent si sa ratio and bd these results are not in line with those obtained by botula et al 2012 and rastgou et al 2020 which likely is due to the soil type and the used method for normalizing of clay parameter according to fig 8 sm has a significant and strong relationship with all vegetation spectral indices except rvi soil indices and moisture indices p 0 01 as shown in figs 3 and 4 these indicators are a combination of short wavelength swir and nir spectrum the strong water absorption bands in the swir spectrum are more sensitive to moisture variation than other optical spectral ranges chuvieco et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 in addition some studies showed that nir is less effective for moisture estimation given the lower sensitivity to changes in leaf water content compared with the swir datt 1999 ceccato et al 2002 thus swir and nir bands can effectively reduce the scattering effects of single bands and highlight the water variation of vegetation leaves this means that these bands have a high sensitivity to changes in surface sm and spectral indices have shown significant relationships with surface sm figs 7 and 8 these figures show that vegetation spectral indices correlate positively with moisture and the majority of moisture indices correlate negatively due to the lower sensitivity of water absorption in the nir spectral range wei et al 2019 usually sm in vegetated areas is estimated by measuring a visible and nir band reflectance using empirical models sm can affect biophysical and biochemical parameters of vegetation leading to changes in reflectance there is a high positive correlation between sm and the growth condition especially in arid and semi arid areas the vegetation indices vi can provide an insight into the vegetation condition therefore vis may be used for estimating sm in vegetation covered areas gao et al 2013 weidong et al 2002 indicated that bare soil reflectance in the red and nir bands diminishes exponentially with increasing sm but the function relation may not be suitable for vegetation area the normalized multi band drought index nmdi which estimates the moisture for soils and vegetation is one of the important indicators in this section neither sm nor vegetation moisture has a clear relationship with this index it is positively correlated with changes of vegetation water and negatively with sm changes wang and qu 2009 among the spectral indices the swci index had the highest correlation 0 69 with sm and this result is in consistent with the findings of hong wei et al 2011 3 3 using rf and mlr methods for developing the ptfs regression equations of sm estimation are shown in table 3 the popularity of regression methods is due to their simple methodology longevity in the application and their ability to be applied across numerous process domains by practitioners and academicians however the specific statistical assumptions required for regression analysis such as multicollinearity can limit the utility of the model in the present study these problems were reviewed and resolved before fitting however some of the challenges and issues regarding different reflectance bands related to the optical domain such as red nir and swir are applicable for direct estimation of sm hassan esfahani et al 2015 the results showed that regression equations using several radiometric indices and basic soil properties can have considerable accuracy in estimating surface sm table 3 3 4 a comparison between the results of rf and mlr methods fig 9 depicts the estimation results of the sm using mlr and rf methods for the training and testing steps ptfs were analyzed using mlr and rf methods according to the report of geng 2006 from a theoretical perspective the rf method has several advantages over mlr method first it can select important variables automatically regardless of how many variables you use the algorithm which the rf method uses to select important variables is different from stepwise variable selection in logistic regression the rf method estimates a variable s importance based on the margin of cases second the rf method provides methods automatically to handle missing values third it never suffers from the problem of overfitting breiman 2001 stated that the test set error rates are monotonically decreasing and converge to a limit as the number of trees increases approaching fourth it can handle imbalanced data it is more efficient for a dataset in which the number of cases in the class of interest is small compared with another class fifth it works efficiently in large data sets on the other hand there are two feature selection approaches in the rf method including mean decrease impurity and mean decrease accuracy houborg and mccabe 2018 hastie et al 2009 reported that in the rf method you could use a random subsample of estimator variables to choose the best predictor that minimizes regression errors the size of the estimator subsample is usually the square root of the total number of estimator variables the nodes continue to split until the error rate does not improve further which means that to get the best result for the objective function you must constantly adjust the parameters of the rf method fig 9 shows that both methods have significantly improved sm estimation nevertheless the rf method statistics such as aic and rmse are lower than those of the mlr method at most levels and r2 values for the rf method are higher than the mlr values therefore considering the advantages of the rf method compared to the mlr method as stated above it can be reported with a great level confidence that the rf method s results are more accurate and valid fig 9 shows that the rf method had higher efficiency than the mlr method for estimating of the sm both in the training and testing steps in all ptfs however the regression method improved the estimation of sm in the testing step more than the training step based on the ri statistic in the training step the rf method had higher efficiency than the mlr method in all the ptfs except for the ptf7a and b in the aic criterion the aic values of the first to fourth steps for the mlr method ranged from 555 to 502 and these were greater than those in the rf method which varied from 585 to 515 respectively the rmse values of the first to fourth steps for the mlr method ranged from 0 028 to 0 041 cm3 cm 3 and were greater than those in the rf method which varied from 0 024 to 0 038 cm3 cm 3 respectively moreover the r2 values for the first to fourth steps of the mlr method ranged from 0 53 to 0 75 and they were smaller than those for the rf method which varied from 0 60 to 0 86 fig 9 in the testing step the efficiency of the rf method was higher than the mlr method in all the ptfs except for the ptfs 5a and 11 in respect to the aic criterion in the mlr method the aic values of the first to fourth steps ranged from 281 to 222 which was higher than those in the rf model according to the mlr method the rmse values for the first to fourth steps ranged from 0 034 to 0 074 cm3 cm 3 while those for the rf method ranged from 0 030 to 0 050 cm3 cm 3 furthermore for the mlr method the r2 values ranged from 0 43 to 0 75 these values were lower than those for the rf method which varied from 0 46 to 0 82 fig 9 these measurements illustrate an excellent correlation between the measured and estimated sm values based on aic statistics both methods significantly improved the sm estimation see aic graph fig 9 in the mlr and rf methods the values for the mbe from the first to fourth steps in the model ranged from 0 0008 to 0 004 and from 0 0003 to 0 003 respectively fig 9 the mbe is nearly close to zero for the rf and the mlr methods for training and testing steps so there is little indication of any significant under or overestimation singh et al 2020 according to the results fig 9 ptfs performed better when the number of input variables increased despite the results of the study the rf method provides a better estimate of sm than the mlr method adab et al 2020 and rastgou et al 2020 reported similar results 3 5 effects of different inputs on the sm estimation in this study eleven ptfs were developed with and without basic soil properties in the cases that the spectral indices were used without basic soil properties the results were poor and therefore they were not reported however to show that spectral indices alone are not suitable estimators for sm estimation and it is necessary to include basic soil properties in addition to spectral indices in each group for the level that had the highest efficiency the results of the functions derived from the spectral indices of that level without using the basic soil properties i e ptf5b ptf7b and ptf10b are presented there are two levels in the first group including ptf1 and ptf2 the clay percent and si sa ratio are the only estimator using in ptf1 to estimate the sm the results of the other ptfs were compared to that of the baseline ptf since the soil textural fractions are easily measured readily available and significantly affect the sm content ghanbarian alavijeh and millán 2010 therefore ptf1 was considered as the reference for ptfs results of the use of this estimator were weaker than those from other ptfs fig 9 in this step the rmse and aic for training and testing steps are 0 039 and 0 051 cm3 cm 3 515 and 258 respectively additionally bd was also added to clay and si sa in ptf2 in the model with increasing of bd in the ptf2 r2 increased in training and testing steps as well with decreasing of rmse and aic the estimation of sm improved but it was not significant in the training step at low and high matric suctions the soil water retention curve swrc is significantly affected by the soil structure and texture respectively pachepsky et al 2006 bd is also an indicator of soil structure nunes et al 2020 and has a significant correlation with the sm fig 7 at this step the rmse and aic for the training and testing steps is 0 034 and 0 042 cm3 cm 3 533 and 274 respectively furthermore minasny and mcbratney 2002 found that adding bd to the neuro m model improved the models performance in comparison to only using the textural constituents moreover the inclusion of bd as the input variable along with the soil texture resulted in better performance in both neuro m and rosetta ptfs to estimate water retention minasny and mcbratney 2002 zhang and schaap 2017 many researchers have used parameters from this step c si sa and bd to estimate the hydraulic properties of the soil bayat et al 2015 rastgou et al 2020 the input parameters c si sa and bd of this group are the basic soil properties and the available variables hillel 1998 found that sm depended primarily on the soil structure and texture therefore to improve the accuracy of the model input from these parameters has come at all levels of groups 2 3 and 4 many researchers have used soil textual properties touil et al 2016 and bd bayat et al 2011 as efficient estimators for deriving point and parametric ptfs the importance of soil texture parameters can be demonstrated by comparing ptf5a ptf7a and ptf10a to ptf5b ptf7b and ptf10b the second groups consist of three levels i e ptf3 5 fig 6 vegetation spectral indices are in this group also the basic soil properties at all levels with vegetation density spectral indices gmei and ndi45 were used in ptf3 the vegetation density spectral indices ipvi rvi and dvi are in the ptf4 and vegetation chlorophyll indices gndvi mtci mcari and ireci are in the ptf5a and vegetation chlorophyll indices gndvi mtci mcari and ireci without basic soil properties are in the ptf5b both at training and testing steps the inputs of all levels in this group significantly improved the estimation of sm in mlr and rf methods fig 9 it is noteworthy that the aic and rmse values are almost the same in all three levels of this group for both methods ri in the mlr method is greater than the rf method in the test phase which indicates that the mlr method is more generalizable than the rf method the ptf5a results in both methods had the highest efficiency compared to the other levels one of the reasons for better results at this level compared to the other two in the group is that it used more model inputs which improved its accuracy and reliability schaap et al 1998 in this group the ptf5b had the lowest efficiency fig 9 in ptf5a the rmse and aic values in the training step increased from 0 026 and 572 to 0 040 and 502 in ptf5b respectively in the testing step the rmse and aic increased from 0 039 and 271 in ptf5a to 0 052 and 246 in ptf5b consequently if you do not use the texture and structure properties the model is less accurate based on fig 8 the vegetation chlorophyll indices used in ptf5 had a closer correlation with the sm compared to the other vegetation indices figs 3 and 4 show that all vegetation indices are a combination of visible and infrared bands it is important to note a close relationship between the sm and vegetation chlorophyll at these wavelengths fig 8 the reflectance of healthy plants is mostly determined by pigments especially within the visible spectrum 0 4 0 74 µm ollinger 2011 water stress can lead to a decrease or termination of chlorophyll production including reduced absorption of fluorescein in the blue and red bands lillesand et al 2015 soil dehydration stress causes different physiological effects on various plant tissues including a decrease in chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate brevedan and egli 2003 a decrease in shoot growth and dry matter production hoekstra et al 2001 which depends on the intensity and duration of the stress and plant resistance increasing ndvi and greenness in the study area indicated an increase in vegetation percentage higher transpiration and enhanced sm among other surface biophysical properties firozjaei et al 2019 the third group contains three levels i e ptf6 8 fig 6 the water spectral indices were used in this group the basic soil properties were used at all levels with water spectral indices nmdi and wri in the ptf6 ndwi and swci in the ptf7a ndwi and swci without basic soil properties in the ptf7b and ndmi and msi in the ptf8 based on fig 9 the results show that the inputs of all levels of this group have significantly improved the estimation of sm in both mlr and rf methods at training and testing steps the aic and rmse values in the training step were almost the same in all three levels of this group for both methods however in the testing step these statistics are lower for the rf method compared to the mlr while the r2 values in the rf method are higher than regression in both testing and training steps the ri in the mlr method is greater than the rf method in the testing step which indicates that the mlr method is more generalizable than the rf method in this group the ptf7a had the best results using ndwi and swci indices with basic soil properties while the ptf7b using only ndwi and swci indices had the weakest results in the training step of ptf7a the rmse and aic were 0 031 and 547 respectively whereas they were 0 042 and 525 in ptf7b in the testing step the rmse and aic values were 0 030 and 297 for ptf7a and 0 047 and 259 for ptf7b respectively in the ptf7b the absence of soil texture and structure reduced the accuracy and validity of the model in this group the input indicators were only sensitive to water information but not vegetation growth status zhang and zhou 2019 all input indices except for the ndwi index come from a combination of the bands in the nir and swir spectrum which includes bands 8 and 11 of the sentinel 2 satellite the ndwi was calculated by combining the bands visible and nir which include band 3 and band 8 of the sentinel 2 satellite figs 3 and 4 a change in the water content of the canopy can affect the ndwi in comparison the ndvi is less sensitive to atmospheric effects gao 1996 liu et al 2003 found that estimation of sm with the relative method was more successful in the swir domain 1 4 2 5 m in this group the ptf7a results were relatively better than both levels of ptfs in fig 7 the swci index had the highest correlation coefficient about 0 69 with the sm p 0 01 on the other hand ndwi index had the highest cv about 69 66 figs 3 and 4 and it is imagined that the ndwi index has a significant effect on estimation of sm according to gao 1996 the ndwi index is less affected by atmospheric effects than other indices likely for these reasons the inputs of this level ptf7a had the highest efficiency in estimating of sm not only in this group but also in the four groups the normalized multi band drought indicator nmdi has been proposed by wang and qu 2007 it increases the sensitivity to drought monitoring by comparing soil and vegetation band differences of 1640 and 2130 nm the nmdi s ability was proved to detect forest fires quickly by its successful application in detecting changes in moisture levels wang et al 2010 the fourth group contains three levels i e ptf9 11 fig 6 the soil spectral indices were used in this group the basic soil properties were used at all levels with soil spectral indices ci in the ptf9 bi in the ptf10a bi without basic soil properties in the ptf10b and ci and bi in the ptf11 in fig 9 the results show that the inputs of all levels of this group have significantly improved estimation of sm in mlr and rf methods at both training and testing steps in the training step aic and rmse values were almost the same in all three levels of this group for both methods but in the testing step these statistics were less in the rf method compared to the mlr method the r2 and ri values in the rf method were higher than the mlr method in both testing and training steps consequently the rf method has higher accuracy reliability and generalizability than the mlr method in this group the ptf10a derived from the bi with the basic soil properties showed relatively better efficiency than the other two levels furthermore this level had a lower aic and rmse values and a higher ri value than the other levels in this group the ptf10a had the best results using the bi index with basic properties while the ptf10b using only the bi index had the weakest results in the training step of ptf10a the rmse and aic values were 0 029 and 560 respectively whereas they were 0 042 and 500 in ptf10b in the testing step the rmse and aic values were 0 034 and 289 in ptf10a and 0 059 and 241 in the ptf10b respectively the bi index is sensitive to the brightness of soils which is highly correlated with the moisture content and the presence of salts on the surface escadafal 1989 in most cases the ci index gives complementary information to the bi and the ndvi kaleita et al 2005 reported that the reflectance decreases with an increase in sm the reason for this is probably due to the fact that at high sm contents the soil is already quite dark and additional moisture will have relatively little effect on the reflectance in cases where plant density is low or the canopy has not reached ground closure the reflectance is highly affected by soil reflectance different factors including sm om and soil texture affect the reflectance of soil asner 1998 for a given location the soil reflectance is primarily determined by the sm since other factors change slowly with time weidong et al 2002 therefore the sm must be considered in realistic simulations of land surface reflectance and vegetation water indices the soil spectral reflectance reveals the properties of soil structure and constituents including om total n and soil texture rossel et al 2009 stenberg et al 2010 which are significantly correlated to the hydraulic properties of soil tóth et al 2015 also increasing the brightness of soils increases the surface albedo and thus decreases the sm rao et al 1987 there are still uncertainties for estimating soil hydraulic properties with spectral reflectance a variety of factors including sample sizes soil physiochemical properties including soil color and vegetation types can contribute to the uncertainty of the results although soil spectral reflectance may contain some information about soil physiochemistry it does not pertain to all properties that influence soil hydraulics for example the land use types can affect the soil hydraulic properties through various processes such as fertilization tillage roots growth and death zimmermann et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 however different soil types may have different impacts on their processes despite this using spectral reflectance data as additional inputs can significantly improve the efficiency of the ptfs the sm can be estimated by spectral indices and transfer functions but there are limited studies on developing these methods based on the results integration of biophysical and physical properties of the soil in the mlr and rf methods enhanced the accuracy of sm modeling to shorten the text only the graph of the measured versus estimated values for the sm with the rf method is shown fig 10 3 6 predictor importance the predictor importance represents the rate of changes in output variables relative to changes in each input variable pachepsky et al 1996 one of the important steps in the rf method is model simplification through quantification of the predictor importance strobel and hawkins 2009 the predictor importance is presented in fig 11 for eleven ptfs in the rf algorithm features importance is determined by calculating the decrease in the mean squared error mse of the predictive the more important a parameter the greater its role in decreasing the mse liang and zhao 2019 attanasi et al 2020 statistica software shows the importance ranking on a 0 1 scale for each estimator variable considered in the analysis using the bar graph and spreadsheet of the predictor importance it is usually possible to distinguish the variables that make major contributions for estimating of the dependent variable of interest according to the results soil spectral indices are a more effective way for estimating sm than the vegetation spectral indices ptf11 which are not in consistent with the findings of some studies ziadat 2005 ließ et al 2012 the ci and bi indices were most influential on estimating of sm among the spectral indices entered into the model as estimators among the basic properties the clay percent had the most effect on estimating of sm and the value of one is assigned to it fig 11 it confirms that the soil texture and structure affect the sm hillel 1998 and numerous parameters affect estimation of sm including soil texture and structure parameters touil et al 2016 in the present study were used farmland and rangeland soils which naturally have high suction therefore the clay percent has a significant effect on estimating of sm which is in agreement with the observation made by pachepsky et al 1996 who reported that at small and great matric suctions swrc is significantly affected by the soil structure and texture respectively 4 conclusion the accuracy of sm estimation was significantly improved using the rf and mlr methods but the rf method was superior to the mlr method in the testing step in the testing step the efficiency of the rf method was greater than the mlr method in all of the ptfs in terms of the aic criterion the surface sm was estimated by spectral indices with and without basic properties results showed that the accuracy of estimation was low when using only spectral indices therefore spectral indices with soil texture and structure are good estimators of sm the results showed that vegetation spectral indices are positively correlated with sm while the majority of the moisture indices are negatively correlated with sm all spectral indices significantly improved the estimation of sm in the second group the ptf5a used indices of vegetation such as gndvi mtci and mcari in the third group the ptf7a used indices of vegetation such as ndwi and swci and in the fourth group the ptf10a used indices of soil such as bi with basic soil properties as estimators and all of them increased the accuracy of sm estimation furthermore soil spectral indices are a more effective estimator for sm compared to the vegetation spectral indices ptf11 due to the significant correlation between sm and swir and visible spectrum wavelengths the indices obtained by combining the swir and visible spectrum increased the accuracy of the sm estimation in general by combining basic soil properties with the spectral indices the accuracy of the transfer functions for estimating of sm is increased the relationships between spectral indices and sm may be unstable and time varying the accuracy of sm estimation in the present study is may be related to the condition of studied region in terms of vegetation climate soil properties and the time of soil sampling therefore these indices must be tested to determine whether they apply to other soil vegetation and climate conditions declaration of competing interest the

3641,to estimate the surface soil moisture sm using a combination of new spectral indices and methods of random forrest rf and multiple linear regression mlr 11 pedotransfer functions ptf1 11 were developed by combining basic soil properties clay silt sand and bulk density and spectral indices of sentinel 2 satellite in this study 124 surface soil samples were randomly taken from three regions including telo in tehran province ivaneki in semnan province and borujerd in lorestan province iran the results showed that the accuracy of the rf method was considerably higher compared to the mlr method the sm was better estimated using water spectral indices such as normalized difference water index ndwi and surface water capacity index swci along with the basic properties of soil as inputs of ptf7 in the training and testing steps the root mean square error rmse decreased from 0 041 and 0 05 cm3 cm 3 in ptf1 to 0 028 and 0 039 in ptf7 respectively the average values of rmse akaike information criterion aic coefficient of determination r2 and relative improvement ri of the rf method were 0 028 cm3 cm 3 559 0 79 and 0 001 and 0 038 cm3 cm 3 279 0 73 and 0 006 for the training and testing steps of all ptfs respectively while these values for the mlr method were 0 032 cm3 cm 3 542 0 69 and 0 0003 and 0 043 cm3 cm 3 269 0 63 and 0 002 for the training and testing steps respectively due to the low values of mbe it was possible to disregard the overestimation of the results the evaluation of results for predictor importance indicated that among the basic properties clay percent has a significant effect on estimation of sm these results show that spectral indices alone are not suitable estimators for sm estimation it suggests using basic soil properties and spectral indices to estimate the sm keywords soil moisture sentinel 2 spectral indices random forest 1 introduction soil moisture sm describes the amount of moisture in the surface layer first 5 15 cm of the soil wang and qu 2009 the sm can be estimated at local and global scales using three methods 1 in situ observations 2 remote sensing rs and 3 simulation models brocca et al 2017 a spatial pattern for factors affecting sm can determine the spatial variations in sm in which can vary greatly over space and time katuwal et al 2018 hence rs and simulation models are two important techniques for obtaining large scale sm rs is a popular method in the estimation of sm which was first reported by johannsen 1970 and utilized in other studies khellouk et al 2020 remote sensing is a promising method compared to the simulation models offering advantages such as relatively lower costs for large area applications jiang et al 2020 on the one hand most of the satellites with high temporal frequency offer coarse resolution 250 1 000 m xin et al 2013 on the other hand moderate resolution satellites such as landsat provide observations at 30 m spatial resolution which is fine enough to screen a range of landscape changes zhu et al 2019 however their temporal resolution is not sufficient for near real time monitoring fortunately the newly launched sentinel 2a and 2b have similar band designs as landsat drusch et al 2012 and together need five days to repeat observations at 10 20 60 m spatial resolution this makes it possible to observe the global land surface every two to four days by combining landsat and sentinel 2 satellites li and roy 2017 optical rs methods usually apply the visible vis near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir data for sm modeling ghulam et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 in rs methods thermal bands normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or their combinations estimate the surface sm yu et al 2013 amani et al 2016 swir is sensitive to leaf water content and offers a more sensitive indicator of sm changes compared to visible or nir for the sm content less than or equal to 50 of the volumetric water content lobell and asner 2002 gao et al 2013 estimated sm content using normalized difference spectral indices nd and simple ratio indices sr they reported that this method is reasonable and suitable for being widely applied in different temporal and spatial scaled fields some studies have recommended and examined a range of normalized difference indices and biophysical parameters for estimating the sm content attila et al 2014 khellouk et al 2020 professionals can significantly correlate drought indices to the spatial and temporal variability of sm and correct information on sm can offer a vision into drought conditions the rs is limited for sm estimation over vegetated surfaces due to the strong effects of surface roughness and vegetation on active microwaves zhan et al 2006 finn et al 2011 showed that rs methods can be relatively successful in determining sm in soils with low vegetation cover the pedotransfer functions ptfs are created using the available properties of soil such as soil texture bulk density geometric mean particle size diameter organic matter percent and geometric standard deviation of soil particles bouma 1989 researchers have studied the use of ptfs in various soil parameters worldwide this is important for parameters with difficult or time consuming direct measurement methods such as soil plasticity al masmoudi et al 2021 soil carbon percent keskin et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity bayat et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 bulk density souza et al 2016 and sm content santra et al 2018 rastgou et al 2020 tietje and hennings 1996 showed there are considerable deviations between the measured and estimated values of the various ptfs which were developed for estimating of soil hydraulic properties thus it is important to investigate methods for decreasing the deviation between the measured and estimated values therefore finding more effective estimators for developing ptfs is known as the best solution the complications related to the above methods have resulted in the use of data driven modeling tools such as artificial neural networks anns support vector machines svms relevance vector machines rvms random forest rf and decision trees for estimating the sm content kashif gill et al 2007 zaman et al 2012 multivariate linear regression is one of the most common statistical methods for determining the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables mcbratney et al 2002 scientists have used a regression method to develop ptfs in recent years merdun 2010 fodor et al 2011 kalkhajeh et al 2012 machine learning ml is a popular method for modeling different properties of soil such as sm szabó et al 2019 one of the main advantages of ml method for estimating of sm content is that it can provide estimates having resolutions commensurate with remotely sensed data zaman et al 2012 researchers have been using ml methods for estimating the sm content using remotely sensed data in semi arid regions bousbih et al 2018 due to their verified accuracy stability and ease of use rf method are among the most popular ml methods the rf method has several advantages over other ml methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy for the estimation of agronomic parameters of crops and other various applications from monitoring of forest growth and assessment of water resources to wetland biomass estimation abdel rahman et al 2014 belgiu and drăguţ 2016 some researchers developed an rf method that links surface biophysical and topographic properties for improving the spatial resolution of sm derived from radar images hajdu et al 2018 qu et al 2019 adab et al 2020 used ml method to estimate the surface sm using landsat data their results showed that the estimations had a significant correlation with the measurements from the rf svm and ann methods that were comparable to the pr2 field data a method for measuring sm on site with a portable multi sensor capacitive probe they concluded that the rf method had higher efficiency than the other two methods svm and ann in testing step for sm estimation fathololoumi et al 2020 studied landsat8 spectral indices and spatial based methods i e rf triangular regression tr and mlr to map the local variations in sm for a semi arid mountainous area they reported that the rf method had the highest efficiency in the modeling of sm in general the rs based models were more efficient for estimating sm than interpolation models because they used both topographic parameters and surface biophysical properties zhao et al 2017 developed a different model for estimating of sm based on the rf method by using time series radar data according to the researchers the rf method provides an estimate of sm that is reasonable and can capture the spatio temporal variability of sm jung et al 2017 estimated the sm using mlr and rs bousbih et al 2018 estimated the surface sm using sentinel 1 and 2 data and ml method they showed that the sm estimation results retrieved from remotely sensed data are accurate with a rmse of 5 between the two moisture products gunarathna et al 2019a evaluated ml methods including anns and rf to estimate sm at different matric suctions in the soils of sri lanka they then developed the ptfs using the rf method however few studies have assessed the feasibility of ptfs including regression or ml methods for estimating sm lamorski et al 2014 gunarathna et al 2019a gunarathna et al 2019b this is possibly due to the lack of suitable indicators used in modeling of surface sm resulting in the lack of thorough solutions in this sector to answer whether soil spectral information is effective in improving of sm estimations this study aims to introduce effective spectral indices vegetation moisture and soil to improve sm estimation at first the spectral indices obtained from sentinel 2 satellite data and then their correlation was evaluated with surface sm consequently the surface sm was estimated by creating a transfer function based on spectral indices and basic soil properties clay silt sand and bulk density using mlr and rf methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description in the present study 124 disturbed soil samples 0 to 10 cm were prepared from three regions of iran including telo in tehran province 35 47ˊ 35 48ˊ n 51 37ˊ 51 39ˊe 40 samples ivaneki in semnan province 35 28ˊ 35 34ˊ n 52 00ˊ to 52 05ˊe 30 samples and borujerd in lorestan province 33 45ˊ 33 55ˊ n 48 12ˊ 48 12ˊ e 54 samples based on the water requirement system of plants which was developed by soil and water research institute karaj iran http www swri ir en us douranportal 1 page home the annual precipitation for telo ivaneki and borujerd in 2019 was respectively 510 216 and 678 mm and the mean annual temperature for the studied regions was respectively about 14 27 c 20 42 c and 15 82 c most of the soils have developed profiles grading and construction and the subsurface diagnostic horizons cambic and calcic texture varies from medium to heavy the dominant soils of the areas of study were classified into two orders of entisols and inceptisols the vegetation in the telo region is forest and rangeland while ivaneki has rangeland cover and borujerd has the cultivation of rainfed cover of wheat and barley fig 1 shows a landcover map of these three areas the land cover maps of three areas were generated by processing sentinel imagery within the google earth engine gee platform for this purpose the images of seminal 2 used an object based rf classification method 2 2 experimental design of the samples the soil samples were obtained from different altitudes reflecting microclimate conditions adab et al 2020 and because of area s conditions i e mostly forested and the high slope and lack of access at some points regular network sampling was not possible however by examining the overlapping of the soil layer land use layer and elevation data the soil sampling was carried out randomly with a suitable distribution that represented the general properties of the region the soil samples were prepared based on the standard methods to measure their basic properties sm content was measured using gravimetric method gardner 1986 and then by using the method of lobell and asner 2002 the volumetric moisture was calculated the core cylinder method was used to measure the bulk density grossman and reinsch 2002 also the method of gee and or 2002 was used to determine the soil texture the distribution status of the 124 soil samples based on the usda textural triangle is presented in fig 2 based on this figure the soil samples were covered by ten textural classes and did not include sandy clay and silt classes 2 3 satellite data 2 3 1 sentinel 2 data and image analysis sentinel 2 offers images with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared sentinel 2 integrates an innovative wideband high spatial 10 to 60 m and temporal five days resolution multispectral imager with 13 spectral bands covering the visible nir and swir electromagnetic frequency domains the satellite images in this research were from the european space agency which was mainly synchronous with the sampling time and with no clouds in the study area the sentinel 2 data used in this research were level 2a products bottom of atmosphere reflectance images which were produced by the plug in sen2cor level 2a product can also be obtained directly from esa since december 2018 for the s2 level 2a images a simple scaling factor of 0 0001 was applied sadeghi et al 2017 fig 3 and fig 4 show the properties of spectral indices all the bands were then resampled to 20 m with the nearest neighbor method via the s2 resampling processor using snap software chen et al 2020 obviously compared with the sparse ground measurements 20 m remotely sensed images provided more spatial detail in estimating the surface sm along with the soil reflectance the surface sm has correlations with other spatial auxiliary data such as land use types and based on the results of adab et al 2020 this complicates the estimation of sm through reflectance images considering the ground sampling times three images without clouds and corrected them at the l2a level were used table 1 images were processed and analyzed using snap8 software and were plotted in the arcmap 10 7 software to generate maps and data outputs fig 5 shows the flowchart for this study 2 3 2 spectral response of plants and soil to water stress here is briefly explained how spectral indicators correlate with water stress in plants and soil zhang et al 2013 showed that plant reflectance near the red and swir spectra increases dramatically with the decrease in plant water content it is also possible to observe a variable pattern of nir reflectance but no significant change is apparent in the blue spectrum plant reflectance is largely controlled by pigments especially in the blue 0 4 0 52 µm and red 0 63 0 69 µm regions of the visible spectrum 0 4 0 74 µm ollinger 2011 soil reflectance tend to increase with increasing wavelength at a rate depending on other physical and chemical properties of soil attila et al 2014 the organic matter content moisture content parent material soil texture size of the soil particles and salt content are the most important factors which determine the reflectance these factors are complex changeable and often interconnected furthermore general observations show that increase in organic matter and moisture content of the soil will reduce the reflectance properties in the wavelength range of 0 4 2 5 µm attila et al 2014 sm and mineral composition usually affect the reflectance values the higher the moisture level of soils the lower the reflectance values furthermore the reflectance increases at higher wavelengths correlation and linear regression analysis showed a strong relationship between the sm content and the indices attila et al 2014 also the soil moisture indices smis have correlation with water content of vegetation and sm spectral indices have been applied to downscale passive microwave sm products and showed reasonable consistency with a situ measurement the correlation between spectral indices and sm increases the accuracy of ml method wei et al 2019 evangelides and nobajas 2020 reported that in most cases green blue red and nir spectral properties are more important than multiple band indices such as dvi rvi ndvi and msavi because these indicators have a red edge1 band 705 nm that shows the growth status of vegetation thus accurately measure surface sm a spectral transfer functions approach uses spectral data as cheap fast and accurate soil information and reduces the cost of measuring ptf input data however the addition of the spectral reflectance information can significantly improve the performance of ptfs the models can generally be classified as follows 1 surface sm indices spectral indices are mainly defined in the infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum mobasheri and bidkhan 2013 and increasing surface sm decreases reflectivity in the entire reflectance section 2 5 0 4 µm 2 models based on regression the surface sm is estimated using every correct combination of spectral bands and spectral indices gholami bidkhani and mobasheri 2018 the last type was used for estimating of sm in the present study 2 4 development of pedotransfer functions the kolmogorov smirnov normality test was carried out by minitab software ryan et al 1976 on all variables which were used in the ptfs and non normal variables were transformed as well figs 3 and 4 eleven functions were classified in 4 steps fig 6 the input functions were selected based on the availability of parameters the similar nature of spectral indices i e vegetation chlorophyll indices vegetation indices soil and water indices and the correlation between these indices and sm to increase the accuracy of the ptfs flexible equations and additional input parameters were used to show the relationships between sm soil properties and spectral indices ptfs have different applicability depending on their inputs ptfs were created using mlr and rf methods as they are among the most common mlr methods in rs lópez serrano et al 2016 the training set was applied to create the linear regression ptfs using datafit software and rf by statistica12 software in all four steps 80 and 44 samples were randomly selected from the 124 samples for training and testing steps respectively the ratio of silt sand in the ptfs was used to avoid multicollinearity for all ptfs the variance inflation factor criterion vif was used to test for multicollinearity the vif can be obtained by using the following equation eq 1 marquaridt 1970 vif 1 1 r i 2 1 where ri2 the coefficient of determination for regression with the ith variable considering all other independent variables generally variance inflation factors for ptf should not exceed ten which is usually for multicollinearity detection of regression variables ho 2006 table 2 shows the vif values for the eleven steps 2 5 multiple linear regression mlr mlr is usually in soil analysis as a multivariate statistical method by establishing the relationship between soil properties and a set of estimators this method can estimate soil properties 2 y p 0 p i x i p n x n here pi i 0 n parameters are usually estimated by least squares and xi i 1 n independent variables estimators the results of this method are usually acceptable when a linear relationship obtains between independent and dependent variables 2 6 random forest rf random forest is an ensemble based ml method comprised of n collections of de correlated decision trees hastie et al 2009 to build a tree a bootstrap sample a random sample with replacement is taken from observations to determine a split at a node in a tree a random subsample of estimator variables is taken to select the estimator that minimizes the regression error hastie et al 2009 nodes continue splitting until the error rate does not improve to calculate the regression errors for trees omitted observations were referred as out of bag samples hastie et al 2009 tyralis et al 2019 have recently used rs data to map different soil properties and water dynamics using the rf method 2 7 evaluation criteria akaike information criterion aic coefficient of determination r2 relative improvement ri root mean square error rmse and mean bias error mbe were used for investigating the accuracy and reliability of the developed ptfs 3 aic ln n i 1 n y i y i 2 n 2 n p 4 r 2 1 1 n y i y i 2 1 n y i y i 2 5 rmse 1 n y i y i 2 n 6 mbe 1 n i 1 n y i y i 7 ri r m s e 1 r m s e i r m s e 1 100 where np the number of parameters that need to be estimated n the number of soil samples y i yi and y i the average measured and estimated sm respectively rmse1 root mean square error of the first step and rmsei root mean square error of the second to the eleven steps the accuracy of the estimation was higher for smaller aic and rmse values akaike 1974 the variation between the estimated and the measured values is measured by rmse adab et al 2020 positive and negative values of mbe show over estimation and under estimation of the sm respectively gopinathan 1988 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical analysis of the variables the results showed that the lowest variability belonged to the bulk density figs 3 and 4 high variability of the input and output parameter enhances the model s generalization capabilities while low variability reduces it the coefficient of variation cv represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and it is a useful statistic for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another even if the means are drastically different from one another furthermore the mean and highest percent of clay were 29 7 and 46 2 respectively the bd varied from 1 30gr cm 3 to 1 46gr cm 3 with a mean of 1 38 gr cm 3 which was high because the texture in the studied soils varied from moderate to heavy the cv for the sm was 50 56 figs 3 and 4 which shows that the sm values are highly deviated around the mean thus the sampling points cover a wide range of sm values adab et al 2020 3 2 the results of correlation the results of the pearson correlation showed that there was a good correlation between soil properties and spectral indices and sm figs 7 and 8 there was a significant correlation between sm and input parameters of clay percent si sa ratio and bd these results are not in line with those obtained by botula et al 2012 and rastgou et al 2020 which likely is due to the soil type and the used method for normalizing of clay parameter according to fig 8 sm has a significant and strong relationship with all vegetation spectral indices except rvi soil indices and moisture indices p 0 01 as shown in figs 3 and 4 these indicators are a combination of short wavelength swir and nir spectrum the strong water absorption bands in the swir spectrum are more sensitive to moisture variation than other optical spectral ranges chuvieco et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 in addition some studies showed that nir is less effective for moisture estimation given the lower sensitivity to changes in leaf water content compared with the swir datt 1999 ceccato et al 2002 thus swir and nir bands can effectively reduce the scattering effects of single bands and highlight the water variation of vegetation leaves this means that these bands have a high sensitivity to changes in surface sm and spectral indices have shown significant relationships with surface sm figs 7 and 8 these figures show that vegetation spectral indices correlate positively with moisture and the majority of moisture indices correlate negatively due to the lower sensitivity of water absorption in the nir spectral range wei et al 2019 usually sm in vegetated areas is estimated by measuring a visible and nir band reflectance using empirical models sm can affect biophysical and biochemical parameters of vegetation leading to changes in reflectance there is a high positive correlation between sm and the growth condition especially in arid and semi arid areas the vegetation indices vi can provide an insight into the vegetation condition therefore vis may be used for estimating sm in vegetation covered areas gao et al 2013 weidong et al 2002 indicated that bare soil reflectance in the red and nir bands diminishes exponentially with increasing sm but the function relation may not be suitable for vegetation area the normalized multi band drought index nmdi which estimates the moisture for soils and vegetation is one of the important indicators in this section neither sm nor vegetation moisture has a clear relationship with this index it is positively correlated with changes of vegetation water and negatively with sm changes wang and qu 2009 among the spectral indices the swci index had the highest correlation 0 69 with sm and this result is in consistent with the findings of hong wei et al 2011 3 3 using rf and mlr methods for developing the ptfs regression equations of sm estimation are shown in table 3 the popularity of regression methods is due to their simple methodology longevity in the application and their ability to be applied across numerous process domains by practitioners and academicians however the specific statistical assumptions required for regression analysis such as multicollinearity can limit the utility of the model in the present study these problems were reviewed and resolved before fitting however some of the challenges and issues regarding different reflectance bands related to the optical domain such as red nir and swir are applicable for direct estimation of sm hassan esfahani et al 2015 the results showed that regression equations using several radiometric indices and basic soil properties can have considerable accuracy in estimating surface sm table 3 3 4 a comparison between the results of rf and mlr methods fig 9 depicts the estimation results of the sm using mlr and rf methods for the training and testing steps ptfs were analyzed using mlr and rf methods according to the report of geng 2006 from a theoretical perspective the rf method has several advantages over mlr method first it can select important variables automatically regardless of how many variables you use the algorithm which the rf method uses to select important variables is different from stepwise variable selection in logistic regression the rf method estimates a variable s importance based on the margin of cases second the rf method provides methods automatically to handle missing values third it never suffers from the problem of overfitting breiman 2001 stated that the test set error rates are monotonically decreasing and converge to a limit as the number of trees increases approaching fourth it can handle imbalanced data it is more efficient for a dataset in which the number of cases in the class of interest is small compared with another class fifth it works efficiently in large data sets on the other hand there are two feature selection approaches in the rf method including mean decrease impurity and mean decrease accuracy houborg and mccabe 2018 hastie et al 2009 reported that in the rf method you could use a random subsample of estimator variables to choose the best predictor that minimizes regression errors the size of the estimator subsample is usually the square root of the total number of estimator variables the nodes continue to split until the error rate does not improve further which means that to get the best result for the objective function you must constantly adjust the parameters of the rf method fig 9 shows that both methods have significantly improved sm estimation nevertheless the rf method statistics such as aic and rmse are lower than those of the mlr method at most levels and r2 values for the rf method are higher than the mlr values therefore considering the advantages of the rf method compared to the mlr method as stated above it can be reported with a great level confidence that the rf method s results are more accurate and valid fig 9 shows that the rf method had higher efficiency than the mlr method for estimating of the sm both in the training and testing steps in all ptfs however the regression method improved the estimation of sm in the testing step more than the training step based on the ri statistic in the training step the rf method had higher efficiency than the mlr method in all the ptfs except for the ptf7a and b in the aic criterion the aic values of the first to fourth steps for the mlr method ranged from 555 to 502 and these were greater than those in the rf method which varied from 585 to 515 respectively the rmse values of the first to fourth steps for the mlr method ranged from 0 028 to 0 041 cm3 cm 3 and were greater than those in the rf method which varied from 0 024 to 0 038 cm3 cm 3 respectively moreover the r2 values for the first to fourth steps of the mlr method ranged from 0 53 to 0 75 and they were smaller than those for the rf method which varied from 0 60 to 0 86 fig 9 in the testing step the efficiency of the rf method was higher than the mlr method in all the ptfs except for the ptfs 5a and 11 in respect to the aic criterion in the mlr method the aic values of the first to fourth steps ranged from 281 to 222 which was higher than those in the rf model according to the mlr method the rmse values for the first to fourth steps ranged from 0 034 to 0 074 cm3 cm 3 while those for the rf method ranged from 0 030 to 0 050 cm3 cm 3 furthermore for the mlr method the r2 values ranged from 0 43 to 0 75 these values were lower than those for the rf method which varied from 0 46 to 0 82 fig 9 these measurements illustrate an excellent correlation between the measured and estimated sm values based on aic statistics both methods significantly improved the sm estimation see aic graph fig 9 in the mlr and rf methods the values for the mbe from the first to fourth steps in the model ranged from 0 0008 to 0 004 and from 0 0003 to 0 003 respectively fig 9 the mbe is nearly close to zero for the rf and the mlr methods for training and testing steps so there is little indication of any significant under or overestimation singh et al 2020 according to the results fig 9 ptfs performed better when the number of input variables increased despite the results of the study the rf method provides a better estimate of sm than the mlr method adab et al 2020 and rastgou et al 2020 reported similar results 3 5 effects of different inputs on the sm estimation in this study eleven ptfs were developed with and without basic soil properties in the cases that the spectral indices were used without basic soil properties the results were poor and therefore they were not reported however to show that spectral indices alone are not suitable estimators for sm estimation and it is necessary to include basic soil properties in addition to spectral indices in each group for the level that had the highest efficiency the results of the functions derived from the spectral indices of that level without using the basic soil properties i e ptf5b ptf7b and ptf10b are presented there are two levels in the first group including ptf1 and ptf2 the clay percent and si sa ratio are the only estimator using in ptf1 to estimate the sm the results of the other ptfs were compared to that of the baseline ptf since the soil textural fractions are easily measured readily available and significantly affect the sm content ghanbarian alavijeh and millán 2010 therefore ptf1 was considered as the reference for ptfs results of the use of this estimator were weaker than those from other ptfs fig 9 in this step the rmse and aic for training and testing steps are 0 039 and 0 051 cm3 cm 3 515 and 258 respectively additionally bd was also added to clay and si sa in ptf2 in the model with increasing of bd in the ptf2 r2 increased in training and testing steps as well with decreasing of rmse and aic the estimation of sm improved but it was not significant in the training step at low and high matric suctions the soil water retention curve swrc is significantly affected by the soil structure and texture respectively pachepsky et al 2006 bd is also an indicator of soil structure nunes et al 2020 and has a significant correlation with the sm fig 7 at this step the rmse and aic for the training and testing steps is 0 034 and 0 042 cm3 cm 3 533 and 274 respectively furthermore minasny and mcbratney 2002 found that adding bd to the neuro m model improved the models performance in comparison to only using the textural constituents moreover the inclusion of bd as the input variable along with the soil texture resulted in better performance in both neuro m and rosetta ptfs to estimate water retention minasny and mcbratney 2002 zhang and schaap 2017 many researchers have used parameters from this step c si sa and bd to estimate the hydraulic properties of the soil bayat et al 2015 rastgou et al 2020 the input parameters c si sa and bd of this group are the basic soil properties and the available variables hillel 1998 found that sm depended primarily on the soil structure and texture therefore to improve the accuracy of the model input from these parameters has come at all levels of groups 2 3 and 4 many researchers have used soil textual properties touil et al 2016 and bd bayat et al 2011 as efficient estimators for deriving point and parametric ptfs the importance of soil texture parameters can be demonstrated by comparing ptf5a ptf7a and ptf10a to ptf5b ptf7b and ptf10b the second groups consist of three levels i e ptf3 5 fig 6 vegetation spectral indices are in this group also the basic soil properties at all levels with vegetation density spectral indices gmei and ndi45 were used in ptf3 the vegetation density spectral indices ipvi rvi and dvi are in the ptf4 and vegetation chlorophyll indices gndvi mtci mcari and ireci are in the ptf5a and vegetation chlorophyll indices gndvi mtci mcari and ireci without basic soil properties are in the ptf5b both at training and testing steps the inputs of all levels in this group significantly improved the estimation of sm in mlr and rf methods fig 9 it is noteworthy that the aic and rmse values are almost the same in all three levels of this group for both methods ri in the mlr method is greater than the rf method in the test phase which indicates that the mlr method is more generalizable than the rf method the ptf5a results in both methods had the highest efficiency compared to the other levels one of the reasons for better results at this level compared to the other two in the group is that it used more model inputs which improved its accuracy and reliability schaap et al 1998 in this group the ptf5b had the lowest efficiency fig 9 in ptf5a the rmse and aic values in the training step increased from 0 026 and 572 to 0 040 and 502 in ptf5b respectively in the testing step the rmse and aic increased from 0 039 and 271 in ptf5a to 0 052 and 246 in ptf5b consequently if you do not use the texture and structure properties the model is less accurate based on fig 8 the vegetation chlorophyll indices used in ptf5 had a closer correlation with the sm compared to the other vegetation indices figs 3 and 4 show that all vegetation indices are a combination of visible and infrared bands it is important to note a close relationship between the sm and vegetation chlorophyll at these wavelengths fig 8 the reflectance of healthy plants is mostly determined by pigments especially within the visible spectrum 0 4 0 74 µm ollinger 2011 water stress can lead to a decrease or termination of chlorophyll production including reduced absorption of fluorescein in the blue and red bands lillesand et al 2015 soil dehydration stress causes different physiological effects on various plant tissues including a decrease in chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate brevedan and egli 2003 a decrease in shoot growth and dry matter production hoekstra et al 2001 which depends on the intensity and duration of the stress and plant resistance increasing ndvi and greenness in the study area indicated an increase in vegetation percentage higher transpiration and enhanced sm among other surface biophysical properties firozjaei et al 2019 the third group contains three levels i e ptf6 8 fig 6 the water spectral indices were used in this group the basic soil properties were used at all levels with water spectral indices nmdi and wri in the ptf6 ndwi and swci in the ptf7a ndwi and swci without basic soil properties in the ptf7b and ndmi and msi in the ptf8 based on fig 9 the results show that the inputs of all levels of this group have significantly improved the estimation of sm in both mlr and rf methods at training and testing steps the aic and rmse values in the training step were almost the same in all three levels of this group for both methods however in the testing step these statistics are lower for the rf method compared to the mlr while the r2 values in the rf method are higher than regression in both testing and training steps the ri in the mlr method is greater than the rf method in the testing step which indicates that the mlr method is more generalizable than the rf method in this group the ptf7a had the best results using ndwi and swci indices with basic soil properties while the ptf7b using only ndwi and swci indices had the weakest results in the training step of ptf7a the rmse and aic were 0 031 and 547 respectively whereas they were 0 042 and 525 in ptf7b in the testing step the rmse and aic values were 0 030 and 297 for ptf7a and 0 047 and 259 for ptf7b respectively in the ptf7b the absence of soil texture and structure reduced the accuracy and validity of the model in this group the input indicators were only sensitive to water information but not vegetation growth status zhang and zhou 2019 all input indices except for the ndwi index come from a combination of the bands in the nir and swir spectrum which includes bands 8 and 11 of the sentinel 2 satellite the ndwi was calculated by combining the bands visible and nir which include band 3 and band 8 of the sentinel 2 satellite figs 3 and 4 a change in the water content of the canopy can affect the ndwi in comparison the ndvi is less sensitive to atmospheric effects gao 1996 liu et al 2003 found that estimation of sm with the relative method was more successful in the swir domain 1 4 2 5 m in this group the ptf7a results were relatively better than both levels of ptfs in fig 7 the swci index had the highest correlation coefficient about 0 69 with the sm p 0 01 on the other hand ndwi index had the highest cv about 69 66 figs 3 and 4 and it is imagined that the ndwi index has a significant effect on estimation of sm according to gao 1996 the ndwi index is less affected by atmospheric effects than other indices likely for these reasons the inputs of this level ptf7a had the highest efficiency in estimating of sm not only in this group but also in the four groups the normalized multi band drought indicator nmdi has been proposed by wang and qu 2007 it increases the sensitivity to drought monitoring by comparing soil and vegetation band differences of 1640 and 2130 nm the nmdi s ability was proved to detect forest fires quickly by its successful application in detecting changes in moisture levels wang et al 2010 the fourth group contains three levels i e ptf9 11 fig 6 the soil spectral indices were used in this group the basic soil properties were used at all levels with soil spectral indices ci in the ptf9 bi in the ptf10a bi without basic soil properties in the ptf10b and ci and bi in the ptf11 in fig 9 the results show that the inputs of all levels of this group have significantly improved estimation of sm in mlr and rf methods at both training and testing steps in the training step aic and rmse values were almost the same in all three levels of this group for both methods but in the testing step these statistics were less in the rf method compared to the mlr method the r2 and ri values in the rf method were higher than the mlr method in both testing and training steps consequently the rf method has higher accuracy reliability and generalizability than the mlr method in this group the ptf10a derived from the bi with the basic soil properties showed relatively better efficiency than the other two levels furthermore this level had a lower aic and rmse values and a higher ri value than the other levels in this group the ptf10a had the best results using the bi index with basic properties while the ptf10b using only the bi index had the weakest results in the training step of ptf10a the rmse and aic values were 0 029 and 560 respectively whereas they were 0 042 and 500 in ptf10b in the testing step the rmse and aic values were 0 034 and 289 in ptf10a and 0 059 and 241 in the ptf10b respectively the bi index is sensitive to the brightness of soils which is highly correlated with the moisture content and the presence of salts on the surface escadafal 1989 in most cases the ci index gives complementary information to the bi and the ndvi kaleita et al 2005 reported that the reflectance decreases with an increase in sm the reason for this is probably due to the fact that at high sm contents the soil is already quite dark and additional moisture will have relatively little effect on the reflectance in cases where plant density is low or the canopy has not reached ground closure the reflectance is highly affected by soil reflectance different factors including sm om and soil texture affect the reflectance of soil asner 1998 for a given location the soil reflectance is primarily determined by the sm since other factors change slowly with time weidong et al 2002 therefore the sm must be considered in realistic simulations of land surface reflectance and vegetation water indices the soil spectral reflectance reveals the properties of soil structure and constituents including om total n and soil texture rossel et al 2009 stenberg et al 2010 which are significantly correlated to the hydraulic properties of soil tóth et al 2015 also increasing the brightness of soils increases the surface albedo and thus decreases the sm rao et al 1987 there are still uncertainties for estimating soil hydraulic properties with spectral reflectance a variety of factors including sample sizes soil physiochemical properties including soil color and vegetation types can contribute to the uncertainty of the results although soil spectral reflectance may contain some information about soil physiochemistry it does not pertain to all properties that influence soil hydraulics for example the land use types can affect the soil hydraulic properties through various processes such as fertilization tillage roots growth and death zimmermann et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 however different soil types may have different impacts on their processes despite this using spectral reflectance data as additional inputs can significantly improve the efficiency of the ptfs the sm can be estimated by spectral indices and transfer functions but there are limited studies on developing these methods based on the results integration of biophysical and physical properties of the soil in the mlr and rf methods enhanced the accuracy of sm modeling to shorten the text only the graph of the measured versus estimated values for the sm with the rf method is shown fig 10 3 6 predictor importance the predictor importance represents the rate of changes in output variables relative to changes in each input variable pachepsky et al 1996 one of the important steps in the rf method is model simplification through quantification of the predictor importance strobel and hawkins 2009 the predictor importance is presented in fig 11 for eleven ptfs in the rf algorithm features importance is determined by calculating the decrease in the mean squared error mse of the predictive the more important a parameter the greater its role in decreasing the mse liang and zhao 2019 attanasi et al 2020 statistica software shows the importance ranking on a 0 1 scale for each estimator variable considered in the analysis using the bar graph and spreadsheet of the predictor importance it is usually possible to distinguish the variables that make major contributions for estimating of the dependent variable of interest according to the results soil spectral indices are a more effective way for estimating sm than the vegetation spectral indices ptf11 which are not in consistent with the findings of some studies ziadat 2005 ließ et al 2012 the ci and bi indices were most influential on estimating of sm among the spectral indices entered into the model as estimators among the basic properties the clay percent had the most effect on estimating of sm and the value of one is assigned to it fig 11 it confirms that the soil texture and structure affect the sm hillel 1998 and numerous parameters affect estimation of sm including soil texture and structure parameters touil et al 2016 in the present study were used farmland and rangeland soils which naturally have high suction therefore the clay percent has a significant effect on estimating of sm which is in agreement with the observation made by pachepsky et al 1996 who reported that at small and great matric suctions swrc is significantly affected by the soil structure and texture respectively 4 conclusion the accuracy of sm estimation was significantly improved using the rf and mlr methods but the rf method was superior to the mlr method in the testing step in the testing step the efficiency of the rf method was greater than the mlr method in all of the ptfs in terms of the aic criterion the surface sm was estimated by spectral indices with and without basic properties results showed that the accuracy of estimation was low when using only spectral indices therefore spectral indices with soil texture and structure are good estimators of sm the results showed that vegetation spectral indices are positively correlated with sm while the majority of the moisture indices are negatively correlated with sm all spectral indices significantly improved the estimation of sm in the second group the ptf5a used indices of vegetation such as gndvi mtci and mcari in the third group the ptf7a used indices of vegetation such as ndwi and swci and in the fourth group the ptf10a used indices of soil such as bi with basic soil properties as estimators and all of them increased the accuracy of sm estimation furthermore soil spectral indices are a more effective estimator for sm compared to the vegetation spectral indices ptf11 due to the significant correlation between sm and swir and visible spectrum wavelengths the indices obtained by combining the swir and visible spectrum increased the accuracy of the sm estimation in general by combining basic soil properties with the spectral indices the accuracy of the transfer functions for estimating of sm is increased the relationships between spectral indices and sm may be unstable and time varying the accuracy of sm estimation in the present study is may be related to the condition of studied region in terms of vegetation climate soil properties and the time of soil sampling therefore these indices must be tested to determine whether they apply to other soil vegetation and climate conditions declaration of competing interest the

3642,transpiration t is a fundamental process in understanding the ecophysiology of plants and it is the dominant component of evapotranspiration et in the terrestrial water cycle although previous studies have examined t characteristics of shrub ecosystems in some regions global scale synthesis that integrates the spatial variations of t et and ratio of t to et t et and the associated influences of bio abiotic factors in the shrub ecosystems is currently lacking in this study we synthesized and analyzed t rate et rate and t et of the shrub ecosystems from the peer reviewed articles using field observations around the world these studies were mainly distributed in drylands with aridity index ratio of precipitation to potential et 0 65 which accounted for 86 4 of the study locations globally the mean daily t and et rates of shrubs were 1 5 1 0 mm d 1 and 2 4 0 8 mm d 1 with coefficient of variation of 63 2 and 36 2 among the study locations respectively mean t et of the shrubs over the growing season was 0 54 0 14 which was generally lower compared with forest grassland and cropland ecosystems the t rate of shrubs was positively related to shrub age shrub height leaf area index and vegetation coverage p 0 05 and the effects of biotic factors on t rate were stronger compared with abiotic factors the et rate of shrubs was positively related to aridity index long term annual mean precipitation mean soil water content as well as shrub height and vegetation coverage p 0 05 by contrast the effects of biotic factors on variations of shrub t et were weaker than those of abiotic factors and the t et of shrubs was negatively related to aridity index long term annual mean precipitation and mean soil water content but positively related to latitude p 0 05 this study is an important supplement of our knowledge gap in terrestrial water cycle and the findings suggest that t accounted for about half of the water into atmosphere from shrub ecosystems and the variations of t rate of shrubs were mainly controlled by biotic factors whereas et rate and t et was mainly affected by abiotic factors keywords transpiration evapotranspiration partitioning shrub spatial variations biotic abiotic factors 1 introduction evapotranspiration et consists of transpiration t through the stomata of plants evaporation e from the soil and evaporation of water intercepted i by the plant canopy and litter layer raz yaseef et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 evapotranspiration is critical for global water cycle and it can amount to up to 95 of the annual water budget in drylands with aridity index ratio of precipitation to potential et 0 65 wilcox et al 2003 wang et al 2012 kool et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 the processes of t and e among ecosystems are distinctly different wang et al 2013 transpiration is usually coupled with carbon assimilation and associated with plant productivity whereas e does not directly contribute to production kool et al 2014 transpiration is strongly influenced by biological factors while e and i are mostly a result of abiotic processes katul et al 2012 thus investigating the variations of t rate and et partitioning and the associated controlling factors would help to better understand terrestrial hydrological cycles vegetation productivity and water use efficiency wei et al 2017 stoy et al 2019 climate change appears to increasingly intensify hydrological cycles and global terrestrial et showed the declining trend jung et al 2010 in recent years a number of studies have been conducted to explore global scale et and its partitioning in a changing environment jasechko et al 2013 used the distinct isotope effects of t and e to show that t is by far the largest water flux from earth s continents representing 80 90 of terrestrial et coenders gerrits et al 2014 revised the input data in the modeling of jasechko et al 2013 and proposed a more conservative ratio of t to et t et i e 35 80 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 focused on 81 studies using eddy covariance and sap flow measurements or isotopic approaches to quantify t et and found that t accounts for 61 15 of et and returns approximately 39 10 of incident precipitation to the atmosphere wang et al 2014 synthesized the published articles that measured at least two of the three components e t and et and showed that t et ranged from 38 to 77 good et al 2015 combined two large scale flux partitioning approaches to quantify et components and found that globally t is 64 13 of et although ranges of global t et differed amongst the above studies et was dominated by t in the terrestrial hydrological cycles zhou et al 2016 as the main component of et t of plants has been measured using multiple methods for example by chambers lysimeter and sap flow methods williams et al 2004 stannard and weltz 2006 wang et al 2010 rafi et al 2019 sap flow is water flux across a given section of trunk diameter at a given period which is an important indicator of water movement in plants liu et al 2012 poyatos et al 2016 thus sap flow can be used to indicate the instantaneous t of plants granier et al 1996 kume et al 2008 steppe et al 2010 a better characterization of sap flow and t dynamics of different ecosystems would improve our understanding of terrestrial hydrological processes its connection to ecological processes and its variability under climate change poyatos et al 2016 as an important vegetation type shrubs are widely distributed throughout the world especially in drylands li et al 2008 gwenzi et al 2014 dzikiti et al 2016 and the area of shrubs is about 2 5 107 km2 which accounts for 17 6 of global land area hansen et al 2000 shrubs in drylands have various benefits such as reducing surface runoff farley et al 2005 altering infiltration spatial pattern eldridge et al 2015 and increasing infiltration rate issa et al 2011 and carbon sequestration deng et al 2014 the sap flow t and et characteristics of shrubs and their relationships with affecting factors have been conducted in a number of studies since 1994 terwilliger and zeroni 1994 cavanaugh et al 2011 ji et al 2016 szutu and papuga 2019 wang et al 2020 even though the number of studies quantifying shrub t rate et rate and t et increased over the years most of these studies focused on one or two shrub species at a specific site schlesinger and jasechko 2014 summarized t dynamics of mediterranean shrubland while average t et 47 10 n 4 of shrubs in mediterranean region still needs to be reconsidered due to limited compilation studies to our best knowledge there was no report of the dynamics of t rate et rate and t et in shrubs at global scale understanding the shrubs spatial characteristics of t rate et rate and t et at global scale and their influencing factors will be an important supplement of our knowledge gap in hydrological cycle in dryland ecosystems this study aimed to synthesize the in situ measurement based publications of sap flow and t rate in shrub ecosystems across the world the objectives of this study were to 1 examine globally the spatial variations in t rate et rate and t et for the shrub ecosystems and 2 understand globally the biotic abiotic factors controlling the variations in t rate et rate and t et for the shrub ecosystems 2 materials and methods using the web of science www webofknowledge com and google scholar www scholar google com we searched relevant peer reviewed journal articles that were published in english before december 2020 literatures that included at least two of the following keywords and phrases were searched one is shrub or subshrub or shrubland and the other is sap flow or transpiration or evapotranspiration to avoid bias in the selection of publications articles were chosen based on the following criteria 1 major results such as sap flow t rate and t et of shrub ecosystems were exclusively obtained from field measurements modeled values were not considered 2 field measurements of sap flow or t rate have to be continuously one month at least in total the final dataset comprised data from 43 published articles and

of shrubs daily mean t rate of shrubs varied with site locations and species and globally the mean daily t rate of shrubs was 1 5 1 0 mm d 1 fig 2 a daily mean t rate of shrubs over the growing season ranged from 0 2 to 3 4 mm d 1 amongst study locations with a mean of 1 6 1 0 mm d 1 and coefficient of variation of 63 2 the mean value amongst shrub species was about 1 9 mm d 1 0 2 4 5 mm d 1 with

biotic factors on variations in annual shrub t et were weak fig 6 among the biotic factors there were somewhat correlations between t et and leaf area index p 0 065 n 26 and vegetation coverage p 0

synthesis 4 discussion 4 1 t and et rates of shrubs and their influencing factors daily mean t rate of shrubs was 1 5 1 0 mm d 1 and it differed with site locations and shrub species with the

conducted a global synthesis of in situ studies that examined t rate et rate and t et dynamics of the shrub ecosystems and most of the study sites 86 4 were distributed in drylands mean daily t rate

3642,transpiration t is a fundamental process in understanding the ecophysiology of plants and it is the dominant component of evapotranspiration et in the terrestrial water cycle although previous studies have examined t characteristics of shrub ecosystems in some regions global scale synthesis that integrates the spatial variations of t et and ratio of t to et t et and the associated influences of bio abiotic factors in the shrub ecosystems is currently lacking in this study we synthesized and analyzed t rate et rate and t et of the shrub ecosystems from the peer reviewed articles using field observations around the world these studies were mainly distributed in drylands with aridity index ratio of precipitation to potential et 0 65 which accounted for 86 4 of the study locations globally the mean daily t and et rates of shrubs were 1 5 1 0 mm d 1 and 2 4 0 8 mm d 1 with coefficient of variation of 63 2 and 36 2 among the study locations respectively mean t et of the shrubs over the growing season was 0 54 0 14 which was generally lower compared with forest grassland and cropland ecosystems the t rate of shrubs was positively related to shrub age shrub height leaf area index and vegetation coverage p 0 05 and the effects of biotic factors on t rate were stronger compared with abiotic factors the et rate of shrubs was positively related to aridity index long term annual mean precipitation mean soil water content as well as shrub height and vegetation coverage p 0 05 by contrast the effects of biotic factors on variations of shrub t et were weaker than those of abiotic factors and the t et of shrubs was negatively related to aridity index long term annual mean precipitation and mean soil water content but positively related to latitude p 0 05 this study is an important supplement of our knowledge gap in terrestrial water cycle and the findings suggest that t accounted for about half of the water into atmosphere from shrub ecosystems and the variations of t rate of shrubs were mainly controlled by biotic factors whereas et rate and t et was mainly affected by abiotic factors keywords transpiration evapotranspiration partitioning shrub spatial variations biotic abiotic factors 1 introduction evapotranspiration et consists of transpiration t through the stomata of plants evaporation e from the soil and evaporation of water intercepted i by the plant canopy and litter layer raz yaseef et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 evapotranspiration is critical for global water cycle and it can amount to up to 95 of the annual water budget in drylands with aridity index ratio of precipitation to potential et 0 65 wilcox et al 2003 wang et al 2012 kool et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 the processes of t and e among ecosystems are distinctly different wang et al 2013 transpiration is usually coupled with carbon assimilation and associated with plant productivity whereas e does not directly contribute to production kool et al 2014 transpiration is strongly influenced by biological factors while e and i are mostly a result of abiotic processes katul et al 2012 thus investigating the variations of t rate and et partitioning and the associated controlling factors would help to better understand terrestrial hydrological cycles vegetation productivity and water use efficiency wei et al 2017 stoy et al 2019 climate change appears to increasingly intensify hydrological cycles and global terrestrial et showed the declining trend jung et al 2010 in recent years a number of studies have been conducted to explore global scale et and its partitioning in a changing environment jasechko et al 2013 used the distinct isotope effects of t and e to show that t is by far the largest water flux from earth s continents representing 80 90 of terrestrial et coenders gerrits et al 2014 revised the input data in the modeling of jasechko et al 2013 and proposed a more conservative ratio of t to et t et i e 35 80 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 focused on 81 studies using eddy covariance and sap flow measurements or isotopic approaches to quantify t et and found that t accounts for 61 15 of et and returns approximately 39 10 of incident precipitation to the atmosphere wang et al 2014 synthesized the published articles that measured at least two of the three components e t and et and showed that t et ranged from 38 to 77 good et al 2015 combined two large scale flux partitioning approaches to quantify et components and found that globally t is 64 13 of et although ranges of global t et differed amongst the above studies et was dominated by t in the terrestrial hydrological cycles zhou et al 2016 as the main component of et t of plants has been measured using multiple methods for example by chambers lysimeter and sap flow methods williams et al 2004 stannard and weltz 2006 wang et al 2010 rafi et al 2019 sap flow is water flux across a given section of trunk diameter at a given period which is an important indicator of water movement in plants liu et al 2012 poyatos et al 2016 thus sap flow can be used to indicate the instantaneous t of plants granier et al 1996 kume et al 2008 steppe et al 2010 a better characterization of sap flow and t dynamics of different ecosystems would improve our understanding of terrestrial hydrological processes its connection to ecological processes and its variability under climate change poyatos et al 2016 as an important vegetation type shrubs are widely distributed throughout the world especially in drylands li et al 2008 gwenzi et al 2014 dzikiti et al 2016 and the area of shrubs is about 2 5 107 km2 which accounts for 17 6 of global land area hansen et al 2000 shrubs in drylands have various benefits such as reducing surface runoff farley et al 2005 altering infiltration spatial pattern eldridge et al 2015 and increasing infiltration rate issa et al 2011 and carbon sequestration deng et al 2014 the sap flow t and et characteristics of shrubs and their relationships with affecting factors have been conducted in a number of studies since 1994 terwilliger and zeroni 1994 cavanaugh et al 2011 ji et al 2016 szutu and papuga 2019 wang et al 2020 even though the number of studies quantifying shrub t rate et rate and t et increased over the years most of these studies focused on one or two shrub species at a specific site schlesinger and jasechko 2014 summarized t dynamics of mediterranean shrubland while average t et 47 10 n 4 of shrubs in mediterranean region still needs to be reconsidered due to limited compilation studies to our best knowledge there was no report of the dynamics of t rate et rate and t et in shrubs at global scale understanding the shrubs spatial characteristics of t rate et rate and t et at global scale and their influencing factors will be an important supplement of our knowledge gap in hydrological cycle in dryland ecosystems this study aimed to synthesize the in situ measurement based publications of sap flow and t rate in shrub ecosystems across the world the objectives of this study were to 1 examine globally the spatial variations in t rate et rate and t et for the shrub ecosystems and 2 understand globally the biotic abiotic factors controlling the variations in t rate et rate and t et for the shrub ecosystems 2 materials and methods using the web of science www webofknowledge com and google scholar www scholar google com we searched relevant peer reviewed journal articles that were published in english before december 2020 literatures that included at least two of the following keywords and phrases were searched one is shrub or subshrub or shrubland and the other is sap flow or transpiration or evapotranspiration to avoid bias in the selection of publications articles were chosen based on the following criteria 1 major results such as sap flow t rate and t et of shrub ecosystems were exclusively obtained from field measurements modeled values were not considered 2 field measurements of sap flow or t rate have to be continuously one month at least in total the final dataset comprised data from 43 published articles and

precipitation range from 116 8 to 530 mm other environment factors and soil water conditions might also largely affect the dynamics of t et of the shrub ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we conducted a global synthesis of in situ studies that examined t rate et rate and t et dynamics of the shrub ecosystems and most of the study sites 86 4 were distributed in drylands mean daily t rate and et rate of shrubs varied greatly among different locations and shrub species with the mean value of 1 5 1 0 and 2 4 0 8 mm d 1 respectively globally mean t et of shrubs was 0 54 0 14 which was lower than forest grassland and cropland ecosystems compared with abiotic factors effects of biotic factors on dynamics of daily mean t rate in shrubs were strong in contrast the effects of biotic factors on variations of shrub t rate and t et were weaker than those of abiotic factors this study is the first time to synthesize studies that measured t rate et rate and et partitioning of shrubs throughout the world the obtained results of t rate et rate and et partitioning of shrubs as well as their relationships with bio abiotic factors at a global scale will strengthen our understanding of the characteristics of t rate et rate and the contribution of plant water use to et in shrub ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement guangyao gao conceptualization methodology writing

3643,this study investigated the frequency analysis of precipitation indices of maximum daily precipitation amount rx1day maximum 5 day cumulative precipitation amount rx5day and maximum length of consecutive dry days cdd using various bias correction schemes over mainland southeast asia msea the bias correction schemes were based on quantile delta mapping qdm with different strategies in selecting the data series including monthly correction mc annual correction ac peak correction using annual raw data pcraw and annual correction using extreme index data series acex two regional climate model rcm outputs from cordex sea and aphrodite rainfall datasets were used as modelled and observed data for methodology verification the study first compared four frequency analysis methods based on generalized extreme value gev gumbel gb log pearson type iii lp3 and lognormal logn distributions at 9 selected sites over msea and found that lp3 was the best choice for frequency analysis for the study region then the study compared the four bias correction schemes at both individual sites and all grids over the entire msea and indicated that the pcraw was the best performer in terms of bias correction for frequency information finally the study gave an ensembled projection of future extreme indices with 200 yr return based on seven cordex sea rcms and suggested a general increasing trend of all indices over msea the study explored the effect of uncertainty originated from adopting various bias correction schemes in mapping future frequency of precipitation indices and is valuable in revealing the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation extremes over large areas under climate change which is important for flood drought risk assessment and adaptation planning keywords frequency analysis cordex mainland southeast asia quantile delta mapping 1 introduction climate change has become one of the greatest challenges to the long term stability of socioeconomic development water security and disaster management around the world ehsani et al 2020 mei et al 2021 occurrence of extreme weather events has been witnessed to become more frequent and severe in southeast asia sea and their consequences are tremendous considering this region s large population size insufficient infrastructure extensive coastlines and broad low lying areas ipcc 2014 also the reliance on agricultural economy for this region makes it especially vulnerable to climate related risks e g flooding drought and heat waves aryal et al 2020 it is thus an imperative task to evaluate the climate risks such as extreme weather frequencies under climate change to provide scientific guidance for early warning and adaptation planning regional climate models rcms with their sophisticated parameterizations and higher resolution climate data than global circulation models gcms gained their popularity in examining the responses of regional climate to various global warming levels in recent years nikulin et al 2018 the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for southeast asia cordex sea is one of the examples for offering regional climate model rcm model projections under the framework of world climate research program wcrp for the sea domain tangang et al 2018 in recent years there have been a few studies on extreme weather events under the impact of climate change over sea for examples tangang et al 2018 projected changes in four annual precipitation extreme indices over sea under global warming of 2 c based on cordex sea datasets and revealed significant changes of these indices over the period of 2031 to 2051 ge et al 2019 projected changes of nine precipitation extreme indices over sea using an ensemble of cordex simulations under both 1 5 and 2 c global warming levels and indicated strengthened frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes over indochina peninsula and maritime continent amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2019 used a nested regional climate model nrcm to evaluate future agricultural drought risk in the mainland southeast asia msea for the near future period from 2020 to 2029 the study suggested an increased risk of drought events in the future based on standard precipitation index spi supari et al 2020 examined the far future projections over 2081 to 2100 of four precipitation extreme indices over sea domain based on eight cordex sea datasets and highlighted the changes with respect to the reference period and indicated more noticeable and wider changes of extreme indices under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 these mentioned example studies generally rely on projected climate data from rcms without pre adjustment on model biases many researchers have indicated the value of bias correction in improving the raw climate model outputs as they may exhibit large systematic errors due to imperfect modeling mechanism and numerical settings ramirez villegas et al 2013 over the past decades various bias correction methods are proposed main examples include delta change gleick 1986 hay et al 2000 direct statistical downscaling hay and clark 2003 maraun et al 2010 and quantile mapping qm sun et al 2011 pierce et al 2015 etc more extensive review of bias correction methods can be referred to themeßl et al 2011 and maraun 2016 in recent years several applications were reported for the sea area using bias correction masud et al 2016 analyzed 24 climate extreme indices over north thailand using both observed and the providing regional climates for impact studies precis rcm simulations for the period of 1960 to 2100 where statistical downscaling method was used for linking large scale model outputs to local scale the study indicated notable rising trend of temperature slight increase of annual rainfall and dropping trend of cool days ngai et al 2017 adopted a trend preserving qm method for bias correction of both precipitation and temperature from five rcms of cordex for east asia cordex ea over sea domain and indicated that the used method could notably reduce the inter model variability ngai et al 2020 examined the future precipitation patterns over malaysia based on indices of rain day frequency intensity and 90th percentile of rain day precipitation amount based on seven cordex precipitation products datasets where the qm method was used to correct daily rainfall time series with the aid of observed gridded data the study demonstrated satisfactory performance of qm and revealed future rainfall patterns over malaysia using ensembled mean of rcms among various alternatives the qm methods have found to be a more flexible method that could modify the distribution of model data to better match the observed one teutschbein and seibert 2012 maraun 2016 the qm method itself has many developments over years and consists of a variety of implementation algorithms such as simple implementation with preservation on the trend of mean hempel et al 2013 enhancement of transfer function using regression passow and donner 2020 and adoption of delta changes tong et al 2020 cannon et al 2015 discussed and compared several quantile mapping techniques including conventional qm detrended quantile mapping dqm and quantile delta mapping qdm in correcting precipitation outputs from gcms based on a few precipitation extreme indices the study pointed out that qdm method was especially advantageous in its effectiveness of detrending the projection data through multiple quantiles and capability of dealing with extreme model projections which may be beyond the scope of the historical record by using a superimposing algorithm more recent examples of qdm applications around the world could refer to passow and donner 2020 tong et al 2020 and xavier et al 2021 from the above mentioned literatures and discussions we have identified two major research gaps firstly with more and more cordex sea rcms becomes readily available it is expected to have more climate change impact studies in sea region and extensive test of advanced bias correction techniques tangang et al 2020 however the applications of qdm method for climate change impact study in this region are still relatively limited secondly it is found that most of the previous works have focused on bias correction of direct climate variable time series like daily rainfall there are relatively inadequate works on exploring the performance of bias correction method on precipitation extremes with frequency considerations kuo et al 2014 soriano et al 2019 as one of the major pioneering works cannon et al 2015 evaluated the performance of qdm and dqm in correcting the annual precipitation maxima with frequency information fitted by the generalized extreme value gev distribution the study verified the validity of bias correction methods in correcting historical data with a return period of 20 years however the work did not carry out more in depth analysis on the type of frequency methods and effectiveness of bias correction on other more complex extreme indices with frequency concerns to fill the above mentioned gaps this study aims to carry out a comprehensive study on identifying the best bias correction scheme based on qdm framework for the purpose of frequency analysis on several precipitation extreme indices over the region of msea and making projections of frequency based extremes for future windows the comparison of various schemes and frequency analysis methods will be conducted first where the grid data based observed precipitation dataset will be used as historical precipitation record and two regional climate model rcm outputs will be adopted for testing the methods the study will start from selected sites for in depth comparison of methodology performance followed by a more extensive comparison for the entire msea after the best option of bias correction and frequency analysis is determined the study will carry out ensembled projections using seven rcms from cordex sea the advantages and limitations of different schemes will also be discussed 2 study region and data the study area as shown in fig 1 focuses mainly on msea including central and south part of myanmar thailand laos cambodia vietnam peninsular malaysia and singapore with a total land area over 4 5 million km2 the study region is featured by long coastlines plains and a few river basins with most areas belonging to warm humid and monsoonal tropical climate the study region relies heavily on agricultural economy and suffers from both flood and drought problems and is particularly sensitive to the impact of climate change ngai et al 2017 aryal et al 2020 overland et al 2021 we also selected 9 representative sites major cities over msea with different geographic locations for more detailed discussion and comparison of study methods they include singapore kuala lumpur terengganu

products html yatagai et al 2012 for both historical and future modelled climate data we choose two rcp8 5 precipitation outputs from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for

temporal resolution is at daily three future windows are considered including near 2010 2039 middle 2040 2069 and far 2070 2099 future these datasets are obtained from esgf nodes https cordex org data access esfg 3 methodology 3 1 bias correction using quantile delta mapping quantile delta mapping qdm is one of the widely adopted bias correction methods for climatic data in addition to its superior performance in describing relative changes of a few precipitation indices cannon et al 2015 has reported its applicability in characterizing 20 yr return magnitudes of annual daily precipitation in this study we will adopt qdm as the basic bias correction framework due to its advantage of detrending the data and avoidance of extrapolation of historical cdf cannon et al 2015 the primary step is to identify the relative change between historical benchmark and projection written as tong et al 2020 1 δ t x m p t f m h 1 f m p t x m p t where x m p t is the model projected data series at time point t f m p t is the cumulative distribution function cdf established from the projected data at time point t f 1 m h is the inverse cdf from modelled historical data the δ t will then be multiplied to the historical corrected value to get the modeled corrected value written as tong et al 2020 2 x m p c δ t f o h 1 f m p t x m p t where f 1 o h is the inverse cdf from observed historical data x m p c is the final model corrected data in this study the empirical cdf will be adopted for qdm in order to minimize the additional error introduced from fitting standard distributions more detailed introduction of qdm can refer to cannon et al 2015 and tong et al 2020 3 2 qdm schemes based on different time series the data series used to generate either historical or modelled cdf for qdm could be based on different time scales such as monthly seasonal annual or derived data points if monthly data is to be used the qdm will be carried out for daily time series within individual month with pooled monthly data from multiple years the corrected monthly based daily time series data then can be combined to form the corrected annual daily time series this scheme is commonly used in previous studies for hydrological impact study as the monthly climatic pattern like wet day or dry day frequency can be best preserved in this manner shrestha et al 2017 in this study we denote the monthly data based qdm as monthly correction mc method similarly if annual data time series over multiple years is used in qdm we call this method annual correction ac method the reason to include ac is that the frequency analysis is normally based on annual scale and the bias corrected quantiles are expected to match annual extreme variables better which is yet to be tested another option is to consider derived data points based on a more complicated extreme index for example the continuous number of dry days can be extracted from the daily precipitation time series over an annual scale thus for each year there will be a derived data series for this index if such derived data series is adopted for qdm we call this scheme annual corrected extreme data series acex the incentive to consider this scheme is that the daily times series even after bias correction may still be weak in reflecting frequency feature of the derived extreme variables acex is a direct data series of extreme variables and expected to perform better the last scheme to be considered in this study is called the peak correction using raw data pcraw where only the annual peaks from the raw data points are used for qdm this scheme exerts correction directly on the annual peaks and is expected to maximumly avoid middle errors accumulated in deriving extreme variables for frequency analysis all these schemes will be fully compared in followed sections 3 3 frequency analysis for precipitation extremes in this study we select three precipitation extreme indices at annual scale to examine the future changes of extreme variables with various non exceedance probabilities including maximum daily precipitation amount rx1day maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation amount rx5day and maximum length of consecutive dry days precipitation amount above 1 mm zhang et al 2011 bronaugh 2014 the reason to adopt 1 mm threshold is mainly based on literatures e g zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2018 acharya et al 2019 which have indicated the effectiveness of 1 mm threshold in classifying wet and dry days for grid rainfall datasets frequency analysis is used to estimate the precipitation extremes over a given return period normally samples of extreme climate variables will be fitted through a standard extreme value distribution that could best reflect the probability distribution of the extremes in this study we consider four frequency analysis methods based on generalized extreme value gev gumbel gb log pearson type iii lp3 and lognormal logn distributions the gev and lp3 are popularly used three parameter distribution types and gb and logn are two parameter and special cases of gev and lp3 respectively for technical details about these methods readers can refer to coronado hernández et al 2020 the return periods of interest are set to 10 25 50 100 and 200 years in this study the reason to choose a relatively wide range of return periods is to ensure that the reliability and stability of the frequency analysis methods could be fully evaluated the suitability of probability fitting will be tested based on kolmogorov smirnov test massey jr 1951 and the accuracy of frequency analysis will be evaluated through the following mean absolute percentage error mape 3 mape 100 n 1 n i mod t i obs t i obs t where imod t is the modelled data at return period t iobs t is the observed data at return period t and n is the number of return periods of interest 4 result analysis and discussions 4 1 evaluation of frequency analysis methods based on selected sites before evaluation of various qdm approaches we first investigate the frequency analysis methods which help forecast the occurrence probability of extreme variables at selected sites fig 2 gives a comparison of the daily maximum precipitation rx1day frequency with 200 yr return period from four methods including gev gb lp3 and logn the computation is carried out on 9 sites based on various time series from observed history o mc corrected modelled history m and mc corrected projections for near p1 middle p2 and far p3 futures it is indicated that that the three parameter fitting methods i e gev and lp3 generally except for gev s overestimation occasionally give slightly higher projections than two parameter ones i e gb and logn however gev tends to give overly high and unreasonable projections in some occasions such as p3 at site 2 under rcm1 p1 at site 6 under rcm1 p1 at site 4 under rcm2 and p2 at site 6 under rcm2 the over fitting issue of gev due to highly skewed time series using maximum likelihood method is also reported by müller 2018 similar conclusions are also found for the rx5day and cdd see supplementary materials to further justify the performance of various frequency analysis methods the mapes between the distribution fitted projections and samples over the return periods of 10 25 50 100 and 200 years are computed the mape at each site for each extreme index as shown in table 1 is an averaged value computed over multiple bias correction experiments these experiments include frequency analysis computations based on observed values for history only raw values for both history and projections and bias corrected values using mc ac pcraw and acex if applicable for both history and projections in total there are 17 21 and 21 experiments for rx1day rx5day and cdd respectively it is indicated that for all indices lp3 notably outperforms other methods due to the consistent lowest values of mapes among all other methods for most sites the mean values of the averaged mapes over all indices and rcm models are 5 01 8 76 1 21 and 6 03 for gev gb lp3 and logn respectively similarly the r square values as given in supplementary materials demonstrated that lp3 has relatively higher correlations between frequency projected values and original samples at the given return periods we also carried out kolmogorov smirnov test for each frequency analysis experiment the mean of passing rates for gev gb lp3 and logn are 99 8 96 5 95 1 and 99 3 respectively although the passing rates are all high lp3 does not perform the best in this respect likely due to its relatively poorer fitting in the lower tail of cdf curves in summary we believe all frequency analysis methods can do acceptable projections for the extreme indices in most cases but gev may have abnormal projections and gb and logn give less accurate fitting in comparison to three parameter distributions lp3 is deemed a relatively better choice for this study and will be adopted for further analysis 4 2 comparison of quantile mapping methods at selected sites we next compare the performance of various bias correction methods at the selected 9 sites mapes are computed based on raw or corrected flood frequency projections with various return periods from lp3 method over the observed ones table 2 gives the mapes over the historical period at various sites based on two rcm outputs the mapes of the raw data over observed one are also shown in the table for reference purpose apparently the raw data gives highly deviated projections of frequencies of all indices in comparison to the observed ones among all bias correction alternatives it is revealed that the pcraw method shows consistently satisfactory corrections in terms of rx1day and rx5day mape 0 for all sites and both rcms and also the lowest mape i e 2 3 in average for cdd the main reason is that there are limited data points of the annual peaks for the quantile mapping e g 36 for historical peaks the empirical cdfs generated from the modelled peaks of indices could be fully mapped to the historical scales by using the algorithm of qdm the annual peaks of cdd still present slightly varying quantiles to the observed ones likely because there are duplicating values of cdd peaks over the historical and future periods which reduces somewhat the effectiveness of cdf mapping the performance of acex for rx5day and cdd ranks the 2nd in terms of the averaged mapes i e 6 6 over all sites followed by mc i e 13 9 and ac i e 22 5 this is because acex is meant to correct the direct data series of annual extremes which would reflect better the frequency of annual indices mc and ac only adjust the daily precipitation time series which may not correctly replicate the frequency features of derived extreme indices like rx5day and cdd this can be seen from the fact that mc and ac still perform satisfactorily although not as good as pcraw in describing rx1day frequencies showing rcm averaged mapes at 3 6 and 4 1 respectively figs 3 and 4 present the frequency curves for site 4 under rcm1 and site 5 under rcm2 respectively for both historical period and far future window 2070 2099 full results of frequency curves at all sites are given in the supplementary materials it is indicated that frequency curves of rx1day from mc ac and pcraw are relatively close at historical periods but those of rx5day and cdd deviate notably especially when the return periods are longer e g 200 years pcraw performs almost perfectly for historical periods except for slight deviation in cdd under rcm1 which is consistent with the results in table 2 the frequency curves from acex are relatively closer to those from pcraw in light of rx5day and cdd and mc and ac seem to project results that are deviated much from observed ones e g 71 0 and 79 4 for rx5day and 55 5 and 78 0 for cdd at site 4 under rcm1 respectively in terms of future projections taking far future window for example the result from mc tends to give higher projections in comparison to other methods in terms of rx1day and rx5day while those from pcraw and acex are still generally close from rx1day alone the ac method gives very consistent projections in comparison to pcraw and acex under both rcm models implying that behavior of over projection for mc is not common for other methods this might because the mc correction is based on pooled monthly record where some extreme historical monthly based daily time series may influence its performance in reflecting the annual characteristics of precipitation extreme indices hence the mc method must be used with caution if the bias correction is meant for frequency analysis a full mape table for different bias correction methods for far future window is also provided in supplementary materials from the above mentioned facts we believe pcraw is the best performer in terms of bias correction from the angle of frequency analysis followed by acex this is because these two methods conduct quantile mapping directly based on the cdfs of the extreme indices either peak or derived extreme time series instead of computing from the daily precipitation time series avoiding the cumulative divergences from the derivation process moreover the ac method is proved to be also reliable in frequency analysis of annual maximum daily precipitation partly because it corrects daily precipitation time series based on an annual scale the mc method however is not recommended 4 3 comparison of quantile mapping methods over msea now we move to the msea region and explore the performance of various quantile mapping methods for large scale applications all frequency analysis is based on lp3 method as discussed in the previous sections fig 5 shows the indices computed from the observed and rcm modelled raw data with 200 yr return period it is obvious that the modeled historical rx1day and rx5day from the two rcms are notably higher than observed levels over majority of the msea with 90th percentile values of rx1day range from 270 to 978 mm for rcm1 and 354 to 918 mm for rcm2 and those of rx5day range from 409 to 1640 mm for rcm1 and 541 to 1595 mm for rcm2 respectively in comparison the observed historical records at 90th percentile for these two indices are from 72 to 201 mm and from 149 to 434 mm respectively the index of cdd seems to be better reflected by the two rcms with the south myanmar showing long continuous dry days the observed historical record has indicated that the majority of the central cambodia could have cdd over 200 days with 200 yr return and this fact was only captured slightly by rcm2 in general the modelled raw data have obvious system bias in comparison to historical record although the local features could somewhat be reflected such as the higher precipitation extremes over the central laos and coastal regions along the west and east sides of the msea fig 6 shows the indices after bias correction using various approaches under rcm1 the results are shown based on the absolute difference of the bias corrected indices and observed historical ones obviously the bias correction method has significantly reduced the system bias from the modelled outputs and the pcraw gives near zero errors for both rx1day and rx5day which is consistent with the results from the selected site analysis in terms of rx1day under rcm1 the mc approach seem to have errors at 99th percentile being between 27 to 37 mm over the entire msea respectively with average absolute error being 8 0 mm the range for ac are 31 to 32 mm respectively with average absolute error being 7 6 mm if benchmarked with averaged historical observation the absolute relative errors of rx1day are 6 12 and 5 80 for mc and ac respectively spatially positive errors from mc and ac are primarily found near central part of myanmar southeast thailand south laos and west cambodia and main negative errors are mainly encountered near the northwest coast of vietnam in terms of rx5day the varying ranges at 99th percentile of mc ac and acex are 174 224 146 314 and 45 105 mm respectively with average absolute errors being 52 3 56 8 19 9 mm comparing to averaged historical record the absolute relative errors of rx5day are 19 74 21 43 and 7 51 respectively spatially positive errors from mc and ac are found in majority of myanmar east thailand south laos majority of cambodia and west coast of vietnam with a large error patch 400 mm being identified near the west coast of vietnam in terms of cdd the varying ranges of mc ac pcraw and acex are found to be 123 56 173 69 16 11 and 30 45 days respectively with average absolute errors being 20 5 32 3 2 4 and 9 5 days respectively the absolute relative errors are found to be 19 9 31 4 2 3 and 9 2 for the four methods respectively spatially the errors from pcraw are rather small for the majority of msea except for a few scattered locations in cambodia mc and ac lead to positive errors over most of south myanmar north and west thailand and southern malay peninsula while negative errors in majority of cambodia south laos and south vietnam where a more serious negative error patch 150 days is found in the central cambodia acex seems to slightly overestimate over most of the mainland sea except for southern malay peninsula fig 7 shows similar results as fig 6 but under rcm2 mc and ac methods in general perform similarly in terms of the three indices the average absolute relative errors of mc for rx1day rx5day and cdd are 5 3 16 2 and 20 4 respectively and those of ac are 5 5 15 7 and 22 8 respectively the average absolute relative errors of acex for rx5day and cdd are 8 1 and 8 9 respectively similar to fig 6 the pcraw shows near zero errors for rx1day and rx5day and its average absolute relative error for cdd is 1 44 spatially positive errors from mc and ac are found in most southern myanmar and western msea for rx1day north msea for rx5day and north west central and south parts of msea the major negative errors are found near south thailand for rx5day and central cambodia for cdd acex shows positive errors mainly in southern myanmar and western msea in terms of rx5day and most part of cambodia in terms of cdd pcraw only seen small negative errors near some areas within cambodia in general the comparison from two rcms demonstrates that the frequency analyzed from pcraw best matches the historical indices followed by acex both mc and ac have relatively large errors for rx5day and cdd 15 to 30 and minor ones for rx1day 5 to 6 as the daily time series is more applicable in reflecting simply derived extreme variable like daily maximum precipitation but less accurate in complex ones like cumulative 5 day precipitation or maximum continuous dry days overall these results are consistent with the findings from the selected sites 4 4 comparison of future projection of extreme indices over msea although the bias corrected indices with frequency information based on rcm outputs are verified by comparing with historical records the future projections may still exhibit uncertainty arising from different schemes of quantile mapping from the previous section the bias correction process itself contains errors that would also be embedded in bias corrected future projections in this section we will compare the indices based on projected data in the far future 2070 2099 minus those based on modeled history for each bias correction method the reason of using modeled history instead of actual observed history is to avoid duplicating error from bias correction process so that the projected changes could be kept as much as possible the raw modelled future minus the history is also included for comparison purpose figs 8 and 9 present the absolute difference of indicators at 200 yr return under rcm1 and rcm2 respectively please note that the bias corrected subfigures are plotted on the same scale for fair comparison and the raw data subfigure is on its own scale due to its much wider data range also to better differentiate the changes we use 95th percentile of the data range to show the results from fig 8 a1 and 8 a4 it is apparent that the projected changes of rx1day from raw modelled data are much different from those after bias correction the 99th percentile of varying ranges of raw mc ac and pcraw are found to be 403 1793 29 1164 65 569 and 61 617 mm respectively with averaged absolute changes being 389 245 112 113 mm respectively spatially although all methods including raw have demonstrated a general increasing trend of rx1day over the entire msea the raw model has shown a few large value scattered areas 1000 mm around the south myanmar and west thailand the projection based on mc method seems to have higher positive changes in comparison to those based on other methods where the large positive change areas 600 mm are found primarily scattered in north and south vietnam southeast thailand and southern malay peninsula the results from ac and pcraw are rather close where only west thailand is seen slight differences in distribution areas of large changes 600 mm this implies that the pcraw based projection of rx1day is more consistent with ac based one from fig 8 b1 and 8 b5 the projections of rx5day from various methods are somewhat similar to those of rx1day the 99th percentile of varying ranges of raw mc ac pcraw acex are found to be 920 2596 46 1173 170 716 130 971 and 147 943 mm respectively with averaged absolute changes being 533 292 156 182 184 mm respectively the raw model data has shown both large increase and decrease of rx5day over the msea it is also indicated that the pcraw performs the closest to acex followed by ac note that acex is the same as ac when computing rx1day the ac method slightly underestimate the rx5day but mc has notable overestimations in comparison to pcraw spatially the raw modelled data has indicated high increasing areas 1500 mm in south myanmar and west thailand and high decreasing areas 500 mm near south laos middle vietnam and north cambodia the mc method shows an overall increasing trend over the entire sea with high increasing areas 600 mm scattered in many places around msea whereas the methods of ac pcraw and acex have indicated that the high increasing areas mainly scatter around west thailand north vietnam and southwest coast of myanmar some slight decreases of rx5day near south laos and north cambodia are also projected by ac pcraw and acex from fig 8 c1 and 8 c5 the projections of cdd seem to be relatively closer by all methods in comparison to other indices the 99th percentile of varying ranges of raw mc ac pcraw acex are found to be 32 75 37 82 36 84 33 182 and 35 193 days respectively with averaged absolute changes being 21 23 22 37 35 days respectively spatially all methods have implied increase of cdd over majority of msea except for southwest myanmar south laos and other scattered areas it is noted that the results from pcraw and acex are relatively close to each other with high increase zones 100 days being suggested in most part of cambodia south vietnam and south tips of thailand and myanmar however other methods did not detect such trends possibly due to deviated corrections for this region in both history and future periods see fig 6c1 to 6c2 fig 9 presents the outputs based on rcm2 although models are different the general findings are mostly consistent with those from fig 8 in terms of rx1day the raw model i e varying from 544 to 949 mm has demonstrated rather drastic changes at 200 yr return and mc i e 149 mm in average seems to give a higher level of projections than ac i e 61 mm and pcraw i e 59 mm in terms of rx5day the raw model shows a varying range from 812 to 1628 mm and the bias correction methods show average changes of 173 100 125 and 130 for mc ac pcraw and acex respectively spatially mc has given more scattered higher positive projection zones in comparison to other bias corrected methods and the pcraw results are more consistent with ac in rx1day and acex in rx5day in terms of cdd the projections show somewhat deviated outputs from various methods although overall a general increase of cdd is suggested over majority of msea where the average absolute changes for raw mc ac pcraw and acex are 16 21 20 18 and 15 days respectively the pcraw and acex methods have main differences in the area of cambodia where pcraw has suggested a general increasing trend but acex has given a decreasing one please note that the overall change magnitude is relatively smaller than the results from rcm1 and the deviation of bias correction for the cambodia region is detected in the model verification stage as shown in fig 7 these results imply a higher level of uncertainty of projection for cdd which is also shown from the results on selected sites in general the projections from two rcm models have shown that various bias correction methods could give different results in terms of the three studied extreme indices the raw modelled data project minus the modeled history gives a different scale of changes for future which is rather different from bias corrected ones particularly for rx1day and rx5day this demonstrates the advantage of bias correction where the changes in the future could be mapped to the historical scale for more reasonable understanding and comparison from this sense the pcraw method could be considered as a relative more reliable correction method among the studied options for frequency assessment in consideration of its good performance in repeating historical frequency and relative consistency in future projections as a second choice ac could also be reliably used for rx1day and acex be used for rx5day these conclusions supplement the outputs from selected sites see supplementary materials 4 5 future projections from pcraw to finally demonstrate the value of bias correction in future projections an ensembled relative changes of model projection over model simulated history in three future windows over msea is computed using pcraw table 3 lists seven rcms selected from cordex sea database where the first two are the rcms adopted for methodology demonstration in the previous sections tangang et al 2020 wcrp 2021 figs 10 and 11 present the projections from these rcms based on 50th and 75th percentiles of ensembled outputs respectively from fig 10 it is seen that the 50th percentile of the projections has suggested an increasing trend from near to far future in terms of rx1day with absolute relative changes averaged at 19 31 30 01 and 43 38 in near middle and far futures respectively those for rx5day are found to be 19 61 28 61 and 40 46 respectively those for cdd are 9 13 11 99 and 18 24 respectively spatially it is found that the eastern cambodia has seen patches of area that have considerable increases 70 for both rx1day and rx5day in the middle of the century in the far future it is found that both rx1day and rx5day have seen scattered areas with significant increases 90 mainly around the northern and western myanmar western thailand and southern cambodia cdd has high increase 45 primarily in northern vietnam southeastern and southern thailand southern tip of vietnam and western coast of southern malay peninsula considering a riskier future the 75th percentile of the ensembled output can be examined from fig 11 the 75th percentile has suggested a more drastic increase of all indicators where the average changes for rx1day are 49 85 67 73 and 91 14 in the near middle and far future respectively those for rx5day are 47 42 64 21 and 83 84 respectively those for cdd are 21 37 27 51 and 36 27 respectively in terms of spatial distribution of the projected changes the red to black areas i e higher positive values are obviously enlarging from near to far future in the near future the increases of all indictors are relatively uniform over the entire msea while in the middle of the century the rx1day and rx5day have seen large increment 120 primarily over cambodia and some scattered areas within myanmar and cdd has high increment 50 mainly over northern vietnam and laos and southern malay peninsula towards the end of the century there are large areas that would see high increase 150 of rx1day and rx5day primarily distributing over majority of myanmar western thailand and southern cambodia whereas large cdd increment 70 is found mainly in northern and southern tip of vietnam southeastern thailand and malay peninsula in general the ensembled projection of frequencies of rx1day rx5day and cdd has implied an overall escalated risk of rainfall and drought extremes over msea specifically myanmar thailand and cambodia are suggested to have higher risk of extreme rainfalls in the far future and vietnam and malay peninsula have higher risk of drought in comparison to other regions over msea by examining the projected results adaptation strategies should be carried out by those highly vulnerable regions to mitigate the impact more detailed projections at the nine major cities as discussed in previous sections can be referred to the supplementary materials 4 6 further discussions this study explored the performance of various bias correction schemes in the context of the qdm framework among these options the mc method is the most popularly used in climate change impact studies although it performs satisfactorily in most applications in correcting the daily time series it may encounter problems in frequency analysis for extreme variables derived from daily data particularly when long return periods are considered e g over 200 years our study demonstrated satisfactory performance of pcraw in reflecting frequency of most extreme indicators and applicability of ac and acex on some occasions however pcraw and acex only exert adjustment based on the derived data series of extreme variables and do not modify the daily time series of the data for studies that need to use adjusted daily time series as input such as continuous meteorological input for hydrological modeling mc or ac would be more advantageous without any doubt the rcm models and the driven gcms under various scenarios have large variations in projecting futures our study used an ensemble of seven rcm models to accommodate the relevant scenario uncertainties and demonstrate the value of the proposed methodology however our study indicated that the uncertainty that is associated with bias correction method may also be significant if the relevant methods are not probably selected the frequency of extreme data series is affected by both the frequency assessment method and the way of carrying out the bias correction our study has indicated the combination of lp3 and pcraw is the best option in mitigating such uncertainty however two things should be highlighted first the pcraw is based on the empirical cdf information of the peak data of extreme indices the number of such peaks should be sufficiently high in order to generate a reasonable cdf mapping it is suggested to have at least 30 year historical record to ensure reliability second it is possible to fit the peak data using standard extreme value distributions like gev or lp3 instead of empirical ones however based on our tests for this study region the fitted method may cause additional error that reduce the performance of the pcraw our suggestion is since the purpose of bias correction is to map the projected future into historical scale we should try to keep the historical matching from the modelled data as close as possible to observation thus empirical cdf is still recommended in general this study made a few novel contributions firstly it is the first attempt to compare various qdm based bias correction schemes in frequency analysis of extreme weather indicators these schemes vary in their adopted data series and frequency assessment methods and may lead to notable difference of future projections our study helped identify the best option of methods which could minimize the uncertainty of projections arising from methodology selection this point is rarely discussed in any previous works secondly we have provided ensembled projection of frequency based rainfall extremes and drought condition in near middle and far future windows for msea which could provide useful information for relevant countries or areas in their adaptation planning efforts we believe from the frequency analysis point of view this is a unique contribution for this region which is particularly vulnerable under climate change impact overland et al 2021 a few limitations are also highlighted here for future improvement firstly this study only considers three representative extreme variables for demonstration other indices can also be tested in the future secondly the main concerned climate variable for this study is precipitation where occurrence probability of dry or wet days plays important roles in time series other variables like temperature radiation humidity and potential multivariate indicators do not have such feature and the quantile mapping techniques may perform differently in frequency analysis huang and fan 2021 thirdly the precipitation assessment is mainly based on grid precipitation data which may still be coarse for localized studies such as urban flood risk assessment however the same bias correction method could be applied if local observed data is available lastly the bias correction schemes tested in this study are all based upon quantile delta mapping which is not the only way for carrying out bias correction other methods can also be explored in the future for frequency analysis 5 conclusions this study investigated the frequency analysis of precipitation indices of rx1day rx5day and cdd using various bias correction methods over mainland southeast asia the bias correction schemes are based on quantile delta mapping with different strategies in selecting the time series including mc ac pcraw and acex two rcm outputs from cordex sea and aphrodite precipitation datasets were used as modelled and observed data respectively the study first compared four frequency analysis methods based on gev gb lp3 and logn distributions at 9 selected sites over msea and found that lp3 is the best choice for frequency analysis for the study region then the study compared the four bias correction methods at both individual sites and all grids over the entire msea and indicated that the pcraw is the best performer in terms of bias correction for frequency information also it was found that ac could also be reliably used for rx1day and acex be used for rx5day in frequency analysis lastly the study presented an ensembled projection of future extreme indices with 200 yr return based on seven cordex sea rcms and suggested a general increasing trend of all indices over msea the study explored the effect of uncertainty originated from adopting various bias correction methods in mapping future frequency of precipitation indices and shed some light on the applicability and performance of different methods although further research works are necessary to enhance the comparison options index types and study regions this study is valuable in revealing the challenge in correcting frequency information for climate change impact studies and initiating the relevant discussion in this specific area furthermore the study is useful in revealing the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation extremes over large areas under climate change which is important for flood drought risk assessment and adaptation planning credit

3643,this study investigated the frequency analysis of precipitation indices of maximum daily precipitation amount rx1day maximum 5 day cumulative precipitation amount rx5day and maximum length of consecutive dry days cdd using various bias correction schemes over mainland southeast asia msea the bias correction schemes were based on quantile delta mapping qdm with different strategies in selecting the data series including monthly correction mc annual correction ac peak correction using annual raw data pcraw and annual correction using extreme index data series acex two regional climate model rcm outputs from cordex sea and aphrodite rainfall datasets were used as modelled and observed data for methodology verification the study first compared four frequency analysis methods based on generalized extreme value gev gumbel gb log pearson type iii lp3 and lognormal logn distributions at 9 selected sites over msea and found that lp3 was the best choice for frequency analysis for the study region then the study compared the four bias correction schemes at both individual sites and all grids over the entire msea and indicated that the pcraw was the best performer in terms of bias correction for frequency information finally the study gave an ensembled projection of future extreme indices with 200 yr return based on seven cordex sea rcms and suggested a general increasing trend of all indices over msea the study explored the effect of uncertainty originated from adopting various bias correction schemes in mapping future frequency of precipitation indices and is valuable in revealing the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation extremes over large areas under climate change which is important for flood drought risk assessment and adaptation planning keywords frequency analysis cordex mainland southeast asia quantile delta mapping 1 introduction climate change has become one of the greatest challenges to the long term stability of socioeconomic development water security and disaster management around the world ehsani et al 2020 mei et al 2021 occurrence of extreme weather events has been witnessed to become more frequent and severe in southeast asia sea and their consequences are tremendous considering this region s large population size insufficient infrastructure extensive coastlines and broad low lying areas ipcc 2014 also the reliance on agricultural economy for this region makes it especially vulnerable to climate related risks e g flooding drought and heat waves aryal et al 2020 it is thus an imperative task to evaluate the climate risks such as extreme weather frequencies under climate change to provide scientific guidance for early warning and adaptation planning regional climate models rcms with their sophisticated parameterizations and higher resolution climate data than global circulation models gcms gained their popularity in examining the responses of regional climate to various global warming levels in recent years nikulin et al 2018 the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for southeast asia cordex sea is one of the examples for offering regional climate model rcm model projections under the framework of world climate research program wcrp for the sea domain tangang et al 2018 in recent years there have been a few studies on extreme weather events under the impact of climate change over sea for examples tangang et al 2018 projected changes in four annual precipitation extreme indices over sea under global warming of 2 c based on cordex sea datasets and revealed significant changes of these indices over the period of 2031 to 2051 ge et al 2019 projected changes of nine precipitation extreme indices over sea using an ensemble of cordex simulations under both 1 5 and 2 c global warming levels and indicated strengthened frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes over indochina peninsula and maritime continent amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2019 used a nested regional climate model nrcm to evaluate future agricultural drought risk in the mainland southeast asia msea for the near future period from 2020 to 2029 the study suggested an increased risk of drought events in the future based on standard precipitation index spi supari et al 2020 examined the far future projections over 2081 to 2100 of four precipitation extreme indices over sea domain based on eight cordex sea datasets and highlighted the changes with respect to the reference period and indicated more noticeable and wider changes of extreme indices under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 these mentioned example studies generally rely on projected climate data from rcms without pre adjustment on model biases many researchers have indicated the value of bias correction in improving the raw climate model outputs as they may exhibit large systematic errors due to imperfect modeling mechanism and numerical settings ramirez villegas et al 2013 over the past decades various bias correction methods are proposed main examples include delta change gleick 1986 hay et al 2000 direct statistical downscaling hay and clark 2003 maraun et al 2010 and quantile mapping qm sun et al 2011 pierce et al 2015 etc more extensive review of bias correction methods can be referred to themeßl et al 2011 and maraun 2016 in recent years several applications were reported for the sea area using bias correction masud et al 2016 analyzed 24 climate extreme indices over north thailand using both observed and the providing regional climates for impact studies precis rcm simulations for the period of 1960 to 2100 where statistical downscaling method was used for linking large scale model outputs to local scale the study indicated notable rising trend of temperature slight increase of annual rainfall and dropping trend of cool days ngai et al 2017 adopted a trend preserving qm method for bias correction of both precipitation and temperature from five rcms of cordex for east asia cordex ea over sea domain and indicated that the used method could notably reduce the inter model variability ngai et al 2020 examined the future precipitation patterns over malaysia based on indices of rain day frequency intensity and 90th percentile of rain day precipitation amount based on seven cordex precipitation products datasets where the qm method was used to correct daily rainfall time series with the aid of observed gridded data the study demonstrated satisfactory performance of qm and revealed future rainfall patterns over malaysia using ensembled mean of rcms among various alternatives the qm methods have found to be a more flexible method that could modify the distribution of model data to better match the observed one teutschbein and seibert 2012 maraun 2016 the qm method itself has many developments over years and consists of a variety of implementation algorithms such as simple implementation with preservation on the trend of mean hempel et al 2013 enhancement of transfer function using regression passow and donner 2020 and adoption of delta changes tong et al 2020 cannon et al 2015 discussed and compared several quantile mapping techniques including conventional qm detrended quantile mapping dqm and quantile delta mapping qdm in correcting precipitation outputs from gcms based on a few precipitation extreme indices the study pointed out that qdm method was especially advantageous in its effectiveness of detrending the projection data through multiple quantiles and capability of dealing with extreme model projections which may be beyond the scope of the historical record by using a superimposing algorithm more recent examples of qdm applications around the world could refer to passow and donner 2020 tong et al 2020 and xavier et al 2021 from the above mentioned literatures and discussions we have identified two major research gaps firstly with more and more cordex sea rcms becomes readily available it is expected to have more climate change impact studies in sea region and extensive test of advanced bias correction techniques tangang et al 2020 however the applications of qdm method for climate change impact study in this region are still relatively limited secondly it is found that most of the previous works have focused on bias correction of direct climate variable time series like daily rainfall there are relatively inadequate works on exploring the performance of bias correction method on precipitation extremes with frequency considerations kuo et al 2014 soriano et al 2019 as one of the major pioneering works cannon et al 2015 evaluated the performance of qdm and dqm in correcting the annual precipitation maxima with frequency information fitted by the generalized extreme value gev distribution the study verified the validity of bias correction methods in correcting historical data with a return period of 20 years however the work did not carry out more in depth analysis on the type of frequency methods and effectiveness of bias correction on other more complex extreme indices with frequency concerns to fill the above mentioned gaps this study aims to carry out a comprehensive study on identifying the best bias correction scheme based on qdm framework for the purpose of frequency analysis on several precipitation extreme indices over the region of msea and making projections of frequency based extremes for future windows the comparison of various schemes and frequency analysis methods will be conducted first where the grid data based observed precipitation dataset will be used as historical precipitation record and two regional climate model rcm outputs will be adopted for testing the methods the study will start from selected sites for in depth comparison of methodology performance followed by a more extensive comparison for the entire msea after the best option of bias correction and frequency analysis is determined the study will carry out ensembled projections using seven rcms from cordex sea the advantages and limitations of different schemes will also be discussed 2 study region and data the study area as shown in fig 1 focuses mainly on msea including central and south part of myanmar thailand laos cambodia vietnam peninsular malaysia and singapore with a total land area over 4 5 million km2 the study region is featured by long coastlines plains and a few river basins with most areas belonging to warm humid and monsoonal tropical climate the study region relies heavily on agricultural economy and suffers from both flood and drought problems and is particularly sensitive to the impact of climate change ngai et al 2017 aryal et al 2020 overland et al 2021 we also

products html yatagai et al 2012 for both historical and future modelled climate data we choose two rcp8 5 precipitation outputs from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for

access esfg 3 methodology 3 1 bias correction using quantile delta mapping quantile delta mapping qdm is one of the widely adopted bias correction methods for climatic data in addition to its superior performance in describing relative changes of a few precipitation indices cannon et al 2015 has reported its applicability in characterizing 20 yr return magnitudes of annual daily precipitation in this study we will adopt qdm as the basic bias correction framework due to its advantage of detrending the data and avoidance of extrapolation of historical cdf cannon et al 2015 the primary step is to identify the relative change between historical benchmark and projection written as tong et al 2020 1 δ t x m p t f m h 1 f m p t x m p t where x m p t is the model projected data series at time point t f m p t is the cumulative distribution function cdf established from the projected data at time point t f 1 m h is the inverse cdf from modelled historical data the δ t will then be multiplied to the historical corrected value to get the modeled corrected value written as tong et al 2020 2 x m p c δ t f o h 1 f m p t x m p t where f 1 o h is the inverse cdf from observed historical data x m p c is the final model corrected data in this study the empirical cdf will be adopted for qdm in order to minimize the additional error introduced from fitting standard distributions more detailed introduction of qdm can refer to cannon et al 2015 and tong et al 2020 3 2 qdm schemes based on different time series the data series used to generate either historical or modelled cdf for qdm could be based on different time scales such as monthly seasonal annual or derived data points if monthly data is to be used the qdm will be carried out for daily time series within individual month with pooled monthly data from multiple years the corrected monthly based daily time series data then can be combined to form the corrected annual daily time series this scheme is commonly used in previous studies for hydrological impact study as the monthly climatic pattern like wet day or dry day frequency can be best preserved in this manner shrestha et al 2017 in this study we denote the monthly data based qdm as monthly correction mc method similarly if annual data time series over multiple years is used in qdm we call this method annual correction ac method the reason to include ac is that the frequency analysis is normally based on annual scale and the bias corrected quantiles are expected to match annual extreme variables better which is yet to be tested another option is to consider derived data points based on a more complicated extreme index for example the continuous number of dry days can be extracted from the daily precipitation time series over an annual scale thus for each year there will be a derived data series for this index if such derived data series is adopted for qdm we call this scheme annual corrected extreme data series acex the incentive to consider this scheme is that the daily times series even after bias correction may still be weak in reflecting frequency feature of the derived extreme variables acex is a direct data series of extreme variables and expected to perform better the last scheme to be considered in this study is called the peak correction using raw data pcraw where only the annual peaks from the raw data points are used for qdm this scheme exerts correction directly on the annual peaks and is expected to maximumly avoid middle errors accumulated in deriving extreme variables for frequency analysis all these schemes will be fully compared in followed sections 3 3 frequency analysis for precipitation extremes in this study we select three precipitation extreme indices at annual scale to examine the future changes of extreme variables with various non exceedance probabilities including maximum daily precipitation amount rx1day maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation amount rx5day and maximum length of consecutive dry days precipitation amount above 1 mm zhang et al 2011 bronaugh 2014 the reason to adopt 1 mm threshold is mainly based on literatures e g zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2018 acharya et al 2019 which have indicated the effectiveness of 1 mm threshold in classifying wet and dry days for grid rainfall datasets frequency analysis is used to estimate the precipitation extremes over a given return period normally samples of extreme climate variables will be fitted through a standard extreme value distribution that could best reflect the probability distribution of the extremes in this study we consider four frequency analysis methods based on generalized extreme value gev gumbel gb log pearson type iii lp3 and lognormal logn distributions the gev and lp3 are popularly used three parameter distribution types and gb and logn are two parameter and special cases of gev and lp3 respectively for technical details about these methods readers can refer to coronado hernández et al 2020 the return periods of interest are set to 10 25 50 100 and 200 years in this study the reason to choose a relatively wide range of return periods is to ensure that the reliability and stability of the frequency analysis methods could be fully evaluated the suitability of probability fitting will be tested based on kolmogorov smirnov test massey jr 1951 and the accuracy of frequency analysis will be evaluated through the following mean absolute percentage error mape 3 mape 100 n 1 n i mod t i obs t i obs t where imod t is the modelled data at return period t iobs t is the observed data at return period t and n is the number of return periods of interest 4 result analysis and discussions 4 1 evaluation of frequency analysis methods based on selected sites before evaluation of various qdm approaches we first investigate the frequency analysis methods which help forecast the occurrence probability of extreme variables at selected sites fig 2 gives a comparison of the daily maximum precipitation rx1day frequency with 200 yr return period from four methods including gev gb lp3 and logn the computation is carried out on 9 sites based on various time series from observed history o mc corrected modelled history m and mc corrected projections for near p1 middle p2 and far p3 futures it is indicated that that the three parameter fitting methods i e gev and lp3 generally except for gev s overestimation occasionally give slightly higher projections than two parameter ones i e gb and logn however gev tends to give overly high and unreasonable projections in some occasions such as p3 at site 2 under rcm1 p1 at site 6 under rcm1 p1 at site 4 under rcm2 and p2 at site 6 under rcm2 the over fitting issue of gev due to highly skewed time series using maximum likelihood method is also reported by müller 2018 similar conclusions are also found for the rx5day and cdd see supplementary materials to further justify the performance of various frequency analysis methods the mapes between the distribution fitted projections and samples over the return periods of 10 25 50 100 and 200 years are computed the mape at each site for each extreme index as shown in table 1 is an averaged value computed over multiple bias correction experiments these experiments include frequency analysis computations based on observed values for history only raw values for both history and projections and bias corrected values using mc ac pcraw and acex if applicable for both history and projections in total there are 17 21 and 21 experiments for rx1day rx5day and cdd respectively it is indicated that for all indices lp3 notably outperforms other methods due to the consistent lowest values of mapes among all other methods for most sites the mean values of the averaged mapes over all indices and rcm models are 5 01 8 76 1 21 and 6 03 for gev gb lp3 and logn respectively similarly the r square values as given in supplementary materials demonstrated that lp3 has relatively higher correlations between frequency projected values and original samples at the given return periods we also carried out kolmogorov smirnov test for each frequency analysis experiment the mean of passing rates for gev gb lp3 and logn are 99 8 96 5 95 1 and 99 3 respectively although the passing rates are all high lp3 does not perform the best in this respect likely due to its relatively poorer fitting in the lower tail of cdf curves in summary we believe all frequency analysis methods can do acceptable projections for the extreme indices in most cases but gev may have abnormal projections and gb and logn give less accurate fitting in comparison to three parameter distributions lp3 is deemed a relatively better choice for this study and will be adopted for further analysis 4 2 comparison of quantile mapping methods at selected sites we next compare the performance of various bias correction methods at the selected 9 sites mapes are computed based on raw or corrected flood frequency projections with various return periods from lp3 method over the observed ones table 2 gives the mapes over the historical period at various sites based on two rcm outputs the mapes of the raw data over observed one are also shown in the table for reference purpose apparently the raw data gives highly deviated projections of frequencies of all indices in comparison to the observed ones among all bias correction alternatives it is revealed that the pcraw method shows consistently satisfactory corrections in terms of rx1day and rx5day mape 0 for all sites and both rcms and also the lowest mape i e 2 3 in average for cdd the main reason is that there are limited data points of the annual peaks for the quantile mapping e g 36 for historical peaks the empirical cdfs generated from the modelled peaks of indices could be fully mapped to the historical scales by using the algorithm of qdm the annual peaks of cdd still present slightly varying quantiles to the observed ones likely because there are duplicating values of cdd peaks over the historical and future periods which reduces somewhat the effectiveness of cdf mapping the performance of acex for rx5day and cdd ranks the 2nd in terms of the averaged mapes i e 6 6 over all sites followed by mc i e 13 9 and ac i e 22 5 this is because acex is meant to correct the direct data series of annual extremes which would reflect better the frequency of annual indices mc and ac only adjust the daily precipitation time series which may not correctly replicate the frequency features of derived extreme indices like rx5day and cdd this can be seen from the fact that mc and ac still perform satisfactorily although not as good as pcraw in describing rx1day frequencies showing rcm averaged mapes at 3 6 and 4 1 respectively figs 3 and 4 present the frequency curves for site 4 under rcm1 and site 5 under rcm2 respectively for both historical period and far future window 2070 2099 full results of frequency curves at all sites are given in the supplementary materials it is indicated that frequency curves of rx1day from mc ac and pcraw are relatively close at historical periods but those of rx5day and cdd deviate notably especially when the return periods are longer e g 200 years pcraw performs almost perfectly for historical periods except for slight deviation in cdd under rcm1 which is consistent with the results in table 2 the frequency curves from acex are relatively closer to those from pcraw in light of rx5day and cdd and mc and ac seem to project results that are deviated much from observed ones e g 71 0 and 79 4 for rx5day and 55 5 and 78 0 for cdd at site 4 under rcm1 respectively in terms of future projections taking far future window for example the result from mc tends to give higher projections in comparison to other methods in terms of rx1day and rx5day while those from pcraw and acex are still generally close from rx1day alone the ac method gives very consistent projections in comparison to pcraw and acex under both rcm models implying that behavior of over projection for mc is not common for other methods this might because the mc correction is based on pooled monthly record where some extreme historical monthly based daily time series may influence its performance in reflecting the annual characteristics of precipitation extreme indices hence the mc method must be used with caution if the bias correction is meant for frequency analysis a full mape table for different bias correction methods for far future window is also provided in supplementary materials from the above mentioned facts we believe pcraw is the best performer in terms of bias correction from the angle of frequency analysis followed by acex this is because these two methods conduct quantile mapping directly based on the cdfs of the extreme indices either peak or derived extreme time series instead of computing from the daily precipitation time series avoiding the cumulative divergences from the derivation process moreover the ac method is proved to be also reliable in frequency analysis of annual maximum daily precipitation partly because it corrects daily precipitation time series based on an annual scale the mc method however is not recommended 4 3 comparison of quantile mapping methods over msea now we move to the msea region and explore the performance of various quantile mapping methods for large scale applications all frequency analysis is based on lp3 method as discussed in the previous sections fig 5 shows the indices computed from the observed and rcm modelled raw data with 200 yr return period it is obvious that the modeled historical rx1day and rx5day from the two rcms are notably higher than observed levels over majority of the msea with 90th percentile values of rx1day range from 270 to 978 mm for rcm1 and 354 to 918 mm for rcm2 and those of rx5day range from 409 to 1640 mm for rcm1 and 541 to 1595 mm for rcm2 respectively in comparison the observed historical records at 90th percentile for these two indices are from 72 to 201 mm and from 149 to 434 mm respectively the index of cdd seems to be better reflected by the two rcms with the south myanmar showing long continuous dry days the observed historical record has indicated that the majority of the central cambodia could have cdd over 200 days with 200 yr return and this fact was only captured slightly by rcm2 in general the modelled raw data have obvious system bias in comparison to historical record although the local features could somewhat be reflected such as the higher precipitation extremes over the central laos and coastal regions along the west and east sides of the msea fig 6 shows the indices after bias correction using various approaches under rcm1 the results are shown based on the absolute difference of the bias corrected indices and observed historical ones obviously the bias correction method has significantly reduced the system bias from the modelled outputs and the pcraw gives near zero errors for both rx1day and rx5day which is consistent with the results from the selected site analysis in terms of rx1day under rcm1 the mc approach seem to have errors at 99th percentile being between 27 to 37 mm over the entire msea respectively with average absolute error being 8 0 mm the range for ac are 31 to 32 mm respectively with average absolute error being 7 6 mm if benchmarked with averaged historical observation the absolute relative errors of rx1day are 6 12 and 5 80 for mc and ac respectively spatially positive errors from mc and ac are primarily found near central part of myanmar southeast thailand south laos and west cambodia and main negative errors are mainly encountered near the northwest coast of vietnam in terms of rx5day the varying ranges at 99th percentile of mc ac and acex are 174 224 146 314 and 45 105 mm respectively with average absolute errors being 52 3 56 8 19 9 mm comparing to averaged historical record the absolute relative errors of rx5day are 19 74 21 43 and 7 51 respectively spatially positive errors from mc and ac are found in majority of myanmar east thailand south laos majority of cambodia and west coast of vietnam with a large error patch 400 mm being identified near the west coast of vietnam in terms of cdd the varying ranges of mc ac pcraw and acex are found to be 123 56 173 69 16 11 and 30 45 days respectively with average absolute errors being 20 5 32 3 2 4 and 9 5 days respectively the absolute relative errors are found to be 19 9 31 4 2 3 and 9 2 for the four methods respectively spatially the errors from pcraw are rather small for the majority of msea except for a few scattered locations in cambodia mc and ac lead to positive errors over most of south myanmar north and west thailand and southern malay peninsula while negative errors in majority of cambodia south laos and south vietnam where a more serious negative error patch 150 days is found in the central cambodia acex seems to slightly overestimate over most of the mainland sea except for southern malay peninsula fig 7 shows similar results as fig 6 but under rcm2 mc and ac methods in general perform similarly in terms of the three indices the average absolute relative errors of mc for rx1day rx5day and cdd are 5 3 16 2 and 20 4 respectively and those of ac are 5 5 15 7 and 22 8 respectively the average absolute relative errors of acex for rx5day and cdd are 8 1 and 8 9 respectively similar to fig 6 the pcraw shows near zero errors for rx1day and rx5day and its average absolute relative error for cdd is 1 44 spatially positive errors from mc and ac are found in most southern myanmar and western msea for rx1day north msea for rx5day and north west central and south parts of msea the major negative errors are found near south thailand for rx5day and central cambodia for cdd acex shows positive errors mainly in southern myanmar and western msea in terms of rx5day and most part of cambodia in terms of cdd pcraw only seen small negative errors near some areas within cambodia in general the comparison from two rcms demonstrates that the frequency analyzed from pcraw best matches the historical indices followed by acex both mc and ac have relatively large errors for rx5day and cdd 15 to 30 and minor ones for rx1day 5 to 6 as the daily time series is more applicable in reflecting simply derived extreme variable like daily maximum precipitation but less accurate in complex ones like cumulative 5 day precipitation or maximum continuous dry days overall these results are consistent with the findings from the selected sites 4 4 comparison of future projection of extreme indices over msea although the bias corrected indices with frequency information based on rcm outputs are verified by comparing with historical records the future projections may still exhibit uncertainty arising from different schemes of quantile mapping from the previous section the bias correction process itself contains errors that would also be embedded in bias corrected future projections in this section we will compare the indices based on projected data in the far future 2070 2099 minus those based on modeled history for each bias correction method the reason of using modeled history instead of actual observed history is to avoid duplicating error from bias correction process so that the projected changes could be kept as much as possible the raw modelled future minus the history is also included for comparison purpose figs 8 and 9 present the absolute difference of indicators at 200 yr return under rcm1 and rcm2 respectively please note that the bias corrected subfigures are plotted on the same scale for fair comparison and the raw data subfigure is on its own scale due to its much wider data range also to better differentiate the changes we use 95th percentile of the data range to show the results from fig 8 a1 and 8 a4 it is apparent that the projected changes of rx1day from raw modelled data are much different from those after bias correction the 99th percentile of varying ranges of raw mc ac and pcraw are found to be 403 1793 29 1164 65 569 and 61 617 mm respectively with averaged absolute changes being 389 245 112 113 mm respectively spatially although all methods including raw have demonstrated a general increasing trend of rx1day over the entire msea the raw model has shown a few large value scattered areas 1000 mm around the south myanmar and west thailand the projection based on mc method seems to have higher positive changes in comparison to those based on other methods where the large positive change areas 600 mm are found primarily scattered in north and south vietnam southeast thailand and southern malay peninsula the results from ac and pcraw are rather close where only west thailand is seen slight differences in distribution areas of large changes 600 mm this implies that the pcraw based projection of rx1day is more consistent with ac based one from fig 8 b1 and 8 b5 the projections of rx5day from various methods are somewhat similar to those of rx1day the 99th percentile of varying ranges of raw mc ac pcraw acex are found to be 920 2596 46 1173 170 716 130 971 and 147 943 mm respectively with averaged absolute changes being 533 292 156 182 184 mm respectively the raw model data has shown both large increase and decrease of rx5day over the msea it is also indicated that the pcraw performs the closest to acex followed by ac note that acex is the same as ac when computing rx1day the ac method slightly underestimate the rx5day but mc has notable overestimations in comparison to pcraw spatially the raw modelled data has indicated high increasing areas 1500 mm in south myanmar and west thailand and high decreasing areas 500 mm near south laos middle vietnam and north cambodia the mc method shows an overall increasing trend over the entire sea with high increasing areas 600 mm scattered in many places around msea whereas the methods of ac pcraw and acex have indicated that the high increasing areas mainly scatter around west thailand north vietnam and southwest coast of myanmar some slight decreases of rx5day near south laos and north cambodia are also projected by ac pcraw and acex from fig 8 c1 and 8 c5 the projections of cdd seem to be relatively closer by all methods in comparison to other indices the 99th percentile of varying ranges of raw mc ac pcraw acex are found to be 32 75 37 82 36 84 33 182 and 35 193 days respectively with averaged absolute changes being 21 23 22 37 35 days respectively spatially all methods have implied increase of cdd over majority of msea except for southwest myanmar south laos and other scattered areas it is noted that the results from pcraw and acex are relatively close to each other with high increase zones 100 days being suggested in most part of cambodia south vietnam and south tips of thailand and myanmar however other methods did not detect such trends possibly due to deviated corrections for this region in both history and future periods see fig 6c1 to 6c2 fig 9 presents the outputs based on rcm2 although models are different the general findings are mostly consistent with those from fig 8 in terms of rx1day the raw model i e varying from 544 to 949 mm has demonstrated rather drastic changes at 200 yr return and mc i e 149 mm in average seems to give a higher level of projections than ac i e 61 mm and pcraw i e 59 mm in terms of rx5day the raw model shows a varying range from 812 to 1628 mm and the bias correction methods show average changes of 173 100 125 and 130 for mc ac pcraw and acex respectively spatially mc has given more scattered higher positive projection zones in comparison to other bias corrected methods and the pcraw results are more consistent with ac in rx1day and acex in rx5day in terms of cdd the projections show somewhat deviated outputs from various methods although overall a general increase of cdd is suggested over majority of msea where the average absolute changes for raw mc ac pcraw and acex are 16 21 20 18 and 15 days respectively the pcraw and acex methods have main differences in the area of cambodia where pcraw has suggested a general increasing trend but acex has given a decreasing one please note that the overall change magnitude is relatively smaller than the results from rcm1 and the deviation of bias correction for the cambodia region is detected in the model verification stage as shown in fig 7 these results imply a higher level of uncertainty of projection for cdd which is also shown from the results on selected sites in general the projections from two rcm models have shown that various bias correction methods could give different results in terms of the three studied extreme indices the raw modelled data project minus the modeled history gives a different scale of changes for future which is rather different from bias corrected ones particularly for rx1day and rx5day this demonstrates the advantage of bias correction where the changes in the future could be mapped to the historical scale for more reasonable understanding and comparison from this sense the pcraw method could be considered as a relative more reliable correction method among the studied options for frequency assessment in consideration of its good performance in repeating historical frequency and relative consistency in future projections as a second choice ac could also be reliably used for rx1day and acex be used for rx5day these conclusions supplement the outputs from selected sites see supplementary materials 4 5 future projections from pcraw to finally demonstrate the value of bias correction in future projections an ensembled relative changes of model projection over model simulated history in three future windows over msea is computed using pcraw table 3 lists seven rcms selected from cordex sea database where the first two are the rcms adopted for methodology demonstration in the previous sections tangang et al 2020 wcrp 2021 figs 10 and 11 present the projections from these rcms based on 50th and 75th percentiles of ensembled outputs respectively from fig 10 it is seen that the 50th percentile of the projections has suggested an increasing trend from near to far future in terms of rx1day with absolute relative changes averaged at 19 31 30 01 and 43 38 in near middle and far futures respectively those for rx5day are found to be 19 61 28 61 and 40 46 respectively those for cdd are 9 13 11 99 and 18 24 respectively spatially it is found that the eastern cambodia has seen patches of area that have considerable increases 70 for both rx1day and rx5day in the middle of the century in the far future it is found that both rx1day and rx5day have seen scattered areas with significant increases 90 mainly around the northern and western myanmar western thailand and southern cambodia cdd has high increase 45 primarily in northern vietnam southeastern and southern thailand southern tip of vietnam and western coast of southern malay peninsula considering a riskier future the 75th percentile of the ensembled output can be examined from fig 11 the 75th percentile has suggested a more drastic increase of all indicators where the average changes for rx1day are 49 85 67 73 and 91 14 in the near middle and far future respectively those for rx5day are 47 42 64 21 and 83 84 respectively those for cdd are 21 37 27 51 and 36 27 respectively in terms of spatial distribution of the projected changes the red to black areas i e higher positive values are obviously enlarging from near to far future in the near future the increases of all indictors are relatively uniform over the entire msea while in the middle of the century the rx1day and rx5day have seen large increment 120 primarily over cambodia and some scattered areas within myanmar and cdd has high increment 50 mainly over northern vietnam and laos and southern malay peninsula towards the end of the century there are large areas that would see high increase 150 of rx1day and rx5day primarily distributing over majority of myanmar western thailand and southern cambodia whereas large cdd increment 70 is found mainly in northern and southern tip of vietnam southeastern thailand and malay peninsula in general the ensembled projection of frequencies of rx1day rx5day and cdd has implied an overall escalated risk of rainfall and drought extremes over msea specifically myanmar thailand and cambodia are suggested to have higher risk of extreme rainfalls in the far future and vietnam and malay peninsula have higher risk of drought in comparison to other regions over msea by examining the projected results adaptation strategies should be carried out by those highly vulnerable regions to mitigate the impact more detailed projections at the nine major cities as discussed in previous sections can be referred to the supplementary materials 4 6 further discussions this study explored the performance of various bias correction schemes in the context of the qdm framework among these options the mc method is the most popularly used in climate change impact studies although it performs satisfactorily in most applications in correcting the daily time series it may encounter problems in frequency analysis for extreme variables derived from daily data particularly when long return periods are considered e g over 200 years our study demonstrated satisfactory performance of pcraw in reflecting frequency of most extreme indicators and applicability of ac and acex on some occasions however pcraw and acex only exert adjustment based on the derived data series of extreme variables and do not modify the daily time series of the data for studies that need to use adjusted daily time series as input such as continuous meteorological input for hydrological modeling mc or ac would be more advantageous without any doubt the rcm models and the driven gcms under various scenarios have large variations in projecting futures our study used an ensemble of seven rcm models to accommodate the relevant scenario uncertainties and demonstrate the value of the proposed methodology however our study indicated that the uncertainty that is associated with bias correction method may also be significant if the relevant methods are not probably selected the frequency of extreme data series is affected by both the frequency assessment method and the way of carrying out the bias correction our study has indicated the combination of lp3 and pcraw is the best option in mitigating such uncertainty however two things should be highlighted first the pcraw is based on the empirical cdf information of the peak data of extreme indices the number of such peaks should be sufficiently high in order to generate a reasonable cdf mapping it is suggested to have at least 30 year historical record to ensure reliability second it is possible to fit the peak data using standard extreme value distributions like gev or lp3 instead of empirical ones however based on our tests for this study region the fitted method may cause additional error that reduce the performance of the pcraw our suggestion is since the purpose of bias correction is to map the projected future into historical scale we should try to keep the historical matching from the modelled data as close as possible to observation thus empirical cdf is still recommended in general this study made a few novel contributions firstly it is the first attempt to compare various qdm based bias correction schemes in frequency analysis of extreme weather indicators these schemes vary in their adopted data series and frequency assessment methods and may lead to notable difference of future projections our study helped identify the best option of methods which could minimize the uncertainty of projections arising from methodology selection this point is rarely discussed in any previous works secondly we have provided ensembled projection of frequency based rainfall extremes and drought condition in near middle and far future windows for msea which could provide useful information for relevant countries or areas in their adaptation planning efforts we believe from the frequency analysis point of view this is a unique contribution for this region which is particularly vulnerable under climate change impact overland et al 2021 a few limitations are also highlighted here for future improvement firstly this study only considers three representative extreme variables for demonstration other indices can also be tested in the future secondly the main concerned climate variable for this study is precipitation where occurrence probability of dry or wet days plays important roles in time series other variables like temperature radiation humidity and potential multivariate indicators do not have such feature and the quantile mapping techniques may perform differently in frequency analysis huang and fan 2021 thirdly the precipitation assessment is mainly based on grid precipitation data which may still be coarse for localized studies such as urban flood risk assessment however the same bias correction method could be applied if local observed data is available lastly the bias correction schemes tested in this study are all based upon quantile delta mapping which is not the only way for carrying out bias correction other methods can also be explored in the future for frequency analysis 5 conclusions this study investigated the frequency analysis of precipitation indices of rx1day rx5day and cdd using various bias correction methods over mainland southeast asia the bias correction schemes are based on quantile delta mapping with different strategies in selecting the time series including mc ac pcraw and acex two rcm outputs from cordex sea and aphrodite precipitation datasets were used as modelled and observed data respectively the study first compared four frequency analysis methods based on gev gb lp3 and logn distributions at 9 selected sites over msea and found that lp3 is the best choice for frequency analysis for the study region then the study compared the four bias correction methods at both individual sites and all grids over the entire msea and indicated that the pcraw is the best performer in terms of bias correction for frequency information also it was found that ac could also be reliably used for rx1day and acex be used for rx5day in frequency analysis lastly the study presented an ensembled projection of future extreme indices with 200 yr return based on seven cordex sea rcms and suggested a general increasing trend of all indices over msea the study explored the effect of uncertainty originated from adopting various bias correction methods in mapping future frequency of precipitation indices and shed some light on the applicability and performance of different methods although further research works are necessary to enhance the comparison options index types and study regions this study is valuable in revealing the challenge in correcting frequency information for climate change impact studies and initiating the relevant discussion in this specific area furthermore the study is useful in revealing the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation extremes over large areas under climate change which is important for flood drought risk assessment and adaptation planning credit

3644,as an important agriculture production area in the world and a flood prone area future hydro climate changes in winter and spring in northeast china could have remarkable influence on spring water resources and flood yet studies on future hydro climate variations with special considerations of snow influences remain limited so far in the region here we studied future winter and spring hydro climate changes to the end of the century with special considerations of snow variations under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in northeast china a water and energy budget based distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics was implemented we find that winter and spring are warming 0 08 c and 0 06 c annually under 30 years moving average in rcp8 5 air temperature increasing rate in winter is approximately two times higher than that in spring in 2030 2059 in this period snow melt contribution to spring average runoff and maximum runoff decrease by at least 39 and 23 respectively and spring soil moisture decreases by 7 the spring snow melt runoff peak will move from april to march under the warmest climate condition i e 2070 2099 in rcp8 5 the earlier snow melt renders the snow melt contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in may which could increase drought severity this study sheds some lights on changes in hydrological regimes under climate change with a focus on snow melt and the influences in the entire northeast china for the first time and is helpful for adaption to future climate change keywords snow northeast china climate change water resources 1 introduction snow provides water resources to about two million people globally and is important for agriculture production barnett et al 2005 musselman et al 2017 huning and aghakouchak 2020 livneh and badger 2020 malek et al 2020 pulliainen et al 2020 qin et al 2020 with increasing co2 concentration in atmosphere the global mean air temperature is expected to increase seneviratne et al 2018 but the degree of warming distributed unevenly in space and times tamarin brodsky et al 2020 with some regions even cooling hansen et al 2012 under climate change the differences in the warming cooling degrees in various regions and seasons would complicate the studies on the role of snow in water supply huning and aghakouchak 2020 qin et al 2020 in addition snow melt is related to snow physics and energy supply musselman et al 2017 gleason et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 which further increases the complexity of snow melt studies especially on large scales and requires snow melt study to consider snow physics and energy budgets northeast china is an important region for agriculture production with 300 000 km2 of cropland yang et al 2007 kent et al 2017 and the china s largest plain i e the northeast china plain is located in this region water is an important factor limiting the intensification of agriculture production in northeast china northeast china has a cold and long winter with a large volume of snowfall snow is an important natural water reservoir for soil moisture and runoff discharge and can sustain water demand of crop planting and growth in the region northeast china is also a region with potential spring snow melt flood risk when large volume of accumulated snow in winter melts in spring kundzewicz et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which could cause damage to agriculture production the studies on snow melt in northeast china are few table 1 lists some recent studies on snow melt influence in some important regions on a global scale most of the studies focused on the tibetan plateau and north america the tibetan plateau is the source region of several large river basins in asia and sustains the water supply of a large population in downstream kraaijenbrink et al 2021 the western north america relies heavily on snow melt water in high mountains for agricultural and industrial production musselman et al 2021 musselman et al 2021 suggested that snow melt changes were more indicative than snow water equivalent swe variations to water resources availability because swe was more sensitive to precipitation changes whereas snowmelt was more sensitive to temperature variations under a warming world in the previous studies the studies by tian et al 2018 yang et al 2020 qi et al 2020 and qin et al 2020 involved snow melt influence in northeast china qi et al 2020 investigated the hydrological changes when there was no snow in northeast china in a historical period the results showed soil moisture could decrease by at least 20 from march to may when no snow existed runoff could decrease by at least 33 from march to may when there was no snow tian et al 2018 studied the snow melt influence on runoff in a relatively small region accounting for only 1 5 of northeast china area in a historical period yang et al 2020 investigated snow melt influence on flood in northeast china in a historical period qin et al 2020 studied snow change influence on runoff on a global scale and identified hotspots where irrigation water could be influenced studies on snow melt influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood in the future periods in northeast china remain limited so far how future snow will change and what are the impacts of future snow changes on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood remain unknown in northeast china shi et al 2011 studied snow changes from 1951 to 2100 using the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics regional climate model regcm under the intergovernmental panel on climate change a1b scenario they found that snow cover days and duration would decrease in northeast china zhou et al 2018 projected future snow changes using the regcm model simulation under the representative concentration pathway 4 5 rcp4 5 scenario and found that total snowfall would decrease in northeast china in the future despite these progresses the previous studies focused on snowfall snow cover and did not investigate the impacts of future snow melt on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood with considerations of seasonal variations the studies by tian et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and qi et al 2020 only studied snow melt in historical periods and therefore the future snow melt changes and the influence were unknown although qin et al 2020 included snow melt in the future on a global scale including northeast china the study focused on snow melt influence on runoff and did not study future changes in soil moisture and flood caused by snow variations in addition qin et al 2020 did not calibrate and validate their simulation against observed data in northeast china such as discharge snow cover and soil moisture and therefore their uncertainty may be large to study snow melt influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood on a large scale such as the entire northeast china models and their parameterizations are required to have sufficient physical basis multiple datasets are also needed in model calibration and validation in terms of models the degree day approach is commonly used in snow melt simulation e g bookhagen and burbank 2010 chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 yet this method is an empirical approach to some degree and does not consider the physical process of snow melt in the degree day approach rain snow temperature thresholds are commonly based on calibration and or subjective selections e g chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 which could skew snow melt simulation and snow influence on soil moisture in terms of model calibration and validation several datasets should be implemented to evaluate the overall performance of models such as discharge snow cover and soil moisture on a large scale such as the entire northeast china region discharge from sufficient hydrological gauges are difficult to collect especially when trans boundary rivers exist in the region such as the heilongjiang amur river in the trans boundary rivers the observed discharge data are commonly confidential here we studied future winter and spring hydro climate changes to the end of the century with special considerations of snow changes and the influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios a water and energy budget based distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics web dhm s was implemented after validation using multiple datasets such as observed discharge snow cover and soil moisture an observation based rain snow temperature threshold dataset developed by jennings et al 2018 was used in the model to avoid the uncertainty caused by calibration and or subjective selections of the threshold this study sheds some lights on the future situations of snow changes and the influence in northeast china for the first time and is useful for adaption to climate change and developing sustainable water management strategies for the region 2 study region datasets and methodology 2 1 study region northeast china fig 1 covers an area of about 1 2 million km2 two main large rivers i e the songhua river and liao river are located in northeast china the songhua river is the largest tributary of the heilong river amur river which forms the border between china and russia in northeast china winter is from december to february and spring includes march april and may in this study we focused on snow changes and the influence which are mainly in winter and spring there is no snow in summer and therefore we did not consider summer 2 2 the datasets the climate projections from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip2b were used frieler et al 2017 isimip2b

future climate data from isimip2b have a 0 5 spatial resolution on a daily scale we re gridded the data into 0 1 cells to match the grids in the baseline periods because we used daily scale data and the original gcm data were on a daily scale we did not downscale the data the isimip2b climate data were bias corrected according to a merged dataset lange 2016 frieler et al 2017 lange 2018 the data

at a significance level of 0 05 the nonparametric mann kendall analysis approach was used to analyse the changing trends mann 1945 kendall 1975 2 3 the model future snowfall snow depth snow melt runoff discharge total runoff discharge and soil moisture were simulated using the web dhm s model wang et al 2009a wang et al 2009b wang et al 2009c shrestha et al 2010 qi et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the simulation was based on water and energy budgets energy input from downward solar radiation downward longwave radiation and air temperature was considered in the energy budgets heat conduction between sublayers was also considered the snow mass budget considered the precipitation evaporation condensation compaction liquid water retention snowmelt runoff and infiltration into underlying layers the snow compaction is due to snow overburden and snow melt which can influence snow depth changes the snow depth increases during snowfall and decreases because of snow compaction the web dhm s model was calibrated and validated using observed discharge snow cover fraction and soil moisture in the baseline period in the study by qi et al 2020 in northeast china the overall nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and absolute value of relative bias rb were 0 81 and 7 8 in discharge simulation nse and rb were were 0 85 and 1 0 for snow cover fraction simulation the observed and simulated average surface soil moisture were 0 34 m3 m3 and 0 39 m3 m3 respectively overall the model performance was acceptable in discharge snow and soil moisture simulations 3 results 3 1 future precipitation and air temperature changes fig 2 a and b show changes of average precipitation in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in northeast china winter precipitation is increasing in all the situations but significant only in the rcp8 5 scenario table s1 in the supporting information similarly spring precipitation is increasing in all the situations and is significant in both rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s1 in the supporting information fig s1 in the supporting information shows spatial distribution of precipitation trends in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the rcp2 6 scenario precipitation in central part of northeast china is decreasing in winter but not significant in most of the regions and precipitation in eastern part of northeast china is decreasing in spring but not significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in contrast precipitation is increasing in most regions fig 2c and d show changes of regional average air temperature in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios winter and spring are significantly warming in all the scenarios fig s2 in the supporting information shows spatial distribution of air temperature trends in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios under the rcp2 6 scenario northern part of the study region is warming faster than other regions the rcp6 0 scenario shows middle and northern parts are warming faster than other regions in both winter and spring the rcp8 5 scenario shows middle eastern and northern parts are warming faster than other regions in winter whereas it shows the eastern parts are warming faster than other regions in spring in addition the warming trends are significant in almost all the regions except for the western region in winter under the rcp2 6 scenario the future air temperature is increasing and the warming rate is almost the same in the entire region and the cropland area fig s3 in the supporting information winter is warming faster than spring under the rcp8 5 and rcp6 0 scenarios and the warming rates of winter and spring are almost the same under the rcp2 6 scenario fig s3 under the rcp8 5 scenario winter warming trend has a slope of 0 08 c with the 30 years moving average and spring warming has a slope of 0 06 c fig s3 table 2 shows air temperature changes in the near future 2030 2059 and far future 2070 2099 compared to the baseline period average 1982 2011 in both near future and far future winter warms much more than spring for example winter air temperature increases by 2 1 c and spring temperature increases by 1 3 c in the 2030 2059 period under the rcp8 5 scenario winter air temperature increases by 5 8 c and spring temperature increases by 4 1 c in the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario in addition the air temperature increasing rate in winter is about two times higher than that in spring in 2030 2059 1 6 0 7 2 3 1 5 0 7 2 1 2 4 1 3 1 8 3 2 climate change influence on snow soil moisture and runoff fig 3 a and b show changes of regional average snowfall winter snowfall is increasing under all the scenarios and is significant under the rcp8 5 scenario table s2 in the supporting information different from winter all scenarios show that spring snowfall is decreasing and is significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s2 in the supporting information fig s4 in the supporting information shows spatial distribution of snowfall trends in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the rcp2 6 winter snowfall in central parts of the study region is decreasing but mostly non significant different from winter under the rcp2 6 scenario winter snowfall under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios is increasing in most of the regions with the exception in the south in the rcp2 6 spring most of the regions show decreasing snowfall with the exception in the south western region similarly spring snowfall is also decreasing in most of the regions under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios and the trend is significant in almost all the regions under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 shows trends of snow depth from 2006 to 2099 in winter and spring under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in winter snow depth is decreasing in almost all the regions especially in the southern region in spring snow depth is also decreasing in most of the regions with the exceptions in some regions under the rcp2 6 scenario fig 3c and d show changes in the regional average snow depth the results clearly show the snow depth is significantly decreasing in all the situations especially under the rcp8 5 scenario which has the greatest slope table s2 in the supporting information because snow depth has remarkable influence on soil moisture in this region the reduction in snow depth could render soil dryer as shown in fig 5 a and b the drying soil could increase irrigation demand if agriculture production needs to remain at a high productivity winter runoff is increasing generally fig 5c and table s3 in the supporting information and winter snow melt runoff shows similar trends fig 5e and table s3 in the supporting information fig 5f clearly shows snow melt runoff in spring is decreasing in all the situations and is significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s3 in the supporting information fig 6 shows changes of regional average snow runoff ratios snow melt runoff contribution to total runoff in spring is reducing and is significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s4 in the supporting information indicating weakening capacity of winter snowpack to ameliorate spring water shortage 3 3 future snow melt flood in spring fig 7 shows changes of spring maximum runoff and snow melt contribution to the maximum runoff under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios spring maximum runoff and snow melt runoff contribution to the maximum runoff are reducing remarkably in the eastern part and some areas in the northern part the results show maximum runoff in southern areas is increasing whereas snow melt runoff contribution to the maximum runoff does not show similar patterns the spring precipitation in the southern areas is increasing as shown in fig s1 in the supporting information which may result in the increasing maximum spring runoff fig 8 shows changes of spring maximum discharge and snow melt contribution to the maximum discharge under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios similar to fig 7 fig 8 also shows snow melt discharge contribution to the maximum spring discharge decreases in most of the regions implying that spring flood risk resulting from snow melt is decreasing fig s5 in the supporting information shows changes of regional averages snow ratio of spring maximum runoff discharge decreases in all the situations and is significantly decreasing under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s5 in the supporting information 3 4 changes in hydro climate variables in the near future and far future fig 9 shows relative changes of winter regional average precipitation p snowfall snow depth sd soil moisture runoff snow runoff and snow runoff ratio in the 2030 2059 and 2070 2099 time periods precipitation snowfall snow runoff and snow runoff ratio are increasing in all the situations whereas snow depth and soil moisture are decreasing in the rcp2 6 2030 2059 scenario snow melt contributes 55 of winter average runoff snow melt contribution to winter average runoff increases by at least 34 which corresponds to the rcp2 6 2030 2059 scenario results in the cropland are similar to that in the entire region fig 10 shows relative changes of spring regional average p snowfall sd soil moisture runoff snow runoff snow runoff ratio spring maximum discharge smd spring maximum discharge snow ratio smds spring maximum runoff smr and spring maximum runoff snow ratio smrs in the 2030 2059 and 2070 2099 time periods precipitation is increasing under all the situations snowfall soil moisture snow melt runoff snow runoff ratio spring maximum discharge spring maximum discharge snow ratio spring maximum runoff and spring maximum runoff snow ratio are decreasing under all the situations in the rcp6 0 2030 2059 scenario snow melt contributes 33 of spring average runoff and 59 of spring maximum runoff snow melt contribution to spring average runoff decreases by at least 39 and snow melt contribution to spring maximum discharge decreases by at least 38 which correspond to the rcp6 0 2030 2059 scenario soil moisture decreases by 7 in rcp6 0 2030 2059 snow melt contribution to spring maximum runoff decreases by at least 23 which corresponds to the rcp6 0 2030 2059 scenario as well as for snow depth it is decreasing in all situations in cropland and is decreasing in all situations with the exception of the rcp6 0 2030 2059 situation the increase in snow depth is a combined effects of snowfall and snow melt which is related to air temperature and the spatial distributions of snowfall and air temperature also influence the snow depth variations however the increase is little in the rcp6 0 2030 2059 situation regarding runoff the entire region average is decreasing under all situations and the cropland average is decreasing in most of the situations with the exception of the rcp6 0 2070 2099 situation the increase in runoff in the rcp6 0 2070 2099 situation is the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature 3 5 seasonal variations of hydro climate variables under the extreme climate here we select the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario as the extreme climate because this time period and scenario are the warmest fig 11 shows total runoff snow melt runoff snow melt runoff ratio precipitation air temperature and snowfall variations in the baseline period 1982 2011 and the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario for total runoff the month with the maximum total runoff is august in the baseline period whereas it is july in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation this result may be because the increased precipitation in july is much more than august fig 11d the spring snow melt runoff peak moves from april to march and autumn snow melt runoff peak moves from october to november these changes are consistent with the snowfall changes as shown in fig 11f the increased snow melt runoff ratio in january february and december may be due to the increase in the snowfall fig 11f and air temperature fig 11e in march the snowfall does not increase remarkably while the total runoff in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation is smaller than the baseline period which may lead to the increase in snow melt runoff ratio fig 11c in november the snowfall shows minor changes but the total runoff in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation is greater than the baseline period which may lead to the slight decrease in the snow melt runoff ratio fig 11c may represents a crucial month for crop planting and growth the earlier snow melt in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation renders snow melt water contribution to total runoff decrease from 20 3 to almost zero 1 4 in may fig 11c which could increase drought severity in this month 4 discussion in contrast to previous studies we studied future snow changes and the influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and spring flood with considerations of seasonal variations in the whole of northeast china compared to the study by qin et al 2020 we studied snow melt influence on soil moisture and spring flood in addition to impacts on runoff discharge used a model well calibrated and validated against multiple datasets such as observed discharge snow cover and soil moisture compared to the studies by tian et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and qi et al 2020 we investigated future snow changes and the influence we find that runoff and soil moisture would decrease from march to may in the entire region in both the near future and far future under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios specifically spring soil moisture would decrease by at least 6 spring snow melt runoff would decrease by at least 41 and spring total runoff would decrease by at least 2 we also find that winter warming rate would be faster than that in spring in rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 during the near future period 2030 2059 air temperature increasing rate in winter would be about two times higher than that in spring in this time period snow melt contributions to average runoff and maximum runoff would decrease by at least 39 and 23 respectively and spring soil moisture would decrease by 7 the results have not been reported in previous studies our results show that the snow melt runoff peak in spring would move forward about one month in northeast china by the end of this century under rcp8 5 the earlier snow melt would render snow melt water contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in may which is the main month for crop cultivation our study represents the first study about future snow melt runoff peak time changes in the region studied overall our study presents important information beyond the aforementioned studies can reveal in northeast china the results could have important implications for future adaption to climate change in the region in terms of agriculture production and water management in other regions others have investigated the changes of snow melt runoff peak timing for example livneh and badger 2020 studied the snow melt in western north america which is located in a similar latitude region as our study region they found that the snow melt runoff peak would move from april to march during the late century 2070 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario li et al 2017 also found that the snow melt in western north america would become earlier in spring by the end of the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario and snow melt runoff peak would move about four weeks earlier stewart et al 2004 found that the snow melt runoff peak would be 30 40 days earlier in western north america than historical period during 2080 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario combing our results and these previous studies we may infer that the spring snow melt runoff peak would move forward about one month by the end of this century under the rcp8 5 scenario more studies are encouraged to project changes in the timing of snow melt runoff peak and the inference could be consolidated when more studies are carried out the earlier snow melt and warmer climate than the baseline period imply that the cropping date could be advanced to avoid the limitation caused by water shortage when planting crop in may i e the crop calendar in the baseline period monfreda et al 2008 may need to adapt to the future climate the increasing winter runoff in all the situations is due to increases in winter precipitation fig 2 and snow melt the increasing winter snow melt runoff fig 5e is due to winter air temperature increases a warming winter can lead to the snow melt start time earlier and snow that should melt in spring starts to melt in winter the decreasing spring runoff in the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios could be because snowpack that should melt in spring melts in winter and the increasing spring runoff in the rcp6 0 scenario could be because the increasing precipitation fig 2b differences between the entire region averages and the cropland region averages exist for example the runoff in the cropland is increasing in all the situations whereas the entire region average shows decreasing runoff in the rcp2 6 2070 2099 period the differences result from the spatial differences of precipitation changes as shown in fig s1 with climate warming the permafrost degradation would influence the discharge in northeast china currently there is no permafrost degradation monitoring network and the permafrost degradation observation stations are few in the region chen et al 2020 these difficulties prevent us from a detailed calibration and validation of permafrost degradation modelling in the large area of northeast china this issue is challenging not only for us but also for all of other studies in the region at the moment 5 conclusions as an important agriculture production area in the world the hydro climate changes in winter and spring in northeast china could have remarkable influence on spring water availability soil moisture and flood this study investigated future winter and spring hydro climate changes until 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios with the considerations of snow influence in the entire northeast china for the first time the following results are presented on the basis of this study first winter is projected to warm faster than spring during the period 2006 2099 under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios under the rcp8 5 scenario winter is warming 0 08 c annually under 30 years moving average and spring is warming 0 06 c the average air temperature increases in the entire region and the cropland area are almost the same warming rates in winter and spring are similar under the rcp2 6 scenario second air temperature increasing rate in winter is about two times higher than that in spring on average in the near future time period from 2030 to 2059 in this time period snow melt contribution to spring average runoff and maximum runoff decreases by at least 39 and 23 respectively and spring soil moisture decreases by 7 third regional average winter snowfall is consistently increasing and spring snowfall and soil moisture are consistently decreasing from 2006 to 2099 snow depth is consistently decreasing in both winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 fourth contribution of snow melt discharge to the maximum spring discharge decreases in most of the regions from 2006 to 2099 implying that spring flood risk resulting from snow melt is decreasing fifth spring snow melt runoff peak moves from april to march in the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario the earlier snow melt renders the snow melt contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in may which

3644,as an important agriculture production area in the world and a flood prone area future hydro climate changes in winter and spring in northeast china could have remarkable influence on spring water resources and flood yet studies on future hydro climate variations with special considerations of snow influences remain limited so far in the region here we studied future winter and spring hydro climate changes to the end of the century with special considerations of snow variations under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in northeast china a water and energy budget based distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics was implemented we find that winter and spring are warming 0 08 c and 0 06 c annually under 30 years moving average in rcp8 5 air temperature increasing rate in winter is approximately two times higher than that in spring in 2030 2059 in this period snow melt contribution to spring average runoff and maximum runoff decrease by at least 39 and 23 respectively and spring soil moisture decreases by 7 the spring snow melt runoff peak will move from april to march under the warmest climate condition i e 2070 2099 in rcp8 5 the earlier snow melt renders the snow melt contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in may which could increase drought severity this study sheds some lights on changes in hydrological regimes under climate change with a focus on snow melt and the influences in the entire northeast china for the first time and is helpful for adaption to future climate change keywords snow northeast china climate change water resources 1 introduction snow provides water resources to about two million people globally and is important for agriculture production barnett et al 2005 musselman et al 2017 huning and aghakouchak 2020 livneh and badger 2020 malek et al 2020 pulliainen et al 2020 qin et al 2020 with increasing co2 concentration in atmosphere the global mean air temperature is expected to increase seneviratne et al 2018 but the degree of warming distributed unevenly in space and times tamarin brodsky et al 2020 with some regions even cooling hansen et al 2012 under climate change the differences in the warming cooling degrees in various regions and seasons would complicate the studies on the role of snow in water supply huning and aghakouchak 2020 qin et al 2020 in addition snow melt is related to snow physics and energy supply musselman et al 2017 gleason et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 which further increases the complexity of snow melt studies especially on large scales and requires snow melt study to consider snow physics and energy budgets northeast china is an important region for agriculture production with 300 000 km2 of cropland yang et al 2007 kent et al 2017 and the china s largest plain i e the northeast china plain is located in this region water is an important factor limiting the intensification of agriculture production in northeast china northeast china has a cold and long winter with a large volume of snowfall snow is an important natural water reservoir for soil moisture and runoff discharge and can sustain water demand of crop planting and growth in the region northeast china is also a region with potential spring snow melt flood risk when large volume of accumulated snow in winter melts in spring kundzewicz et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which could cause damage to agriculture production the studies on snow melt in northeast china are few table 1 lists some recent studies on snow melt influence in some important regions on a global scale most of the studies focused on the tibetan plateau and north america the tibetan plateau is the source region of several large river basins in asia and sustains the water supply of a large population in downstream kraaijenbrink et al 2021 the western north america relies heavily on snow melt water in high mountains for agricultural and industrial production musselman et al 2021 musselman et al 2021 suggested that snow melt changes were more indicative than snow water equivalent swe variations to water resources availability because swe was more sensitive to precipitation changes whereas snowmelt was more sensitive to temperature variations under a warming world in the previous studies the studies by tian et al 2018 yang et al 2020 qi et al 2020 and qin et al 2020 involved snow melt influence in northeast china qi et al 2020 investigated the hydrological changes when there was no snow in northeast china in a historical period the results showed soil moisture could decrease by at least 20 from march to may when no snow existed runoff could decrease by at least 33 from march to may when there was no snow tian et al 2018 studied the snow melt influence on runoff in a relatively small region accounting for only 1 5 of northeast china area in a historical period yang et al 2020 investigated snow melt influence on flood in northeast china in a historical period qin et al 2020 studied snow change influence on runoff on a global scale and identified hotspots where irrigation water could be influenced studies on snow melt influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood in the future periods in northeast china remain limited so far how future snow will change and what are the impacts of future snow changes on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood remain unknown in northeast china shi et al 2011 studied snow changes from 1951 to 2100 using the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics regional climate model regcm under the intergovernmental panel on climate change a1b scenario they found that snow cover days and duration would decrease in northeast china zhou et al 2018 projected future snow changes using the regcm model simulation under the representative concentration pathway 4 5 rcp4 5 scenario and found that total snowfall would decrease in northeast china in the future despite these progresses the previous studies focused on snowfall snow cover and did not investigate the impacts of future snow melt on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood with considerations of seasonal variations the studies by tian et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and qi et al 2020 only studied snow melt in historical periods and therefore the future snow melt changes and the influence were unknown although qin et al 2020 included snow melt in the future on a global scale including northeast china the study focused on snow melt influence on runoff and did not study future changes in soil moisture and flood caused by snow variations in addition qin et al 2020 did not calibrate and validate their simulation against observed data in northeast china such as discharge snow cover and soil moisture and therefore their uncertainty may be large to study snow melt influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood on a large scale such as the entire northeast china models and their parameterizations are required to have sufficient physical basis multiple datasets are also needed in model calibration and validation in terms of models the degree day approach is commonly used in snow melt simulation e g bookhagen and burbank 2010 chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 yet this method is an empirical approach to some degree and does not consider the physical process of snow melt in the degree day approach rain snow temperature thresholds are commonly based on calibration and or subjective selections e g chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 which could skew snow melt simulation and snow influence on soil moisture in terms of model calibration and validation several datasets should be implemented to evaluate the overall performance of models such as discharge snow cover and soil moisture on a large scale such as the entire northeast china region discharge from sufficient hydrological gauges are difficult to collect especially when trans boundary rivers exist in the region such as the heilongjiang amur river in the trans boundary rivers the observed discharge data are commonly confidential here we studied future winter and spring hydro climate changes to the end of the century with special considerations of snow changes and the influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and flood under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios a water and energy budget based distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics web dhm s was implemented after validation using multiple datasets such as observed discharge snow cover and soil moisture an observation based rain snow temperature threshold dataset developed by jennings et al 2018 was used in the model to avoid the uncertainty caused by calibration and or subjective selections of the threshold this study sheds some lights on the future situations of snow changes and the influence in northeast china for the first time and is useful for adaption to climate change and developing sustainable water management strategies for the region 2 study region datasets and methodology 2 1 study region northeast china fig 1 covers an area of about 1 2 million km2 two main large rivers i e the songhua river and liao river are located in northeast china the songhua river is the largest tributary of the heilong river amur river which forms the border between china and russia in northeast china winter is from december to february and spring includes march april and may in this study we focused on snow changes and the influence which are mainly in winter and spring there is no snow in summer and therefore we did not consider summer 2 2 the datasets the climate projections from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip2b were used frieler et al 2017 isimip2b input data provide four global circulation model simulations i e the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s esm2m model gfdl esm2m the hadley center global environmental model version 2 hadgem2 es the institute pierre simon laplace s cm5a lr model ipsl cm5a lr and the model for interdisciplinary research on climate version 5 miroc5 the climate data include precipitation air temperature downward longwave radiation downward shortwave radiation wind speed air pressure and specific humidity the projected data start from 2006 in isimip2b and data ending before 2099 were used isimip2b focuses on the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios leaf area index for the future periods was also from isimip2b and was simulated by the community land model lawrence et al 2011 thiery et al 2017 the original future climate data from isimip2b have a 0 5 spatial resolution on a daily scale we re gridded the data into 0 1 cells to match the grids in the baseline periods because we used daily scale data and the original gcm data were on a daily scale we did not downscale the data the isimip2b climate data were bias corrected according to a merged dataset lange 2016 frieler et al 2017 lange 2018 the data sources for the bias corrections include era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 and earth2observe data schellekens et al 2017 watch forcing data methodology was applied to era interim reanalysis data to correct bias weedon et al 2014 downward shortwave and longwave radiation from nasa gewex surface radiation budget data were used to correct earth2observe data lange 2018 isimip2b is considered one of the best climate datasets and have been commonly used in hydrology related studies globally e g gernaat et al 2021 gudmundsson et al 2021 woolway et al 2021 therefore we used isimip2b in our study in the baseline period 1982 2011 the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite xie et al 2007 yatagai et al 2012 was used the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd provided the downward shortwave radiation longwave radiation specific humidity wind speed and air temperature he et al 2020 the datasets used are the same to our previous study and please refer to the study by qi et al 2020 for more information on the dataset used in the baseline period we evaluated the significance of changes in hydro climate variables at a significance level of 0 05 the nonparametric mann kendall analysis approach was used to analyse the changing trends mann 1945 kendall 1975 2 3 the model future snowfall snow depth snow melt runoff discharge total runoff discharge and soil moisture were simulated using the web dhm s model wang et al 2009a wang et al 2009b wang et al 2009c shrestha et al 2010 qi et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the simulation was based on water and energy budgets energy input from downward solar radiation downward longwave radiation and air temperature was considered in the energy budgets heat conduction between sublayers was also considered the snow mass budget considered the precipitation evaporation condensation compaction liquid water retention snowmelt runoff and infiltration into underlying layers the snow compaction is due to snow overburden and snow melt which can influence snow depth changes the snow depth increases during snowfall and decreases because of snow compaction the web dhm s model was calibrated and validated using observed discharge snow cover fraction and soil moisture in the baseline period in the study by qi et al 2020 in northeast china the overall nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and absolute value of relative bias rb were 0 81 and 7 8 in discharge simulation nse and rb were were 0 85 and 1 0 for snow cover fraction simulation the observed and simulated average surface soil moisture were 0 34 m3 m3 and 0 39 m3 m3 respectively overall the model performance was acceptable in discharge snow and soil moisture simulations 3 results 3 1 future precipitation and

is increasing in all the situations but significant only in the rcp8 5 scenario table s1 in the supporting information similarly spring precipitation is increasing in all the situations and is significant in both rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s1 in the supporting information fig s1 in the supporting information shows spatial distribution of precipitation trends in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the rcp2 6 scenario precipitation in central part of northeast china is decreasing in winter but not significant in most of the regions and precipitation in eastern part of northeast china is decreasing in spring but not significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in contrast precipitation is increasing in most regions fig 2c and d show changes of regional average air temperature in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios winter and spring are significantly warming in all the scenarios fig s2 in the supporting information shows spatial distribution of air temperature trends in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios under the rcp2 6 scenario northern part of the study region is warming faster than other regions the rcp6 0 scenario shows middle and northern parts are warming faster than other regions in both winter and spring the rcp8 5 scenario shows middle eastern and northern parts are warming faster than other regions in winter whereas it shows the eastern parts are warming faster than other regions in spring in addition the warming trends are significant in almost all the regions except for the western region in winter under the rcp2 6 scenario the future air temperature is increasing and the warming rate is almost the same in the entire region and the cropland area fig s3 in the supporting information winter is warming faster than spring under the rcp8 5 and rcp6 0 scenarios and the warming rates of winter and spring are almost the same under the rcp2 6 scenario fig s3 under the rcp8 5 scenario winter warming trend has a slope of 0 08 c with the 30 years moving average and spring warming has a slope of 0 06 c fig s3 table 2 shows air temperature changes in the near future 2030 2059 and far future 2070 2099 compared to the baseline period average 1982 2011 in both near future and far future winter warms much more than spring for example winter air temperature increases by 2 1 c and spring temperature increases by 1 3 c in the 2030 2059 period under the rcp8 5 scenario winter air temperature increases by 5 8 c and spring temperature increases by 4 1 c in the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario in addition the air temperature increasing rate in winter is about two times higher than that in spring in 2030 2059 1 6 0 7 2 3 1 5 0 7 2 1 2 4 1 3 1 8 3 2 climate change influence on snow soil moisture and runoff fig 3 a and b show changes of regional average snowfall winter snowfall is increasing under all the scenarios and is significant under the rcp8 5 scenario table s2 in the supporting information different from winter all scenarios show that spring snowfall is decreasing and is significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s2 in the supporting information fig s4 in the supporting information shows spatial distribution of snowfall trends in winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the rcp2 6 winter snowfall in central parts of the study region is decreasing but mostly non significant different from winter under the rcp2 6 scenario winter snowfall under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios is increasing in most of the regions with the exception in the south in the rcp2 6 spring most of the regions show decreasing snowfall with the exception in the south western region similarly spring snowfall is also decreasing in most of the regions under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios and the trend is significant in almost all the regions under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 shows trends of snow depth from 2006 to 2099 in winter and spring under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios in winter snow depth is decreasing in almost all the regions especially in the southern region in spring snow depth is also decreasing in most of the regions with the exceptions in some regions under the rcp2 6 scenario fig 3c and d show changes in the regional average snow depth the results clearly show the snow depth is significantly decreasing in all the situations especially under the rcp8 5 scenario which has the greatest slope table s2 in the supporting information because snow depth has remarkable influence on soil moisture in this region the reduction in snow depth could render soil dryer as shown in fig 5 a and b the drying soil could increase irrigation demand if agriculture production needs to remain at a high productivity winter runoff is increasing generally fig 5c and table s3 in the supporting information and winter snow melt runoff shows similar trends fig 5e and table s3 in the supporting information fig 5f clearly shows snow melt runoff in spring is decreasing in all the situations and is significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s3 in the supporting information fig 6 shows changes of regional average snow runoff ratios snow melt runoff contribution to total runoff in spring is reducing and is significant under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s4 in the supporting information indicating weakening capacity of winter snowpack to ameliorate spring water shortage 3 3 future snow melt flood in spring fig 7 shows changes of spring maximum runoff and snow melt contribution to the maximum runoff under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios spring maximum runoff and snow melt runoff contribution to the maximum runoff are reducing remarkably in the eastern part and some areas in the northern part the results show maximum runoff in southern areas is increasing whereas snow melt runoff contribution to the maximum runoff does not show similar patterns the spring precipitation in the southern areas is increasing as shown in fig s1 in the supporting information which may result in the increasing maximum spring runoff fig 8 shows changes of spring maximum discharge and snow melt contribution to the maximum discharge under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios similar to fig 7 fig 8 also shows snow melt discharge contribution to the maximum spring discharge decreases in most of the regions implying that spring flood risk resulting from snow melt is decreasing fig s5 in the supporting information shows changes of regional averages snow ratio of spring maximum runoff discharge decreases in all the situations and is significantly decreasing under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios table s5 in the supporting information 3 4 changes in hydro climate variables in the near future and far future fig 9 shows relative changes of winter regional average precipitation p snowfall snow depth sd soil moisture runoff snow runoff and snow runoff ratio in the 2030 2059 and 2070 2099 time periods precipitation snowfall snow runoff and snow runoff ratio are increasing in all the situations whereas snow depth and soil moisture are decreasing in the rcp2 6 2030 2059 scenario snow melt contributes 55 of winter average runoff snow melt contribution to winter average runoff increases by at least 34 which corresponds to the rcp2 6 2030 2059 scenario results in the cropland are similar to that in the entire region fig 10 shows relative changes of spring regional average p snowfall sd soil moisture runoff snow runoff snow runoff ratio spring maximum discharge smd spring maximum discharge snow ratio smds spring maximum runoff smr and spring maximum runoff snow ratio smrs in the 2030 2059 and 2070 2099 time periods precipitation is increasing under all the situations snowfall soil moisture snow melt runoff snow runoff ratio spring maximum discharge spring maximum discharge snow ratio spring maximum runoff and spring maximum runoff snow ratio are decreasing under all the situations in the rcp6 0 2030 2059 scenario snow melt contributes 33 of spring average runoff and 59 of spring maximum runoff snow melt contribution to spring average runoff decreases by at least 39 and snow melt contribution to spring maximum discharge decreases by at least 38 which correspond to the rcp6 0 2030 2059 scenario soil moisture decreases by 7 in rcp6 0 2030 2059 snow melt contribution to spring maximum runoff decreases by at least 23 which corresponds to the rcp6 0 2030 2059 scenario as well as for snow depth it is decreasing in all situations in cropland and is decreasing in all situations with the exception of the rcp6 0 2030 2059 situation the increase in snow depth is a combined effects of snowfall and snow melt which is related to air temperature and the spatial distributions of snowfall and air temperature also influence the snow depth variations however the increase is little in the rcp6 0 2030 2059 situation regarding runoff the entire region average is decreasing under all situations and the cropland average is decreasing in most of the situations with the exception of the rcp6 0 2070 2099 situation the increase in runoff in the rcp6 0 2070 2099 situation is the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature 3 5 seasonal variations of hydro climate variables under the extreme climate here we select the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario as the extreme climate because this time period and scenario are the warmest fig 11 shows total runoff snow melt runoff snow melt runoff ratio precipitation air temperature and snowfall variations in the baseline period 1982 2011 and the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario for total runoff the month with the maximum total runoff is august in the baseline period whereas it is july in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation this result may be because the increased precipitation in july is much more than august fig 11d the spring snow melt runoff peak moves from april to march and autumn snow melt runoff peak moves from october to november these changes are consistent with the snowfall changes as shown in fig 11f the increased snow melt runoff ratio in january february and december may be due to the increase in the snowfall fig 11f and air temperature fig 11e in march the snowfall does not increase remarkably while the total runoff in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation is smaller than the baseline period which may lead to the increase in snow melt runoff ratio fig 11c in november the snowfall shows minor changes but the total runoff in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation is greater than the baseline period which may lead to the slight decrease in the snow melt runoff ratio fig 11c may represents a crucial month for crop planting and growth the earlier snow melt in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 situation renders snow melt water contribution to total runoff decrease from 20 3 to almost zero 1 4 in may fig 11c which could increase drought severity in this month 4 discussion in contrast to previous studies we studied future snow changes and the influence on runoff discharge soil moisture and spring flood with considerations of seasonal variations in the whole of northeast china compared to the study by qin et al 2020 we studied snow melt influence on soil moisture and spring flood in addition to impacts on runoff discharge used a model well calibrated and validated against multiple datasets such as observed discharge snow cover and soil moisture compared to the studies by tian et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and qi et al 2020 we investigated future snow changes and the influence we find that runoff and soil moisture would decrease from march to may in the entire region in both the near future and far future under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios specifically spring soil moisture would decrease by at least 6 spring snow melt runoff would decrease by at least 41 and spring total runoff would decrease by at least 2 we also find that winter warming rate would be faster than that in spring in rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 during the near future period 2030 2059 air temperature increasing rate in winter would be about two times higher than that in spring in this time period snow melt contributions to average runoff and maximum runoff would decrease by at least 39 and 23 respectively and spring soil moisture would decrease by 7 the results have not been reported in previous studies our results show that the snow melt runoff peak in spring would move forward about one month in northeast china by the end of this century under rcp8 5 the earlier snow melt would render snow melt water contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in may which is the main month for crop cultivation our study represents the first study about future snow melt runoff peak time changes in the region studied overall our study presents important information beyond the aforementioned studies can reveal in northeast china the results could have important implications for future adaption to climate change in the region in terms of agriculture production and water management in other regions others have investigated the changes of snow melt runoff peak timing for example livneh and badger 2020 studied the snow melt in western north america which is located in a similar latitude region as our study region they found that the snow melt runoff peak would move from april to march during the late century 2070 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario li et al 2017 also found that the snow melt in western north america would become earlier in spring by the end of the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario and snow melt runoff peak would move about four weeks earlier stewart et al 2004 found that the snow melt runoff peak would be 30 40 days earlier in western north america than historical period during 2080 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario combing our results and these previous studies we may infer that the spring snow melt runoff peak would move forward about one month by the end of this century under the rcp8 5 scenario more studies are encouraged to project changes in the timing of snow melt runoff peak and the inference could be consolidated when more studies are carried out the earlier snow melt and warmer climate than the baseline period imply that the cropping date could be advanced to avoid the limitation caused by water shortage when planting crop in may i e the crop calendar in the baseline period monfreda et al 2008 may need to adapt to the future climate the increasing winter runoff in all the situations is due to increases in winter precipitation fig 2 and snow melt the increasing winter snow melt runoff fig 5e is due to winter air temperature increases a warming winter can lead to the snow melt start time earlier and snow that should melt in spring starts to melt in winter the decreasing spring runoff in the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios could be because snowpack that should melt in spring melts in winter and the increasing spring runoff in the rcp6 0 scenario could be because the increasing precipitation fig 2b differences between the entire region averages and the cropland region averages exist for example the runoff in the cropland is increasing in all the situations whereas the entire region average shows decreasing runoff in the rcp2 6 2070 2099 period the differences result from the spatial differences of precipitation changes as shown in fig s1 with climate warming the permafrost degradation would influence the discharge in northeast china currently there is no permafrost degradation monitoring network and the permafrost degradation observation stations are few in the region chen et al 2020 these difficulties prevent us from a detailed calibration and validation of permafrost degradation modelling in the large area of northeast china this issue is challenging not only for us but also for all of other studies in the region at the moment 5 conclusions as an important agriculture production area in the world the hydro climate changes in winter and spring in northeast china could have remarkable influence on spring water availability soil moisture and flood this study investigated future winter and spring hydro climate changes until 2099 under the rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios with the considerations of snow influence in the entire northeast china for the first time the following results are presented on the basis of this study first winter is projected to warm faster than spring during the period 2006 2099 under the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios under the rcp8 5 scenario winter is warming 0 08 c annually under 30 years moving average and spring is warming 0 06 c the average air temperature increases in the entire region and the cropland area are almost the same warming rates in winter and spring are similar under the rcp2 6 scenario second air temperature increasing rate in winter is about two times higher than that in spring on average in the near future time period from 2030 to 2059 in this time period snow melt contribution to spring average runoff and maximum runoff decreases by at least 39 and 23 respectively and spring soil moisture decreases by 7 third regional average winter snowfall is consistently increasing and spring snowfall and soil moisture are consistently decreasing from 2006 to 2099 snow depth is consistently decreasing in both winter and spring from 2006 to 2099 fourth contribution of snow melt discharge to the maximum spring discharge decreases in most of the regions from 2006 to 2099 implying that spring flood risk resulting from snow melt is decreasing fifth spring snow melt runoff peak moves from april to march in the 2070 2099 period under the rcp8 5 scenario the earlier snow melt renders the snow melt contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in may which
