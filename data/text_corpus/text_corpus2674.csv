13370,autoflocculation followed by gravity sedimentation is a promising method for harvesting of microalgae however the effect of hydrodynamics on spontaneous flocculation of chlorella vulgaris is yet uncertain in this study where quantitative analysis was conducted to study the effect of hydrodynamics on autoflocculation of chlorella vulgaris it was found that hydrodynamic turbulence enhanced autoflocculation efficiency by 40 53 3 autoflocculation efficiency increased first and then decreased with the increase of turbulence strength with shear strength of 0 0069 n m2 and energy dissipation efficient ɛ of 0 45 10 3 m2 s3 the average floc size and settling velocity achieved their maximum at 373 5 36 4 μm and 2 17 0 29 m h respectively however after shear strength exceeded 0 0115 nm 2 and energy dissipation efficient exceeded 1 25 10 3 m2 s3 the chlorella vulgaris flocs started to disaggregate under the shearing effect hydrodynamic turbulence not only increased the probability of contact between chlorella vulgaris cells but also the enhanced the accumulation of eps which serves as bridge for autoflocculation after binding with the bivalent cation presented in the aqueous medium under hydrodynamic conditions chlorella vulgaris flocs start to settle by gravity with separation efficiency reaching up to 94 5 4 5 therefore hydrodynamic control presents a new approach for low cost harvesting of algae products keywords flocculation chlorella vulgaris hydrodynamics harvesting 1 introduction under the context of global resources scarcity development of clean and renewable recourses from microalgae biomass is of broad prospective and significance mass production of microalgae which requires no arable lands and thus avoiding land competition with other traditional plants has not been widely practiced 1 currently the major bottleneck for commercial utilization of microalgae as bio energy is the harvesting of microalgae 2 separation of microalgae from aqueous medium accounts for 20 30 of the total biomass utilization cost due to their high water content which is difficult to remove 3 4 because of their small size and similar density to water microalgae tend to form suspension in aqueous medium with low biomass concentration about 0 1 2 g dry weight l 3 5 as a result the settling velocity of microalgae in aqueous medium is lower than 10 6 m s commonly used methods for harvesting of microalgae include flocculation gravity sedimentation centrifugation filtration ultra filtration and flocculation flotation 6 7 at present microalgae products are mainly harvested by centrifugation which involves high energy consumption low energy consumption concentrating process as pretreatment prior to centrifugation can be used to significantly reduce the overall energy consumption for harvesting of microalgae products 8 membrane filtration is an alternative technically feasible however it has such disadvantages as membrane pollution high membrane replacement cost etc in addition membrane filtration performance is also dependent on microalgae density 9 10 chemical induced flocculation and gravity concentrating as a promising method to reduce microalgae harvesting cost and energy consumption 11 involves addition of chemical flocculants which not only increases operating cost but also leads to contamination of microalgae products in this study a flocculation process without addition of chemical flocculants was investigated to realize preliminary concentrating and separation of microalgae by gravity sendimentation 12 according to previous studies autoflocculation occurs when environmental conditions are changed microalgae was found to flocculate spontaneously and settle by gravity with the presence of bacteria 13 14 autoflocculation and gravity sedimentation of microalgae were observed as a result of increased excretion of extracellular polysaccharides eps under nitrogen and phosphate limiting conditions 15 16 however the eps are negatively charged which would prevent the microalgae from colliding with each other and forming flocculation because of the electrostatic repulsion 17 some studies have shown that the cation such as ca2 and mg2 will reacted with the eps forming bridge which allows for improved floc size of microalgae 18 19 hydrodynamics could increase the frequency of algal collisions in examining the impact of hydrodynamic on microalgae growth hondzo and lyn observed autoflocculation in scenedesmus quadricauda 20 microalgae autoflocculation was detected when leupold et al investigated the impact of turbulence on chlorella photosynthesis 21 under turbulent conditions gutiérrez et al 22 conducted experiments to investigate the effect of flocculants on flocculation of microalgae used in urban sewage treatment where flocculation of microalgae occurred however the effect of hydrodynamics on flocculation characteristics of microalgae has remained unclear this study of experiments were conducted in annular tanks made of pmma polymethyl methacrylate the effect of hydrodynamic on autoflocculation of microalgae was quantified under various flow regimes with different flow rates the floc characteristics was quantified in terms of floc size average settling velocity and flocculation efficiency etc to evaluate the potential of hydrodynamics in harvesting of microalgae for mass production 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal strain and medium chlorella vulgaris has been used in various sewage treatment studies due to its high pollution resistance and high treatment rate 23 24

followed by addition of 100 ml aseptic bg11 culture medium 25 the conical flasks were cultivated in illuminated incubator at temperature of 29 0 5 c illumination intensity of 40 μmol photons m2 s and light dark cycle of 14 10 h the flasks were shaken manually three times a day under these conditions the chlorella vulgaris existed as unicellular morphs and collected for use at exponential growth phase in order to observe the self flocculation effect of chlorella vulgaris in the process of advanced treatment of effluent the aqueous medium used was the effluent collected from the outfall of a sewage treatment plant in nanchang jiangxi province china and without any pretreatment before use the heavy metal content was determined using icp aes method icap 7400 thermo usa tn tp and codmn were determined using standard methods 26 the content of water samples were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup strain was batch cultured in annular tanks made of pmma as shown in fig 1 driven by varying speed motor the impeller blade forced the water stream to move around the tank our previous study showed that the growth of microcystis was inhibited at a flow rate of over 35 cm s in the same device 27 zhong et al 28 also found that the microcystis had the largest colony size at a flow rate of 32 cm s and then decreased beyond this flow rate hence the flow rate of the water stream which was controlled by varying speed motor was set at 0 control group running at 5 cm s 3 times day 3 min per time 5 10 15 25 and 35 cm s experimental group continuous operation respectively the experimental setup was sterilized in advance with uv light of 30 w for 2 4 h prior to experiments which were conducted in illuminated incubator with temperature of 29 0 5 c illumination intensity of

floc diameter settling velocity extracellular polysaccharides eps and flocculation efficiency 2 2 1 floc diameter during sedimentation sony camera sony fdr ax30 japan was used to take images which were used by image processing software to measure the settling velocity and diameter of chlorella vulgaris flocs under various hydrodynamic conditions 29 the long axis a and short axis b which represents the length of the longest axis and the length of the shortest axis of a floc respectively were measured using the image processing software the floc diameter was calculated based on equation d ab more than 300 flocs per sample were measured to determine the average diameter 2 2 2 settling velocity during gravity sedimentation experiments camera was used to record the

was calculated based on eq 1 as shown below 13 1 fe 1 od t od 0 100 where od0 and odt refer to the absorbance measured at 680 nm of the aqueous medium respectively at time zero and time t after the motor was switched off 2 3 flow regime measurement and quantitative hydrodynamic analysis acoustics doppler tachometer 16 mhz microadv was employed for flow regime measurement turbulent flow can be treated as a big vortex which is unstable and tends to break up into smaller and smaller eddies till it is ultimately converted into heat energy by viscous stress this heat energy is dissipated equally in all directions statistically there is no energy variation along all direction 32 energy dissipation rate ɛ is used to represent the conversion of kinetic energy into heat energy 33 kolmogorov length refers to the length scale of the smallest eddies at which level the turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by viscosity 34 energy dissipation rate and shear strength are key parameters in evaluating the hydrodynamic characteristics of fluid flow 35 36 e ω the power spectra was obtained based on spectral analysis of flow velocity and average e ω was obtained based on the correlation between ω and e ω the energy dissipation rate was calculated based on the eq 2 as below 2 ε e ω 2 3 w 5 2 α 3 2 u 2 1 2 where ω is angular frequency α is a constant with a value of

of the liquid which is approx 1 mg ml ν is viscosity which is approx 10 6 m2 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 images of chlorella vulgaris autoflocculation regime under experimental conditions autoflocculation occurred in both control group and experimental group on day 1 after inoculation but the experimental group exhibited more evident autoflocculation characteristics the floc size increased with cultivation time fig 2 presented the images recorded during autoflocculation of chlorella vulgaris on day 5 after inoculation as shown in image a b c e f and g which correspond chlorella vulgaris flocculation regime at flow rate of 0 5 10 15 25 and 35 cm s respectively after allowing the same sedimentation cylinder corresponding to image e to settle for additional 16 min as illustrated in image g the chlorella vulgaris flocs settled to the bottom by gravity with desirable algae and water separation performance this suggested that hydrodynamically induced autoflocculation can be a promising approach for harvesting of chlorella vulgaris 3 2 the effect of hydrodynamics on autoflocculation of chlorella vulgaris after 5 days cultivation the autoflocculation characteristics of chlorella vulgaris were analyzed as shown in fig 3 in the control group static conditions the standard floc diameter was 108 9 μm in the experimental group with flow rate from 5 to 35 cm s the standard floc diameter increased in turn from 230 28 μm to 373 46 μm and then decreased to 227 26 μm with the maximum floc size occurring at flow rate of 15 cm s and ε of 0 45 10 4 m2 s3 the floc size in the experimental group and control group demonstrated significant difference p 0 01 suggesting fluid flow significantly promotes autoflocculation of chlorella vulgaris as shown in fig 4 hydrodynamic conditions considerably increased eps content of chlorella vulgaris cells p 0 01 with the maximum eps content reaching up to 142 17 mg g dry weight at flow rate of 15 cm s the eps with negative charge will reacted with the cation present in the aqueous medium such as ca mg 19 37 forming bridge which allows for improved autoflocculation of chlorella vulgaris in laboratory experiments under static conditions with calcium ion concentration of 15 mg l and 100 mg l wang et al 38 observed that microalgae floc diameter reached 55 μm and 105 μm respectively which are smaller than the floc size observed in the experimental group in this study this may be caused by fluid flow which increased the contact probability of algae cells in addition appropriate shear strength by inhibiting the release of daughter cells from the mother cells also promoted spontaneous flocculation of algae cells fluid flow in turn limits the floc size 39 the floc size of chlorella vulgaris at 15 cm s flow rate was 373 46 μm fig 3 which is smaller than the scale of the smallest eddy ηkolmogrov is 387 μm table 2 and when shear strength above 0 115 0 1 n m2 the flocs started to disaggregate fig 3 as shown in fig 4 the ζ potential of the aqueous medium in experimental group varied from 10 mv to 5 mv which is closer to 0 mv than that of control group the flocs formed in experimental group though more stable than those formed in control group were still less stable compared with those generated under ideal flocculation conditions where the ζ potential of the aqueous medium equals to 0 mv 40 3 3 analysis of hydrodynamic effect on autoflocculation and sedimentation of microalgae autoflocculation characteristics of chlorella vulgaris in aqueous medium was analyzed as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that the autoflocculation efficiency under hydrodynamic effect ranged from 84 3 1 to 95 5 considerably higher than that of the control group under static conditions which was 62 3 p 0 01 the autoflocculation efficiency was highest at flow rate of 15 cm s as an important parameter in evaluating flocculation efficiency the settling velocity of chlorella vulgaris flocs varies depending on floc size structure and density 41 the average autoflocculation settling velocity for control group and experimental group was 0 515 0 05 m h and 1 47 2 17 m h respectively with the highest settling velocity occurring at flow rate of 15 cm s the significant increase in settling velocity under hydrodynamic conditions may be contributable to the increase in microalgae density as a result of increased eps accumulation with low investment and energy consumption 42 autoflocculation and gravity settling can be used for harvesting of algae from the high rate algal pond which is used for domestic wastewater 43 based on pnk ponder nakamura kuroda theory the clean water production efficiency qc is associated with projected settling area on the horizontal plane and algae settling velocity of the treatment work as shown in eq 7 44 45 7 q c nwbv sin θ l b cos θ where n b and w are the number spacing and width of the plates respectively v is the flocculation settling velocity which is 2 m h l is the length of the plate which is 1 m b is the width of the plate which is 2 cm θ is the included angle between the horizontal line and the object to be settled which is approx 65 if an open algae pond is used to treat wastewater with capacity of 80 000m3 per hectare per year which is equivalent to 300m3 per day the plate separator required for harvesting of algae is less than 1 m2 however whether chlorella vulgari could further in depth treatment of the effluent of the sewage treatment plant needs to be further explored in future studies 4 conclusions based on hydrodynamic quantitative analysis hydrodynamic turbulence considerably promoted autoflocculation of chlorella vulgaris with auto flocculation characteristics being most evident at shear strength of 0 0069 n m2 and energy efficiency rate ε of 0 45 10 4 m2 s3 under hydrodynamic conditions which caused an increase in eps accumulation and subsequent increase in floc density the settling velocity were increased to 1 47 2 17 m h in addition chlorella vulgaris flocs start to settle by gravity with separation efficiency reaching up to 94 5 4 5 declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

gradually increased for 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles these results could indicate that the epsp was the main effective factor in tmp variations for 12 12 and 24 0 l d regimes however the epsp and epsc in 16 8 l d did not show any significant changes keywords membrane fouling eps smp light dark cycles membrane photobioreactor chlorella vulgaris 1 introduction microalgae cells are green photosynthetic microorganisms that can produce high value compounds with the aid of light and organic or inorganic carbon molecules 1 2 these value added compounds have a wide range from carbohydrates proteins lipids to many other primary and secondary products 3 4 some of these compounds require dark cycles for increasing in their amounts within the cells 5 moreover some molecules which can be synthesized in the light period have the ability to use their energy in order to produce other high value substances during the dark phase 6 there are two basic forms for microalgae mass cultivation including open and closed systems recently a new promising technology was exploited to boost the productivity of these systems in wastewater treatment by combining the membrane technology with the traditional closed systems which is known as the membrane photobioreactor mpbr system 7 9 this system has promising advantages in treating wastewater streams compared to the common photobioreactor pbr systems owing to desirable control on the operational parameters through the process 10 viruela et al 11 designed a 2 2 m3 mpbr with the hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane system for nutrient removal in sewage treatment system the operation condition with a high concentration of biomass and the temperature of higher than 25 c decreased the rate of nutrient removal and biomass productivity the authors reported the nutrient removal rate of 1 17 mg p l 1 d 1 and 7 68 mg n l 1 d 1 through the solid retention time srt of 4 5 days gao et al 12 exploited an mpbr system for nutrient removal and biomass production from aquaculture wastewater treatment with chlorella vulgaris cells the results showed a significant rise 5 8 fold in the biomass productivity for a continuous cultivation configuration compared to the batch one additionally the average removal in total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were 82 7 and 86 1 respectively in another research gao and co workers 13 utilized chlorella vulgaris within a batch mode mpbr for nutrient removal from treated sewage and biomass production the results were compared with a conventional photobioreactor the results demonstrated that the biomass productivity and the nutrients removal were significantly higher in mpbr compared to the pbr one of the greatest predicaments in all membrane systems for wastewater treatment is the fouling issue which causes a great rise in operational cost and energy consumption 14 thus when microalgae cells have been cultivated in the membrane systems they can lead to internal fouling pore blocking as well as external fouling cake layer formation through membrane pores and surface respectively 15 when addressed to wastewater treatment there are different types of substances can be involved in the fouling subject in membrane photobioreactors including proteins and carbohydrates within the extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp 16 17 these materials can be released into the microalgal cultures as a result of the photosynthetic activities of these green cells 18 in membrane systems that work under low operating pressure biopolymers such as polysaccharides carbohydrates are considered as the main substances contributing in the membrane fouling 19 the smp and eps molecules have the potential to take part in different inter molecule interactions thus various molecules even small ones e g humic components can participate in the formation of large biopolymeric clusters these clusters can be much bigger than smp molecules that can lead to severe membrane fouling 20 21 proteins and carbohydrates can form non covalent interactions that had a great potential to aggravate fouling challenge however it should be mentioned that carbohydrates usually can lead to reversible fouling 22 23 in order to postpone this problem and the consequent imposing cost two main strategies have conventionally been investigated including physical and chemical cleaning methods for the utilized membrane 24 according to the published results in the literature there are a number of examples of these methods which can improve the efficiency of the membrane processes there are some solutions that have been utilized for the chemical cleaning of membranes for example acidic solutions e g hcl hno3 and h3po4 have been used for removing inorganic foulants basic solutions such as naoh however can effectively be used for removing organic and biological foulants as well as oxidants h2o2 and naclo in case of metal rich organic foulants edta solution was successfully utilized for membrane cleaning and ion removal from the membrane surface 25 huang et al 26 used periodical backwash in their ultrafiltration membrane photobioreactor system which was used for chlorella sp cultivation as a result the permeate flux recovery up to 95 could be reached with this physical cleaning method honda et al 27 utilized the chemical method with naoh flushing for the forward osmosis membrane in the photobioreactor system for the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris the authors reported and they could reach around almost 88 flux recovery kanchanatip et al 28 stated that using surface cleaning and membrane relaxation could lead to a partial flux recovery in a novel circular disc ultrafiltration membrane within the submerged bioreactor in both high and low cell densities of arthrospira maxima the authors also declared that the membrane flux could be fully recovered by the backwashing method in another research praveen and loh 29 used chlorella vulgaris in the osmotic membrane photobioreactor for investigating of nutrient removal from wastewater within 162 days the authors reported the removal values of 95 53 and 89 for ammonium nitrate and phosphate respectively moreover they stated high microalgal attitude to stick to the surface of the bioreactor and membrane this biofilm could be removed by frequent backwash from the surface of the membrane in this work the effect of various light dark l d cycles 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 on the eps and smp concentration and their effects on the membrane fouling during the chlorella vulgaris cultivation within a novel reciprocal membrane photobioreactor rmpbr system were studied the trans membrane pressure tmp values total eps and total smp epsp epsc smpc smpp carbohydrate concentration and protein concentration within the permeate under each l d cycle were investigated finally the differences between the protein and carbohydrate values for the initial point and the end of the irradiation period for each parameter eps and smp were determined and discussed the objective of this work was to design a simpler more cost effective and lower time consuming rmpbr system for a promising efficiency in mitigating membrane fouling challenge with a focus on the cake layer removal and diminishing cake resistance value compared to the other hydraulic resistances 2 material and methods 2 1 microalgae species and culture medium chlorella vulgaris species which was provided from iranian biological resource center ibrc was cultivated within the bg11 culture medium that contained as follows table 1 30 in the first stage 1 ml of solutions e and d were added to 960 ml of solution a then 1 ml of solution c that was diluted with 20 ml distilled water was added to the previous solution at the final stage solution b 20 ml was injected into the main solution 2 2 operating conditions for the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris species an elevator cleaner membrane photobioreactor rmpbr was designed and set up the schematic of the designed system is depicted in fig 1 the proposed system includes four main sections the external box the main membrane photobioreactor rmpbr an electronic segment and the mechanical segment the external box was made up of dark plexiglas 0 7 cm thickness with the dimensions of 30 25 120 cm3 as the length width and height respectively the main purpose of designing this dark box was to surround the rmpbr system and prepare the adequate light dark cycle a 20 l feed tank was placed on the top side of this structure package a movable dark plexiglas door could make the complete closed system to absolutely manage the light dark regime tests a 300 μmol m 2 s 1 light irradiation was applied by the led lamp and temperature was 25 2 c through the system the main rmpbr system had about 12 l capacity with 10 cm width 23 cm length and 52 cm height respectively the aeration pump had the 10 l min 1 flow rate and a 1 5 mm pore sized gas sparger was set up to 5 cm below the membrane sheet to generate bubbles for culture circulation within the system a membrane sheet with 0 4 μm pore size kubota company japan was utilized in this rmpbr system this membrane was located between two mobile dark plexiglas sheets the electronic part of the system was equipped by an amplifier and a programmed plc system this programmed plc system was connected to a computer in order to detect the tmp and tmpmax of the membrane additionally another connection between the plc system and a dc motor was considered that was able to regulate the tmp max in different pressures and different membrane fouling conditions whenever the tmp reached the critical value tmpmax the signals were sent to the dc motor mechanical segment to clear the cake layer on the membrane surface by the upward and downward movements of the spongy blade this designed system can be classified as a physical method of membrane cleaning which has the ability to reduce and postpone the frequency of the chemical cleaning of the utilized membrane although chemical membrane cleaning techniques are essential against the membrane fouling pore blocking this design can significantly decrease the total hydraulic resistance even up to 73 85 this will be discussed in the next sections comprehensively 2 3 extraction and analysis as previously stated extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products are of critical factors in the membrane fouling issue thus finding a promising technique for evaluation of the amounts of these parameters seems inevitable there are two sub categories for eps including extracted eps from cell aggregation eeps and smp soluble microbial products 31 some practical methods are available for the eps extraction such as ultrasonic method autoclaving or boiling with ch2o and naoh extraction centrifugation at high rpm edta extraction naoh extraction nh4oh extraction etc 32 the eps extraction method was as follows the suspension of chlorella vulgaris was mixed for 5 min using a magnet stirrer then 10 ml of the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm thereafter for smp detection chlorella vulgaris suspension was filtered after discarding the cells from the filter paper they must be suspended in deionized water again and must be shaken for almost 1 min after heating the suspended cells at 80 c for 10 min the sample must be centrifuged for 10 min at 7000 rpm eventually the solution was filtered via a 1 2 mm filter and the eeps sample which was prepared for the analysis step 33 the apha standard method was used in order to measure the dry weight of the cells 34 in this method 10 ml dried cell was centrifuged under 104 rpm and was dried in 105 c for 40 min the ph and the temperature values were recorded daily during the experiment using a ph meter metrohm 827 ph lab switzerland and a thermal sensor metrohm pt 1000 switzerland for obtaining the protein concentration three solution samples were prepared a 2 g of na2co3 1000 ml naoh 0 1 n and 0 02 g of knac4h4o6 4h2o were mixed as solution a b 0 5 g cuso4 5h2o one drop of h2so4 98 and 1000 ml distilled water were conflated with each other and was called solution b c 50 ml of solution a must be mixed with 1 ml of solution b to create solution c then about 1 ml of the microalgae sample was added to 3 ml of solution c and was mixed vigorously after that it was put in a dark place for 10 min then 0 3 ml c10h5nao5s which was diluted by distilled water 2 1 ratio was added to the former solution the final solution was located in a dark place for 30 min and was analyzed with spectrophotometer device under 750 nm wavelength 35 moreover dubois et al s method 36 was utilized for the determination of carbohydrate content first 100 ml h2so4 96 was mixed with 0 2 g anthrone solution and was located in a dark place for 4 h then 1 ml of microalgae sample was mixed to the previous solution this was an exothermic reaction and the container had to be kept in ice after that the solution was heated for 10 min based on the bain marie method finally the solution container was cooled with the cold water for 5 min and its absorption was recorded with the spectrophotometer device under 625 nm all the experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 4 total hydraulic membrane resistance the total hydraulic membrane resistance rt was measured based on the darcy law as follows eq 1 1 rt tmpt j μp where j and μ are the constant permeate flux and the dynamic viscosity respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 the membrane cleaning efficiency of the rmpbr system based on the experiments wastewater specifications operating conditions and membrane characteristics are of the most critical factors that are attributed to the membrane fouling challenge in anaerobic membrane bioreactors there are several methods for membrane fouling alleviation such as membrane vibration gas bubbling chemical cleaning and media manipulation energy consumption is one of the most essential factors that must be taken into consideration 37 according to the literature the cake layer formation on the membrane surface is a chief factor that can lead to a rise in the membrane total resistance during the microalgae base membrane process for wastewater treatment the investigated strategy for membrane cleaning and fouling reduction in this work was focused on the physical mode fig 2 shows the reduction percentage of the total hydraulic resistances which was achieved by using the newly developed reciprocal spongy blade at the fouling moment for each l d cycle during the conducted experiment as could be observed for proposed designed reciprocal membrane cleaner in the present mpbr system the cake layer can be removed from the surface of the membrane at any desired tmps according to the obtained results applying the rmbpr system could lead to a decline in the membrane fouling by reducing the total resistance up to 73 85 under the three l d regimes by the mechanical method without using any chemical washing material for reviving the membrane this continuous and chemical free process can raise the productivity and efficiency of the whole separation system the highest rt decline was achieved by using the 12 12 l d cycle this had the longest fouling time compared to the other cycles see fig 3 additionally the lowest drop of rt was reported in the 16 8 l d cycle in the third fouling time at about 73 these results apparently reveal that the rate of rt fall was decreased for each counterpart from first to the other next fouling moments for each cycle this can be translated to the fact that the overall efficiency of the designed physical cleaning method was decreased after each reciprocal operation of the cleaning system table 2 compares the results for conventional membrane cleaning methods and the obtained results in this work as could be observed there are a few examples of using physical and chemical methods for cutting down on the membrane fouling in various systems keyvan hosseini et al 38 used the granular particles in their hybrid membrane photobioreactor system to reduce the fouling issue with the mechanical cleaning method and obtained a 53 drop in the cake resistance huang et al 26 utilized the periodical backwash method in the ultrafiltration system as the membrane mechanical cleaning method and could obtain up to 95 flux recovery when the chlorella sp cell density was about 1 3 g l 1 also honda et al 27 applied the 400 ml min 1 flushing of deionized water for 1 h for brushing the membrane surface after each batch in the forward osmosis membrane and reached around 88 flux recovery in other work keyvan hosseini et al 39 employed orifices with different whole diameters for the alleviation of cake resistance at about 43 in their membrane photobioreactor system 3 2 tmp fluctuations as stated above the light dark cycles are of substantial parameters in the microalgal photosynthesis process for wastewater treatment either in membrane based or other cultivation systems closed or open these cycles can directly affect the production of primary and secondary metabolites i e protein carbohydrate lipid etc within the microalgae cells these substances can be simply transferred through membrane channels of the microalgae 40 consequently the presence of these materials within microalgal cultures is inevitable as a result microalgal biomass that is the main source in the cake layer formation as well as proteins and carbohydrates that are the principal parameters in membrane pore fouling pore blocking can affect the total membrane fouling process altogether 41 unwanted biofilm accumulation on the surface of the membrane is an inevitable issue this is so common in various pressure driven membrane filtration systems ranging from microfiltration to reverse osmosis this biofilm contains different microorganisms and biopolymers broadly speaking when biomolecules and microorganisms attach to the surface of the membrane the first stage of biofilm formation can be started 42 44 the effects of 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 l d cycles on the membrane fouling in a consistent lmh 20 l m 2 h 1 srt 11 days and hrt 5 h were also investigated rising the transmembrane pressure tmp is a logical indication for the membrane fouling 45 the tmp values during the cultivation under three l d cycles are illustrated in fig 3 as could be observed the membrane fouling occurred just about 96 h after starting the process for 16 8 l d cycle and this happened after 162 h and 226 h from the initial point for 24 0 and 12 12 l d regimes respectively this can be explained as follows in the membrane process quick fouling often takes place because of the formation of the cake layer on the membrane surface 45 it seems necessary to investigate the substances and the mechanisms that contribute to the membrane fouling through microalgal cultivation systems a general theoretical model for membrane fouling mechanisms is considered by chiang 45 according to the proposed model first a slight increase in tmp occurs because of membrane fouling then a constant linear or exponential rise in tmp happens eventually a sharp leap in tmp that is named tmp jump step takes place as could be observed in fig 3 these triple stages were also occurred in the recorded tmp fluctuations in this study it should be noted that the main factors in mpbrs fouling are the organic substances and microalgal biomass therefore the mechanisms of fouling in mpbrs and mbrs are the same 46 3 3 extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp contents in various light dark l d cycles according to the literature the light dark periods can effectively influence the concentrations of total extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp 46 the amounts of total eps and total smp in varied l d cycles are depicted in fig 4 as could be observed in fig 4 the total amounts of eps for the 12 12 l d cycle did not show any considerable changes until the third day after that it reached the maximum amount i e 46 86 mg g 1 on the fifth day of cultivation this procedure eps fluctuations was also the same for the 24 0 l d cycle however it reached a peak of 47 12 mg g 1 on the day 11 it could be obviously seen that there were no significant fluctuations in eps concentrations for the 16 8 l d cycles moreover according to the tmp graph see fig 3 the 16 8 l d regime had the fastest fouling time this can be explained based on the lower eps concentration as a result it revealed that the more extracellular organic matter concentration the more the cake layer resistance and the longer fouling time 47 48 additionally as comprehensively discussed in the previous work 49 the 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles led to the higher cake layer resistance compared to the 16 8 l d regime this was desirable accordance with the obtained results from two separate experiments heng et al 50 stated that the sharp tmp rise in the tmp jump step can be due to the sudden rise of eps concentration at the bottom cake layer broadly speaking eps molecules are deposited on the membrane surface and the initial layers of deposition which can form the clusters are made these clusters are generated by the eps related microorganisms that bond to the eps molecules on the surface of the membrane this biofouling layer is getting thickened gradually consequently the system needs a proper membrane cleaning method 51 on the other hand the stability of the biofilm layer can be improved by the aid of rejected biomolecules that are rejected from the membrane and the eps molecules that were generated by cells these eps molecules are able to build a strong matrix in the bio cake layer 52 in contradiction to total eps concentrations in various cycles the total smp concentration of 16 8 l d cycle had a meaningful increase and reached the maximum amount of 18 9 mg g 1 on the day 11 furthermore the 24 0 and 12 12 cycles same as the former cycle faced an increase and reached their maximum values of 17 01 and 16 2 mg g 1 respectively low et al 46 illustrated that the high smp concentration can be a witness for the decadence of the cells owing to the low aptitude of dead cells in smp absorption thus the smp concentration rises sharply and the tendency of the formation of large cell aggregations decreases moreover the amount of suspended cells within the culture increases remarkably generally proteins and carbohydrates are the main contents of eps and smp compounds fig 5 illustrates different factors that are involved in membrane fouling issues through various light dark cycles fig 5 vividly demonstrates that the 16 8 l d cycle which had the shortest fouling time had a minimum cake layer formation on the membrane surface it should be noted that soluble microbial products are the most critical factor related to the fastest fouling in this l d cycle however the 24 0 and 12 12 l d cycles had the thicker biomass layer on the membrane surface subsequently biomass and extracellular polymeric substances are of the most significant parameters in the formation of cake layer and longer fouling time compared to the 16 8 l d cycle the presence of proteins and carbohydrates contents within the cake layer on the membrane surface was also confirmed with the ftir test 49 table 3 shows some of the recent microalgal systems in different operation modes and various eps smp ranges as mentioned earlier the proteins and carbohydrates are the main contents of eps and smp compounds lee et al 56 used different hydraulic retention times in three semi continuous submerged photobioreactors for livestock wastewater treatment by microalgae the main goal of their experiments was to assess the fouling characteristics of membrane system under the microalgae cultivation and their photosynthesis activities that could inevitably result in eps proteins carbohydrates and smp proteins carbohydrates production within the culture the results vividly demonstrated that these contents are the most critical parameters in the fouling of membrane systems under microalgal operation the compositions of foulants are altered during the membrane operation these changes are the result of degradation of smp and other biopolymer molecules owing to microalgae cells activities and the release of other biopolymers via dead cells moreover a large amount of inactive or dead cells can be formed in the deeper layer of biofilms this can be explained based on the depletion of nutrients and co2 for the microalgal photosynthetic process this layer has the affinity to absorb new layers of biopolymers live cells proteins and biodegradability as well as higher molecular weight substances compared to the proteins hence it can be more responsible for the fouling of membrane systems 57 therefore every action that can enhance the biodegradability of biopolymers within the cake layer matrix can be an effective method for fouling mitigation in membrane systems 25 fig 6 a to d illustrates the different concentrations of carbohydrate and protein within the eps and smp in the corresponding 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 l d regimes as could be observed the carbohydrate content of the soluble microbial products smpc in all cycles rose considerably in the 16 8 l d regime the highest smpc concentrations were 1 35 1 71 and 1 78 mg g 1 for the first second and third periods of membrane fouling respectively moreover the 24 0 and 12 12 cycles increased considerably until days 3 and 5 respectively and then fluctuated slightly in the limited range these results revealed that the rising of tmp in the first stage of tmp in all regimes especially in 16 8 l d cycle could be the result of an increase in the smpc concentrations shariati et al 58 discussed that the biomass activity is the main reason for released smpc in the supernatant in comparison with the cell lysis as demonstrated in fig 6b the smpp content increased during the process for the 16 8 cycle and obtained the maximum values of 17 28 mg g 1 in the day 11 of cultivation moreover the 24 0 cycle increased noticeably until day 5 and reached to 15 61 mg g 1 and then fluctuated slightly smpp concentrations had the same pattern for 12 12 l d and reached to 14 75 mg g 1 as its peak smp accumulation can be occurred in the membrane pores because of their tendency of adherence and also can affect the rate of eps fouling the initial connection between biopolymers and smp as well as their colonization on the membrane surface can help the following eps adhesion to the membrane surface 59 60 fig 6c shows that the epsc contents of each l d regime according to the obtained results carbohydrate fractions of polymeric substances did not have any effective role in the rmpbr membrane fouling in 16 8 regime however these values in 24 0 and 12 12 l d cycles increased gradually fig 6d depicted the protein of eps epsp content fluctuations in each l d regime based on the obtained results the epsp concentrations increased steadily and reached to 39 16 on day 5 120 h and 37 97 mg g 1 for the 12 12 and 24 0 l d regimes respectively by matching these data with the tmp graph fig 3 it could be concluded that the epsp might probably be the main factor through tmp jump in 12 12 l d cycles in contrast there were no considerable changes in epsp contents for the 16 8 l d cycle during the whole period of cultivation this can be explained as follows different substances have specific contribution to each stage of membrane fouling in the primary stage of membrane operation and at lower tmp levels smpp and smpc are the main substances that can diffuse through the membrane pores gradually epsp and epsc stick to the smpp and smpc particles that are accumulated within membrane pores and on the membrane surface when tmp reaches larger values in the middle of operation dead cells are added to this bio cake matrix and with combining of live cells to this layer a thick cake layer is formed on the membrane surface this can consequently lead to a sharp increase in the tmp level in this circumstance a reviving process for the membrane is expected for proper resumption of the membrane operation 25 these discussions and results are in accordance with the reported results in the literature trabelsi et al 61 discussed that organic substances are mainly utilized for synthesizing biomass rather than the production of protein under a darkness period the eps fills the vacancies among the cells and these structures are deposited in the membrane filtration process and increase the hydraulic resistance with composing this special obstruction thus it can be concluded that the eps plays a crucial role in the cake formation in comparison with the internal fouling 62 low et al 46 cultivated the chlorella vulgaris species within the submerged ceramic membrane photobioreactors scmpbr under 20 day srt and three operated hrts 6 5 24 and 72 h and investigated the membrane fouling behavior based on the obtained results at lower hrts tmp and the rate of membrane fouling increased owing to the smpc increase while the eps did not have any significant role in membrane fouling through the scmpbr system in another work xu et al 54 declared the dead cell aggregations as the main factor in the membrane fouling for the long srt period 180 days larronde larretche and jin 63 employed the forward osmosis membrane system for the dewatering of chlorella vulgaris under 100 μmol m 2 s 1 light intensity the authors discussed that deposition of the extracellular carbohydrate had a dominant role in increasing the membrane fouling babel et al 64 cultured the chlorella sp with the 0 45 μm disk filter membrane system and the 7000 8000 lx irradiation the authors claimed that the extracellular organic matter led to high filtration resistance in another work wicaksana et al 65 performed chlorella sorokiniana species cultivation through a 0 2 μm disk microfiltration system with 3 co2 enriched aeration the results demonstrated that the deposited microalgae cells on the membrane surface were the primary foulant that caused the severe fouling honda et al 27 investigated the effect of chlorella vulgaris cultivation through the fouling of forward osmosis membrane systems the results revealed that the polysaccharides proportion in eps to smp was lower in physical cleaning effluent than in chemical ones sun et al 66 reported a 50 reduction in the membrane fouling by exploiting an algal sludge combination system as well as an increase in the ratio of the smpp to smpc the authors also discussed the lower protein to carbohydrate ratio through bound eps which could lead to a lower fouling layer deposition and higher membrane permeability in another work chen et al 67 added biochar to an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr to make mitigation through the membrane fouling in treating the pharmaceutical wastewater sample the authors reported a 56 reduction in tmp increment while the amount of epsp within the cake layer was declined remarkably 3 4 epsp epsc smpp and smpc concentrations through various light dark cycles before and after the illumination periods in this research microalgal cells were exposed to frequent light and darkness periods protein and carbohydrate contents within extra polymeric substances and soluble microbial products before and after illumination periods 16 h and 12 h were analyzed according to fig 7 the protein and carbohydrate concentrations through eps and smp after the illumination period decreased during 12 h of 12 12 l d cycle and 16 h of 16 8 l d cycle this could be explained as follows the related reduction in the carbohydrate and protein contents of eps and smp are the comparisons among the concentrations of carbohydrate and protein contents these contents were measured just before starting point of the illumination period and then right after finishing the irradiation time as stated above protein and carbohydrate contents within eps and smp after the illumination period declined it is well known that the light period is an essential part of microalgal photosynthesis in wastewater treatment because the photosynthesis process contains a light dependent section photochemical step and a light independent section biochemical step 49 it was proved that some kinds of molecules that are vital for cell growth procedures are synthesized in the dark phase and to achieve this goal they use some compounds that produce at the light dependent phase of the photosynthesis as the primary substances 68 in better words during the dark period microalgae cells perform protein synthesis and also use the energy that is absorbed in the light period for carbohydrate and lipid production 69 as a result a longer light irradiation period can lead to a lower protein and carbohydrate synthesis within microalgae cells moreover microalgae cells require both light and dark cycles to raise their photosynthetic productivity at irradiation time photochemical stage the cells absorb energy and store them by photoreduction reactions in some energy carrying molecules such as adenosine triphosphate atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase nadph this stored energy will be used in the dark phase biochemical stage that is related to the carbon fixation reactions to synthesize critical compounds lipid carbohydrate and protein which are vital for cells growth in other words frequent chain reactions photo reduction which is a part of the calvin cycle utilize the stored energy in atp and nadph and convert co2 and other compounds into carbohydrate compounds this required light can be supplied by both artificial sources e g leds and the sunlight 70 71 table 4 shows the percentage of differences in carbohydrates and protein contents after the irradiation period 12 and 16 h in each 12 12 and 16 8 l d regimes apparently these discrepancies were higher in the 16 8 cycle in comparison with the 12 12 cycle owing to the longer illumination period 16 h compared with 12 h of 16 8 l d regime moreover the smp s discrepancies are sharper than that of the eps s differences between the two investigated cycles e g the difference percentage of smpp in the 16l 8d and 12l 12d were 31 97 and 21 42 respectively that were higher than the corresponding values in epsp with 15 37 and 11 97 the highest percentage of difference was about 33 33 for smpc of 16 8 l d on the first day of the cultivation while the lowest percentage discrepancy was measured at about 1 91 for epsp in 12 12 l d at the end of the cultivation period 11th day it is noteworthy to state that during the cultivation period these differences decreased as a result of the rising of cell density and a drop in light penetration factor this descending procedure can be observed for both cycles in each protein and carbohydrate concentrations in eps and smp contents therefore it can be concluded that the light penetration is the most vital factor in protein and carbohydrate contents within eps and smp compounds this is in favourable agreement with the findings of de winter et al 58 moreover each parameter that can make a fall in the light diffusivity such as rising biomass concentration can decrease the amount of these substances in the culture these results can be a desirable interpretation for analyzing the results that can be comprehended from fig 7 4 conclusion a novel reciprocal membrane photobioreactor rmpbr which can effectively be used in wastewater treatment was designed and examined the reciprocal movements of the spongy blade could lead to a reduction in the total hydraulic resistance owing to a decrease in the cake resistance various light dark cycles 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 were applied for the chlorella vulgaris cultivation within this system according to the obtained results the fastest membrane fouling occurred at 96 h for the 16 8 l d regime the total eps for 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles increased slightly until the fifth day and then fluctuated erratically this procedure was almost the same for the total smp contents of all cycles however the 16 8 l d regime did not show any notable changes in the total eps during the cultivation the increment in the smp concentration can indicate an increase in the number of suspended cells and a reduction in the generation of large cell accumulation in addition the smpc content increased considerably until the second third and fifth days of cultivation for 16 8 24 0 and 12 12 l d cycles respectively these results revealed that the tmp increment in the first stage of the tmp graph could probably be the result of the smpc content furthermore the smpp concentration increased and achieved their highest values in the third phase of tmp for 16 8 and the second phase of tmp for 24 0 and 12 12 l d regimes moreover the main probable factor in the tmp sharp increase in 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles was the epsp content however the epsp in 16 8 l d and epsc in all cycles had not any considerable role in the membrane fouling owing to their negligible fluctuations thus it can be concluded that the eps has an effective role in cake formation rather than internal pore fouling declaration of competing interest the authors would like to declare that there is no conflict of interest with this research acknowledgements the authors would like to thank mr esmaeil ranjbari and mr masoud barani for their helps during this project 
13371,in this study a novel reciprocal membrane photobioreactor rmpbr was designed this system includes a plc programmed and a spongy blade that could clean the formed cake layer on the membrane surface moreover various light dark l d cycles of 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 for the chlorella vulgaris cultivation were applied and the effects of these cycles on the membrane fouling time transmembrane pressure tmp total extracellular polymeric substances eps concentration total soluble microbial product smp concentration the carbohydrate and protein contents through eps epsc and epsp as well as the carbohydrate and protein contents through smp smpc and smpp were evaluated obtained results revealed that this mechanical membrane revival method could reduce the total resistance at about 73 85 without any cleaning washing via chemical substances besides the obtained results from microalgae cultures demonstrated that the contrary of the total concentration of eps in 24 0 and 12 12 the total eps contents for the 16 8 l d regime did not change considerably however the total smp for 16 8 l d increased moreover the smpc and smpp for all cycles depicted the rising trend epsp concentration gradually increased for 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles these results could indicate that the epsp was the main effective factor in tmp variations for 12 12 and 24 0 l d regimes however the epsp and epsc in 16 8 l d did not show any significant changes keywords membrane fouling eps smp light dark cycles membrane photobioreactor chlorella vulgaris 1 introduction microalgae cells are green photosynthetic microorganisms that can produce high value compounds with the aid of light and organic or inorganic carbon molecules 1 2 these value added compounds have a wide range from carbohydrates proteins lipids to many other primary and secondary products 3 4 some of these compounds require dark cycles for increasing in their amounts within the cells 5 moreover some molecules which can be synthesized in the light period have the ability to use their energy in order to produce other high value substances during the dark phase 6 there are two basic forms for microalgae mass cultivation including open and closed systems recently a new promising technology was exploited to boost the productivity of these systems in wastewater treatment by combining the membrane technology with the traditional closed systems which is known as the membrane photobioreactor mpbr system 7 9 this system has promising advantages in treating wastewater streams compared to the common photobioreactor pbr systems owing to desirable control on the operational parameters through the process 10 viruela et al 11 designed a 2 2 m3 mpbr with the hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane system for nutrient removal in sewage treatment system the operation condition with a high concentration of biomass and the temperature of higher than 25 c decreased the rate of nutrient removal and biomass productivity the authors reported the nutrient removal rate of 1 17 mg p l 1 d 1 and 7 68 mg n l 1 d 1 through the solid retention time srt of 4 5 days gao et al 12 exploited an mpbr system for nutrient removal and biomass production from aquaculture wastewater treatment with chlorella vulgaris cells the results showed a significant rise 5 8 fold in the biomass productivity for a continuous cultivation configuration compared to the batch one additionally the average removal in total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were 82 7 and 86 1 respectively in another research gao and co workers 13 utilized chlorella vulgaris within a batch mode mpbr for nutrient removal from treated sewage and biomass production the results were compared with a conventional photobioreactor the results demonstrated that the biomass productivity and the nutrients removal were significantly higher in mpbr compared to the pbr one of the greatest predicaments in all membrane systems for wastewater treatment is the fouling issue which causes a great rise in operational cost and energy consumption 14 thus when microalgae cells have been cultivated in the membrane systems they can lead to internal fouling pore blocking as well as external fouling cake layer formation through membrane pores and surface respectively 15 when addressed to wastewater treatment there are different types of substances can be involved in the fouling subject in membrane photobioreactors including proteins and carbohydrates within the extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp 16 17 these materials can be released into the microalgal cultures as a result of the photosynthetic activities of these green cells 18 in membrane systems that work under low operating pressure biopolymers such as polysaccharides carbohydrates are considered as the main substances contributing in the membrane fouling 19 the smp and eps molecules have the potential to take part in different inter molecule interactions thus various molecules even small ones e g humic components can participate in the formation of large biopolymeric clusters these clusters can be much bigger than smp molecules that can lead to severe membrane fouling 20 21 proteins and carbohydrates can form non covalent interactions that had a great potential to aggravate fouling challenge however it should be mentioned that carbohydrates usually can lead to reversible fouling 22 23 in order to postpone this problem and the consequent imposing cost two main strategies have conventionally been investigated including physical and chemical cleaning methods for the utilized membrane 24 according to the published results in the literature there are a number of examples of these methods which can improve the efficiency of the membrane processes there are some solutions that have been utilized for the chemical cleaning of membranes for example acidic solutions e g hcl hno3 and h3po4 have been used for removing inorganic foulants basic solutions such as naoh however can effectively be used for removing organic and biological foulants as well as oxidants h2o2 and naclo in case of metal rich organic foulants edta solution was successfully utilized for membrane cleaning and ion removal from the membrane surface 25 huang et al 26 used periodical backwash in their ultrafiltration membrane photobioreactor system which was used for chlorella sp cultivation as a result the permeate flux recovery up to 95 could be reached with this physical cleaning method honda et al 27 utilized the chemical method with naoh flushing for the forward osmosis membrane in the photobioreactor system for the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris the authors reported and they could reach around almost 88 flux recovery kanchanatip et al 28 stated that using surface cleaning and membrane relaxation could lead to a partial flux recovery in a novel circular disc ultrafiltration membrane within the submerged bioreactor in both high and low cell densities of arthrospira maxima the authors also declared that the membrane flux could be fully recovered by the backwashing method in another research praveen and loh 29 used chlorella vulgaris in the osmotic membrane photobioreactor for investigating of nutrient removal from wastewater within 162 days the authors reported the removal values of 95 53 and 89 for ammonium nitrate and phosphate respectively moreover they stated high microalgal attitude to stick to the surface of the bioreactor and membrane this biofilm could be removed by frequent backwash from the surface of the membrane in this work the effect of various light dark l d cycles 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 on the eps and smp concentration and their effects on the membrane fouling during the chlorella vulgaris cultivation within a novel reciprocal membrane photobioreactor rmpbr system were studied the trans membrane pressure tmp values total eps and total smp epsp epsc smpc smpp carbohydrate concentration and protein concentration within the permeate under each l d cycle were investigated finally the differences between the protein and carbohydrate values for the initial point and the end of the irradiation period for each parameter eps and smp were determined and discussed the objective of this work was to design a simpler more cost effective and lower time consuming rmpbr system for a promising efficiency in mitigating membrane fouling challenge with a focus on the cake layer removal and diminishing cake resistance value compared to the other hydraulic resistances 2 material and methods 2 1 microalgae species and culture medium chlorella vulgaris species which was provided from iranian biological resource center ibrc was cultivated within the bg11 culture medium that contained as follows table 1 30 in the first stage 1 ml of solutions e and d were added to 960 ml of solution a then 1 ml of solution c that was diluted with 20 ml distilled water was added to the previous solution at the final stage solution b 20 ml was injected into the main solution 2 2 operating conditions for the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris species an elevator cleaner membrane photobioreactor rmpbr was designed and set up the schematic of the designed system is depicted in fig 1 the proposed system includes four main sections the external box the main membrane photobioreactor rmpbr an electronic segment and the mechanical segment the external box was made up of dark plexiglas 0 7 cm thickness with the dimensions of 30 25 120 cm3 as the length width and height respectively the main purpose of designing this dark box was to surround the rmpbr system and prepare the adequate light dark cycle a 20 l feed tank was placed on the top side of this structure package a movable dark plexiglas door could make the complete closed system to absolutely manage the light dark regime tests a 300 μmol m 2 s 1 light irradiation was applied by the led lamp and temperature was 25 2 c through the system the main rmpbr system had about 12 l capacity with 10 cm width 23 cm length and 52 cm height respectively the aeration pump had the 10 l min 1 flow rate and a 1 5 mm pore sized gas sparger was set up to 5 cm below the membrane sheet to generate bubbles for culture circulation within the system a membrane sheet with 0 4 μm pore size kubota company japan was utilized in this rmpbr system this membrane was located between two mobile dark plexiglas sheets the electronic part of the system was equipped by an amplifier and a programmed plc system this programmed plc system was connected to a computer in order to detect the tmp and tmpmax of the membrane additionally another connection between the plc system and a dc motor was considered that was able to regulate the tmp max in different pressures and different membrane fouling conditions whenever the tmp reached the critical value tmpmax the signals were sent to the dc motor mechanical segment to clear the cake layer on the membrane surface by the upward and downward movements of the spongy blade this designed system can be classified as a physical method of membrane cleaning which has the ability to reduce and postpone the frequency of the chemical cleaning of the utilized membrane although chemical membrane cleaning techniques are essential against the membrane fouling pore blocking this design can significantly decrease the total hydraulic resistance even up to 73 85 this will be discussed in the next sections comprehensively 2 3 extraction and analysis as previously stated extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products are of critical factors in the membrane fouling issue thus finding a promising technique for evaluation of the amounts of these parameters seems inevitable there are two sub categories for eps including extracted eps from cell aggregation eeps and smp soluble microbial products 31 some practical methods are available for the eps extraction such as ultrasonic method autoclaving or boiling with ch2o and naoh extraction centrifugation at high rpm edta extraction naoh extraction nh4oh extraction etc 32 the eps extraction method was as follows the suspension of chlorella vulgaris was mixed for 5 min using a magnet stirrer then 10 ml of the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm thereafter for smp detection chlorella vulgaris suspension was filtered after discarding the cells from the filter paper they must be suspended in deionized water again and must be shaken for almost 1 min after heating the suspended cells at 80 c for 10 min the sample must be centrifuged for 10 min at 7000 rpm eventually the solution was filtered via a 1 2 mm filter and the eeps sample which was prepared for the analysis step 33 the apha standard method was used in order to measure the dry weight of the cells 34 in this method 10 ml dried cell was centrifuged under 104 rpm and was dried in 105 c for 40 min the ph and the temperature values were recorded daily during the experiment using a ph meter metrohm 827 ph lab switzerland and a thermal sensor metrohm pt 1000 switzerland for obtaining the protein concentration three solution samples were prepared a 2 g of na2co3 1000 ml naoh 0 1 n and 0 02 g of knac4h4o6 4h2o were mixed as solution a b 0 5 g cuso4 5h2o one drop of h2so4 98 and 1000 ml distilled water were conflated with each other and was called solution b c 50 ml of solution a must be mixed with 1 ml of solution b to create solution c then about 1 ml of the microalgae sample was added to 3 ml of solution c and was mixed vigorously after that it was put in a dark place for 10 min then 0 3 ml c10h5nao5s which was diluted by distilled water 2 1 ratio was added to the former solution the final solution was located in a dark place for 30 min and was analyzed with spectrophotometer device under 750 nm wavelength 35 moreover dubois et al s method 36 was utilized for the determination of carbohydrate content first 100 ml h2so4 96 was mixed with 0 2 g anthrone solution and was located in a dark place for 4 h then 1 ml of microalgae sample was mixed to the previous solution this was an exothermic reaction and the container had to be kept in ice after that the solution was heated for 10 min based on the bain marie method finally the solution container was cooled with the cold water for 5 min and its absorption was recorded with the spectrophotometer device under 625 nm all the experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 4 total hydraulic membrane resistance the total hydraulic membrane resistance rt was measured based on the darcy law as follows eq 1 1 rt tmpt j μp where j and μ are the constant permeate flux and the dynamic viscosity respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 the membrane cleaning efficiency of the rmpbr system based on the experiments wastewater specifications operating conditions and membrane characteristics are of the most critical factors that are attributed to the membrane fouling challenge in anaerobic membrane bioreactors there are several methods for membrane fouling alleviation such as membrane vibration gas bubbling chemical cleaning and media manipulation energy consumption is one of the most essential factors that must be taken into consideration 37 according to the literature the cake layer formation on the membrane surface is a chief factor that can lead to a rise in the membrane total resistance during the microalgae base membrane process for wastewater treatment the investigated strategy for membrane cleaning and fouling reduction in this work was focused on the physical mode fig 2 shows the reduction percentage of the total hydraulic resistances which was achieved by using the newly developed reciprocal spongy blade at the fouling moment for each l d cycle during the conducted experiment as could be observed for proposed designed reciprocal membrane cleaner in the present mpbr system the cake layer can be removed from the surface of the membrane at any desired tmps according to the obtained results applying the rmbpr system could lead to a decline in the membrane fouling by reducing the total resistance up to 73 85 under the three l d regimes by the mechanical method without using any chemical washing material for reviving the membrane this continuous and chemical free process can raise the productivity and efficiency of the whole separation system the highest rt decline was achieved by using the 12 12 l d cycle this had the longest fouling time compared to the other cycles see fig 3 additionally the lowest drop of rt was reported in the 16 8 l d cycle in the third fouling time at about 73 these results apparently reveal that the rate of rt fall was decreased for each counterpart from first to the other next fouling moments for each cycle this can be translated to the fact that the overall efficiency of the designed physical cleaning method was decreased after each reciprocal operation of the cleaning system table 2 compares the results for conventional membrane cleaning methods and the obtained results in this work as could be observed there are a few examples of using physical and chemical methods for cutting down on the membrane fouling in various systems keyvan hosseini et al 38 used the granular particles in their hybrid membrane photobioreactor system to reduce the fouling issue with the mechanical cleaning method and obtained a 53 drop in the cake resistance huang et al 26 utilized the periodical backwash method in the ultrafiltration system as the membrane mechanical cleaning method and could obtain up to 95 flux recovery when the chlorella sp cell density was about 1 3 g l 1 also honda et al 27 applied the 400 ml min 1 flushing of deionized water for 1 h for brushing the membrane surface after each batch in the forward osmosis membrane and reached around 88 flux recovery in other work keyvan hosseini et al 39 employed orifices with different whole diameters for the alleviation of cake resistance at about 43 in their membrane photobioreactor system 3 2 tmp fluctuations as stated above the light dark cycles are of substantial parameters in the microalgal photosynthesis process for wastewater treatment either in membrane based or other cultivation systems closed or open these cycles can directly affect the production of primary and secondary metabolites i e protein carbohydrate lipid etc within the microalgae cells these substances can be simply transferred through membrane channels of the microalgae 40 consequently the presence of these materials within microalgal cultures is inevitable as a result microalgal biomass that is the main source in the cake layer formation as well as proteins and carbohydrates that are the principal parameters in membrane pore fouling pore blocking can affect the total membrane fouling process altogether 41 unwanted biofilm accumulation on the surface of the membrane is an inevitable issue this is so common in various pressure driven membrane filtration systems ranging from microfiltration to reverse osmosis this biofilm contains different microorganisms and biopolymers broadly speaking when biomolecules and microorganisms attach to the surface of the membrane the first stage of biofilm formation can be started 42 44 the effects of 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 l d cycles on the membrane fouling in a consistent lmh 20 l m 2 h 1 srt 11 days and hrt 5 h were also investigated rising the transmembrane pressure tmp is a logical indication for the membrane fouling 45 the tmp values during the cultivation under three l d cycles are illustrated in fig 3 as could be observed the membrane fouling occurred just about 96 h after starting the process for 16 8 l d cycle and this happened after 162 h and 226 h from the initial point for 24 0 and 12 12 l d regimes respectively this can be explained as follows in the membrane process quick fouling often takes place because of the formation of the cake layer on the membrane surface 45 it seems necessary to investigate the substances and the mechanisms that contribute to the membrane fouling through microalgal cultivation systems a general theoretical model for membrane fouling mechanisms is considered by chiang 45 according to the proposed model first a slight increase in tmp occurs because of membrane fouling then a constant linear or exponential rise in tmp happens eventually a sharp leap in tmp that is named tmp jump step takes place as could be observed in fig 3 these triple stages were also occurred in the recorded tmp fluctuations in this study it should be noted that the main factors in mpbrs fouling are the organic substances and microalgal biomass therefore the mechanisms of fouling in mpbrs and mbrs are the same 46 3 3 extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp contents in various light dark l d cycles according to the literature the light dark periods can effectively influence the concentrations of total extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp 46 the amounts of total eps and total smp in varied l d cycles are depicted in fig 4 as could be observed in fig 4 the total amounts of eps for the 12 12 l d cycle did not show any considerable changes until the third day after that it reached the maximum amount i e 46 86 mg g 1 on the fifth day of cultivation this procedure eps fluctuations was also the same for the 24 0 l d cycle however it reached a peak of 47 12 mg g 1 on the day 11 it could be obviously seen that there were no significant fluctuations in eps concentrations for the 16 8 l d cycles moreover according to the tmp graph see fig 3 the 16 8 l d regime had the fastest fouling time this can be explained based on the lower eps concentration as a result it revealed that the more extracellular organic matter concentration the more the cake layer resistance and the longer fouling time 47 48 additionally as comprehensively discussed in the previous work 49 the 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles led to the higher cake layer resistance compared to the 16 8 l d regime this was desirable accordance with the obtained results from two separate experiments heng et al 50 stated that the sharp tmp rise in the tmp jump step can be due to the sudden rise of eps concentration at the bottom cake layer broadly speaking eps molecules are deposited on the membrane surface and the initial layers of deposition which can form the clusters are made these clusters are generated by the eps related microorganisms that bond to the eps molecules on the surface of the membrane this biofouling layer is getting thickened gradually consequently the system needs a proper membrane cleaning method 51 on the other hand the stability of the biofilm layer can be improved by the aid of rejected biomolecules that are rejected from the membrane and the eps molecules that were generated by cells these eps molecules are able to build a strong matrix in the bio cake layer 52 in contradiction to total eps concentrations in various cycles the total smp concentration of 16 8 l d cycle had a meaningful increase and reached the maximum amount of 18 9 mg g 1 on the day 11 furthermore the 24 0 and 12 12 cycles same as the former cycle faced an increase and reached their maximum values of 17 01 and 16 2 mg g 1 respectively low et al 46 illustrated that the high smp concentration can be a witness for the decadence of the cells owing to the low aptitude of dead cells in smp absorption thus the smp concentration rises sharply and the tendency of the formation of large cell aggregations decreases moreover the amount of suspended cells within the culture increases remarkably generally proteins and carbohydrates are the main contents of eps and smp compounds fig 5 illustrates different factors that are involved in membrane fouling issues through various light dark cycles fig 5 vividly demonstrates that the 16 8 l d cycle which had the shortest fouling time had a minimum cake layer formation on the membrane surface it should be noted that soluble microbial products are the most critical factor related to the fastest fouling in this l d cycle however the 24 0 and 12 12 l d cycles had the thicker biomass layer on the membrane surface subsequently biomass and extracellular polymeric substances are of the most significant parameters in the formation of cake layer and longer fouling time compared to the 16 8 l d cycle the presence of proteins and carbohydrates contents within the cake layer on the membrane surface was also confirmed with the ftir test 49 table 3 shows some of the recent microalgal systems in different operation modes and various eps smp ranges as mentioned earlier the proteins and carbohydrates are the main contents of eps and smp compounds lee et al 56 used different hydraulic retention times in three semi continuous submerged photobioreactors for livestock wastewater treatment by microalgae the main goal of their experiments was to assess the fouling characteristics of membrane system under the microalgae cultivation and their photosynthesis activities that could inevitably result in eps proteins carbohydrates and smp proteins carbohydrates production within the culture the results vividly demonstrated that these contents are the most critical parameters in the fouling of membrane systems under microalgal operation the compositions of foulants are altered during the membrane operation these changes are the result of degradation of smp and other biopolymer molecules owing to microalgae cells activities and the release of other biopolymers via dead cells moreover a large amount of inactive or dead cells can be formed in the deeper layer of biofilms this can be explained based on the depletion of nutrients and co2 for the microalgal photosynthetic process this layer has the affinity to absorb new layers of biopolymers live cells proteins and biodegradability as well as higher molecular weight substances compared to the proteins hence it can be more responsible for the fouling of membrane systems 57 therefore every action that can enhance the biodegradability of biopolymers within the cake layer matrix can be an effective method for fouling mitigation in membrane systems 25 fig 6 a to d illustrates the different concentrations of carbohydrate and protein within the eps and smp in the corresponding 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 l d regimes as could be observed the carbohydrate content of the soluble microbial products smpc in all cycles rose considerably in the 16 8 l d regime the highest smpc concentrations were 1 35 1 71 and 1 78 mg g 1 for the first second and third periods of membrane fouling respectively moreover the 24 0 and 12 12 cycles increased considerably until days 3 and 5 respectively and then fluctuated slightly in the limited range these results revealed that the rising of tmp in the first stage of tmp in all regimes especially in 16 8 l d cycle could be the result of an increase in the smpc concentrations shariati et al 58 discussed that the biomass activity is the main reason for released smpc in the supernatant in comparison with the cell lysis as demonstrated in fig 6b the smpp content increased during the process for the 16 8 cycle and obtained the maximum values of 17 28 mg g 1 in the day 11 of cultivation moreover the 24 0 cycle increased noticeably until day 5 and reached to 15 61 mg g 1 and then fluctuated slightly smpp concentrations had the same pattern for 12 12 l d and reached to 14 75 mg g 1 as its peak smp accumulation can be occurred in the membrane pores because of their tendency of adherence and also can affect the rate of eps fouling the initial connection between biopolymers and smp as well as their colonization on the membrane surface can help the following eps adhesion to the membrane surface 59 60 fig 6c shows that the epsc contents of each l d regime according to the obtained results carbohydrate fractions of polymeric substances did not have any effective role in the rmpbr membrane fouling in 16 8 regime however these values in 24 0 and 12 12 l d cycles increased gradually fig 6d depicted the protein of eps epsp content fluctuations in each l d regime based on the obtained results the epsp concentrations increased steadily and reached to 39 16 on day 5 120 h and 37 97 mg g 1 for the 12 12 and 24 0 l d regimes respectively by matching these data with the tmp graph fig 3 it could be concluded that the epsp might probably be the main factor through tmp jump in 12 12 l d cycles in contrast there were no considerable changes in epsp contents for the 16 8 l d cycle during the whole period of cultivation this can be explained as follows different substances have specific contribution to each stage of membrane fouling in the primary stage of membrane operation and at lower tmp levels smpp and smpc are the main substances that can diffuse through the membrane pores gradually epsp and epsc stick to the smpp and smpc particles that are accumulated within membrane pores and on the membrane surface when tmp reaches larger values in the middle of operation dead cells are added to this bio cake matrix and with combining of live cells to this layer a thick cake layer is formed on the membrane surface this can consequently lead to a sharp increase in the tmp level in this circumstance a reviving process for the membrane is expected for proper resumption of the membrane operation 25 these discussions and results are in accordance with the reported results in the literature trabelsi et al 61 discussed that organic substances are mainly utilized for synthesizing biomass rather than the production of protein under a darkness period the eps fills the vacancies among the cells and these structures are deposited in the membrane filtration process and increase the hydraulic resistance with composing this special obstruction thus it can be concluded that the eps plays a crucial role in the cake formation in comparison with the internal fouling 62 low et al 46 cultivated the chlorella vulgaris species within the submerged ceramic membrane photobioreactors scmpbr under 20 day srt and three operated hrts 6 5 24 and 72 h and investigated the membrane fouling behavior based on the obtained results at lower hrts tmp and the rate of membrane fouling increased owing to the smpc increase while the eps did not have any significant role in membrane fouling through the scmpbr system in another work xu et al 54 declared the dead cell aggregations as the main factor in the membrane fouling for the long srt period 180 days larronde larretche and jin 63 employed the forward osmosis membrane system for the dewatering of chlorella vulgaris under 100 μmol m 2 s 1 light intensity the authors discussed that deposition of the extracellular carbohydrate had a dominant role in increasing the membrane fouling babel et al 64 cultured the chlorella sp with the 0 45 μm disk filter membrane system and the 7000 8000 lx irradiation the authors claimed that the extracellular organic matter led to high filtration resistance in another work wicaksana et al 65 performed chlorella sorokiniana species cultivation through a 0 2 μm disk microfiltration system with 3 co2 enriched aeration the results demonstrated that the deposited microalgae cells on the membrane surface were the primary foulant that caused the severe fouling honda et al 27 investigated the effect of chlorella vulgaris cultivation through the fouling of forward osmosis membrane systems the results revealed that the polysaccharides proportion in eps to smp was lower in physical cleaning effluent than in chemical ones sun et al 66 reported a 50 reduction in the membrane fouling by exploiting an algal sludge combination system as well as an increase in the ratio of the smpp to smpc the authors also discussed the lower protein to carbohydrate ratio through bound eps which could lead to a lower fouling layer deposition and higher membrane permeability in another work chen et al 67 added biochar to an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr to make mitigation through the membrane fouling in treating the pharmaceutical wastewater sample the authors reported a 56 reduction in tmp increment while the amount of epsp within the cake layer was declined remarkably 3 4 epsp epsc smpp and smpc concentrations through various light dark cycles before and after the illumination periods in this research microalgal cells were exposed to frequent light and darkness periods protein and carbohydrate contents within extra polymeric substances and soluble microbial products before and after illumination periods 16 h and 12 h were analyzed according to fig 7 the protein and carbohydrate concentrations through eps and smp after the illumination period decreased during 12 h of 12 12 l d cycle and 16 h of 16 8 l d cycle this could be explained as follows the related reduction in the carbohydrate and protein contents of eps and smp are the comparisons among the concentrations of carbohydrate and protein contents these contents were measured just before starting point of the illumination period and then right after finishing the irradiation time as stated above protein and carbohydrate contents within eps and smp after the illumination period declined it is well known that the light period is an essential part of microalgal photosynthesis in wastewater treatment because the photosynthesis process contains a light dependent section photochemical step and a light independent section biochemical step 49 it was proved that some kinds of molecules that are vital for cell growth procedures are synthesized in the dark phase and to achieve this goal they use some compounds that produce at the light dependent phase of the photosynthesis as the primary substances 68 in better words during the dark period microalgae cells perform protein synthesis and also use the energy that is absorbed in the light period for carbohydrate and lipid production 69 as a result a longer light irradiation period can lead to a lower protein and carbohydrate synthesis within microalgae cells moreover microalgae cells require both light and dark cycles to raise their photosynthetic productivity at irradiation time photochemical stage the cells absorb energy and store them by photoreduction reactions in some energy carrying molecules such as adenosine triphosphate atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase nadph this stored energy will be used in the dark phase biochemical stage that is related to the carbon fixation reactions to synthesize critical compounds lipid carbohydrate and protein which are vital for cells growth in other words frequent chain reactions photo reduction which is a part of the calvin cycle utilize the stored energy in atp and nadph and convert co2 and other compounds into carbohydrate compounds this required light can be supplied by both artificial sources e g leds and the sunlight 70 71 table 4 shows the percentage of differences in carbohydrates and protein contents after the irradiation period 12 and 16 h in each 12 12 and 16 8 l d regimes apparently these discrepancies were higher in the 16 8 cycle in comparison with the 12 12 cycle owing to the longer illumination period 16 h compared with 12 h of 16 8 l d regime moreover the smp s discrepancies are sharper than that of the eps s differences between the two investigated cycles e g the difference percentage of smpp in the 16l 8d and 12l 12d were 31 97 and 21 42 respectively that were higher than the corresponding values in epsp with 15 37 and 11 97 the highest percentage of difference was about 33 33 for smpc of 16 8 l d on the first day of the cultivation while the lowest percentage discrepancy was measured at about 1 91 for epsp in 12 12 l d at the end of the cultivation period 11th day it is noteworthy to state that during the cultivation period these differences decreased as a result of the rising of cell density and a drop in light penetration factor this descending procedure can be observed for both cycles in each protein and carbohydrate concentrations in eps and smp contents therefore it can be concluded that the light penetration is the most vital factor in protein and carbohydrate contents within eps and smp compounds this is in favourable agreement with the findings of de winter et al 58 moreover each parameter that can make a fall in the light diffusivity such as rising biomass concentration can decrease the amount of these substances in the culture these results can be a desirable interpretation for analyzing the results that can be comprehended from fig 7 4 conclusion a novel reciprocal membrane photobioreactor rmpbr which can effectively be used in wastewater treatment was designed and examined the reciprocal movements of the spongy blade could lead to a reduction in the total hydraulic resistance owing to a decrease in the cake resistance various light dark cycles 24 0 16 8 and 12 12 were applied for the chlorella vulgaris cultivation within this system according to the obtained results the fastest membrane fouling occurred at 96 h for the 16 8 l d regime the total eps for 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles increased slightly until the fifth day and then fluctuated erratically this procedure was almost the same for the total smp contents of all cycles however the 16 8 l d regime did not show any notable changes in the total eps during the cultivation the increment in the smp concentration can indicate an increase in the number of suspended cells and a reduction in the generation of large cell accumulation in addition the smpc content increased considerably until the second third and fifth days of cultivation for 16 8 24 0 and 12 12 l d cycles respectively these results revealed that the tmp increment in the first stage of the tmp graph could probably be the result of the smpc content furthermore the smpp concentration increased and achieved their highest values in the third phase of tmp for 16 8 and the second phase of tmp for 24 0 and 12 12 l d regimes moreover the main probable factor in the tmp sharp increase in 12 12 and 24 0 l d cycles was the epsp content however the epsp in 16 8 l d and epsc in all cycles had not any considerable role in the membrane fouling owing to their negligible fluctuations thus it can be concluded that the eps has an effective role in cake formation rather than internal pore fouling declaration of competing interest the authors would like to declare that there is no conflict of interest with this research acknowledgements the authors would like to thank

diclofenac adsorption on raw and plasma based functionalized fibers were quantified and modeled with different equations thermodynamic parameters of diclofenac adsorption were estimated and statistical physics calculations were carried out to characterize the adsorption orientation of diclofenac molecules on biomass surface overall the palm fibers functionalized with plasma and hydrogen peroxide showed the best adsorption properties for the removal of this pharmaceutical results showed that diclofenac adsorption was a multi molecular exothermic process with an inclined adsorption orientation on the fiber surface the experimental maximum adsorption capacities decreased from 33 12 to 24 71 mg g at 25 50 c liu model provided the best correlation of experimental data for all adsorption temperatures solution ph played a relevant role in the diclofenac adsorption mechanism where hydrogen bonding van der waals forces and electrostatic interactions were involved this paper contributes to the valorization of biomasses for implementing low cost and effective adsorption processes to face the water pollution caused by pharmaceuticals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non thermal plasma lignocellulosic biomasses low cost adsorbent emerging pollutants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction in recent decades the substantial presence of pharmaceuticals e g anticancer drugs antibiotics hormones and anti inflammatory drugs in wastewaters and effluents has been considered as a serious environmental problem due to the continuous input and persistence of these pollutants in the ecosystems 1 pharmaceutical pollutants found in aquatic environments can come from the fluids generated during conventional wastewater treatment processes and their excretion in the urine and feces caused by the limited bio assimilation during human metabolism 2 the presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewaters can lead to resistance to bacteria and could generate an increase in infectious diseases such as tuberculosis pneumonia and gonorrhea which are difficult to treat as these compounds lose their effectiveness 3 current water treatment methods are effective to face the pollution caused by traditional chemical compounds but they can fail to reduce the concentrations of emerging pollutants where the pharmaceutical products fall in this category note that these molecules are not biodegradable but are also resistant to oxidation and consequently they can be found in water resources 1 3 to solve this environmental problem scientists have applied and tested different processes such as chemical treatments chemical oxidation complexation coagulation and precipitation and physical treatments adsorption membrane filtration to reduce the concentration of pharmaceuticals in polluted water in the case of adsorption the commercial activated carbons are widely used for pollution control however their large scale application could imply a cost problem for low income countries 4 thus a promising alternative is the use of agro industrial wastes as adsorbents for the treatment of effluents containing pharmaceutical products 5 7 in order to maximize the adsorption capacity of natural biomasses the modification of their surfaces by introducing other chemical groups using various techniques such as plasma has been explored 8 10 previous studies have examined the impact of plasma pretreatment on the physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic materials for the removal of organic pollutants e g dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides 8 12 however the effects of plasma gas type to modify the surface functional groups of lignocellulosic materials and to enhance the removal of pollutants in aqueous solutions have not yet been evaluated and discussed therefore the present paper has taken the advantage of the reactivity of the plasma glidarc burning at atmospheric pressure with several types of plasma gas to modify the surface chemistry of palm fibers a natural biomass to increase their adsorption properties for diclofenac sodium dcf which was used as a model compound of pharmaceutical pollutants in aqueous solution this plasma modification does not affect the intrinsic properties of biomasses due to its non thermal characteristics 12 the use of different types of plasma gas contributes to optimize this process by evaluating the role of each gas to modify the material surface via the incorporation of functional groups like polar and hydrophilic groups indeed each gas could offer the possibility of creating a unique chemical environment to tailor the adsorbent surface for the removal of a specific pollutant 13 on the other hand the palms are not trees but giant grasses from a botanical point of view they do not have a trunk but a stipe represented by an unbranched stem filled with pith or fibers these palms can be found in the tropics subtropics and temperate regions of africa america and asia the plant fibers can come from the stems or leaves and their morphology varies according to the origin and their dimensions also depend on the state of plant maturity 14 recent studies have shown that unlike the large majority of lignocellulosic fibers used as adsorbents which have commonly a low specific surface area and limited porosity the palm fibers have better textural parameters 15 17 these characteristics have motivated the selection of this material for the present study therefore the adsorption of dcf with palm fibers modified using different plasma gases has been analyzed the performances of natural fibers were compared with those obtained for plasma modified fibers physicochemical characterization of the modified adsorbents was carried out and the corresponding dcf adsorption mechanism was studied via experimental results and statistical physics calculations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents were of analytical grade the sodium diclofenac dcf c14h10cl2no2na cid 5018304 318 1 g mol see fig s1 of supplementary material was donated by labo genie ltd and used without further purification solutions of dcf were prepared with deionized water by diluting a stock solution of 1000 mg l the ph of dcf solutions was adjusted with 0 1 mol l of hcl and naoh solutions and all ph values were measured with a portable hanna hi9811 5 electronic multi meter 2 2 surface chemistry modification and characterization of the palm fibers the fibers were collected from an oil palm in méfou and afamba department in the center region cameroon these fibers were cut into small pieces washed and placed in an oven for 24 h before being crushed afterward the biomass was washed several times with boiling potable water until colorless washing water was obtained to remove extractives and other impurities finally the sample was rinsed with distilled water placed in an oven for 8 h at 70 c and sieved to obtain different particle sizes from 800 to 80 μm the experimental plasma device used for the modification of fiber surface chemistry is shown in fig 1 and its description has been reported in previous studies 18 20 it consisted of a double walled glass reactor that allowed the circulation of cooling water this reactor contained two metal electrodes of divergent shapes and a nozzle connected to a gas supply device this device included a compressor that captured the ambient air a bubbler to saturate this air according to the nature of the desired plasma gas and in the case of the present study a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide the gas supply device had a flow meter to adjust the gas flow directly injected into the reactor through the nozzle the two electrodes were connected to a high voltage generator ac 220 v 10 kv 1a which delivered a mean current intensity of 160 ma 600 v p 100 w the procedure for the biomass modification was performed with 10 g of palm fibers and 430 ml of distilled water that were introduced into the plasma reactor depending on tested plasma gas 100 ml of distilled water 10 hydrogen peroxide naoh were introduced into the bubbler after this step the air compressor was turned on and the gas flow meter was set to 800 l h just after running the cooling and homogenization of the system via magnetic stirrer after the high voltage generator was switched on to initiate the electric shock the electric discharge started at the narrowest point between the electrodes and it slid under the pressure of the gas jet because of the divergent profile of the electrodes the discharge arc stretched until extinction and the cycle was resumed note that the arc discharge formed between diverging conductors was the thermal plasma which was driven by the input gas along the electrodes to their tips where it burst in a plasma plume its temperature drastically reduced until it was close to room temperature and formed a quenched plasma cloud the macroscopic temperature of a liquid target exposed to the plasma cloud increased only by a few tens of degrees even without cooling 18 20 the chemical species generated by the discharge were dispersed in the gas and thus they promoted specific chemical reactions that took place at the interface solution plasma 21 24 after a treatment time i e 30 min the discharge was stopped the collected solution was filtered and the modified fibers were rinsed with distilled water and then dried in an oven at 70 c for 24 h the modified fibers fah2o fah2o2 fanaoh were stored for further characterization and dcf adsorption studies surface chemistry of modified fibers was analyzed by ftir spectroscopy with an alpha p bruker spectrophotometer using kbr pellets in particular 2 mg of adsorbent particles were well mixed with 200 mg of high quality grade kbr 99 and pressed to obtain sample discs for the analysis the spectra were recorded at a speed of 100 cumulative scans from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 resolution the morphology of different biomass samples was visualized using a philips xl 30 feg field emission gun microscope with an acceleration voltage of 5 kv the ph at point zero charge pcn of all adsorbents was determined by adding 0 05 g of fibers in 50 ml beakers containing 20 ml of nacl 0 1 m at different initial ph phi from 2 to 10 that was adjusted by the addition of hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m in each beaker the suspensions were stirred continuously at room temperature for 48 h and the final ph phf was measured in the solutions without the fibers pcn values were determined from the intersection of the curves δph phf phi f phi where the abscissa axis passed through zero 2 3 batch adsorption of diclofenac on raw and plasma modified palm fibers first the impact of operating parameters such as adsorbent size ph and contact time on dcf removal was studied adsorption studies with different fiber sizes i e 800 500 500 315 315 200 and 200 80 μm were carried out using 0 25 g of adsorbent 200 ml of diclofenac solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l at ph 5 which was the natural ph of this dcf solution and a contact time of 60 min on the other hand the dcf adsorption at different ph i e 2 3 5 7 and 9 was also analyzed employing 0 25 g of raw and modified palm fibers 250 ml of dfc solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l dcf adsorption kinetics and isotherms were quantified with both raw and modified palm fibers adsorption kinetics were determined at contact times from 30 to 240 min with 250 ml of diclofenac solution and 0 25 g of the adsorbent particle size of 200 80 μm at ph 5 and 25 c three kinetic models were applied for the analysis of these experimental data pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich equations dcf adsorption isotherms were determined at 25 50 c and ph 5 where langmuir freundlich and liu equations were employed for the experimental data correlation dcf concentrations were determined by spectrophotometric analysis at the absorption wavelength of λ 276 nm removal percentage r and dcf adsorption capacities q mg g of the fibers were calculated using the following formulas 1 re moval c 0 c f c 0 100 2 q c 0 c f m v where c 0 is the initial dcf concentration mg l cf is the final dcf concentration mg l after adsorption m is the fiber mass g and v is the dfc solution volume l adsorption data correlation of kinetics and isotherms was analyzed via the determination coefficients r 2 adj and the sum of residual squares sd between experimental and calculated values of adsorption capacities the thermodynamic parameters were estimated using the experimental adsorption isotherms as reported by lima et al 25 enthalpy δh kj mol entropy δs j mol k and gibbs free energy δg kj mol changes were determined at 25 50 c using the next equations 3 δg δh tδs 4 δg rt ln k e where k e represents the corresponding equilibrium constant obtained with the following dimensionless equation 25 5 k e 0 1000 kg molecular weight of adsorbate adsorbate 0 γ where γ is the activity coefficient kg is the equilibrium constant generated from the best isotherm model adsorbate 0 is the standard adsorbate concentration 1 mol l and the term 1000 kg molecular weight of adsorbate is utilized to convert l mg to mol l respectively δh and δs were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot ln k e versus 1 t finally the eq 3 was utilized to calculate δg at each adsorption temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw and plasma modified palm fibers the results of ftir analysis of natural palm fibers fa and fibers treated with plasma saturated with humid air fah2o hydrogen peroxide fah2o2 and sodium hydroxide fanaoh are shown in fig 2 where the main absorption bands of these spectra are summarized in table s1 of supplementary material to understand the changes of surface chemistry of modified fibers it is convenient to recall that the air plasma is a medium of great complexity involving electrons molecules photons ions and in particular excited and neutral species atoms and radicals this medium becomes more complex when the natural air is saturated with water hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide the energy available in the arc plasma is transferred to the parent species e g o2 n2 h2o h2o2 oh thus favoring the break of ho oh h oh and oo bonds which requires less energy than nn breaking 26 this phenomenon also allows the transition of gaseous moieties from their fundamental energy level to the excited energy level the mechanism of conversion of hydroxide ion oh to oh radical is well likely since it requires an energy of 2 4 ev while plasma can provide 3 ev 26 28 table 1 summarizes the main primary and secondary impinging species as a function of plasma feeding gas the occurrence of ho can be attributed to three essential processes that involve h2o electronic attachment 6 e h 2 o h ho dissociation by electronic impact 7 e h 2 o e ho h dissociation by o 1 8 o 1 h 2 o 2ho a single reaction product is not usually observed and consequently there is a mixture of products from competing reactions which increases the complexity of the underlying chemistry since the energy of o o bond or 5 2 ev is slightly greater than the energy of the majority of electrons in a non thermal plasma only a few electrons can cause the direct dissociation main processes in plasmas involve indirect dissociations that imply several stages of vibrational and or electronic excitation ionization of the oxygen molecule also gives rise to singlet oxygen and the species o2 o and o 26 the dissociation energy of n2 is 9 8 ev and its excited levels require more energy than those of oxygen consequently the rates of electron excitation and dissociation of nitrogen in air plasma are lower than those of oxygen note that average electron energy of 1 3 ev is expected for the system tested in this paper therefore the atomic nitrogen is less abundant than atomic oxygen 26 28 the dissociation of nitrogen occurs mainly via several successive vibrational excitations upscaling that are favored by the transfers of vibrational energy during shocks between molecules a discharge in nitrogen n2 likewise reveals the presence of n2 and n ions but the introduction of oxygen into the landfill induces the formation of additional species such as nitrogen oxides nox 29 the presence of water reduces the production rates of ozone and atomic oxygen the respective concentrations of ho and h radicals are maximum as the humidity increases h species disappear quickly due to their reaction with o2 to give the ho2 species the proportion of no decreases sharply after the first pulses while that no2 increases following recombination with o2 19 20 22 26 28 these findings are the basis to explain the surface chemistry changes on the palm fibers modified with plasma as described below in particular ftir results showed the main functional groups from lignin hemicellulose and cellulose contained in palm fibers the intensities of absorption bands of some functional groups increased with the gas composition ftir spectrum of fah2o2 showed the more intense band at 3400 cm 1 that was assigned to the vibration of oh bond which could be due to the increment of hydroxyl groups after the biomass exposure to electric shock following the addition of supplementary ho radicals coming from the homolytic rupture of ho oh bond 28 the biomass surface functionalization via hydroxyl radical oh addition follows the next equation 9 r ch ch r 2 oh cell choh choh r the increased intensity of the band at 1730 cm 1 corresponding to the c o vibration of modified fibers could be due to the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl and carboxylic acids under the action of strong oxidants produced by plasma according to the next reactions 10 r ch 2 oh 2 oh r cooh 2h 2 o 11 r ch oh r 2 oh r co r 2h 2 o the intensity of bands located in the regions of 3100 3600 and 950 1200 cm 1 clearly revealed that air saturated with hydrogen peroxide generated a more intense functionalization in comparison with other plasma gases due to the abundant production of ho radicals from homolytic rupture 11 12 the photodecomposition of hydrogen peroxide generated hydroxyl radicals by simple uv irradiation at 300 nm 12 h 2 o 2 hυ 2ho 250 λ 300 nm fig 2 indicated that the absorption band intensities of the functional groups of fanaoh fibers were lower than the absorption bands of other treated fibers fah2o and fah2o2 this result can be explained by the lower reactivity of air saturated with naoh as plasma gas indeed the negative charges of ho ions affected the production of hydroxyl radicals because of electrostatic attraction moreover the basicity reduced the reactivity of hydrogen peroxide with sodium hydroxide which was unstable in a basic medium 19 the main functional groups of modified fibers independently of plasma gas used in their functionalization were oh c o and cooh these surface functionalities have been associated to the adsorption of different pollutants from water 30 32 based on the intensity of ftir absorption bands the air saturated with hydrogen peroxide was more appropriate to modify the surface chemistry of palm fibers where the next trend was identified fah2o2 fah2o fanaoh the morphology of modified fiber samples is reported in fig 3 the fibrous aspect of this biomass was not significantly altered except when naoh was employed as a plasma gas alencar et al 7 have reported that the exposure of cellulose to a strong base such as sodium hydroxide altered its structure this result also corroborated that the plasma energy was not sufficient to break the non binding doublets on oxygen to form the hydroxyl radical this reaction required 5 ev which was higher than 2 ev to break the homolytic h oh bond or 1 5 ev to break the ho oh bond respectively for air saturated with water and hydrogen peroxide 19 27 a higher porosity and accentuated roughness were also observed for the samples treated with these two plasma gases these morphology changes could contribute to the pollutant adsorption with these modified palm fibers results of pcn quantification for raw and modified palm fibers are given in fig 4 pcn values were 4 6 4 2 3 3 and 3 5 for fibers fa fah2o fah2o2 and fanaoh respectively plasma treatment decreased the pcn value of raw palm fibers and this result could be explained by the acidifying effect of nitrous hno2 and nitric hno3 acids formed during the biomass functionalization in a strong alkaline environment it is possible that the collision between no and the superoxide radical ion o2 leads to the formation of peroxynitrite 19 33 13 o 2 no onoo if the solution ph is 7 10 nitrogen dioxide can react with the ho radical to form peroxynitrite acid 33 14 no 2 ho onooh k l mol s 4 5 10 9 peroxynitrite is a stable compound in an alkaline medium it is a weak acid pka 7 and its lifespan is of the order of a second at physiological ph 33 however peroxynitrite degrades by two competing processes at acidic ph either it quickly rearranges into nitrate 15 onooh h no 3 or it breaks down very quickly into no2 and ho 16 onooh no 2 ho 3 2 dfc adsorption on raw and plasma modified palm fibers 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent size and initial solution ph results of adsorption studies with different fiber sizes and different mass amount are presented in fig s2 of the supplementary material as expected the dcf removal decreased as the size of palm fibers increased thus the particle size in the range of 200 80 μm were the best and selected for further adsorption studies this result was consistent with literature where it has been reported that small particles showed a higher adsorption capacity due to increase of available surface area however it is convenient to remark that particle sizes 80 μm could generate an agglomeration phenomenon thus negatively impacting the adsorption 34 35 by varying the mass amount from 0 05 g to 0 40 g the results in fig s2 b show an increasing trend with the mass amount until an optimum of 0 25 g the decrease observed for higher adsorbent loading may be due to the deactivation by collision agglomeration and sedimentation of adsorbent hence the adequate adsorption amount retained is 0 25 g fig s3 shows that dcf removal decreased significantly with increments of solution ph for all raw and plasma modified palm fibers similar results were obtained by nakorn et al 36 for the adsorption of this pharmaceutical on silica based porous materials these results can be explained by the fact that the anionic form of dcf molecule was dominant in the solution at basic ph pka and the palm fiber surface was also negatively charged when ph pcn thus causing electrostatic repulsions that reduced the corresponding adsorption capacities at ph pcn the surface of these fibers was positively charged and there were electrostatic attractions with anionic dcf molecules at pka ph that contributed to the pharmaceutical adsorption for pka ph dcf was in its molecular form and if the fibers surface was positively charged i e ph pcn the adsorption of this pharmaceutical was due to hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces 37 consequently the acidic conditions favored the biomass dfc interactions thus explaining the adsorption capacities at ph 2 and 3 note that the fibers treated with different plasma gases showed better adsorption capacities than raw biomass this trend was associated to the carboxyl cooh and carbonyl co groups formed by the ho radicals in the plasma after oxidation of the alcohol functionalities at the biomass surface as confirmed by ftir results the carbonyl groups have intense dipole moments that can act as electron donors while the carboxylic functionalities of these adsorbents could interact via hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of diclofenac molecules overall these results showed that solution ph played a relevant role in the dcf adsorption with raw and plasma modified palm fibers 3 2 2 kinetics and isotherms of dcf adsorption on palm fibers fig 5 reports the dcf adsorption capacities with raw and plasma modified palm fibers at the best operating conditions rapid adsorption was observed for fah2o2 fibers which can be explained by the availability of a large number of active sites on the adsorbent surface in comparison with other fibers i e fa fah2o and fanaoh in general the saturation of the adsorption sites of all fibers occurred after 150 min of contact time when the adsorption capacities reached their maximum values especially at the highest dcf concentration maximum dcf removal in these kinetic experiments was 1 7 14 6 22 3 and 5 7 for fa fah2o fah2o2 and fanaoh fibers respectively parameters of tested kinetic models used in the correlation of dcf adsorption are given in table 2 and fig 6 illustrates the model performance for the kinetics obtained with the best fibers i e fah2o2 in general the model performance of kinetic equations was pseudo second order elovich pseudo first order statistical metrics showed that pseudo second order equation was the best and suitable to fit the dcf adsorption kinetics on fah2o2 fibers see table 2 r 2 adj values of the pseudo second order model ranged from 0 9920 to 0 9596 with sd values from 0 21 to 2 175 mg g times t ½ and t 0 95 were calculated to complement the description of dfc adsorption kinetics 38 pseudo second order kinetic model estimated t 1 2 and t 0 95 values of 22 66 and 189 18 min for a dfc initial concentration of 25 mg l and 13 32 and 88 69 min for a dcf initial concentration of 50 mg l respectively dcf adsorption isotherms on fah2o2 are reported in fig 7 and the adjusted parameters of four isotherm equations are given in table 3 experimental maximum adsorption capacities ranged from 33 12 to 24 71 mg g at 25 50 c which decreased with adsorption temperature thus indicating an exothermic dcf removal liu model provided the best description of experimental data with the lowest sd values 1 161 to 2 149 mg g and r 2 adj 1 0 for all adsorption temperatures see table 3 calculated thermodynamic parameters for dcf adsorption on fah2o2 fibers are presented in table 4 negative values of g confirmed that dcf adsorption was spontaneous 35 37 38 h was negative thus indicating the exothermic nature of dcf adsorption the positive values of δs confirmed the thermodynamic feasibility of this adsorption process statistical physics calculations were done to sketch the dcf adsorption orientation on the plasma modified fiber surface and complement the explanation of adsorption mechanism the next statistical physics model was used in these calculations 17 q e n s m 1 c 1 2 c e n where n is the number of dcf molecules adsorbed per functional group of modified palm fiber s m is the saturation adsorption density of fiber functional groups and c 1 2 is the concentration at half saturation respectively in general three scenarios could occur for the orientation of dcf molecules during the adsorption on the palm fiber surface 1 if n 0 5 the dcf molecules can be shared by two adsorbent sites at least thus reflecting a parallel orientation and the adsorption is a multi docking process 2 if n 1 the adsorbent functional groups can bind one or more dcf molecules suggesting that the adsorption is a mono or multi molecular process with an inclined adsorption orientation on the fiber surface 3 if 0 5 n 1 both parallel and inclined orientations are possible for the dcf adsorption on fiber surface statistical physics calculations showed that the parameter n varied from 1 96 to 4 45 for the dcf adsorption on fah2o2 fibers this result demonstrated that the functional groups of modified biomass adsorbed more than one dcf molecule at all operating temperatures and consequently an inclined adsorption orientation of dcf molecules occurred at different temperatures it is also important to indicate that the dcf molecules were also aggregated during the adsorption process n 1 3 2 3 mechanism of dcf adsorption recent studies on the adsorption of pharmaceuticals with different adsorbents including functionalized and raw biomasses have reported that the description of the adsorption mechanism may be complex due to several factors are involved 12 30 31 39 the physicochemical properties of adsorbates e g chemical structure functional groups hydrophobicity the process operating conditions e g ph concentration temperature and contact time and the both surface chemistry and textural parameters of the adsorbent used play an important role to characterize the adsorption interactions note that all these parameters are interconnected during the adsorption process for example the variation of medium ph influences both the pollutant and adsorbent surface as discussed in previous sections in the present study the results of removal tests and adsorbent characterization suggested that dfc adsorption depended mainly on the electrostatic attraction forces hydrogen bonding and the van der waals interactions the presence of these adsorption forces was in agreement with similar studies on the adsorption of pharmaceuticals by biomasses 12 39 indeed it is convenient to remark that the phenomenon of intra particle diffusion was negligible and the adsorption occurred mainly on the external adsorbent surface thus the polar functional groups identified at the external surface of adsorbent played a primary role in dcf adsorption these polar groups on the surface of modified palm fibers came from the plasma treatment which induced the formation of carbonyl co and carboxyl cooh groups as revealed by ftir analysis these functional groups have a strong dipole moment and can polarize the palm fiber surface as discussed the quantity of these surface functionalities depended on the plasma gas used in the biomass functionalization finally statistically physics calculations suggested a multilayer adsorption of dcf with an inclined orientation at tested temperatures dfc aggregation phenomenon that results from the molecular self assembly has been already reported on the literature 40 41 however this phenomenon can be thermodynamically regulated and depended on the dfc concentration 41 4 conclusions this study reports the application of glidarc plasma with different gases to modify the surface chemistry of oil palm fibers to increase their adsorption properties for the removal of diclofenac sodium from aqueous solutions as an alternative to solve the pharmaceutical pollution in wastewaters palm fibers modified with a plasma treatment using air saturated with hydrogen peroxide showed the best performance for the adsorption of this pharmaceutical molecule diclofenac adsorption was highly dependent on solution ph and exothermic with the palm fibers modified using plasma and air saturated with hydrogen peroxide pseudo second order and liu models were the best to describe the diclofenac adsorption data at tested operating conditions statistical physics calculations showed that diclofenac adsorption was a multi molecular process with an inclined adsorption orientation on the fiber surface where the molecular aggregation was present in summary this study describes an approach to enhance the value of an agricultural fiber for water pollution control at low cost declaration of competing interest the authors

13372,this study reports the tailoring of surface chemistry of palm fibers via plasma for the adsorption of sodium diclofenac from aqueous solution surface functionalization of palm fibers was carried

circulation of cooling water this reactor contained two metal electrodes of divergent shapes and a nozzle connected to a gas supply device this device included a compressor that captured the ambient air a bubbler to saturate this air according to the nature of the desired plasma gas and in the case of the present study a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide the gas supply device had a flow meter to adjust the gas flow directly injected into the reactor through the nozzle the two electrodes were connected to a high voltage generator ac 220 v 10 kv 1a which delivered a mean current intensity of 160 ma 600 v p 100 w the procedure for the biomass modification was performed with 10 g of palm fibers and 430 ml of distilled water that were introduced into the plasma reactor depending on tested plasma gas 100 ml of distilled water 10 hydrogen peroxide naoh were introduced into the bubbler after this step the air compressor was turned on and the gas flow meter was set to 800 l h just after running the cooling and homogenization of the system via magnetic stirrer after the high voltage generator was switched on to initiate the electric shock the electric discharge started at the narrowest point between the electrodes and it slid under the pressure of the gas jet because of the divergent profile of the electrodes the discharge arc stretched until extinction and the cycle was resumed note that the arc discharge formed between diverging conductors was the thermal plasma which was driven by the input gas along the electrodes to their tips where it burst in a plasma plume its temperature drastically reduced until it was close to room temperature and formed a quenched plasma cloud the macroscopic temperature of a liquid target exposed to the plasma cloud increased only by a few tens of degrees even without cooling 18 20 the chemical species generated by the discharge were dispersed in the gas and thus they promoted specific chemical reactions that took place at the interface solution plasma 21 24 after a treatment time i e 30 min the discharge was stopped the collected solution was filtered and the modified fibers were rinsed with distilled water and then dried in an oven at 70 c for 24 h the modified fibers fah2o fah2o2 fanaoh were stored for further characterization and dcf adsorption studies surface chemistry of modified fibers was analyzed by ftir spectroscopy with an alpha p bruker spectrophotometer using kbr pellets in particular 2 mg of adsorbent particles were well mixed with 200 mg of high quality grade kbr 99 and pressed to obtain sample discs for the analysis the spectra were recorded at a speed of 100 cumulative scans from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 resolution the morphology of different biomass samples was visualized using a philips xl 30 feg field emission gun microscope with an acceleration voltage of 5 kv the ph at point zero charge pcn of all adsorbents was determined by adding 0 05 g of fibers in 50 ml beakers containing 20 ml of nacl 0 1 m at different initial ph phi from 2 to 10 that was adjusted by the addition of hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m in each beaker the suspensions were stirred continuously at room temperature for 48 h and the final ph phf was measured in the solutions without the fibers pcn values were determined from the intersection of the curves δph phf phi f phi where the abscissa axis passed through zero 2 3 batch adsorption of diclofenac on raw and plasma modified palm fibers first the impact of operating parameters such as adsorbent size ph and contact time on dcf removal was studied adsorption studies with different fiber sizes i e 800 500 500 315 315 200 and 200 80 μm were carried out using 0 25 g of adsorbent 200 ml of diclofenac solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l at ph 5 which was the natural ph of this dcf solution and a contact time of 60 min on the other hand the dcf adsorption at different ph i e 2 3 5 7 and 9 was also analyzed employing 0 25 g of raw and modified palm fibers 250 ml of dfc solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l dcf adsorption kinetics and isotherms were quantified with both raw and modified palm fibers adsorption kinetics were determined at contact times from 30 to 240 min with 250 ml of diclofenac solution and 0 25 g of the adsorbent particle size of 200 80 μm at ph 5 and 25 c three kinetic models were applied for the analysis of these experimental data pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich equations dcf adsorption isotherms were determined at 25 50 c and ph 5 where langmuir freundlich and liu equations were employed for the experimental data correlation dcf concentrations were determined by spectrophotometric analysis at the absorption wavelength of λ 276 nm removal percentage r and dcf adsorption capacities q mg g of the fibers were calculated using the following formulas 1 re moval c 0 c f c 0 100 2 q c 0 c f m v where c 0 is the initial dcf concentration mg l cf is the final dcf concentration mg l after adsorption m is the fiber mass g and v is the dfc solution volume l adsorption data correlation of kinetics and isotherms was analyzed via the determination coefficients r 2 adj and the sum of residual squares sd between experimental and calculated values of adsorption capacities the thermodynamic parameters were estimated using the experimental adsorption isotherms as reported by lima et al 25 enthalpy δh kj mol entropy δs j mol k and gibbs free energy δg kj mol changes were determined at 25 50 c using the next equations 3 δg δh tδs 4 δg rt ln k e where k e represents the corresponding equilibrium constant obtained with the following dimensionless equation 25 5 k e 0 1000 kg molecular weight of adsorbate adsorbate 0 γ where γ is the activity coefficient kg is the equilibrium constant generated from the best isotherm model adsorbate 0 is the standard adsorbate concentration 1 mol l and the term 1000 kg molecular weight of adsorbate is utilized to convert l mg to mol l respectively δh and δs were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot ln k e versus 1 t finally the eq 3 was utilized to calculate δg at each adsorption temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw and plasma modified palm fibers the results of ftir analysis of natural palm fibers fa and fibers treated with plasma saturated with humid air fah2o hydrogen peroxide fah2o2 and sodium hydroxide fanaoh are shown in fig 2 where the main absorption bands of these spectra are summarized in table s1 of supplementary material to understand the changes of surface chemistry of modified fibers it is convenient to recall that the air plasma is a medium of great complexity involving electrons molecules photons ions and in particular excited and neutral species atoms and radicals this medium becomes more complex when the natural air is saturated with water hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide the energy available in the arc plasma is transferred to the parent species e g o2 n2 h2o h2o2 oh thus favoring the break of ho oh h oh and oo bonds which requires less energy than nn breaking 26 this phenomenon also allows the transition of gaseous moieties from their fundamental energy level to the excited energy level the mechanism of conversion of hydroxide ion oh to oh radical is well likely since it requires an energy of 2 4 ev while plasma can provide 3 ev 26 28 table 1 summarizes the main primary and secondary impinging species as a function of plasma feeding gas the occurrence of ho can be attributed to three essential processes that involve h2o electronic attachment 6 e h 2 o h ho dissociation by electronic impact 7 e h 2 o e ho h dissociation by o 1 8 o 1 h 2 o 2ho a single reaction product is not usually observed and consequently there is a mixture of products from competing reactions which increases the complexity of the underlying chemistry since the energy of o o bond or 5 2 ev is slightly greater than the energy of the majority of electrons in a non thermal plasma only a few electrons can cause the direct dissociation main processes in plasmas involve indirect dissociations that imply several stages of vibrational and or electronic excitation ionization of the oxygen molecule also gives rise to singlet oxygen and the species o2 o and o 26 the dissociation energy of n2 is 9 8 ev and its excited levels require more energy than those of oxygen consequently the rates of electron excitation and dissociation of nitrogen in air plasma are lower than those of oxygen note that average electron energy of 1 3 ev is expected for the system tested in this paper therefore the atomic nitrogen is less abundant than atomic oxygen 26 28 the dissociation of nitrogen occurs mainly via several successive vibrational excitations upscaling that are favored by the transfers of vibrational energy during shocks between molecules a discharge in nitrogen n2 likewise reveals the presence of n2 and n ions but the introduction of oxygen into the landfill induces the formation of additional species such as nitrogen oxides nox 29 the presence of water reduces the production rates of ozone and atomic oxygen the respective concentrations of ho and h radicals are maximum as the humidity increases h species disappear quickly due to their reaction with o2 to give the ho2 species the proportion of no decreases sharply after the first pulses while that no2 increases following recombination with o2 19 20 22 26 28 these findings are the basis to explain the surface chemistry changes on the palm fibers modified with plasma as described below in particular ftir results showed the main functional groups from lignin hemicellulose and cellulose contained in palm fibers the intensities of absorption bands of some functional groups increased with the gas composition ftir spectrum of fah2o2 showed the more intense band at 3400 cm 1 that was assigned to the vibration of oh bond which could be due to the increment of hydroxyl groups after the biomass exposure to electric shock following the addition of supplementary ho radicals coming from the homolytic rupture of ho oh bond 28 the biomass surface functionalization via hydroxyl radical oh addition follows the next equation 9 r ch ch r 2 oh cell choh choh r the increased intensity of the band at 1730 cm 1 corresponding to the c o vibration of modified fibers could be due to the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl and carboxylic acids under the action of strong oxidants produced by plasma according to the next reactions 10 r ch 2 oh 2 oh r cooh 2h 2 o 11 r ch oh r 2 oh r co r 2h 2 o the intensity of bands located in the regions of 3100 3600 and 950 1200 cm 1 clearly revealed that air saturated with hydrogen peroxide generated a more intense functionalization in comparison with other plasma gases due to the abundant production of ho radicals from homolytic rupture 11 12 the photodecomposition of hydrogen peroxide generated hydroxyl radicals by simple uv irradiation at 300 nm 12 h 2 o 2 hυ 2ho 250 λ 300 nm fig 2 indicated that the absorption band intensities of the functional groups of fanaoh fibers were lower than the absorption bands of other treated fibers fah2o and fah2o2 this result can be explained by the lower reactivity of air saturated with naoh as plasma gas indeed the negative charges of ho ions affected the production of hydroxyl radicals because of electrostatic attraction moreover the basicity reduced the reactivity of hydrogen peroxide with sodium hydroxide which was unstable in a basic medium 19 the main functional groups of modified fibers independently of plasma gas used in their functionalization were oh c o and cooh these surface functionalities have been associated to the adsorption of different pollutants from water 30 32 based on the intensity of ftir absorption bands the air saturated with hydrogen peroxide was more appropriate to modify the surface chemistry of palm fibers where the next trend was identified fah2o2 fah2o fanaoh the morphology of modified fiber samples is reported in fig 3 the fibrous aspect of this biomass was not significantly altered except when naoh was employed as a plasma gas alencar et al 7 have reported that the exposure of cellulose to a strong base such as sodium hydroxide altered its structure this result also corroborated that the plasma energy was not sufficient to break the non binding doublets on oxygen to form the hydroxyl radical this reaction required 5 ev which was higher than 2 ev to break the homolytic h oh bond or 1 5 ev to break the ho oh bond respectively for air saturated with water and hydrogen peroxide 19 27 a higher porosity and accentuated roughness were also observed for the samples treated with these two plasma gases these morphology changes could contribute to the pollutant adsorption with these modified palm fibers results of pcn quantification for raw and modified palm fibers are given in fig 4 pcn values were 4 6 4 2 3 3 and 3 5 for fibers fa fah2o fah2o2 and fanaoh respectively plasma treatment decreased the pcn value of raw palm fibers and this result could be explained by the acidifying effect of nitrous hno2 and nitric hno3 acids formed during the biomass functionalization in a strong alkaline environment it is possible that the collision between no and the superoxide radical ion o2 leads to the formation of peroxynitrite 19 33 13 o 2 no onoo if the solution ph is 7 10 nitrogen dioxide can react with the ho radical to form peroxynitrite acid 33 14 no 2 ho onooh k l mol s 4 5 10 9 peroxynitrite is a stable compound in an alkaline medium it is a weak acid pka 7 and its lifespan is of the order of a second at physiological ph 33 however peroxynitrite degrades by two competing processes at acidic ph either it quickly rearranges into nitrate 15 onooh h no 3 or it breaks down very quickly into no2 and ho 16 onooh no 2 ho 3 2 dfc adsorption on raw and plasma modified palm fibers 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent size and initial solution ph results of adsorption studies with different fiber sizes and different mass amount are presented in fig s2 of the supplementary material as expected the dcf removal decreased as the size of palm fibers increased thus the particle size in the range of 200 80 μm were the best and selected for further adsorption studies this result was consistent with literature where it has been reported that small particles showed a higher adsorption capacity due to increase of available surface area however it is convenient to remark that particle sizes 80 μm could generate an agglomeration phenomenon thus negatively impacting the adsorption 34 35 by varying the mass amount from 0 05 g to 0 40 g the results in fig s2 b show an increasing trend with the mass amount until an optimum of 0 25 g the decrease observed for higher adsorbent loading may be due to the deactivation by collision agglomeration and sedimentation of adsorbent hence the adequate adsorption amount retained is 0 25 g fig s3 shows that dcf removal decreased significantly with increments of solution ph for all raw and plasma modified palm fibers similar results were obtained by nakorn et al 36 for the adsorption of this pharmaceutical on silica based porous materials these results can be explained by the fact that the anionic form of dcf molecule was dominant in the solution at basic ph pka and the palm fiber surface was also negatively charged when ph pcn thus causing electrostatic repulsions that reduced the corresponding adsorption capacities at ph pcn the surface of these fibers was positively charged and there were electrostatic attractions with anionic dcf molecules at pka ph that contributed to the pharmaceutical adsorption for pka ph dcf was in its molecular form and if the fibers surface was positively charged i e ph pcn the adsorption of this pharmaceutical was due to hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces 37 consequently the acidic conditions favored the biomass dfc interactions thus explaining the adsorption capacities at ph 2 and 3 note that the fibers treated with different plasma gases showed better adsorption capacities than raw biomass this trend was associated to the carboxyl cooh and carbonyl co groups formed by the ho radicals in the plasma after oxidation of the alcohol functionalities at the biomass surface as confirmed by ftir results the carbonyl groups have intense dipole moments that can act as electron donors while the carboxylic functionalities of these adsorbents could interact via hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of diclofenac molecules overall these results showed that solution ph played a relevant role in the dcf adsorption with raw and plasma modified palm fibers 3 2 2 kinetics and isotherms of dcf adsorption on palm fibers fig 5 reports the dcf adsorption capacities with raw and plasma modified palm fibers at the best operating conditions rapid adsorption was observed for fah2o2 fibers which can be explained by the availability of a large number of active sites on the adsorbent surface in comparison with other fibers i e fa fah2o and fanaoh in general the saturation of the adsorption sites of all fibers occurred after 150 min of contact time when the adsorption capacities reached their maximum values especially at the highest dcf concentration maximum dcf removal in these kinetic experiments was 1 7 14 6 22 3 and 5 7 for fa fah2o fah2o2 and fanaoh fibers respectively parameters of tested kinetic models used in the correlation of dcf adsorption are given in table 2 and fig 6 illustrates the model performance for the kinetics obtained with the best fibers i e fah2o2 in general the model performance of kinetic equations was pseudo second order elovich pseudo first order statistical metrics showed that pseudo second order equation was the best and suitable to fit the dcf adsorption kinetics on fah2o2 fibers see table 2 r 2 adj values of the pseudo second order model ranged from 0 9920 to 0 9596 with sd values from 0 21 to 2 175 mg g times t ½ and t 0 95 were calculated to complement the description of dfc adsorption kinetics 38 pseudo second order kinetic model estimated t 1 2 and t 0 95 values of 22 66 and 189 18 min for a dfc initial concentration of 25 mg l and 13 32 and 88 69 min for a dcf initial concentration of 50 mg l respectively dcf adsorption isotherms on fah2o2 are reported in fig 7 and the adjusted parameters of four isotherm equations are given in table 3 experimental maximum adsorption capacities ranged from 33 12 to 24 71 mg g at 25 50 c which decreased with adsorption temperature thus indicating an exothermic dcf removal liu model provided the best description of experimental data with the lowest sd values 1 161 to 2 149 mg g and r 2 adj 1 0 for all adsorption temperatures see table 3 calculated thermodynamic parameters for dcf adsorption on fah2o2 fibers are presented in table 4 negative values of g confirmed that dcf adsorption was spontaneous 35 37 38 h was negative thus indicating the exothermic nature of dcf adsorption the positive values of δs confirmed the thermodynamic feasibility of this adsorption process statistical physics calculations were done to sketch the dcf adsorption orientation on the plasma modified fiber surface and complement the explanation of adsorption mechanism the next statistical physics model was used in these calculations 17 q e n s m 1 c 1 2 c e n where n is the number of dcf molecules adsorbed per functional group of modified palm fiber s m is the saturation adsorption density of fiber functional groups and c 1 2 is the concentration at half saturation respectively in general three scenarios could occur for the orientation of dcf molecules during the adsorption on the palm fiber surface 1 if n 0 5 the dcf molecules can be shared by two adsorbent sites at least thus reflecting a parallel orientation and the adsorption is a multi docking process 2 if n 1 the adsorbent functional groups can bind one or more dcf molecules suggesting that the adsorption is a mono or multi molecular process with an inclined adsorption orientation on the fiber surface 3 if 0 5 n 1 both parallel and inclined orientations are possible for the dcf adsorption on fiber surface statistical physics calculations showed that the parameter n varied from 1 96 to 4 45 for the dcf adsorption on fah2o2 fibers this result demonstrated that the functional groups of modified biomass adsorbed more than one dcf molecule at all operating temperatures and consequently an inclined adsorption orientation of dcf molecules occurred at different temperatures it is also important to indicate that the dcf molecules were also aggregated during the adsorption process n 1 3 2 3 mechanism of dcf adsorption recent studies on the adsorption of pharmaceuticals with different adsorbents including functionalized and raw biomasses have reported that the description of the adsorption mechanism may be complex due to several factors are involved 12 30 31 39 the physicochemical properties of adsorbates e g chemical structure functional groups hydrophobicity the process operating conditions e g ph concentration temperature and contact time and the both surface chemistry and textural parameters of the adsorbent used play an important role to characterize the adsorption interactions note that all these parameters are interconnected during the adsorption process for example the variation of medium ph influences both the pollutant and adsorbent surface as discussed in previous sections in the present study the results of removal tests and adsorbent characterization suggested that dfc adsorption depended mainly on the electrostatic attraction forces hydrogen bonding and the van der waals interactions the presence of these adsorption forces was in agreement with similar studies on the adsorption of pharmaceuticals by biomasses 12 39 indeed it is convenient to remark that the phenomenon of intra particle diffusion was negligible and the adsorption occurred mainly on the external adsorbent surface thus the polar functional groups identified at the external surface of adsorbent played a primary role in dcf adsorption these polar groups on the surface of modified palm fibers came from the plasma treatment which induced the formation of carbonyl co and carboxyl cooh groups as revealed by ftir analysis these functional groups have a strong dipole moment and can polarize the palm fiber surface as discussed the quantity of these surface functionalities depended on the plasma gas used in the biomass functionalization finally statistically physics calculations suggested a multilayer adsorption of dcf with an inclined orientation at tested temperatures dfc aggregation phenomenon that results from the molecular self assembly has been already reported on the literature 40 41 however this phenomenon can be thermodynamically regulated and depended on the dfc concentration 41 4 conclusions this study reports the application of glidarc plasma with different gases to modify the surface chemistry of oil palm fibers to increase their adsorption properties for the removal of diclofenac sodium from aqueous solutions as an alternative to solve the pharmaceutical pollution in wastewaters palm fibers modified with a plasma treatment using air saturated with hydrogen peroxide showed the best performance for the adsorption of this pharmaceutical molecule diclofenac adsorption was highly dependent on solution ph and exothermic with the palm fibers modified using plasma and air saturated with hydrogen peroxide pseudo second order and liu models were the best to describe the diclofenac adsorption data at tested operating conditions statistical physics calculations showed that diclofenac adsorption was a multi molecular process with an inclined adsorption orientation on the fiber surface where the molecular aggregation was present in summary this study describes an approach to enhance the value of an agricultural fiber for water pollution control at low cost declaration of competing interest the authors

13373,it is undeniable that water is as a scarce commodity besides being the most overlooked nutrient for life nevertheless the water situation is so challenging due to climate changes and population growth against this background reducing water vulnerability is necessary by ensuring its supplies and reducing global water pollution the blooming of nanotechnology and its expanding to a variety of sectors including water sector can have a positive impact by providing innovative solutions with enhanced efficiencies a class of new materials currently earning growing interest in the water sector due to their countless features is the bionanocomposites bncs based biopolymers bncs have shown efficiencies in removing organic and inorganic contaminants as well as heavy metals and microorganisms from polluted effluents with more privileges as easier recovery from aqueous medium better life cycles and improved treatment durations on that account this paper furnishes an in depth review of bionanocomposites application in water treatment also it sheds a light on the strategies for different contaminants removal with respect to bringing out how bncs are convenient as highly efficient water treatment agents with reduced costs and improved efficiencies keywords biopolymers bionanocomposites nano fillers wastewater treatment 1 introduction in the recent past there has been a propensity to hear the notion bionanocomposites in research fields they appear as a new emerging group of nano structured bio hybrid materials involving a biopolymer naturally occurring polymer in combination with reinforcements showing at least one dimension on the nanometer scale these new materials have the peculiarity to encounter improved physical structural and functional properties due to the synergetic gathering of inherent properties of biopolymers with the assets of nano reinforcements this wise combination approach makes it possible to trim dawn or at least reduce the several hazardous risks and potential harms linked to the nanoparticles and this by creating new flexible and lightweight bionanocomposites of larger size than the nanoparticles they involve 1 this new material family is still defined loosely the number of publications dedicated to the combination of biopolymers and nano sized fillers has acutely increased in which they have been else ways denoted by green composites bio hybrids bio composites nano biocomposites etc the bionanocomposite designation seems to be the most suitable because it recognizes them from the well known nanocomposites as well as recalling the biological polymer origin bionanocomposites are the fruit of a combined effort on behalf of a variety of sciences like chemistry nanotechnology biology and materials engineering to give birth to green and environmentally friendly materials these latter materials can replace the conventional ones within the framework of promotion of research that diminishes the environmental damage and establish a forward looking process that is innocuous to the environment 1 2 the limitations of nanocomposites have paved the way for some significant progress to be made and this by creating bionanocomposites these latter are known to have recourse to biopolymers fig 1 overflowing natural cheap resources that are endowed with countless assets like non toxicity affordable cost over synthetic polymers and biocompatibility besides being made up from renewable resources which accelerate their biodegradation 3 4 considering the limitations of employing these green polymers alone due to their unsuitable properties viz low physical chemical and mechanical resistance low heat degradation temperature and high gas and water absorbance the addition of reinforcements to the biopolymeric matrix is being recommended 5 more than that and under their nanoscale the nanofillers are only required with a low dispersed content to have high mechanical properties which makes a totally filling and incorporation pointless fig 2 displayed the main three nano fillers used as reinforcement for bionanocomposites 6 in the light of this and considering the affinity and compatibility of the different elements involving in the synthesis new bionanocomposites with superior mechanical thermal and chemical features are obtained 7 8 any physical mixture of a biopolymer and nano reinforcements does not essentially lead to a bionanocomposite with improved properties for this the affinity between the matrix and the nanofiller is strongly required because in the case of immiscibility or minimal physical attraction between the two elements bionanocomposites with inferior mechanical properties may appear based on the aforementioned features the bionanocomposites are highly qualified to be adapted as a tool for water decontamination especially in high pressure environments 9 10 due to their compactness outstanding mechanical properties and regeneration potential over and above that they are well endowed with high surface area and adsorption catalysts capacities broadly speaking the conventional wastewater treatment process is a succession of three main steps as seen in fig 3 primary secondary and tertiary treatments which include physical biological and chemical techniques yet the sophisticated monitoring systems high capital operational costs and the high energy consumption of these conventional processes have led many researchers to look for improved methods and materials for handling wastewater decontamination without harming the environment or excessively wasting energy in this context this review reports the recent applications of bionanocomposites in the environmental remediation and water research sector the application of these new bio hybrid materials has been widely studied in the wastewater sector for toxic pollutants removal including organic inorganic and microbial pollutants 2 bionanocomposites applications in water decontamination wastewater pollutants could be split into three broad categories organic pollutants dyes phenols bod cod toc inorganic pollutants heavy metals phosphates nitrates nitrites oils and microorganisms viruses fig 4 11 in this section a survey of the most recent achievements of bionanocomposites in terms of wastewater treatment will be investigated 2 1 inorganic pollutants removal 2 1 1 heavy metal removal it is an indisputable fact that the presence of heavy metals even in trace amounts in the environment jeopardizes the fauna flora animals and human life due to their tendency to accumulate in biological systems 12 sources of heavy metals diversify and the chemical industrial sectors are the main driver of their production and pollution the conventional processes of heavy metals removal involve biological physical and chemical techniques several established conventional processes in terms of heavy metals uptake from aqueous mediums exist and vary from biological chemical to physical techniques elimination of heavy metal ions by coagulation flocculation or expensive membrane filtration techniques has shown good removal efficiencies nonetheless they lead to the formation of large particles and concentrated sludge other tools like electrochemical treatment and oxidations are rapid and practical for some metal s removal yet they are largely energy intensive also biological treatments have been proven to lack effectiveness 13 possible heavy metal removal mechanisms are diverse and include ion exchange electrostatic interaction surface complexation and physical adsorption as outlined in fig 5 new green and cost competitive route to handle heavy metals pollution was paved by bionanocomposite utilization the high specific area along with numerous surface functional groups makes them very convenient for metal binding by adsorption without any unsafe by products engendering numerous studies have been reported on the heavy metal s adsorption on bionanocomposites including hg cd pb cr ni as cr the hg uptake from simulated wastewater using a bionanocomposite based on chitosan which is rich in amino and hydroxyl functional groups and embedded with leaf extract of brassica with a maximum adsorption capacity of 50 mg g for 45 min at 60 c was studied by kumar et al 14 the cadmium ions removal was also satisfactorily investigated by padilla ortega et al 15 using bionanocomposite in the form of macro porous foams based on chitosan intercalated into vermiculite interlayers the study has revealed three times higher adsorption capacities of the bionanocomposite over those of the components taken separately for the same purpose methionine modified bentonite alginate was also elaborated by ahmad et al 16 the detailed study has come up with an adsorption capacity of the order of 217 39 mg g at 303 k with the possibility of bionanocomposites regeneration up to five cycles consecutively lead pb is also a cancer causing element that researchers have worked for its elimination from wastewater well aware of the jeopardizing situation mirza et al 17 have developed an effective bionanocomposite based on xanthan gum and montmorillonite for pb uptake from industrial and synthetic wastewater with an adsorption capacity of the order of 187 mg g within 240 min more than that the bionanocomposite reusability was confirmed with a regeneration up to five succeeding cycles in another unbeaten try rais ahmed et al 18 have developed another outstanding bionanocomposite based on au mica alginate with exceptional pb adsorption capacities up to 2000 mg g the same authors have tried effectively another bionanocomposite based on guar gum bentonite for the same pb removal purpose 19 but in this case from different real wastewater sources like battery manufacturing medical wastewater and electroplating industries it is also worth noting that pb adsorption was not particularly electrostatic attraction but other mechanisms were involved like ion exchange the bionanocomposite has as well displayed regenerative ability up to the fifth cycle halloysite alginate bionanocomposites beads were the idea of chiew et al 20 for the uptake of pb2 from aqueous solutions through a synergism between alginate carboxylate groups and ion exchange route they have reached an adsorption capacity upwards of 325 mg g which is approximately four times greater than the capacity of halloysite nanotubes alone 84 mg g simultaneously chromium removal has also been broadly studied combining the hydrophilicity of an organic poly cation with the adsorption features of an inorganic poly anion by creating an organic inorganic hybrid of chitosan and cloisite nanoclay was the idea of pandey et al 21 the results have confirmed a significantly high cr vi adsorption capacity 357 14 mg g of the prepared hybrid bionanocomposite always with chitosan as the matrix bhatt et al 22 have embedded the biopolymer with nano zirconium phosphate to give birth to a unique organic inorganic bionanocomposite used as a hexavalent chromium effective adsorbent with a maximum of 311 53 mg g besides being a catalyst for other oxidative degradation reactions another green bionanocomposite for the sake of toxic chromium removal was recently shaped up by dinari et al 23 based on magnetic fe3o4 and nickel aluminum layered double hydroxide with guar gum as polymer the high chromium adsorption capacity of 101 mg g within a short time of 30 min was found bionanocomposite adsorbents and their use in heavy metals removal have been reviewed in table 1 2 1 2 nitrogen and phosphate removal nitrogen and phosphate based compounds are possibly the most widespread contaminants in drinking and wastewater these ions are released into the environment from various sources such as chemical fertilizers farmland discharges etc and are responsible for the eutrophication through which it consumes the dissolved oxygen inducing the death of aquatic life furthermore at excessive levels they present a direct threat to human beings by causing diseases and cancers 29 30 biological denitrification and physicochemical processes are the two commonly conventional methods used for nitrate removal which requires high operational energy and operation time besides being expensive and imposes post treatment for the nitrite nitrate and ammonia residual wastes 31 32 due to their eco friendly nature bionanocomposites were highly investigated for nitrate and nitrite removal from contaminated water an ultra thin 2d ag tio2 al2o3 cs bionanocomposite for photocatalytic nitrate removal via a facile method by zarei et al 33 thanks to the synergetic effect of ag doping tio2 nanoparticles coupled to al2o3 and incorporated into the chitosan biopolymer the bionanocomposite has shown an extra fast and high nitrate removal 74 in 5 min reaction time in alkaline conditions ph 11 excluding any nitrite production as a by product modified chitosan was also adopted by jiang et al 34 who have elaborated a bionanocomposite with an ability to adsorb both nitrate and phosphate from water for enhancing chitosan properties zirconia has been used as inert chemical metal oxide to upgrade the biocompatibility physical strength and resistance of the bionanocomposite while the magnetic nanoparticles inclusion aim to quicken the adsorbent separation after the nutriments removal with a surface area of 212 9 m2 g the bionanocomposite maximal adsorption capacities of nitrate and phosphate were found to be 89 3 mg g and 26 5 mg p g respectively for the same purpose magnetic amine crosslinked biopolymer based corn stalk mab cs was investigated by song et al 35 this study has revealed the tremendous potential of this bionanocomposite for effective removal of nitrate with an adsorption capacity of 102 04 mg g nitrate removal was achieved through different adsorption mechanisms including ion exchange surface complex formation and electrostatic attractions on top of that the bionanocomposite magnetization property indicated its easier separation and collect from aqueous medium by an external magnet in less than 10 s alongside biopolymers zeolites have been recently used as low cost effective supports for nano scale particles for water treatment new bionanocomposite based on natural clinoptilolite zeolite as support for nano zero valent iron partly coated with zero valent copper was elaborated by fateminia et al 36 the reason behind using nano zero valent metals relies on their high stability against oxidation especially in very low dissolved oxygen conditions like in groundwater less than 9 g l where nitrates are one of the main toxic contaminants while the zero cu coating aimed to enhance the bionanocomposite reactivity together with keeping a minimum of released ammonium cation into the solution unfavorably higher nitrite production was found for the cu modified zeolite fe ni bimetallic nanoparticles incorporated within the inner pores as well as on the outer zeolite surface bionanocomposite z fe ni was prepared for simultaneous reduction of nitrate and removal of phosphate by he et al 37 the ions removal was found to involve different mechanisms especially co precipitation complexation and reduction results have revealed that zeolites had an important dispersal effect all over the surface which have promoted the reactivity of the fe ni nanoparticles and enhance their reduction performance compared to non supported nanoparticles in a different attempt fe ni nanoparticles supported on biochar bc fe ni were established for nitrate decontamination by li et al 38 again supported bi metallic nanoparticles have exhibited advantages over neat nanoparticles relating to nitrate degradation efficiency of the order of 99 5 they produced secondary ammonia uptake from the aqueous medium to avoid nickel and iron release within the framework of biomass supported adsorbent preparation as an economic and effective method for enhanced removal of ions qiu et al 39 have come with an innovative bionanocomposite ws n la based on nano sized la iii hydroxides anchored within a quaternary aminated wheat straw ws n ws n la have revealed a higher preferable phosphate adsorption capacity over a wide ph range without any sort of la iii leaching the bionanocomposite has proven excellent stability over ten adsorption desorption cycles 2 1 3 rare earth elements rees removal contrary to what one might think from their names rare earth elements are not that rare these natural elements are widespread in the earth s crust and are generally found agglomerated in certain types of rocks and minerals rees consist of 17 elements scandium yttrium and 15 lanthanides lanthanum cerium praseodymium neodymium promethium samarium europium gadolinium terbium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium and lutecium there has been an increasing demand for rees extraction and separation due to their strategic potentials in different fields as catalysts magnetics metallurgy rechargeable batteries and superconductors 40 bionanocomposites have confirmed their suitability again for applications involving rees elements extractions and separation a new bionanocomposite made of gum arabic ga grafted polyacrylamide based silica nanocomposite ga g pam sio2 was developed by iftekhar 41 the bionanocomposite synthesis was based on an in situ radial graft copolymerization approach for the recovery of four ree ions from aqueous solutions especially europium eu lanthanum la neodymium nd and scandium sc investigation revealed that the adsorption mechanism using this bionanocomposite was endothermic spontaneous physisorption that fitted well with the langmuir model the

bionanocomposite adsorbent based on cellulose and zn al layered double hydroxide ldh for the uptake of ytterbium lanthanum and cerium was elaborated by iftekhar et al 42 cellulose was intercalated in the ldh to give birth to a hybrid bionanocomposite with capacities of rapid uptake of the rees ions it showed good adsorption capacities and selectivity for y3 la3 and ce3 with capacities of 102 25 92 51 and 96 25 mg g respectively along with high adsorption capacities this bionanocomposite possesses good reusability for up to five cycles similarly iftekhar et al 43 have opted for layered double

take advantage of the leftover ree doped zr xg za after five adsorption cycles the bionanocomposite was further used as a photocatalyst for tetracycline degradation fig 6 magnetic bionanocomposites were also investigated by many researchers as part of attempts to recover rre elements from aqueous media a magnetic bionanocomposite namely p cdp fe3o4 based on cross linked β cyclodextrin biopolymer and fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles was made by nkinahamira et al 44 the high surface area and porosity of these bionanocomposites have allowed the equilibrium reaching within less than 10 min with

rees in the presence of other competitive ions and regeneration for at least five cycles in the same vein javadian et al 45 have elaborated an environmentally magnetic bionanocomposite in a gelation process of carboxymethyl chitosan sodium alginate and ni0 2zn0 2fe2 6o4 synthesized magnetic nanoparticles the adsorption experiments have revealed high uptake efficiency of 97 75 96 83 and 97 85 for nd 3 tb 3 and dy 3 respectively 2 1 4 oils removal and separation oils are another sort of recalcitrant wastewater pollutant free or floating oils come in different textures lubricants grease fats heavy and light hydrocarbons oily emulsions discharged to the environment are stable liquid liquid systems that are responsible for impeding sunlight penetration and oxygen absorption by water bodies thus causing biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod exacerbation and damaging the natural environment in the absence of adequate separation techniques 46 besides the well known membrane technology for removing oils the bionanocomposites development as new alternatives to draw oils from water has been a research focus lately bionanocomposite aerogels were proven outstanding absorbents for oil water separation by dint of their high porosity and lightweight a tolerant robust superoleophobic aerogel based on tio2 nanoparticles reduced graphene oxide rgo and alginate was reported by zhuang et al 47 tio2 rgo alginate trga synthesis was a non toxic cheap ionic cross linking route followed by freeze drying to produce aerogel the bionanocomposite combined several functionalities potent oil water separation of 99 96 that could be maintained even after 120 cycles self cleaning aptitude and excellent recyclability another 3d porous aerogel for oil water separation based on tio2 nanoparticles and sodium alginate was reported by dai et al 48 the surface hydrophilicity together with microstructure porosity and roughness have insured the aerogel with an oil water separation capability of 99 7 note worthier reusability and antifouling ability moreover titania nanoparticles provide the aerogel with good photocatalytic activity there has been a myriad of studies dealing with the bio sorbents association with magnetic nanoparticles owing to their magnetic properties in fact the magnetic behavior of this kind of material makes them easily recoverable from aqueous mediums in preference to conventional separation techniques as centrifugation and filtration typically oil spills tend to float on the water surface for a certain time based on these floating characteristics bionanocomposite adsorbents dedicated to this kind of handling ought to be low dense easily recoverable and unsinkable in order to fully exchange with floating oils and achieve maximum oil removal as seen in fig 7 magnetic bionanocomposites are the best candidates a ferromagnetic bionanocomposite yb mnp via a co precipitation method for oil spill cleanup based on magnetic nanoparticles mnps and yeast biomass was elaborated by debs et al 49 petroleum p28api mixed used motor oil mumo and new motor oil nmo were the three oils tested on the bionanocomposite results showed that around 69 of the oil was removed using the bionanocomposite and easily recovered owing to its superparamagnetic behavior another bionanocomposite based on alkyd resin cured with toluene diisocyanate and in situ incorporated with magnetic nanoparticles γ fe2o3 was prepared by de souza et al 50 for oil spill cleaning based on its well proven design of double aromatic aliphatic nature and magnetic nanoparticles incorporation the new bionanocomposite has two useful features good affinity between oil and the composite and easy magnetic recovery chitosan grafted magnetic nanoparticles cs mnps bionanocomposite was elaborated by lü et al 51 to assess its demulsification performances after the solvothermal synthesis of fe3o4 mnps a surface coating with amino propyl functionalized silica apfs and aldehyde functionalization with glutaraldehyde was executed via a schiff base reaction for further grafting of cs molecular chains the suitability of this bionanocomposite for treating emulsified oil wastewaters relies on its potent magnetic properties and its demulsification efficiency under neutral acidic and alkaline conditions via electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions on top of that cs mnps bionanocomposite may well be reused up to 7 cycles without significant loss in demulsification performances another bionanocomposite that is also decorated with iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 for a rapid water oil separation was made by yap et al 52 based on alginate and reduced graphene the magnetic bionanocomposite takes the form of foam which is a highly porous texture allowing the water to continuously circulation and the pollutants catching due to its unique combination of mixed hydrophobic hydrophilic nature the bionanocomposite has shown high considerable oil absorption of the order of 13 18 g g over a very short span of time 30 s polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane is a trademark known and recognized as a polymeric hydrophobic membrane due to its outstanding properties to properly address pvdf membrane limitations as fouling due to the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions there has been a coating trend of the membrane with bionanocomposites the pvdf bionanocomposite membranes are endowed with an underwater superoleophobic top surface and a hydrophobic substrate this hydrophilic oleophobic structure creates various synergetic effects which enhances the efficiency of oil removal by preventing their adhesion on the membrane surface as elucidated in fig 8 indeed the hydrophilic surface of the modified pvdf membrane can react effectively with water to yield a hydration layer responsible for foulant rejection 53 a modified pvdf membrane with chitosan silica nanoparticles for the sake of an ultra low oil adhesion underwater superoleophobicity and super hydrophilicity was reported by liu et al 53 the membrane coating has led to an outstanding water oil separation capability 99 0 chitosan and silica coated pvdf was also investigated by ardeshiri et al 54 via a one step coating route to prepare an oleophobic hydrophilic bionanocomposite coated on the pvdf membrane surface for the separation assessments water gasoline emulsions were tested using a pressure process the results have revealed higher flux permeate and 99 total oil rejection of modified membrane over unmodified membrane because of the hydrophilic layer coating 2 2 organic pollutants 2 2 1 dye s removal dyes are colored chemical substances that are extensively used in textile industries for fiber coloration the removal of dyes from discharged textile wastewater is considered a real struggle owing to their high water solubility high stability to light and intense coloration even in low concentration 55 over and above that dyes are extremely poisonous and even carcinogenic to microbial populations and human beings besides being resistant to aerobic digestion and not biologically degradable 56 since dyes are considered as the model molecules regularly studied in the scientific literature to evaluate adsorption and pollutants elimination efficiencies of materials several studies have been reported in terms of using bionanocomposites for dye removal due to their wide adaptability high adsorption capacities and ease of operation a bionanocomposite based on chitosan alginate impregnated with magnetic zeolite in the form of beads was developed by kazemi et al 57 for effective uptake of cationic dye the combination of anionic cationic polysaccharides zeolite and magnetic nanoparticles would help to improve the system in terms of dyes removal moreover a magnetic separation and regeneration aptitude of up to 4 cycles was thereby assured generally adsorbents exhibited a large decline in dye removal efficiency in changed ph solutions and especially in alkaline solutions effective adsorbents over a wide ph range are seldom found and studied to tackle this issue an environment friendly bionanocomposite based on fe iii cross linked poly vinyl alcohol and chitin nanofibers was developed by ghourbanpour et al 58 with a high maximum adsorption capacity of 810 4 mg g for methyl orange mo that can be maintained almost constant up to five cycles not only that the prepared bionanocomposites can efficiently adsorb mo dye under both alkaline and acidic conditions by dint of electrostatic interactions between chitin nanofibers and the adsorbate coupled with the chelation between fe iii and methyl orange sulfonic groups for the same purpose dye removal by means of bionanocomposites another approach reached from surface engineering microorganisms was developed by fan et al 59 fe3o4 mil 100 core shell bionanocomposite was found more effective for ao10 dye removal against adsorbent alone or free microorganisms owing to the combination of biodegradation and physical adsorption hence this strategy puts on view a great potential for dye treatment from industrial effluents in the same biocatalytic degradation vein mahmoodi et al 60 have developed a bionanocomposite for direct red 23 removal based on nano zeolite and nanocarbon tubes where a well ordered enzyme immobilization was done to provide a high specific area in attempt to get efficient biodegradation effectively enzyme immobilization to carbon nanotube solid matrix had a positive effect on the stability and on bound peptides lifetime increasing compared to their native forms reinforcing water soluble biopolymer with clay nanofillers is an interesting approach to fully exploit them as multifunctional adsorbent of pollutants in an aqueous medium ahmad et al 19 have modified guar gum with nanofiller clay bentonite to give raise to an eco friendly effective bionanocmposite for crystal violet removal from water similarly clay was associated with cellulose to produce clay cellulose bionanocomposite for an efficient drimarine yellow dy removal 61 likewise bée et al 62 have entrapped clay and maghemite nanoparticles into cross linked chitosan beads for the elaboration of a bionanocomposite multifunctional adsorbent for the uptake of dyes either cationic as mb or anionic as mo separately or together the beads have shown a high adsorption capacity on an extended ph range due to the clay encapsulation jointly mahdavinia et al 63 have introduced montmorillonite nanoclay into carrageenan based hydrogels for the crystal violet dye uptake it was revealed that by increasing the clay content up to 14 wt of clay the removal speed increases tio2 is the most widely used nanomaterial that has been used in several fields such as photocatalysis energy conversion and storage and cosmetics 5 64 etc tio2 based bionanocomposites for a combined effect of adsorption and photocatalysis under uv irradiations for dyes removal have been demonstrated to be competitive embedding tio2 nps into sesame protein isolate films for mb removal was the idea of fathi et al 65 the films displayed great dye photodegradation potential besides a good o2 scavenging activity immobilizing tio2 nanoparticles into gum tragacanth biopolymer to form photocatalyst hydrogels has been revealed to be a suitable material for dye removal the hybrid bionanocomposite used as photocatalyst surpassed and outperformed the neat biopolymer used as adsorbent by achieving 87 of mb removal efficiency versus 69 66 chitosan was also embedded with tio2 nanoparticles for adsorptional photodegradation of anthraquinone and azo dyes it has been found that the hydrogels still be able to effectively remove dyes even after three cycles with no sufficient efficiency decline 67 in another attempt with chitosan it has been combined with poly n isopropyl acrylamide to be embedded later with tio2 nanoparticles for the elaboration of a hybrid bionanocomposite for the removal of ionic dye 68 tio2 nanoparticles have been also physically encapsulated into a porous mixed matrix composed of polyvinyl alcohol pva and iota carrageenan crg biopolymers by a freezing thawing technique for the same purpose oxidative decomposition of methyl orange dye 69 alginate biopolymer was also subject to tio2 nanoparticles encapsulation for an effective mb removal by adsorption photocatalysis through hybrid organic inorganic bionanocomposite beads composed of carbon dots c dots magnesium fluorohydroxyapatite fa multi walled carbon nanotubes cnts 70 for economical reasons attempts have been made to modify tio2 nanoparticles to have an expanded responsive wavelength range in the visible region thus benefiting from the high titanium dioxide photocatalytic activity under visible light or sunlight without the need of uv irradiations in this vein bionanocomposite based on iron modified tio2 and encapsulated into alginate was made for mb removal 71 72 urea modified tio2 nanoparticles were also encapsulated into chitosan films for an effective malachite green photo bleaching activity under visible light 73 in like manner liu et al 74 have prepared a bionanocomposite based on natural xylan as the template for the immobilization of tio2 nanoparticles and pva as the crosslinking agent for the photodegradation of astrazon brilliant red 4g and ethyl violet and dyes under visible light irradiation 2 2 2 phenolic compound removal phenol hydroxy benzene and its derivatives are regarded as a class of highly toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutants 75 these compounds are generally discharged into the environment after being previously employed as starting materials in multiple chemical industries or from water chlorination in wastewaters plant or from agricultural resources their hazardousness relies on their high solubility in water various organic solvents and oils besides being carcinogenic mutagenic and low biodegradable 76 in consideration of that wastewaters involving phenolic compounds ought to be judiciously treated to avoid their liberation into the environment several methods for phenolic compounds uptake exist namely adsorption membrane extraction ozonation biological processes electrochemical methods and liquid liquid extraction by means of organic solvents 77 that being the case phenol and its derivatives have been often used as hazardous pollutants models in wastewater treatment which confirms their importance in the environmental researches field there is considerable available data on phenol removal with respect to water decontamination by means of bionanocomposites again these types of hybrid materials have shown great effectiveness even when treating recalcitrant toxic pollutants crosslinking chitosan films with epichlorohydrin cs ech and grafting tio2 nanoparticles into it was developed by jawad et al 78 for the photodegradation of phenol in fact the author has adopted the crosslinking avenue to make the bionanocomposite stable in an acidic medium and to reinforce its mechanical resistance another research based on chitosan as biopolymer was conducted by bonardd et al 79 who choose gold nanoparticles as reinforcement content the use of this golden bionanocomposite as a heterogeneous catalyst has demonstrated a significant catalytic performance for the reduction of p nitrophenol 4 np to p aminophenol 4 ap the increase of golden reinforcements has been found to lead to an increase in the catalytic activity of the bionanocomposite a new green approach for the metal bionanocmposite processing was developed by narayanan et al 80 who have designed a silver bionanocomposite as a heterogeneous catalyst using the fungus cylindrocladium floridanum the approach consisted of coating the fungal mycelia silver nanoparticles onto the surface of glass bead surface where the biological entities play an important role in catalyzing the reduction of toxic p nitrophenol 4 np to p aminophenol 4 ap for the same purpose mohammed et al 81 have opted for the preparation of biopolymer rare earth oxides bionanocomposites it is about the preparation of cerium oxide ceo2 nanoparticles loaded trimethyl chitosan bionanocomposite for the sake of an effective phenol adsorption and its chloro derivatives 2 chlorophenol and 4 chlorophenol the combination of the biopolymer and the rare earth oxide has generated a true synergy leading to the enhancement of the antioxidative and antibacterial capacity of the bionanocomposite along with boosting its adsorption capacity this latter has followed the order of 4 chlorophenol 2 chorophenol phenol along with achieving adsorption or photodecomposition of phenol and its derivatives what the researchers also aim for is the sustainability of the materials their improved properties for a longer shelf life and their easier recovery after treatment dinari et al 82 have gone for a green method to make a simple recoverable bionanocomposite based on magnetite ag layered double hydroxide starch for 4 nitrophenol and 2 nitrophenol quick reduction to aminophenols the elaborated bionanocomposite has shown improved thermal stability and a maintaining effectiveness up to the fifth cycle of reusing it with phenolic compounds removal of the order of 90 while yun et al 83 have prepared a bionanocomposite film based on three essential components mungbean starch pva and zns nanoparticles adopting the curing casting method together with the good bisphenol photodegradation the authors have set up priorities on improving specific properties as thermal mechanical optical and water barrier of the matrix via inorganic nanoparticle adding 2 2 3 cod bod and toc removal organic matter covers a broad spectrum of organic compounds over 40 million which made their identification difficult costly and time consuming as an effective alternative for their classification in wastewater analysis three popular parameters are chosen as indicators of organic pollution cod chemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand and toc total organic carbon 84 cod or chemical oxygen demand of a water sample is defined as the needed oxygen amount for the oxidation of its oxidizable compounds whereas bod of water is an approximate measure of the biochemically degradable organic matter amount present in a water sample it is determined by the required oxygen amount for the aerobic micro organisms present in the sample to oxidize the organic matter to a stable inorganic form total organic carbon toc is another sort of organic matter that can be a useful indication of the pollution degree the toc determination is so important because it reflects the organic character of the water sample the higher the carbon amount the more microorganisms grow and thusly the more oxygen consumption in other words the higher the cod bod or toc values of water the greater is its contamination 85 86 as anticipated bionanocomposites as usual were widely used for organic matter removal in terms of cod bod and toc from contaminated water since a complete discoloration of a dye solution does not necessarily mean its total degradation researchers tend to carry out the monitoring of colored water discoloration by the analysis and measurement of cod bod or toc to highlight the efficiency of the used material to not only eliminate the coloration but also to mineralize the pollutants simultaneously 87 a green and low cost bionanocomposite based on guar gum and silver nanoparticles for catalytic degradation of three dyes rh6g rb2 and rr141 and their binary mixture was made by vanamudan et al 88 the impact of these organic pollutants on water quality in this work was expressed in terms of the total organic carbon toc high toc reductions of the three dyes were found ranging from 60 to 77 in single component systems and from 21 to 62 in the case of binary systems and yet due to the formation of colorless by products the toc reduction was found to be inferior to total decolorization an innovative bionanocomposite based on alginate biopolymer reinforced with bentonite clay and surface impregnated with tio2 nanoparticles was developed by chkirida et al 87 for cationic dye degradation in addition to developing this new integrated adsorbent photocatalyst another distinguishing feature of this study is the approach of tio2 nanoparticles fixation on the surface of bentonite alginate by a facile non thermal impregnation technique for direct contact between the photocatalyst and the irradiation source without hindering the incidence of irradiation light to the photocatalyst due to the highly synergetic adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of this bionanocomposite a discoloration rate of the order of 98 together with excellent cod abatement of 93 was achieved these results confirmed the destruction of dyes chromophore groups and not only its adsorption similar to the above study vanamudan et al 89 have proposed to add chitosan to silver nanoparticles and guar gum for catalytic degradation and reduction of dyes and nitrophenol the blending concept aimed to enhance both physical and chemical functionalities of used biopolymers and promote their adsorption efficiencies the mineralization of the dye s organic carbon was checked through toc analysis as was expected higher toc reductions were found using the blend bionanocomposite ranging from 53 to 84 analogously chitosan and silver nanoparticles seemed to have a highly promising potential for water drainage treatment 90 the elaborated bionanocomposite showed high cod and bod removal of 80 and 89 respectively another study found that bionanocomposite based on the chitosan binding to zinc oxide nanoparticles has yielded good results in terms of high cod removal up to 97 of milk industry wastewater 91 thanks to the chitosan amino groups that can act as chelation sites for enhanced cod removal for wastewater decontamination mostafa et al 92 went for merging nanotechnology and membrane technology by designing a new bionanocomposite consisted of entrapping nano zero valent iron into cellulose acetate membrane this combination has led to the creation of a reactive membrane via the phase inversion technique with improved mechanical properties high surface area significant resistance to direct fire and high organic matter removal of 80 for cod and 73 for bod bionanocomposites are not limited to wastewater treatment but also lake decontamination the study investigated by prisa et al 93 is the best illustration using a hydrogel bionanocomposite based on gluten pectin and magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 for lake sediments removal 50 of toc 60 of cod and 80 of bod removal were achieved thusly the lake pollution was considerably reduced owing to the good physical interactions and synergetic effect of the bionanocomposite components 2 3 pathogenic micro organisms inactivation water pollution comes in many guises from organic and inorganic pollution to microbiological contamination the latter is generated by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and parasites microorganism s presence in water is responsible for a lot of infectious diseases which befall the human body no less dangerous is the tendency to control the disinfection of these microorganisms by chlorination which induces carcinogenic byproducts recognized as being harmful to human health 94 95 bionanocomposites have opened a chance for the employment and adoption of novel eco friendly and high performing materials for antibacterial applications making them replace the conventional techniques novel bionanocomposite based on polyaniline cellulose and nickel nanoparticles pani c ni by a chemical oxidative polymerization was elaborated by ahmad et al 96 the bionanocomposite was drawn up to maintain the growth of two pathogenic fungal strains alternaria alternata and rhizoctonia solani nickel nanoparticles incorporation into the pani c chains improves notably its fungicidal properties indeed pani c ni bionanocomposite have unveiled greater fungal growth inhibition 50 and 42 over pan c biocomposite for a alternate and r solani respectively apart from its antibacterial activity the bionanocomposite concentration is another overriding factor the study carried out by nehra et al 97 has stressed this point by using a minimum concentration of 5 μg ml against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli the bionanocomposite have revealed a potent antibacterial activity the synthesis approach consisted of incorporating alzr metal oxide nanoparticles into humic acid biopolymer by a deep freeze drying process in a similar vein nazarzadehzare et al 98 have developed super magnetic bionanocomposites with good antibacterial and antifungal activities via an in situ coprecipitations followed by emulsion polymerization candida albicans staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis were the four pathogenic species investigated using the multilayered bionanocomposite pacp fe3o4 aa based on alginic acid poly aniline co pyrrole and fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles the good antibacterial and antifungal finding activities are due to the simultaneous presence of the copolymer and the magnetic nanoparticles in the bionanocomposite backbone there is a widespread mention of chitosan in the literature due to its well known antibacterial properties these latter are attributable mainly to the interaction of positively charged amino groups of glucosamine with microbial cell membranes which are negatively charged engendering the proteinaceous and other intracellular constituents of the microorganisms outflow 99 nanometer thick titania chitosan ag np bionanocomposite film was elaborated by xiao et al 100 the synthesis process consisted of coating a uniform titania chitosan ultrathin biocomposite on cellulose microfibril using a layer by layer self assembly technique the bionanocomposite antibacterial activities have been assessed against gram negative escherichia coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus bacteria relying on the synergetic effect of cellulose chitosan titania and silver nanoparticles it was enunciated that almost all the inoculated bacteria were disinfected using the bionanocomposite with increasing antibacterial activities in the order of cellulose tio2 n cellulose tio2 chi n and cellulose tio2 chi n ag np again chitosan was used for the surface coating of metallic silver nanoparticles to generate a bionanocomposite with high antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli the green one pot and facile synthesis route is another asset of this bionanocomposite that has proven to be able to maintain its antibacterial activity up to 12 h 101 even moderate or relatively low antibacterial activities are noteworthy this was the case for chitosan encapsulated manganese oxide bionanocomposite that was elaborated by anwar et al 24 via a chemical precipitation route its antibacterial activity was evaluated against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli 3 bionanocomposites regeneration the regeneration and reuse aspect of sorbent materials are a sine qua non criteria for their economic feasibility and practical application in the wastewater sector regeneration allowed a longer period of use and it is by far the main source of value of an adsorbent or a catalyst cost reduction is the flip side of materials regeneration the regeneration depicts adsorbed pollutants removal from adsorbent materials for subsequent reuse as well as restoring its primary adsorption properties using feasible technically and economically methods in some cases it is necessary to recover the pollutant from the adsorbent especially in the case of heavy metals or rare earth elements that possess high market prices and several industrial applications regeneration allows a simulation of adsorption efficiency of used and exhausted adsorbents which is indispensable in water treatment sector to have a more accurate idea about their shelf life literature survey suggests a broad panoply of adsorbent regeneration techniques and tools many of which are already being applied efficiently and have notably helped to retain the adsorption capacity of adsorbents as an illustration thermal 102 and biological degradation 103 electrochemical treatment 104 extraction in supercritical conditions 105 oxidation 106 and ultrasound regeneration 107 due to their biopolymer matrix bionanocomposites can t undergo with a few notable exceptions similar regeneration treatments under extreme conditions oftentimes pollutant desorption from bionanocomposites is based on chemical methods this latter holds many advantages over the above mentioned techniques it is a less energy intensive process endowed with rapidity and high adsorbate recovery without damaging the adsorbent chemical regeneration is based on solvent washing with selected eluents or desorption agents a neutral optimal sorption ph of a bionanocomposite adsorbent requires an acidic desorption eluent and reciprocally bounded pollutants in acidic conditions claim alkaline eluents through this review the summary of research has demonstrated that regeneration of bionanocomposites using desorbing eluents has notably extended the material s life cycle and has ensured that it works and removes perfectly the pollutants over repeated sessions acidic eluents the most used hcl or hno3 provide high concentration of hydronium ions h3o which reduce the adsorbate attraction towards the adsorbent active groups and allow desorption utilizing ion exchange mechanisms 108 while basic eluents such as naoh can also present good regeneration performance due to their ability to lower the adsorbent adsorbate bonding in alkaline medium by dint of the adsorbate tendency towards na ions than adsorbent active sites in this respect bounded cr vi to magnetic chitosan based adsorbent at high acidic medium ph 2 was successfully desorbed using 0 1 m naoh as an eluent agent 109 on top of that the adsorbent performances remain approximately the same after four successive adsorption desorption cycles organic solvents as acetonitrile isopropanol ethanol acetone and methanol were also investigated as regeneration eluents due to their small and polar molecules these organic solvents can easily access the adsorbent interlayer space interact with the adsorbate functional groups and then desorb the adsorbate molecules acetone was confirmed efficient for magnetic chitosan go regeneration after methyl violet and alizarin yellow r dyes adsorption without any significant adsorption capacities decreases 110 methanol was used as desorption eluent of chitosan grafter go bionanocomposite loaded with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin 111 ethanol eluent in an acidic medium was utilized to desorb methylene blue and methyl violet from 3d graphene oxide based biopolymer gels with a recovery efficiency of 95 112 in order to prevent the surface hydrolysis of the bionanocomposite matrix due to acid eluents especially for polysaccharides chelating agents as edta disodium na2edta and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta were also adopted in bionanocomposites regeneration these sodium salts are endowed with cooh groups and n atoms and tend to engender edta metal complexes edta has released adsorbed pb ii ions from mcs tio2 bionanocomposite with a great recovery of the order of 92 after three sorption desorption cycles 113 na2edta was also declared fit for regeneration it have been found an efficient cu ii desorption from chitosan coated magnetic nanoparticles α ketoglutaric acid bionanocomposite of the order of 91 5 with a constant adsorption capacity for seven adsorption desorption cycles 114 regeneration can also be done using sodium chloride nacl due to its ionic species na and cl it can interact with the adsorbent active sites and liberate the pollutants in this regard sodium chloride was used to regenerate magnetic amine crosslinked biopolymer based corn stalk and desorb nitrate ions from it with an efficient recovery above 100 due to the ion exchange between no3 and cl ions 35 also in the same vein high sodium chloride concentrations 0 1 m nacl have caused clopyralid pesticide desorption from montmorillonite chitosan bionanocomposites due to the strong competition between cl ions of nacl and herbicide anions for adsorption sites 115 table 2 summarizes the different desorption eluents used for bionanocomposites regeneration 4 conclusion this document elucidates recent progress in innovative bionanocomposite development and their way of paving towards wastewater and contaminated water treatment applications

water treatment agents with reduced costs and improved efficiencies keywords biopolymers bionanocomposites nano fillers wastewater treatment 1 introduction in the recent past there has been a propensity to hear the notion bionanocomposites in research fields they appear as a new emerging group of nano structured bio hybrid materials involving a biopolymer naturally occurring polymer in combination with reinforcements showing at least one dimension on the nanometer scale these new materials have the peculiarity to encounter improved physical structural and functional properties due to the synergetic gathering of inherent properties of biopolymers with the assets of nano reinforcements this wise combination approach makes it possible to trim dawn or at least reduce the several hazardous risks and potential harms linked to the nanoparticles and this by creating new flexible and lightweight bionanocomposites of larger size than the nanoparticles they involve 1 this new material family is still defined loosely the number of publications dedicated to the combination of biopolymers and nano sized fillers has acutely increased in which they have been else ways denoted by green composites bio hybrids bio composites nano biocomposites etc the bionanocomposite designation seems to be the most suitable because it recognizes them from the well known nanocomposites as well as recalling the biological polymer origin bionanocomposites are the fruit of a combined effort on behalf of a variety of sciences like chemistry nanotechnology biology and materials engineering to give birth to green and environmentally friendly materials these latter materials can replace the conventional ones within the framework of promotion of research that diminishes the environmental damage and establish a forward looking process that is innocuous to the environment 1 2 the limitations of nanocomposites have paved the way for some significant progress to be made and this by creating bionanocomposites these latter are known to have recourse to biopolymers fig 1 overflowing natural cheap resources that are endowed with countless assets like non toxicity affordable cost over synthetic polymers and biocompatibility besides being made up from renewable resources which accelerate their biodegradation 3 4 considering the limitations of employing these green polymers alone due to their unsuitable properties viz low physical chemical and mechanical resistance low heat degradation temperature and high gas and water absorbance the addition of reinforcements to the biopolymeric matrix is being recommended 5 more than that and under their nanoscale the nanofillers are only required with a low dispersed content to have high mechanical properties which makes a totally filling and incorporation pointless fig 2 displayed the main three nano fillers used as reinforcement for bionanocomposites 6 in the light of this and considering the affinity and compatibility of the different elements involving in the synthesis new bionanocomposites with superior mechanical thermal and chemical features are obtained 7 8 any physical mixture of a biopolymer and nano reinforcements does not essentially lead to a bionanocomposite with improved properties for this the affinity between the matrix and the nanofiller is strongly required because in the case of immiscibility or minimal physical attraction between the two elements bionanocomposites with inferior mechanical properties may appear based on the aforementioned features the bionanocomposites are highly qualified to be adapted as a tool for water decontamination especially in high pressure environments 9 10 due to their compactness outstanding mechanical properties and regeneration potential over and above that they are well endowed with high surface area and adsorption catalysts capacities broadly speaking the conventional wastewater treatment process is a succession of three main steps as seen in fig 3 primary secondary and tertiary treatments which include physical biological and chemical techniques yet the sophisticated monitoring systems high capital operational costs and the high energy consumption of these conventional processes have led many researchers to look for improved methods and materials for handling wastewater decontamination without harming the environment or excessively wasting energy in this context this review reports the recent applications of bionanocomposites in the environmental remediation and water research sector the application of these new bio hybrid materials has been widely studied in the wastewater sector for toxic pollutants removal including organic inorganic and microbial pollutants 2 bionanocomposites applications in water decontamination wastewater pollutants could be split into three broad categories organic pollutants dyes phenols bod cod toc inorganic pollutants heavy metals phosphates nitrates nitrites oils and microorganisms viruses fig 4 11 in this section a survey of the most recent achievements of bionanocomposites in terms of wastewater treatment will be investigated 2 1 inorganic pollutants removal 2 1 1 heavy metal removal it is an indisputable fact that the presence of heavy metals even in trace amounts in the environment jeopardizes the fauna flora animals and human life due to their tendency to accumulate in biological systems 12 sources of heavy metals diversify and the chemical industrial sectors are the main driver of their production and pollution the conventional processes of heavy metals removal involve biological physical and chemical techniques several established conventional processes in terms of heavy metals uptake from aqueous mediums exist and vary from biological chemical to physical techniques elimination of heavy metal ions by coagulation flocculation or expensive membrane filtration techniques has shown good removal efficiencies nonetheless they lead to the formation of large particles and concentrated sludge other tools like electrochemical treatment and oxidations are rapid and practical for some metal s removal yet they are largely energy intensive also biological treatments have been proven to lack effectiveness 13 possible heavy metal removal mechanisms are diverse and include ion exchange electrostatic interaction surface complexation and physical adsorption as outlined in fig 5 new green and cost competitive route to handle heavy metals pollution was paved by bionanocomposite utilization the high specific area along with numerous surface functional groups makes them very convenient for metal binding by adsorption without any unsafe by products engendering numerous studies have been reported on the heavy metal s adsorption on bionanocomposites including hg cd pb cr ni as cr the hg uptake from simulated wastewater using a bionanocomposite based on chitosan which is rich in amino and hydroxyl functional groups and embedded with leaf extract of brassica with a maximum adsorption capacity of 50 mg g for 45 min at 60 c was studied by kumar et al 14 the cadmium ions removal was also satisfactorily investigated by padilla ortega et al 15 using bionanocomposite in the form of macro porous foams based on chitosan intercalated into vermiculite interlayers the study has revealed three times higher adsorption capacities of the bionanocomposite over those of the components taken separately for the same purpose methionine modified bentonite alginate was also elaborated by ahmad et al 16 the detailed study has come up with an adsorption capacity of the order of 217 39 mg g at 303 k with the possibility of bionanocomposites regeneration up to five cycles consecutively lead pb is also a cancer causing element that researchers have worked for its elimination from wastewater well aware of the jeopardizing situation mirza et al 17 have developed an effective bionanocomposite based on xanthan gum and montmorillonite for pb uptake from industrial and synthetic wastewater with an adsorption capacity of the order of 187 mg g within 240 min more than that the bionanocomposite reusability was confirmed with a regeneration up to five succeeding cycles in another unbeaten try rais ahmed et al 18 have developed another outstanding bionanocomposite based on au mica alginate with exceptional pb adsorption capacities up to 2000 mg g the same authors have tried effectively another bionanocomposite based on guar gum bentonite for the same pb removal purpose 19 but in this case from different real wastewater sources like battery manufacturing medical wastewater and electroplating industries it is also worth noting that pb adsorption was not particularly electrostatic attraction but other mechanisms were involved like ion exchange the bionanocomposite has as well displayed regenerative ability up to the fifth cycle halloysite alginate bionanocomposites beads were the idea of chiew et al 20 for the uptake of pb2 from aqueous solutions through a synergism between alginate carboxylate groups and ion exchange route they have reached an adsorption capacity upwards of 325 mg g which is approximately four times greater than the capacity of halloysite nanotubes alone 84 mg g simultaneously chromium removal has also been broadly studied combining the hydrophilicity of an organic poly cation with the adsorption features of an inorganic poly anion by creating an organic inorganic hybrid of chitosan and cloisite nanoclay was the idea of pandey et al 21 the results have confirmed a significantly high cr vi adsorption capacity 357 14 mg g of the prepared hybrid bionanocomposite always with chitosan as the matrix bhatt et al 22 have embedded the biopolymer with nano zirconium phosphate to give birth to a unique organic inorganic bionanocomposite used as a hexavalent chromium effective adsorbent with a maximum of 311 53 mg g besides being a catalyst for other oxidative degradation reactions another green bionanocomposite for the sake of toxic chromium removal was recently shaped up by dinari et al 23 based on magnetic fe3o4 and nickel aluminum layered double hydroxide with guar gum as polymer the high chromium adsorption capacity of 101 mg g within a short time of 30 min was found bionanocomposite adsorbents and their use in heavy metals removal have been reviewed in table 1 2 1 2 nitrogen and phosphate removal nitrogen and phosphate based compounds are possibly the most widespread contaminants in drinking and wastewater these ions are released into the environment from various sources such as chemical fertilizers farmland discharges etc and are responsible for the eutrophication through which it consumes the dissolved oxygen inducing the death of aquatic life furthermore at excessive levels they present a direct threat to human beings by causing diseases and cancers 29 30 biological denitrification and physicochemical processes are the two commonly conventional methods used for nitrate removal which requires high operational energy and operation time besides being expensive and imposes post treatment for the nitrite nitrate and ammonia residual wastes 31 32 due to their eco friendly nature bionanocomposites were highly investigated for nitrate and nitrite removal from contaminated water an ultra thin 2d ag tio2 al2o3 cs bionanocomposite for photocatalytic nitrate removal via a facile method by zarei et al 33 thanks to the synergetic effect of ag doping tio2 nanoparticles coupled to al2o3 and incorporated into the chitosan biopolymer the bionanocomposite has shown an extra fast and high nitrate removal 74 in 5 min reaction time in alkaline conditions ph 11 excluding any nitrite production as a by product modified chitosan was also adopted by jiang et al 34 who have elaborated a bionanocomposite with an ability to adsorb both nitrate and phosphate from water for enhancing chitosan properties zirconia has been used as inert chemical metal oxide to upgrade the biocompatibility physical strength and resistance of the bionanocomposite while the magnetic nanoparticles inclusion aim to quicken the adsorbent separation after the nutriments removal with a surface area of 212 9 m2 g the bionanocomposite maximal adsorption capacities of nitrate and phosphate were found to be 89 3 mg g and 26 5 mg p g respectively for the same purpose magnetic amine crosslinked biopolymer based corn stalk mab cs was investigated by song et al 35 this study has revealed the tremendous potential of this bionanocomposite for effective removal of nitrate with an adsorption capacity of 102 04 mg g nitrate removal was achieved through different adsorption mechanisms including ion exchange surface complex formation and electrostatic attractions on top of that the bionanocomposite magnetization property indicated its easier separation and collect from aqueous medium by an external magnet in less than 10 s alongside biopolymers zeolites have been recently used as low cost effective supports for nano scale particles for water treatment new bionanocomposite based on natural clinoptilolite zeolite as support for nano zero valent iron partly coated with zero valent copper was elaborated by fateminia et al 36 the reason behind using nano zero valent metals relies on their high stability against oxidation especially in very low dissolved oxygen conditions like in groundwater less than 9 g l where nitrates are one of the main toxic contaminants while the zero cu coating aimed to enhance the bionanocomposite reactivity together with keeping a minimum of released ammonium cation into the solution unfavorably higher nitrite production was found for the cu modified zeolite fe ni bimetallic nanoparticles incorporated within the inner pores as well as on the outer zeolite surface bionanocomposite z fe ni was prepared for simultaneous reduction of nitrate and removal of phosphate by he et al 37 the ions removal was found to involve different mechanisms especially co precipitation complexation and reduction results have revealed that zeolites had an important dispersal effect all over the surface which have promoted the reactivity of the fe ni nanoparticles and enhance their reduction performance compared to non supported nanoparticles in a different attempt fe ni nanoparticles supported on biochar bc fe ni were established for nitrate decontamination by li et al 38 again supported bi metallic nanoparticles have exhibited advantages over neat nanoparticles relating to nitrate degradation efficiency of the order of 99 5 they produced secondary ammonia uptake from the aqueous medium to avoid nickel and iron release within the framework of biomass supported adsorbent preparation as an economic and effective method for enhanced removal of ions qiu et al 39 have come with an innovative bionanocomposite ws n la based on nano sized la iii hydroxides anchored within a quaternary aminated wheat straw ws n ws n la have revealed a higher preferable phosphate adsorption capacity over a wide ph range without any sort of la iii leaching the bionanocomposite has proven excellent stability over ten adsorption desorption cycles 2 1 3 rare earth elements rees removal contrary to what one might think from their names rare earth elements are not that rare these natural elements are widespread in the earth s crust and are generally found agglomerated in certain types of rocks and minerals rees consist of 17 elements scandium yttrium and 15 lanthanides lanthanum cerium praseodymium neodymium promethium samarium europium gadolinium terbium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium and lutecium there has been an increasing demand for rees extraction and separation due to their strategic potentials in different fields as catalysts magnetics metallurgy rechargeable batteries and superconductors 40 bionanocomposites have confirmed their suitability again for applications involving rees elements extractions and separation a new bionanocomposite made of gum arabic ga grafted polyacrylamide based silica nanocomposite ga g pam sio2 was developed by iftekhar 41 the bionanocomposite synthesis was based on an in situ radial graft copolymerization approach for the recovery of four ree ions from aqueous solutions especially europium eu lanthanum la neodymium nd and scandium sc investigation revealed that the adsorption mechanism using this bionanocomposite was endothermic spontaneous physisorption that fitted well with the langmuir model the adsorption capacities were found to be 12 24 11 05 10 11 and 7 9 mg g for nd sc eu and la respectively with a regeneration efficiency of up to three consecutive cycles for the same purpose a bionanocomposite adsorbent based on cellulose and zn al layered double hydroxide ldh for the uptake of ytterbium lanthanum and cerium was elaborated by iftekhar et al 42 cellulose was intercalated in the ldh to give birth to a hybrid bionanocomposite with capacities of rapid uptake of the rees ions it showed good adsorption capacities and selectivity for y3 la3 and ce3 with capacities of 102 25 92 51 and 96 25 mg g respectively along with high adsorption capacities this bionanocomposite possesses good reusability for up to five cycles similarly iftekhar et al 43 have opted for layered double hydroxide ldh or anionic clays associated with biopolymers for the uptake of ree elements metal ion anchored xanthan gum encapsulating ldh zr xg za bionanocomposite was elaborated via an encapsulation and anchoring method the maximum adsorption capacities for sc nd tm and yb were respectively 132 30 14 01 18 15 and 25 73 mg g the choice set of the bionanocomposite components was confirmed by adsorption experiments that have shown the increasing efficiency of the multicomponent system over a single system three mechanisms would be involved in ree elements removal ion exchange electrostatic attractive interactions between the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of the bionanocomposite and ree ions and coordination complexation reactions between ree cations and o bionanocomposite groups to take advantage of the leftover ree doped zr xg za after five adsorption cycles the bionanocomposite was further used as a photocatalyst for tetracycline degradation fig 6 magnetic bionanocomposites were also investigated by many researchers as part of attempts to recover rre elements from aqueous media a magnetic bionanocomposite namely p cdp fe3o4 based on cross linked β cyclodextrin biopolymer and fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles was made by nkinahamira et al 44 the high surface area and porosity of these bionanocomposites have allowed the equilibrium reaching within less than 10 min with adsorption capacities of 8 88 mg g and 7 76 mg g for nd and gd respectively these bionanocomposites provide add on features like easy separation by an external magnetic field high selectivity towards rees in the presence of other competitive ions and regeneration for at least five cycles in the same vein javadian et al 45 have elaborated an environmentally magnetic bionanocomposite in a gelation process of carboxymethyl chitosan sodium alginate and ni0 2zn0 2fe2 6o4 synthesized magnetic nanoparticles the adsorption experiments have revealed high uptake efficiency of 97 75 96 83 and 97 85 for nd 3 tb 3 and dy 3 respectively 2 1 4 oils removal and separation oils are another sort of recalcitrant wastewater pollutant free or floating oils come in different textures lubricants grease fats heavy and light hydrocarbons oily emulsions discharged to the environment are stable liquid liquid systems that are responsible for impeding sunlight penetration and oxygen absorption by water bodies thus causing biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod exacerbation and damaging the natural environment in the absence of adequate separation techniques 46 besides the well known membrane technology for removing oils the bionanocomposites development as new alternatives to draw oils from water has been a research focus lately bionanocomposite aerogels were proven outstanding absorbents for oil water separation by dint of their high porosity and lightweight a tolerant robust superoleophobic aerogel based on tio2 nanoparticles reduced graphene oxide rgo and alginate was reported by zhuang et al 47 tio2 rgo alginate trga synthesis was a non toxic cheap ionic cross linking route followed by freeze drying to produce aerogel the bionanocomposite combined several functionalities potent oil water separation of 99 96 that could be maintained even after 120 cycles self cleaning aptitude and excellent recyclability another 3d porous aerogel for oil water separation based on tio2 nanoparticles and sodium alginate was reported by dai et al 48 the surface hydrophilicity together with microstructure porosity and roughness have insured the aerogel with an oil water separation capability of 99 7 note worthier reusability and antifouling ability moreover titania nanoparticles provide the aerogel with good photocatalytic activity there has been a myriad of studies dealing with the bio sorbents association with magnetic nanoparticles owing to their magnetic properties in fact the magnetic behavior of this kind of material makes them easily recoverable from aqueous mediums in preference to conventional separation techniques as centrifugation and filtration typically oil spills tend to float on the water surface for a certain time based on these floating characteristics bionanocomposite adsorbents dedicated to this kind of handling ought to be low dense easily recoverable and unsinkable in order to fully exchange with floating oils and achieve maximum oil removal as seen in fig 7 magnetic bionanocomposites are the best candidates a ferromagnetic bionanocomposite yb mnp via a co precipitation method for oil spill cleanup based on magnetic nanoparticles mnps and yeast biomass was elaborated by debs et al 49 petroleum p28api mixed used motor oil mumo and new motor oil nmo were the three oils tested on the bionanocomposite results showed that around 69 of the oil was removed using the bionanocomposite and easily recovered owing to its superparamagnetic behavior another bionanocomposite based on alkyd resin cured with toluene diisocyanate and in situ incorporated with magnetic nanoparticles γ fe2o3 was prepared by de souza et al 50 for oil spill cleaning based on its well proven design of double aromatic aliphatic nature and magnetic nanoparticles incorporation the new bionanocomposite has two useful features good affinity between oil and the composite and easy magnetic recovery chitosan grafted magnetic nanoparticles cs mnps bionanocomposite was elaborated by lü et al 51 to assess its demulsification performances after the solvothermal synthesis of fe3o4 mnps a surface coating with amino propyl functionalized silica apfs and aldehyde functionalization with glutaraldehyde was executed via a schiff base reaction for further grafting of cs molecular chains the suitability of this bionanocomposite for treating emulsified oil wastewaters relies on its potent magnetic properties and its demulsification efficiency under neutral acidic and alkaline conditions via electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions on top of that cs mnps bionanocomposite may well be reused up to 7 cycles without significant loss in demulsification performances another bionanocomposite that is also decorated with iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 for a rapid water oil separation was made by yap et al 52 based on alginate and reduced graphene the magnetic bionanocomposite takes the form of foam which is a highly porous texture allowing the water to continuously circulation and the pollutants catching due to its unique combination of mixed hydrophobic hydrophilic nature the bionanocomposite has shown high considerable oil absorption of the order of 13 18 g g over a very short span of time 30 s polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane is a trademark known and recognized as a polymeric hydrophobic membrane due to its outstanding properties to properly address pvdf membrane limitations as fouling due to the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions there has been a coating trend of the membrane with bionanocomposites the pvdf bionanocomposite membranes are endowed with an underwater superoleophobic top surface and a hydrophobic substrate this hydrophilic oleophobic structure creates various synergetic effects which enhances the efficiency of oil removal by preventing their adhesion on the membrane surface as elucidated in fig 8 indeed the hydrophilic surface of the modified pvdf membrane can react effectively with water to yield a hydration layer responsible for foulant rejection 53 a modified pvdf membrane with chitosan silica nanoparticles for the sake of an ultra low oil adhesion underwater superoleophobicity and super hydrophilicity was reported by liu et al 53 the membrane coating has led to an outstanding water oil separation capability 99 0 chitosan and silica coated pvdf was also investigated by ardeshiri et al 54 via a one step coating route to prepare an oleophobic hydrophilic bionanocomposite coated on the pvdf membrane surface for the separation assessments water gasoline emulsions were tested using a pressure process the results have revealed higher flux permeate and 99 total oil rejection of modified membrane over unmodified membrane because of the hydrophilic layer coating 2 2 organic pollutants 2 2 1 dye s removal dyes are colored chemical substances that are extensively used in textile industries for fiber coloration the removal of dyes from discharged textile wastewater is considered a real struggle owing to their high water solubility high stability to light and intense coloration even in low concentration 55 over and above that dyes are extremely poisonous and even carcinogenic to microbial populations and human beings besides being resistant to aerobic digestion and not biologically degradable 56 since dyes are considered as the model molecules regularly studied in the scientific literature to evaluate adsorption and pollutants elimination efficiencies of materials several studies have been reported in terms of using bionanocomposites for dye removal due to their wide adaptability high adsorption capacities and ease of operation a bionanocomposite based on chitosan alginate impregnated with magnetic zeolite in the form of beads was developed by kazemi et al 57 for effective uptake of cationic dye the combination of anionic cationic polysaccharides zeolite and magnetic nanoparticles would help to improve the system in terms of dyes removal moreover a magnetic separation and regeneration aptitude of up to 4 cycles was thereby assured generally adsorbents exhibited a large decline in dye removal efficiency in changed ph solutions and especially in alkaline solutions effective adsorbents over a wide ph range are seldom found and studied to tackle this issue an environment friendly bionanocomposite based on fe iii cross linked poly vinyl alcohol and chitin nanofibers was developed by ghourbanpour et al 58 with a high maximum adsorption capacity of 810 4 mg g for methyl orange mo that can be maintained almost constant up to five cycles not only that the prepared bionanocomposites can efficiently adsorb mo dye under both alkaline and acidic conditions by dint of electrostatic interactions between chitin nanofibers and the adsorbate coupled with the chelation between fe iii and methyl orange sulfonic groups for the same purpose dye removal by means of bionanocomposites another approach reached from surface engineering microorganisms was developed by fan et al 59 fe3o4 mil 100 core shell bionanocomposite was found more effective for ao10 dye removal against adsorbent alone or free microorganisms owing to the combination of biodegradation and physical adsorption hence this strategy puts on view a great potential for dye treatment from industrial effluents in the same biocatalytic degradation vein mahmoodi et al 60 have developed a bionanocomposite for direct red 23 removal based on nano zeolite and nanocarbon tubes where a well ordered enzyme immobilization was done to provide a high specific area in attempt to get efficient biodegradation effectively enzyme immobilization to carbon nanotube solid matrix had a positive effect on the stability and on bound peptides lifetime increasing compared to their native forms reinforcing water soluble biopolymer with clay nanofillers is an interesting approach to fully exploit them as multifunctional adsorbent of pollutants in an aqueous medium ahmad et al 19 have modified guar gum with nanofiller clay bentonite to give raise to an eco friendly effective bionanocmposite for crystal violet removal from water similarly clay was associated with cellulose to produce clay cellulose bionanocomposite for an efficient drimarine yellow dy removal 61 likewise bée et al 62 have entrapped clay and maghemite nanoparticles into cross linked chitosan beads for the elaboration of a bionanocomposite multifunctional adsorbent for the uptake of dyes either cationic as mb or anionic as mo separately or together the beads have shown a high adsorption capacity on an extended ph range due to the clay encapsulation jointly mahdavinia et al 63 have introduced montmorillonite nanoclay into carrageenan based hydrogels for the crystal violet dye uptake it was revealed that by increasing the clay content up to 14 wt of clay the removal speed increases tio2 is the most widely used nanomaterial that has been used in several fields such as photocatalysis energy conversion and storage and cosmetics 5 64 etc tio2 based bionanocomposites for a combined effect of adsorption and photocatalysis under uv irradiations for dyes removal have been demonstrated to be competitive embedding tio2 nps into sesame protein isolate films for mb removal was the idea of fathi et al 65 the films displayed great dye photodegradation potential besides a good o2 scavenging activity immobilizing tio2 nanoparticles into gum tragacanth biopolymer to form photocatalyst hydrogels has been revealed to be a suitable material for dye removal the hybrid bionanocomposite used as photocatalyst surpassed and outperformed the neat biopolymer used as adsorbent by achieving 87 of mb removal efficiency versus 69 66 chitosan was also embedded with tio2 nanoparticles for adsorptional photodegradation of anthraquinone and azo dyes it has been found that the hydrogels still be able to effectively remove dyes even after three cycles with no sufficient efficiency decline 67 in another attempt with chitosan it has been combined with poly n isopropyl acrylamide to be embedded later with tio2 nanoparticles for the elaboration of a hybrid bionanocomposite for the removal of ionic dye 68 tio2 nanoparticles have been also physically encapsulated into a porous mixed matrix composed of polyvinyl alcohol pva and iota carrageenan crg biopolymers by a freezing thawing technique for the same purpose oxidative decomposition of methyl orange dye 69 alginate biopolymer was also subject to tio2 nanoparticles encapsulation for an effective mb removal by adsorption photocatalysis through hybrid organic inorganic bionanocomposite beads composed of carbon dots c dots magnesium fluorohydroxyapatite fa multi walled carbon nanotubes cnts 70 for economical reasons attempts have been made to modify tio2 nanoparticles to have an expanded responsive wavelength range in the visible region thus benefiting from the high titanium dioxide photocatalytic activity under visible light or sunlight without the need of uv irradiations in this vein bionanocomposite based on iron modified tio2 and encapsulated into alginate was made for mb removal 71 72 urea modified tio2 nanoparticles were also encapsulated into chitosan films for an effective malachite green photo bleaching activity under visible light 73 in like manner liu et al 74 have prepared a bionanocomposite based on natural xylan as the template for the immobilization of tio2 nanoparticles and pva as the crosslinking agent for the photodegradation of astrazon brilliant red 4g and ethyl violet and dyes under visible light irradiation 2 2 2 phenolic compound removal phenol hydroxy benzene and its derivatives are regarded as a class of highly toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutants 75 these compounds are generally discharged into the environment after being previously employed as starting materials in multiple chemical industries or from water chlorination in wastewaters plant or from agricultural resources their hazardousness relies on their high solubility in water various organic solvents and oils besides being carcinogenic mutagenic and low biodegradable 76 in consideration of that wastewaters involving phenolic compounds ought to be judiciously treated to avoid their liberation into the environment several methods for phenolic compounds uptake exist namely adsorption membrane extraction ozonation biological processes electrochemical methods and liquid liquid extraction by means of organic solvents 77 that being the case phenol and its derivatives have been often used as hazardous pollutants models in wastewater treatment which confirms their importance in the environmental researches field there is considerable available data on phenol removal with respect to water decontamination by means of bionanocomposites again these types of hybrid materials have shown great effectiveness even when treating recalcitrant toxic pollutants crosslinking chitosan films with epichlorohydrin cs ech and grafting tio2 nanoparticles into it was developed by jawad et al 78 for the photodegradation of phenol in fact the author has adopted the crosslinking avenue to make the bionanocomposite stable in an acidic medium and to reinforce its mechanical resistance another research based on chitosan as biopolymer was conducted by bonardd et al 79 who choose gold nanoparticles as reinforcement content the use of this golden bionanocomposite as a heterogeneous catalyst has demonstrated a significant catalytic performance for the reduction of p nitrophenol 4 np to p aminophenol 4 ap the increase of golden reinforcements has been found to lead to an increase in the catalytic activity of the bionanocomposite a new green approach for the metal bionanocmposite processing was developed by narayanan et al 80 who have designed a silver bionanocomposite as a heterogeneous catalyst using the fungus cylindrocladium floridanum the approach consisted of coating the fungal mycelia silver nanoparticles onto the surface of glass bead surface where the biological entities play an important role in catalyzing the reduction of toxic p nitrophenol 4 np to p aminophenol 4 ap for the same purpose mohammed et al 81 have opted for the preparation of biopolymer rare earth oxides bionanocomposites it is about the preparation of cerium oxide ceo2 nanoparticles loaded trimethyl chitosan bionanocomposite for the sake of an effective phenol adsorption and its chloro derivatives 2 chlorophenol and 4 chlorophenol the combination of the biopolymer and the rare earth oxide has generated a true synergy leading to the enhancement of the antioxidative and antibacterial capacity of the bionanocomposite along with boosting its adsorption capacity this latter has followed the order of 4 chlorophenol 2 chorophenol phenol along with achieving adsorption or photodecomposition of phenol and its derivatives what the researchers also aim for is the sustainability of the materials their improved properties for a longer shelf life and their easier recovery after treatment dinari et al 82 have gone for a green method to make a simple recoverable bionanocomposite based on magnetite ag layered double hydroxide starch for 4 nitrophenol and 2 nitrophenol quick reduction to aminophenols the elaborated bionanocomposite has shown improved thermal stability and a maintaining effectiveness up to the fifth cycle of reusing it with phenolic compounds removal of the order of 90 while yun et al 83 have prepared a bionanocomposite film based on three essential components mungbean starch pva and zns nanoparticles adopting the curing casting method together with the good bisphenol photodegradation the authors have set up priorities on improving specific properties as thermal mechanical optical and water barrier of the matrix via inorganic nanoparticle adding 2 2 3 cod bod and toc removal organic matter covers a broad spectrum of organic compounds over 40 million which made their identification difficult costly and time consuming as an effective alternative for their classification in wastewater analysis three popular parameters are chosen as indicators of organic pollution cod chemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand and toc total organic carbon 84 cod or chemical oxygen demand of a water sample is defined as the needed oxygen amount for the oxidation of its oxidizable compounds whereas bod of water is an approximate measure of the biochemically degradable organic matter amount present in a water sample it is determined by the required oxygen amount for the aerobic micro organisms present in the sample to oxidize the organic matter to a stable inorganic form total organic carbon toc is another sort of organic matter that can be a useful indication of the pollution degree the toc determination is so important because it reflects the organic character of the water sample the higher the carbon amount the more microorganisms grow and thusly the more oxygen consumption in other words the higher the cod bod or toc values of water the greater is its contamination 85 86 as anticipated bionanocomposites as usual were widely used for organic matter removal in terms of cod bod and toc from contaminated water since a complete discoloration of a dye solution does not necessarily mean its total degradation researchers tend to carry out the monitoring of colored water discoloration by the analysis and measurement of cod bod or toc to highlight the efficiency of the used material to not only eliminate the coloration but also to mineralize the pollutants simultaneously 87 a green and low cost bionanocomposite based on guar gum and silver nanoparticles for catalytic degradation of three dyes rh6g rb2 and rr141 and their binary mixture was made by vanamudan et al 88 the impact of these organic pollutants on water quality in this work was expressed in terms of the total organic carbon toc high toc reductions of the three dyes were found ranging from 60 to 77 in single component systems and from 21 to 62 in the case of binary systems and yet due to the formation of colorless by products the toc reduction was found to be inferior to total decolorization an innovative bionanocomposite based on alginate biopolymer reinforced with bentonite clay and surface impregnated with tio2 nanoparticles was developed by chkirida et al 87 for cationic dye degradation in addition to developing this new integrated adsorbent photocatalyst another distinguishing feature of this study is the approach of tio2 nanoparticles fixation on the surface of bentonite alginate by a facile non thermal impregnation technique for direct contact between the photocatalyst and the irradiation source without hindering the incidence of irradiation light to the photocatalyst due to the highly synergetic adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of this bionanocomposite a discoloration rate of the order of 98 together with excellent cod abatement of 93 was achieved these results confirmed the destruction of dyes chromophore groups and not only its adsorption similar to the above study vanamudan et al 89 have proposed to add chitosan to silver nanoparticles and guar gum for catalytic degradation and reduction of dyes and nitrophenol the blending concept aimed to enhance both physical and chemical functionalities of used biopolymers and promote their adsorption efficiencies the mineralization of the dye s organic carbon was checked through toc analysis as was expected higher toc reductions were found using the blend bionanocomposite ranging from 53 to 84 analogously chitosan and silver nanoparticles seemed to have a highly promising potential for water drainage treatment 90 the elaborated bionanocomposite showed high cod and bod removal of 80 and 89 respectively another study found that bionanocomposite based on the chitosan binding to zinc oxide nanoparticles has yielded good results in terms of high cod removal up to 97 of milk industry wastewater 91 thanks to the chitosan amino groups that can act as chelation sites for enhanced cod removal for wastewater decontamination mostafa et al 92 went for merging nanotechnology and membrane technology by designing a new bionanocomposite consisted of entrapping nano zero valent iron into cellulose acetate membrane this combination has led to the creation of a reactive membrane via the phase inversion technique with improved mechanical properties high surface area significant resistance to direct fire and high organic matter removal of 80 for cod and 73 for bod bionanocomposites are not limited to wastewater treatment but also lake decontamination the study investigated by prisa et al 93 is the best illustration using a hydrogel bionanocomposite based on gluten pectin and magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 for lake sediments removal 50 of toc 60 of cod and 80 of bod removal were achieved thusly the lake pollution was considerably reduced owing to the good physical interactions and synergetic effect of the bionanocomposite components 2 3 pathogenic micro organisms inactivation water pollution comes in many guises from organic and inorganic pollution to microbiological contamination the latter is generated by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and parasites microorganism s presence in water is responsible for a lot of infectious diseases which befall the human body no less dangerous is the tendency to control the disinfection of these microorganisms by chlorination which induces carcinogenic byproducts recognized as being harmful to human health 94 95 bionanocomposites have opened a chance for the employment and adoption of novel eco friendly and high performing materials for antibacterial applications making them replace the conventional techniques novel bionanocomposite based on polyaniline cellulose and nickel nanoparticles pani c ni by a chemical oxidative polymerization was elaborated by ahmad et al 96 the bionanocomposite was drawn up to maintain the growth of two pathogenic fungal strains alternaria alternata and rhizoctonia solani nickel nanoparticles incorporation into the pani c chains improves notably its fungicidal properties indeed pani c ni bionanocomposite have unveiled greater fungal growth inhibition 50 and 42 over pan c biocomposite for a alternate and r solani respectively apart from its antibacterial activity the bionanocomposite concentration is another overriding factor the study carried out by nehra et al 97 has stressed this point by using a minimum concentration of 5 μg ml against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli the bionanocomposite have revealed a potent antibacterial activity the synthesis approach consisted of incorporating alzr metal oxide nanoparticles into humic acid biopolymer by a deep freeze drying process in a similar vein nazarzadehzare et al 98 have developed super magnetic bionanocomposites with good antibacterial and antifungal activities via an in situ coprecipitations followed by emulsion polymerization candida albicans staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis were the four pathogenic species investigated using the multilayered bionanocomposite pacp fe3o4 aa based on alginic acid poly aniline co pyrrole and fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles the good antibacterial and antifungal finding activities are due to the simultaneous presence of the copolymer and the magnetic nanoparticles in the bionanocomposite backbone there is a widespread mention of chitosan in the literature due to its well known antibacterial properties these latter are attributable mainly to the interaction of positively charged amino groups of glucosamine with microbial cell membranes which are negatively charged engendering the proteinaceous and other intracellular constituents of the microorganisms outflow 99 nanometer thick titania chitosan ag np bionanocomposite film was elaborated by xiao et al 100 the synthesis process consisted of coating a uniform titania chitosan ultrathin biocomposite on cellulose microfibril using a layer by layer self assembly technique the bionanocomposite antibacterial activities have been assessed against gram negative escherichia coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus bacteria relying on the synergetic effect of cellulose chitosan titania and silver nanoparticles it was enunciated that almost all the inoculated bacteria were disinfected using the bionanocomposite with increasing antibacterial activities in the order of cellulose tio2 n cellulose tio2 chi n and cellulose tio2 chi n ag np again chitosan was used for the surface coating of metallic silver nanoparticles to generate a bionanocomposite with high antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli the green one pot and facile synthesis route is another asset of this bionanocomposite that has proven to be able to maintain its antibacterial activity up to 12 h 101 even moderate or relatively low antibacterial activities are noteworthy this was the case for chitosan encapsulated manganese oxide bionanocomposite that was elaborated by anwar et al 24 via a chemical precipitation route its antibacterial activity was evaluated against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli 3 bionanocomposites regeneration the regeneration and reuse aspect of sorbent materials are a sine qua non criteria for their economic feasibility and practical application in the wastewater sector regeneration allowed a longer period of use and it is by far the main source of value of an adsorbent or a catalyst cost reduction is the flip side of materials regeneration the regeneration depicts adsorbed pollutants removal from adsorbent materials for subsequent reuse as well as restoring its primary adsorption properties using feasible technically and economically methods in some cases it is necessary to recover the pollutant from the adsorbent especially in the case of heavy metals or rare earth elements that possess high market prices and several industrial applications regeneration allows a simulation of adsorption efficiency of used and exhausted adsorbents which is indispensable in water treatment sector to have a more accurate idea about their shelf life literature survey suggests a broad panoply of adsorbent regeneration techniques and tools many of which are already being applied efficiently and have notably helped to retain the adsorption capacity of adsorbents as an illustration thermal 102 and biological degradation 103 electrochemical treatment 104 extraction in supercritical conditions 105 oxidation 106 and ultrasound regeneration 107 due to their biopolymer matrix bionanocomposites can t undergo with a few notable exceptions similar regeneration treatments under extreme conditions oftentimes pollutant desorption from bionanocomposites is based on chemical methods this latter holds many advantages over the above mentioned techniques it is a less energy intensive process endowed with rapidity and high adsorbate recovery without damaging the adsorbent chemical regeneration is based on solvent washing with selected eluents or desorption agents a neutral optimal sorption ph of a bionanocomposite adsorbent requires an acidic desorption eluent and reciprocally bounded pollutants in acidic conditions claim alkaline eluents through this review the summary of research has demonstrated that regeneration of bionanocomposites using desorbing eluents has notably extended the material s life cycle and has ensured that it works and removes perfectly the pollutants over repeated sessions acidic eluents the most used hcl or hno3 provide high concentration of hydronium ions h3o which reduce the adsorbate attraction towards the adsorbent active groups and allow desorption utilizing ion exchange mechanisms 108 while basic eluents such as naoh can also present good regeneration performance due to their ability to lower the adsorbent adsorbate bonding in alkaline medium by dint of the adsorbate tendency towards na ions than adsorbent active sites in this respect bounded cr vi to magnetic chitosan based adsorbent at high acidic medium ph 2 was successfully desorbed using 0 1 m naoh as an eluent agent 109 on top of that the adsorbent performances remain approximately the same after four successive adsorption desorption cycles organic solvents as acetonitrile isopropanol ethanol acetone and methanol were also investigated as regeneration eluents due to their small and polar molecules these organic solvents can easily access the adsorbent interlayer space interact with the adsorbate functional groups and then desorb the adsorbate molecules acetone was confirmed efficient for magnetic chitosan go regeneration after methyl violet and alizarin yellow r dyes adsorption without any significant adsorption capacities decreases 110 methanol was used as desorption eluent of chitosan grafter go bionanocomposite loaded with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin 111 ethanol eluent in an acidic medium was utilized to desorb methylene blue and methyl violet from 3d graphene oxide based biopolymer gels with a recovery efficiency of 95 112 in order to prevent the surface hydrolysis of the bionanocomposite matrix due to acid eluents especially for polysaccharides chelating agents as edta disodium na2edta and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta were also adopted in bionanocomposites regeneration these sodium salts are endowed with cooh groups and n atoms and tend to engender edta metal complexes edta has released adsorbed pb ii ions from mcs tio2 bionanocomposite with a great recovery of the order of 92 after three sorption desorption cycles 113 na2edta was also declared fit for regeneration it have been found an efficient cu ii desorption from chitosan coated magnetic nanoparticles α ketoglutaric acid bionanocomposite of the order of 91 5 with a constant adsorption capacity for seven adsorption desorption cycles 114 regeneration can also be done using sodium chloride nacl due to its ionic species na and cl it can interact with the adsorbent active sites and liberate the pollutants in this regard sodium chloride was used to regenerate magnetic amine crosslinked biopolymer based corn stalk and desorb nitrate ions from it with an efficient recovery above 100 due to the ion exchange between no3 and cl ions 35 also in the same vein high sodium chloride concentrations 0 1 m nacl have caused clopyralid pesticide desorption from montmorillonite chitosan bionanocomposites due to the strong competition between cl ions of nacl and herbicide anions for adsorption sites 115 table 2 summarizes the different desorption eluents used for bionanocomposites regeneration 4 conclusion this document elucidates recent progress in innovative bionanocomposite development and their way of paving towards wastewater and contaminated water treatment applications

13374,recently microplastics a new type of pollutant have attracted much attention around the world in this study a magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant mmhc was produced by adding magnetic particles of fe3o4 during the formation of mg oh 2 to remove polyethylene from wastewater which easily floats on the water surface and is a major component of microplastics the removal efficiency of microplastics after coagulation was compared with the traditional magnesium hydroxide coagulant mhc in addition three magnetic magnesium hydroxides were prepared by changing the ratio of mg2 to oh when magnesium hydroxide was formed scanning electron microscopy sem images showed the surface morphology of three types of magnetic magnesium hydroxide and fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir described the formation of new bonds during the formation of magnetic magnesium hydroxide the results showed that among the three types of mmhc when mg2 oh was 1 1 the removal efficiency of microplastics reached the highest of 87 1 which was 14 7 higher than that of mhc only in addition when magnetic magnesium hydroxide was added with 120 mg l of fe3o4 and 200 mg l of mg oh 2 the removal efficiency of microplastics would increase to about 92 when accompanied by the addition of 4 mg l of non ionic polyacrylamide pam however in the range of ph 5 9 the removal efficiency of microplastics did not change significantly and charge neutralization occurred in the coagulation process the particle size of the two kinds of coagulants shifted from large to small with time aging while the flocs generated by the two coagulants showed an opposite trend graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastic magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulation flocculation mechanism 1 introduction the widespread presence of microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm in the environment has been recognized as a global pollution challenge 1 2 with the production of plastic products increasing annually research showed that from 1950 to 2018 thousands of tons of microplastic pollutants were discharged into the environment 3 5 microplastics due to their small size large specific surface area hydrophobicity and weak photodegradation ability can become a good carrier in the environment they can easily absorb other organic pollutants generate more complex secondary pollutants and produce higher compound toxicity 6 9 thus in an aquatic environment a variety of organisms may ingest some of the microplastics that clog their digestive tracts and suffer some adverse effects caused by both microplastics themselves and chemical substances in microplastics 10 12 besides studies have shown that microplastics can move through the food chain posing health risks to humans by eating seafood that contains microplastics 13 14 for instance according to the food people usually consume every american citizen consumes 39 000 52 000 microplastics per year and this value is also affected by age and gender 15 another study by the university of newcastle in australia found that the average person around the world consume nearly 5 g of microplastic a week the equivalent of a credit card more importantly microplastics do not directly cause acute life effects on humans and animals but slowly produce toxicity over time which is considered a crucial issue that is often overlooked 2 therefore there is an urgent need for a comprehensive study of microplastics currently several researches with respect to microplastics have focused on the abundance occurrence type size shape and color of microplastics in various water environments previous studies have found that polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyamide pa are the main six polymers of microplastics 16 among them polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp particles separately comprised up to 90 of microplastics 17 19 in the case of microplastic shapes it has been proven that there are also six main shapes fibers granular pellets films foams and fragments 20 and similar to the types of microplastics the shape of microplastics with different water sources is discrepant from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in canada microplastics in the form of fiber and debris accounted for 93 7 of the total 21 nevertheless an analysis of water samples from xiangxi bay in china s three gorges reservoir found that sheet and fragment forms of microplastics were the dominant shapes 22 furthermore it was pointed out in the literatures that the color of microplastics was mainly transparent and white after studying the water sources of three wwtps in different areas of three cities in china 16 23 24 however another study showed that microplastics in wwtps were predominantly red green and blue 25 what is worth mentioning although microplastics can be treated in wwtps with efficiencies of up to 98 they cannot be completely removed even in tertiary treatment 26 therefore wwtps have been considered as a source of microplastics entering the environment in some studies 27 28 not only that personal care products laundry household dust tires and road wear particles can all be sources of microplastics 29 finally anecdotal evidence suggested that due to the sampling method of the microplastics analyzed the size analysis method e g infrared spectroscopy or raman spectroscopy and even the size classification method varied considerably among studies which made it impossible to compare the abundance and size of microplastics directly and in detail 30 while microplastic pollution in domestic wastewater and global aquatic systems is a known threat to marine life and human health advanced technologies for the effective control and purification of microplastics are still largely underdeveloped it is worth noting that current research on microplastics is not only concerned with a wide range of properties of microplastics but also puts a lot of efforts into the substantial removal of microplastics from the macroscopic point of view even if the wwtp is not so targeted for the removal of microplastics there is no doubt that the wwtp is a powerful method to remove microplastics microplastics removal efficiencies of 35 59 and 50 98 were obtained by pretreatment and primary treatment respectively and after secondary treatment the microplastics in the wastewater will be further reduced to 0 2 14 with substantial tertiary treatment support microplastics can be reduced to a staggering 0 2 2 26 from another microscopic point of view there is no shortage of novel processes for removing microplastics misra et al 31 combined iron oxide and porous silicon dioxide to create a magnetic polyoxometalate supported ionic liquid phases magpom silps which results in a microplastic removal efficiency of up to 100 table 1 similarly magnetic carbon nanotubes were used to remove microplastics with remarkable efficiency of 100 32 besides novel and robust nanocarbon springs were synthesized via solid pyrolysis and simultaneously engineered nitrogen dopants and encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles and the removal efficiency of microplastics can be a relatively respectable 50 33 furthermore sun et al 34 investigated a reusable compressed sponge prepared from chitin and graphene oxide chgo have a stable adsorption efficiency of 72 4 89 8 to microplastics at ph 6 8 however some researchers have proved that traditional coagulation treatment can also have a remarkable treatment effect on microplastics for example ma et al 35 and zhou et al 36 achieved the maximum microplastic removal efficiency of 61 and 77 83 respectively through traditional coagulation experiments with the use of aluminum and iron coagulants it is worth noting that the magalhães et al 37 have verified the cationic hydrophobically modified cellulose as biological flocculating agent handling microplastics therefore coagulation flocculation treatment is a particularly promising technology for microplastics processing however in order to obtain significant treatment performance the widely used aluminum salt 20 mg l 405 mg l al 35 and iron salt 30 mg l 180 mg l feci3 36 coagulant must maintain a large dosage which may lead to excessive residual aluminum content in the effluent and color of the effluent thus affecting human health 38 in contrast magnesium hydroxide as a coagulant has strong adsorption capacity stability and stable buffering no corrosive security non toxic etc and is a type of environmentally friendly water treatment agent 39 in a previous study zhao et al 40 have used magnesium hydroxide coagulant for the treatment of dyes wastewater and found that the removal efficiency of reactive orange can reach 99 3 in addition the addition of fe3o4 particles into the coagulant is a magnetic coagulation technology developed on the basis of the conventional coagulation process the addition of magnetic particles can combine with the flocs to form a large magnetic flocs which well makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional coagulation technology especially in reducing the coagulation time and accelerating the sedimentation rate the objective of this study is to prepare a magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant mmhc through the combination of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and fe3o4 and to use non ionic pam a hydrophilic polymer as the flocculant which can form flocs with superior settling performance through adsorption bridging polymerization between the unstable particles the removal characteristics of microplastics in wastewater were further investigated under the coagulation system of magnetic magnesium hydroxide and pam the morphologic characteristics of magnetic magnesium hydroxide with different ratios mg2 oh were investigated coagulant size distribution and flocculation index fi were used to explore the influence of flocculation time and different experimental conditions on the removal efficiency of microplastics in addition the coagulation mechanism between microplastics and coagulants was determined it is hoped to provide a perspective and theoretical basis for the future research direction and removal methods of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of simulated wastewater all reagents used in this experiment are analytical reagent ar except for those mentioned especially humic acid tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute co china and kaolin tianjin kewei co china were used to simulate natural water samples the first step was to preliminarily dissolve 60 mg humic acid under alkaline conditions then mix 120 mg of kaolin with dissolved humic acid and add 6 l of ultrapure water adjust ph to 12 with 2 mol l of sodium hydroxide solution naoh tianjin huihang chemical technology co china and stir for 5 h in magnetic stirring to fully dissolve and mix well after mixing the ph value was altered to 7 by hydrochloric acid hcl tianjin huihang chemical technology co china and stored at room temperature as a stock solution until the coagulation experiment 2 2 synthesis of magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant naoh mgcl2 6h2o and fe3o4 tianjin damao chemical reagent factory were used in this experiment to prepare magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant which can change the ratio of mg2 to oh to obtain three different types by eq 1 1 m g 2 2 o h mg oh 2 the preparation method was as follows in a beaker 10 2 g magnesium chloride hexahydrate were weighted and dissolved with 150 ml ultrapure water then 4 g sodium hydroxide was fully dissolved in 100 ml ultrapure water under the stirring of glass rod followed the addition of fe3o4 and uniform mixing with sodium hydroxide solution finally the mixture of fe3o4 and naoh was uniformly and slowly pumped into the hexahydrate magnesium chloride solution by a peristaltic pump and constantly stirred during its addition mmhc was prepared under the condition of mg2 and oh ratio of 1 to 2 this is denoted hereafter as mmhc 1 two other different types of mmhc can be obtained by changing the mass of mgcl2 6h2o and naoh mmhc 2 1 1 20 3 g mgcl2 6h2o and 4 g naoh mmhc 3 1 4 10 2 g mgcl2 6h2o and 8 g naoh under the same configuration conditions in addition mmhc was prepared and stored at room temperature then the particle size distribution and the change of the coagulation removal efficiency of mmhc at 0 h 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 3 h after preparation were tested respectively to study the effect of aging time aging means that in the process of precipitation after the precipitation is complete the solution is kept still for a period of time under certain conditions the purpose is to make the components inside fully react or to make the suspended solids settle 2 3 jar test batch coagulation experiment was carried out on a programmable six mixer with 1 l controlled jar test apparatus beakers zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china at 20 1 c the simulated water was introduced into a 1 l beaker and 0 05 g microplastic particles polyethylene 270 μm were added the solution with microplastic was rapidly mixed at the set agitation speed of 300 rpm for 120 s followed by a slow mixing phase at 125 rpm for 150 s and then a 5 min settling time magnetic magnesium hydroxide and non ionic pam molecular weight 12 million beijing cool chemical technology co ltd china were added 10 s after the fast stirring phase and 15 s before the slow stirring phase after coagulation and sedimentation zeta potential was measured by sampling the supernatant at 3 cm and the characteristics of the flocs coated with microplastics were collected for characterization to ensure the repeatability of the experiment and the credibility of the data each jar test was conducted twice or three times 2 4 analysis method the morphology of magnetic magnesium hydroxide was obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 czech and its composition and size distribution were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nicolet is 10 ft ir spectrometer thermo scientific usa x ray diffraction zsx primus ii rigaku corporation japan and mastersizer 2000 malvern uk the flocculation index fi and the size distribution of flocs in the flocculation experiment were also monitored by an on line intelligent particle dispersion analyzer ipda pda2000 econovel korea and mastersizer 2000 the suspensions before and after coagulation were extracted for zeta potential determination by zetasizer nano zs malvern uk 2 5 removal efficiency of microplastics the microplastics used in this study float on water because of their small density 0 962 g cm3 therefore weight method was used to calculate the removal efficiency of microplastics after the coagulation the microplastics suspended on the water surface were transferred to another beaker with a needle tube and rinsed with hydrochloric acid hcl three times to remove the impurities then filter with 0 45 μm nylon membrane the microplastics after extraction were dried in the oven at 110 c for 3 h to a constant weight 2 microplastics removal efficiency m 0 m 1 m 0 where m 0 is the weight of microplastics added to each beaker before the coagulation experiment began and m 1 is the weight of microplastics floating on the water after coagulation 2 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed by ibm statistics spss the independent sample t test was used to analyze the significant relationship between the removal efficiency of mg oh 2 pam and fe3o4 the α value is 0 05 with a 95 confidence interval if p 0 05 there was no significant difference if p 0 05 the opposite result was found besides according to the normal distribution pearson correlation coefficient or spearman correlation coefficient was selected to analyze the correlation between reagent dosage and removal efficiency correlation coefficient above 0 7 indicates a strong correlation between 0 4 and 0 7 is a moderate correlation and below 0 4 it indicates a lower correlation 42 46 2 7 contamination control cotton lab coats and latex gloves were worn to avoid microplastic contamination in the laboratory environment glass apparatus were also used to avoid contamination during the experiment two 1 l of ultrapure water samples were transferred to 1 l beakers as a blank control test to detect microplastic particles in the air 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of microplastics by magnetic magnesium hydroxide with different ratios by comparing the removal efficiency of different coagulants the coagulant with higher removal efficiency for microplastics was selected for subsequent experiments as for the four coagulants described in fig 1 the microplastic removal efficiencies of mmhc 2 and mmhc 1 was considerable reaching 87 1 and 81 9 respectively however for magnetic magnesium hydroxide such as mmhc 3 prepared at a higher oh concentration the removal efficiency was reduced to 66 3 at the same time nearly 70 of the microplastics were removed in the presence of mhc in addition the previous study by shahi et al 43 showed that when the dosage of alum as coagulant was increased to 30 mg l it also had 70 7 removal efficiency for microplastics similar to ma et al 35 and zhou et al 36 rajala et al 46 also used similar iron and aluminum coagulants to show amazing removal efficiency of 99 4 and 98 2 for microplastics 1 μm according to the comparison of experimental conditions between this study and other studies in table 2 differences in microplastic removal efficiency are likely due to factors such as microplastic size coagulant and coagulant dosage and mixing conditions in order to further explore the microscopic particle size characteristics of the four coagulants particle size distribution was studied as shown in fig 2 d10 d50 d90 represent the coagulant diameter respectively 10 50 90 cumulative coagulant distribution of particle size distribution d50 is also known as mean particle size or median diameter the results show that the d10 of the four coagulants is very close between 13 μm and 18 μm which can be observed in fig 2a the median particle size d50 of mmhc 1 and mmhc 3 was 81 μm and 75 μm respectively and the mhc of d50 was only 57 μm and that of mmhc 2 was 147 μm this showed that larger particle size was beneficial to improve the removal efficiency of microplastics because the larger particle size of the coagulant will produce larger flocs in the process of coagulation for d90 mmhc 2 reached an extremely high level of 480 μm while the other three coagulants only maintained at about 270 μm the same result can be obtained from fig 2b the peak of mmhc 2 is on the right and bimodal while the other three are shifted to the left in turn indicating that the particle size of mmhc 2 is larger among them different from the bimodal curves of mmhc 2 and mhc both mmhc 1 and mmhc 3 have only one protrude which proves that the particle size of unimodal distribution is more continuous and uniform compared with the bimodal curves of relative jump distribution 47 3 2 characterization of magnetic magnesium hydroxide with different ratios in order to further clarify the internal mechanism of the binding of magnesium hydroxide with fe3o4 the chemical bonds between the magnetic magnesium hydroxide and the single magnesium hydroxide were compared and analyzed by using ftir fig 3 a there is an obvious and prominent peak of 3700 cm 1 in all the four spectra in the fig 3a which can be attributed to the oh stretching in the crystal structure of mg oh 2 48 however three different ratios of magnetic magnesium hydroxide showed two new peaks 450 cm 1 and 580 cm 1 the former can be attributed to the mgo stretching vibration in mg oh 2 49 and the latter corresponds to the vibration of the feo bond in the lattice of fe3o4 crystal 50 the peak values of carbonate content in the material are 1450 and 880 cm 1 the wide range of absorption peaks at 3400 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 indicates the presence of bound water 51 52 as can be seen from fig 3b the diffraction peaks of mhc at 2θ 18 53 37 98 50 78 and 58 67 correspond to 001 101 102 and 110 reflections respectively which can be identified as magnesium hydroxide according to the jcpds 44 1482 similarly the position and relative intensities of all diffraction peak at 2θ 30 22 35 56 62 66 can be assigned to the crystal faces of 220 311 440 so the fe3o4 in mmhc is confirmed jcpds 01 072 2303 as shown in fig 4 the surface morphology after the formation of three different proportions of magnetic magnesium hydroxide was analyzed by sem fig 4a illustrated that when the ratio of mg2 to oh was 1 2 the morphology was irregular and there were few particles on the surface magnesium hydroxide and fe3o4 were closely combined to form uniform vesicular pellet particles with large gaps between each cluster which may be caused by the relative increase of mg2 concentration when the ratio rises to 1 1 as can be clearly observed in fig 4b this morphology was greatly different from the irregular smooth surface presented by the materials prepared by combining fe3o4 and pacl in the previous study of zhang et al 53 perhaps it is this bubble structure that increases the collision between the coagulant and the particulate matter in simulated wastewater during the coagulation process which makes it form uniform and dense flocs thus obtaining better removal efficiency however when the concentration of oh was increased the result shown in fig 4c was obtained different from the previous two no particles were generated on the surface but only sparse structure with holes on the surface at the same time it can be seen from the sem of mhc fig 4d that its surface is relatively flat compared to mmhc 3 there is not even a hole structure in section 3 1 the decrease in mmhc 3 and mhc removal efficiency may be attributed to the disappearance of these pellet and sparse hole structures 3 3 effect of dosage on removal efficiency of microplastics as mentioned above in the case of using mmhc 2 the ph value of the synthetic water was fixed at 7 00 to optimize the dosage of the coagulant the removal efficiency of the three coagulants under different dosages was shown in fig 5 the results showed that the effects of different dosages of three types of coagulants on the removal efficiency of microplastics had their own characteristics with the increase of mg oh 2 dosage from 50 mg l to 100 mg l the removal efficiency also significantly increased from 20 1 to 70 7 until the increase of mg oh 2 dosage to 200 mg l microplastics removal efficiency can be up to 92 1 fig 5a however when the dosage of mg oh 2 reached 250 mg l the result showed that the removal efficiency of this process was significantly reduced to 83 2 which was nearly 10 lower than the previous removal efficiency at 200 mg l this may be attributed to the electrical transformation of the negatively charged colloid in the water caused by the excess of the coagulant due to the stabilization of the surface due to the adsorption of too many positive ions the same result can be obtained from fig 5a it can be clearly observed that the fi value which reflected actually the change in floc size at 200 mg l was greater than 250 mg l and reached a significant value of 9 86 at 130 s while the fi value at 250 mg l was only 8 48 54 55 when the dosage was 50 mg l the fi value increased slowly and consistently below 2 6 which was due to the smaller dosage and correspondingly smaller flocs generated this was also expected it showed that the removal efficiency of microplastics was greatly promoted by increasing the concentration of mg oh 2 200 mg l it can be seen from fig 5c that the influence of pam dosage on the removal efficiency of microplastics has the same trend as that of mg oh 2 also with the increase of pam dosage the removal efficiency increased gradually and stably finally when the dosage of pam was 4 mg l or 5 mg l the removal efficiency was stable at about 92 6 it was worth noting that the removal efficiency was 8 4 without adding pam which corresponded to a straight line in the fi value graph with the subsequent increase of pam concentration the reflected fi value curve was also slightly different the fi value was maintained at a slightly higher level between 130 and 330 s at 1 mg l and dropped rapidly after 350 s however at the dose with high removal efficiency 4 mg l or 5 mg l the fi value reached the maximum value of 9 29 at about 130 s and then decreased which was caused by the rapid formation of flocs with large size and fast precipitation rate nevertheless the effect of fe3o4 on the removal of microplastics was significantly different from the former two and its trend was relatively smooth fig 5b although the concentration of fe3o4 increased from 40 mg l to 200 mg l in an orderly manner its removal efficiency of microplastics changed little varying between 87 3 and 92 5 it can also be seen from fig 5b i e variation of fi with time that curves with different dosage were roughly similar the highest fi value of 9 23 can also be obtained at 200 mg l this indicated that the increase of fe3o4 dosage increased the fi value but the improvement of removal efficiency was not obvious moreover independent sample t test table 3 was conducted between the removal efficiency of mg oh 2 fe3o4 and pam table 4 with the change of dosage the results showed that the p values were greater than 0 05 indicating that there was no statistical significance between the removal efficiencies pearson correlation analysis table 5 between the respective dosage and removal efficiency table 4 showed that pearson correlation coefficients between mg oh 2 dosage and its removal efficiency and between pam dosage and its removal efficiency were 0 792 and 0 941 respectively thus a significant correlation was obtained by contrast the correlation coefficient between fe3o4 and its removal efficiency was 0 257 indicating that it was generally correlated which may be explained by its gentle removal efficiency 3 4 effect of aging time on removal efficiency of microplastics in view of the relatively few previous studies on the influence of aging time on coagulants after preparation this study decided to take aging time as the influencing factor to further explore the particle size distribution of mmhc 2 within 3 h after preparation and its microplastic processing performance fig 6 a illustrated the particle size variation of mmhc 2 with time aging the results showed that the particle size of 400 μm accounted for 4 5 of the total volume of the immediately prepared mmhc 2 in the following 0 5 h the curve showed a three peak distribution and an increasing trend because the curve shifted to the right when compared with the curve at 0 h in addition the value of 1 μm increased from 0 05 at time 0 to about 1 after 1 3 h of aging the curve returned to bimodal distribution from three peaks and the volume distribution of 1 μm decreased overall the d50 of mmhc 2 decreased from 147 μm to about 24 μm during 3 h aging differently the aging of mhc particle size reached stability faster as shown in fig 6c among the two peaks at 0 h the prominent peak indicated that particles of 71 μm account for 5 2 of the total volume however after only 0 5 h of aging and the volume distribution was mainly concentrated in 20 μm which can be obtained from the almost coincidence curve perhaps by attaching fe3o4 to the mg oh 2 the magnetic force of the magnetic powder stabilizes the mg oh 2 crystals and slows them down moderately notably the particles larger than 500 μm gradually decrease with time and the curve becomes unimodal when aging for 3 h for the size of flocs produced by the two coagulants aging with time the pattern can be traced the flocs produced after the coagulation treatment of the two coagulants gradually increased with the aging time fig 6b d the floc size of mmhc 2 increased from 60 μm to 105 μm when the aging time was 0 h to 3 h the mhc climbed from 75 μm to 112 μm in the same time it was not difficult to find that the floc of mhc was larger than that of mmhc 2 which was expected it was believed that the addition of fe3o4 causes the flocs to become dense and form small pieces that were not easily broken while the flocs produced by mhc was larger but in the flocculation stage they were easy to be broken leading to the reduction of removal efficiency fig 7 however the removal efficiency of both mmhc 2 and mhc was relatively stable within 3 h aging time which maintained at about 88 and 74 respectively the removal efficiency of mmhc 2 was obviously higher than that of mhc it is worth noting that in a previous study on the aging time of aluminum sulphate coagulant it was found that the removal efficiency of aluminum sulphate coagulant on turbidity increased with the extension of aging time 56 nevertheless results in this paper indicates that aging time does have an effect on the particle size of the coagulant and the size of the flocs but has negligible effect on the final microplastic removal efficiency 3 5 effect of ph on microplastics removal efficiency and zeta potential on the basis of exploring the dosage of experimental reagent the influence of in depth water quality conditions on the removal efficiency of microplastics and the coagulation mechanism were also studied as an important parameter the ph of raw water will affect the coagulation performance therefore it is indispensable to explore the influence of ph on the removal efficiency of microplastics in the previous literature on the use of coagulation to remove microplastics some studies had a smaller ph range shahi et al 43 used alum as coagulant and only studied the condition of ph value fixed at 7 in another study rajala et al 46 used three different coagulants but only slightly increased ph from 6 5 to 7 3 in this study the ph range was extended to 5 9 as shown in fig 8 a as a whole the removal efficiency showed a slightly rising trend and was relatively stable 92 2 of the removal efficiency was obtained at ph 8 and the removal efficiency was always higher than 85 at other ph values in addition it was found that the removal efficiency under alkaline conditions was better than that under acidic conditions which may be due to the fact that mmhc 2 was alkaline and neutralized in acidic environment thus slightly affecting the removal efficiency moreover ma et al 35 and zhou et al 36 studied microplastics removal within the same ph range using ferric chloride and aluminum chloride hexahydrate as coagulants respectively with the increase of ph value the removal efficiency of both showed different trends and the maximum removal efficiencies of 64 6 and 27 5 respectively were both lower than that of this study in order to explore the coagulation mechanism the zeta potential of the solution at different ph before and after coagulation treatment is shown in fig 8b the zeta potential of the solution before treatment decreased from 47 9 mv to 54 7 mv with the increase of ph which may be due to the increase of oh so that the zeta potential decreased after coagulation treatment charge neutralization occurred during the period and the overall zeta potential increased to 18 mv or even higher this means that the highly positively charged mmhc 2 and kaolin with negative surface charge interact with each other through electrostatic adsorption to form flocs on this basis in the subsequent slow stirring stage the flocs also have the mechanism of sweep flocculation during the process of the flocs changing from tiny to visible size 4 conclusions in the present work magnesium hydroxide combined with fe3o4 was successfully prepared as a magnetic coagulant among the three kinds of mmhcs the removal efficiency is the highest when the ratio of mg2 to oh reaches 1 1 due to the dense bubble like structure on its surface by comparison mmhc 87 2 were observed to be more efficient than mhc 73 4 the d50 of mmhc 2 with the strongest removal performance was 147 μm which was the largest among the coagulants from the flocculation index and the removal efficiency of different dosage of coagulants it can be concluded that for pe microplastics 270 μm when the dosage of mg oh 2 fe3o4 and pam is 200 mg l 120 mg l and 4 mg l respectively the removal efficiency is the highest 92 6 taking aging time as the influencing factor the variation trend of particle size of mmhc 2 and mhc within 3 h after the completion of preparation the size of flocs after coagulation treatment and the removal ability were explored and found that after 3 h of aging the particle size of both mmhc 2 and mhc create a pattern of gradual decline and mmhc 2 needed a longer aging time to reach stability compared with mhc which reached stability after 0 5 h of aging on the contrary the flocs of both of them gradually increase after coagulation and the flocs size of mhc is smaller than that of mmhc 2 due to compounding of fe3o4 after taking ph into consideration the removal efficiency of microplastics by mmhc 2 can be maintained above 85 in the range of ph 5 9 indicating that mmhc 2 has a wide applicability to ph finally with the zeta potential changing from 47 5 mv to 54 7 mv of the supernatant before coagulation to about 18 mv of the supernatant after coagulation it is indicated that charge neutralization as an important mechanism of coagulation occurs in the process of microplastics removal credit authorship contribution statement yutao zhang writing original draft jianhai zhao writing review editing

13374,recently microplastics a new type of pollutant have attracted much attention around the world in this study a magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant mmhc was produced by adding magnetic particles of fe3o4 during the formation of mg oh 2 to remove polyethylene from wastewater which easily floats on the water surface and is a major component of microplastics the removal efficiency of microplastics after coagulation was compared with the traditional magnesium hydroxide coagulant mhc in addition three magnetic magnesium hydroxides were prepared by changing the ratio of mg2 to oh when magnesium hydroxide was formed scanning electron microscopy sem images showed the surface morphology of three types of magnetic magnesium hydroxide and fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir described the formation of new bonds during the formation of magnetic magnesium hydroxide the results showed that among the three types of mmhc when mg2 oh was 1 1 the removal efficiency of microplastics reached the highest of 87 1 which was 14 7 higher than that of mhc only in addition when magnetic magnesium hydroxide was added with 120 mg l of fe3o4 and 200 mg l of mg oh 2 the removal efficiency of microplastics would increase to about 92 when accompanied by the addition of 4 mg l of non ionic polyacrylamide pam however in the range of ph 5 9 the removal efficiency of microplastics did not change significantly and charge neutralization occurred in the coagulation process the particle size of the two kinds of coagulants shifted from large to small with time aging while the flocs generated by the two coagulants showed an opposite trend graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastic magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulation flocculation mechanism 1 introduction the widespread presence of microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm in the environment has been recognized as a global pollution challenge 1 2 with the production of plastic products increasing annually research showed that from 1950 to 2018 thousands of tons of microplastic pollutants were discharged into the environment 3 5 microplastics due to their small size large specific surface area hydrophobicity and weak photodegradation ability can become a good carrier in the environment they can easily absorb other organic pollutants generate more complex secondary pollutants and produce higher compound toxicity 6 9 thus in an aquatic environment a variety of organisms may ingest some of the microplastics that clog their digestive tracts and suffer some adverse effects caused by both microplastics themselves and chemical substances in microplastics 10 12 besides studies have shown that microplastics can move through the food chain posing health risks to humans by eating seafood that contains microplastics 13 14 for instance according to the food people usually consume every american citizen consumes 39 000 52 000 microplastics per year and this value is also affected by age and gender 15 another study by the university of newcastle in australia found that the average person around the world consume nearly 5 g of microplastic a week the equivalent of a credit card more importantly microplastics do not directly cause acute life effects on humans and animals but slowly produce toxicity over time which is considered a crucial issue that is often overlooked 2 therefore there is an urgent need for a comprehensive study of microplastics currently several researches with respect to microplastics have focused on the abundance occurrence type size shape and color of microplastics in various water environments previous studies have found that polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyamide pa are the main six polymers of microplastics 16 among them polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp particles separately comprised up to 90 of microplastics 17 19 in the case of microplastic shapes it has been proven that there are also six main shapes fibers granular pellets films foams and fragments 20 and similar to the types of microplastics the shape of microplastics with different water sources is discrepant from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in canada microplastics in the form of fiber and debris accounted for 93 7 of the total 21 nevertheless an analysis of water samples from xiangxi bay in china s three gorges reservoir found that sheet and fragment forms of microplastics were the dominant shapes 22 furthermore it was pointed out in the literatures that the color of microplastics was mainly transparent and white after studying the water sources of three wwtps in different areas of three cities in china 16 23 24 however another study showed that microplastics in wwtps were predominantly red green and blue 25 what is worth mentioning although microplastics can be treated in wwtps with efficiencies of up to 98 they cannot be completely removed even in tertiary treatment 26 therefore wwtps have been considered as a source of microplastics entering the environment in some studies 27 28 not only that personal care products laundry household dust tires and road wear particles can all be sources of microplastics 29 finally anecdotal evidence suggested that due to the sampling method of the microplastics analyzed the size analysis method e g infrared spectroscopy or raman spectroscopy and even the size classification method varied considerably among studies which made it impossible to compare the abundance and size of microplastics directly and in detail 30 while microplastic pollution in domestic wastewater and global aquatic systems is a known threat to marine life and human health advanced technologies for the effective control and purification of microplastics are still largely underdeveloped it is worth noting that current research on microplastics is not only concerned with a wide range of properties of microplastics but also puts a lot of efforts into the substantial removal of microplastics from the macroscopic point of view even if the wwtp is not so targeted for the removal of microplastics there is no doubt that the wwtp is a powerful method to remove microplastics microplastics removal efficiencies of 35 59 and 50 98 were obtained by pretreatment and primary treatment respectively and after secondary treatment the microplastics in the wastewater will be further reduced to 0 2 14 with substantial tertiary treatment support microplastics can be reduced to a staggering 0 2 2 26 from another microscopic point of view there is no shortage of novel processes for removing microplastics misra et al 31 combined iron oxide and porous silicon dioxide to create a magnetic polyoxometalate supported ionic liquid phases magpom silps which results in a microplastic removal efficiency of up to 100 table 1 similarly magnetic carbon nanotubes were used to remove microplastics with remarkable efficiency of 100 32 besides novel and robust nanocarbon springs were synthesized via solid pyrolysis and simultaneously engineered nitrogen dopants and encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles and the removal efficiency of microplastics can be a relatively respectable 50 33 furthermore sun et al 34 investigated a reusable compressed sponge prepared from chitin and graphene oxide chgo have a stable adsorption efficiency of 72 4 89 8 to microplastics at ph 6 8 however some researchers have proved that traditional coagulation treatment can also have a remarkable treatment effect on microplastics for example ma et al 35 and zhou et al 36 achieved the maximum microplastic removal efficiency of 61 and 77 83 respectively through traditional coagulation experiments with the use of aluminum and iron coagulants it is worth noting that the magalhães et al 37 have verified the cationic hydrophobically modified cellulose as biological flocculating agent handling microplastics therefore coagulation flocculation treatment is a particularly promising technology for microplastics processing however in order to obtain significant treatment performance the widely used aluminum salt 20 mg l 405 mg l al 35 and iron salt 30 mg l 180 mg l feci3 36 coagulant must maintain a large dosage which may lead to excessive residual aluminum content in the effluent and color of the effluent thus affecting human health 38 in contrast magnesium hydroxide as a coagulant has strong adsorption capacity stability and stable buffering no corrosive security non toxic etc and is a type of environmentally friendly water treatment agent 39 in a previous study zhao et al 40 have used magnesium hydroxide coagulant for the treatment of dyes wastewater and found that the removal efficiency of reactive orange can reach 99 3 in addition the addition of fe3o4 particles into the coagulant is a magnetic coagulation technology developed on the basis of the conventional coagulation process the addition of magnetic particles can combine with the flocs to form a large magnetic flocs which well makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional coagulation technology especially in reducing the coagulation time and accelerating the sedimentation rate the objective of this study is to prepare a magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant mmhc through the combination of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and fe3o4 and to use non ionic pam a hydrophilic polymer as the flocculant which can form flocs with superior settling performance through adsorption bridging polymerization between the unstable particles the removal characteristics of microplastics in wastewater were further investigated under the coagulation system of magnetic magnesium hydroxide and pam the morphologic characteristics of magnetic magnesium hydroxide with different ratios mg2 oh were investigated coagulant size distribution and flocculation index fi were used to explore the influence of flocculation time and different experimental conditions on the removal efficiency of microplastics in addition the coagulation mechanism between microplastics and coagulants was determined it is hoped to provide a perspective and theoretical basis for the future research direction and removal methods of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of simulated wastewater all reagents used in this experiment are analytical reagent ar except for those mentioned especially humic acid tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute co china and kaolin tianjin kewei co china were used to simulate natural water samples the first step was to preliminarily dissolve 60 mg humic acid under alkaline conditions then mix 120 mg of kaolin with dissolved humic acid and add 6 l of ultrapure water adjust ph to 12 with 2 mol l of sodium hydroxide solution naoh tianjin huihang chemical technology co china and stir for 5 h in magnetic stirring to fully dissolve and mix well after mixing the ph value was altered to 7 by hydrochloric acid hcl tianjin huihang chemical technology co china and stored at room temperature as a stock solution until the coagulation experiment 2 2 synthesis of magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant naoh mgcl2 6h2o and fe3o4 tianjin damao chemical reagent factory were used in this experiment to prepare magnetic magnesium hydroxide coagulant which can change the ratio of mg2 to oh to obtain three different types by eq 1 1 m g 2 2 o h mg oh 2 the preparation method was as follows in a beaker 10 2 g magnesium chloride hexahydrate were weighted and dissolved with 150 ml ultrapure water then 4 g sodium hydroxide was fully dissolved in 100 ml ultrapure water under the stirring of glass rod followed the addition of fe3o4 and uniform mixing with sodium hydroxide solution finally the mixture of fe3o4 and naoh was uniformly and slowly pumped into the hexahydrate magnesium chloride solution by a peristaltic pump and constantly stirred during its addition mmhc was prepared under the condition of mg2 and oh ratio of 1 to 2 this is denoted hereafter as mmhc 1 two other different types of mmhc can be obtained by changing the mass of mgcl2 6h2o and naoh mmhc 2 1 1 20 3 g mgcl2 6h2o and 4 g naoh mmhc 3 1 4 10 2 g mgcl2 6h2o and 8 g naoh under the same configuration conditions in addition mmhc was prepared and stored at room temperature then the particle size distribution and the change of the coagulation removal efficiency of mmhc at 0 h 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 3 h after preparation were tested respectively to study the effect of aging time aging means that in the process of precipitation after the precipitation is complete the solution is kept still for a period of time under certain conditions the purpose is to make the components inside fully react or to make the suspended solids settle 2 3 jar test batch coagulation experiment was carried out on a programmable six mixer with 1 l controlled jar test apparatus beakers zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china at 20 1 c the simulated water was introduced into a 1 l beaker and 0 05 g microplastic particles polyethylene 270 μm were added the solution with microplastic was rapidly mixed at the set agitation speed of 300 rpm for 120 s followed by a slow mixing phase at 125 rpm for 150 s and then a 5 min settling time magnetic magnesium hydroxide and non ionic pam molecular weight 12 million beijing cool chemical technology co ltd china were added 10 s after the fast stirring phase and 15 s before the slow stirring phase after coagulation and sedimentation zeta potential was measured by sampling the supernatant at 3 cm and the characteristics of the flocs coated with microplastics were collected for characterization to ensure the repeatability of the experiment and the credibility of the data each jar test was conducted twice or three times 2 4 analysis method the morphology of magnetic magnesium hydroxide was obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 czech and its composition and size distribution were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nicolet is 10 ft ir spectrometer thermo scientific usa x ray diffraction zsx primus ii rigaku corporation japan and mastersizer 2000 malvern uk the flocculation index fi and the size distribution of flocs in the flocculation experiment were also monitored by an on line intelligent particle dispersion analyzer ipda pda2000 econovel korea and mastersizer 2000 the suspensions before and after coagulation were extracted for zeta potential determination by zetasizer nano zs malvern uk 2 5 removal efficiency of microplastics the microplastics used in this study float on water because of their small density 0 962 g cm3 therefore weight method was used to calculate the removal efficiency of microplastics after the coagulation the microplastics suspended on the water surface were transferred to another beaker with a needle tube and rinsed with hydrochloric acid hcl three times to remove the impurities then filter with 0 45 μm nylon membrane the microplastics after extraction were dried in the oven at 110 c for 3 h to a constant weight 2 microplastics removal efficiency m 0 m 1 m 0 where m 0 is the weight of microplastics added to each beaker before the coagulation experiment began and m 1 is the weight of microplastics floating on the water after coagulation 2 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed by ibm statistics spss the independent sample t test was used to analyze the significant relationship between the removal efficiency of mg oh 2 pam and fe3o4 the α value is 0 05 with a 95 confidence interval if p 0 05 there was no significant difference if p 0 05 the opposite result was found besides according to the normal distribution pearson correlation coefficient or spearman correlation coefficient was selected to analyze the correlation between reagent dosage and removal efficiency correlation coefficient above 0 7 indicates a strong correlation between 0 4 and 0 7 is a moderate correlation and below 0 4 it indicates a lower correlation 42 46 2 7 contamination control cotton lab coats and latex gloves were worn to avoid microplastic contamination in the laboratory environment glass apparatus were also used to avoid contamination during the experiment two 1 l of ultrapure water samples were transferred to 1 l beakers as a blank control test to detect microplastic particles in the air 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of microplastics by magnetic magnesium hydroxide with different ratios by comparing the removal efficiency of different coagulants the coagulant with higher removal efficiency for microplastics was selected for subsequent experiments as for the four coagulants described in fig 1 the microplastic removal efficiencies of mmhc 2 and mmhc 1 was considerable reaching 87 1 and 81 9 respectively however for magnetic magnesium hydroxide such as mmhc 3 prepared at a higher oh concentration the removal efficiency was reduced to 66 3 at the same time nearly 70 of the microplastics were removed in the presence of mhc in addition the previous study by shahi et al 43 showed that when the dosage of alum as coagulant was increased to 30 mg l it also had 70 7 removal efficiency for microplastics similar to ma et al 35 and zhou et al 36 rajala et al 46 also used similar iron and aluminum coagulants to show amazing removal efficiency of 99 4 and 98 2 for microplastics 1 μm according to the comparison of experimental conditions between this study and other studies in table 2 differences in microplastic removal efficiency are likely due to factors such as microplastic size coagulant and coagulant dosage and mixing conditions in order to further explore the microscopic particle size characteristics of the four coagulants particle size distribution was studied as shown in fig 2 d10 d50 d90 represent the coagulant diameter respectively 10 50 90 cumulative coagulant distribution of particle size distribution d50 is also known as mean particle size or median diameter the results show that the d10 of the four coagulants is very close between 13 μm and 18 μm which can be observed in fig 2a the median particle size d50 of mmhc 1 and mmhc 3 was 81 μm and 75 μm respectively and the mhc of d50 was only 57 μm and that of mmhc 2 was 147 μm this showed that larger particle size was beneficial to improve the removal efficiency of microplastics because the larger particle size of the coagulant will produce larger flocs in the process of coagulation for d90 mmhc 2 reached an extremely high level of 480 μm while the other three coagulants only maintained at about 270 μm the same result can be obtained from fig 2b the peak of mmhc 2 is on the right and bimodal while the other three are shifted to the left in turn indicating that the particle size of mmhc 2 is larger among them different from the bimodal curves of mmhc 2 and mhc both mmhc 1 and mmhc 3 have only one protrude which proves that the particle size of unimodal distribution is more continuous and uniform compared with the bimodal curves of relative jump distribution 47 3 2 characterization of magnetic magnesium hydroxide with different ratios in order to further clarify the internal mechanism of the binding of magnesium hydroxide with fe3o4 the chemical bonds between the magnetic magnesium hydroxide and the single magnesium hydroxide were compared and analyzed by using ftir fig 3 a there is an obvious and prominent peak of 3700 cm 1 in all the four spectra in the fig 3a which can be attributed to the oh stretching in the crystal structure of mg oh 2 48 however three different ratios of magnetic magnesium hydroxide showed two new peaks 450 cm 1 and 580 cm 1 the former can be attributed to the mgo stretching vibration in mg oh 2 49 and the latter corresponds to the vibration of the feo bond in the lattice of fe3o4 crystal 50 the peak values of carbonate content in the material are 1450 and 880 cm 1 the wide range of absorption peaks at 3400 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 indicates the presence of bound water 51 52 as can be seen from fig 3b the diffraction peaks of mhc at 2θ 18 53 37 98 50 78 and 58 67 correspond to 001 101 102 and 110 reflections respectively which can be identified as magnesium hydroxide according to the jcpds 44 1482 similarly the position and relative intensities of all diffraction peak at 2θ 30 22 35 56 62 66 can be assigned to the crystal faces of 220 311 440 so the fe3o4 in mmhc is confirmed jcpds 01 072 2303 as shown in fig 4 the surface morphology after the formation of three different proportions of magnetic magnesium hydroxide was analyzed by sem fig 4a illustrated that when the ratio of mg2 to oh was 1 2 the morphology was irregular and there were few particles on the surface magnesium hydroxide and fe3o4 were closely combined to form uniform vesicular pellet particles with large gaps between each cluster which may be caused by the relative increase of mg2 concentration when the ratio rises to 1 1 as can be clearly observed in fig 4b this morphology was greatly different from the irregular smooth surface presented by the materials prepared by combining fe3o4 and pacl in the previous study of zhang et al 53 perhaps it is this bubble structure that increases the collision between the coagulant and the particulate matter in simulated wastewater during the coagulation process which makes it form uniform and dense flocs thus obtaining better removal efficiency however when the concentration of oh was increased the result shown in fig 4c was obtained different from the previous two no particles were generated on the surface but only sparse structure with holes on the surface at the same time it can be seen from the sem of mhc fig 4d that its surface is relatively flat compared to mmhc 3 there is not even a hole structure in section 3 1 the decrease in mmhc 3 and mhc removal efficiency may be attributed to the disappearance of these pellet and sparse hole structures 3 3 effect of dosage on removal efficiency of microplastics as mentioned above in the case of using mmhc 2 the ph value of the synthetic water was fixed at 7 00 to optimize the dosage of the coagulant the removal efficiency of the three coagulants under different dosages was shown in fig 5 the results showed that the effects of different dosages of three types of coagulants on the removal efficiency of microplastics had their own characteristics with the increase of mg oh 2 dosage from 50 mg l to 100 mg l the removal efficiency also significantly increased from 20 1 to 70 7 until the increase of mg oh 2 dosage to 200 mg l microplastics removal efficiency can be up to 92 1 fig 5a however when the dosage of mg oh 2 reached 250 mg l the result showed that the removal efficiency of this process was significantly reduced to 83 2 which was nearly 10 lower than the previous removal efficiency at 200 mg l this may be attributed to the electrical transformation of the negatively charged colloid in the water caused by the excess of the coagulant due to the stabilization of the surface due to the adsorption of too many positive ions the same result can be obtained from fig 5a it can be clearly observed that the fi value which reflected actually the change in floc size at 200 mg l was greater than 250 mg l and reached a significant value of 9 86 at 130 s while the fi value at 250 mg l was only 8 48 54 55 when the dosage was 50 mg l the fi value increased slowly and consistently below 2 6 which was due to the smaller dosage and correspondingly smaller flocs generated this was also expected it showed that the removal efficiency of microplastics was greatly promoted by increasing the concentration of mg oh 2 200 mg l it can be seen from fig 5c that the influence of pam dosage on the removal efficiency of microplastics has the same trend as that of mg oh 2 also with the increase of pam dosage the removal efficiency increased gradually and stably finally when the dosage of pam was 4 mg l or 5 mg l the removal efficiency was stable at about 92 6 it was worth noting that the removal efficiency was 8 4 without adding pam which corresponded to a straight line in the fi value graph with the subsequent increase of pam concentration the reflected fi value curve was also slightly different the fi value was maintained at a slightly higher level between 130 and 330 s at 1 mg l and dropped rapidly after 350 s however at the dose with high removal efficiency 4 mg l or 5 mg l the fi value reached the maximum value of 9 29 at about 130 s and then decreased which was caused by the rapid formation of flocs with large size and fast precipitation rate nevertheless the effect of fe3o4 on the removal of microplastics was significantly different from the former two and its trend was relatively smooth fig 5b although the concentration of fe3o4 increased from 40 mg l to 200 mg l in an orderly manner its removal efficiency of microplastics changed little varying between 87 3 and 92 5 it can also be seen from fig 5b i e variation of fi with time that curves with different dosage were roughly similar the highest fi value of 9 23 can also be obtained at 200 mg l this indicated that the increase of fe3o4 dosage increased the fi value but the improvement of removal efficiency was not obvious moreover independent sample t test table 3 was conducted between the removal efficiency of mg oh 2 fe3o4 and pam table 4 with the change of dosage the results showed that the p values were greater than 0 05 indicating that there was no statistical significance between the removal efficiencies pearson correlation analysis table 5 between the respective dosage and removal efficiency table 4 showed that pearson correlation coefficients between mg oh 2 dosage and its removal efficiency and between pam dosage and its removal efficiency were 0 792 and 0 941 respectively thus a significant correlation was obtained by contrast the correlation coefficient between fe3o4 and its removal efficiency was 0 257 indicating that it was generally correlated which may be explained by its gentle removal efficiency 3 4 effect of aging time on removal efficiency of microplastics in view of the relatively few previous studies on the influence of aging time on coagulants after preparation this study decided to take aging time as the influencing factor to further explore the particle size distribution of mmhc 2 within 3 h after preparation and its microplastic processing performance fig 6 a illustrated the particle size variation of mmhc 2 with time aging the results showed that the particle size of 400 μm accounted for 4 5 of the total volume of the immediately prepared mmhc 2 in the following 0 5 h the curve showed a three peak distribution and an increasing trend because the curve shifted to the right when compared with the curve at 0 h in addition the value of 1 μm increased from 0 05 at time 0 to about 1 after 1 3 h of aging the curve returned to bimodal distribution from three peaks and the volume distribution of 1 μm decreased overall the d50 of mmhc 2 decreased from 147 μm to about 24 μm during 3 h aging differently the aging of mhc particle size reached stability faster as shown in fig 6c among the two peaks at 0 h the prominent peak indicated that particles of 71 μm account for 5 2 of the total volume however after only 0 5 h of aging and the volume distribution was mainly concentrated in 20 μm which can be obtained from the almost coincidence curve perhaps by attaching fe3o4 to the mg oh 2 the magnetic force of the magnetic powder stabilizes the mg oh 2 crystals and slows them down moderately notably the particles larger than 500 μm gradually decrease with time and the curve becomes unimodal when aging for 3 h for the size of flocs produced by the two coagulants aging with time the pattern can be traced the flocs produced after the coagulation treatment of the two coagulants gradually increased with the aging time fig 6b d the floc size of mmhc 2 increased from 60 μm to 105 μm when the aging time was 0 h to 3 h the mhc climbed from 75 μm to 112 μm in the same time it was not difficult to find that the floc of mhc was larger than that of mmhc 2 which was expected it was believed that the addition of fe3o4 causes the flocs to become dense and form small pieces that were not easily broken while the flocs produced by mhc was larger but in the flocculation stage they were easy to be broken leading to the reduction of removal efficiency fig 7 however the removal efficiency of both mmhc 2 and mhc was relatively stable within 3 h aging time which maintained at about 88 and 74 respectively the removal efficiency of mmhc 2 was obviously higher than that of mhc it is worth noting that in a previous study on the aging time of aluminum sulphate coagulant it was found that the removal efficiency of aluminum sulphate coagulant on turbidity increased with the extension of aging time 56 nevertheless results in this paper indicates that aging time does have an effect on the particle size of the coagulant and the size of the flocs but has negligible effect on the final microplastic removal efficiency 3 5 effect of ph on microplastics removal efficiency and zeta potential on the basis of exploring the dosage of experimental reagent the influence of in depth water quality conditions on the removal efficiency of microplastics and the coagulation mechanism were also studied as an important parameter the ph of raw water will affect the coagulation performance therefore it is indispensable to explore the influence of ph on the removal efficiency of microplastics in the previous literature on the use of coagulation to remove microplastics some studies had a smaller ph range shahi et al 43 used alum as coagulant and only studied the condition of ph value fixed at 7 in another study rajala et al 46 used three different coagulants but only slightly increased ph from 6 5 to 7 3 in this study the ph range was extended to 5 9 as shown in fig 8 a as a whole the removal efficiency showed a slightly rising trend and was relatively stable 92 2 of the removal efficiency was obtained at ph 8 and the removal efficiency was always higher than 85 at other ph values in addition it was found that the removal efficiency under alkaline conditions was better than that under acidic conditions which may be due to the fact that mmhc 2 was alkaline and neutralized in acidic environment thus slightly affecting the removal efficiency moreover ma et al 35 and zhou et al 36 studied microplastics removal within the same ph range using ferric chloride and aluminum chloride hexahydrate as coagulants respectively with the increase of ph value the removal efficiency of both showed different trends and the maximum removal efficiencies of 64 6 and 27 5 respectively were both lower than that of this study in order to explore the coagulation mechanism the zeta potential of the solution at different ph before and after coagulation treatment is shown in fig 8b the zeta potential of the solution before treatment decreased from 47 9 mv to 54 7 mv with the increase of ph which may be due to the increase of oh so that the zeta potential decreased after coagulation treatment charge neutralization occurred during the period and the overall zeta potential increased to 18 mv or even higher this means that the highly positively charged mmhc 2 and kaolin with negative surface charge interact with each other through electrostatic adsorption to form flocs on this basis in the subsequent slow stirring stage the flocs also have the mechanism of sweep flocculation during the process of the flocs changing from tiny to visible size 4 conclusions in the present work magnesium hydroxide combined with fe3o4 was successfully prepared as a magnetic coagulant among the three kinds of mmhcs the removal efficiency is the highest when the ratio of mg2 to oh reaches 1 1 due to the dense bubble like structure on its surface by comparison mmhc 87 2 were observed to be more efficient than mhc 73 4 the d50 of mmhc 2 with the strongest removal performance was 147 μm which was the largest among the coagulants from the flocculation index and the removal efficiency of different dosage of coagulants it can be concluded that for pe microplastics 270 μm when the dosage of mg oh 2 fe3o4 and pam is 200 mg l 120 mg l and 4 mg l respectively the removal efficiency is the highest 92 6 taking aging time as the influencing factor the variation trend of particle size of mmhc 2 and mhc within 3 h after the completion of preparation the size of flocs after coagulation treatment and the removal ability were explored and found that after 3 h of aging the particle size of both mmhc 2 and mhc create a pattern of gradual decline and mmhc 2 needed a longer aging time to reach stability compared with mhc which reached stability after 0 5 h of aging on the contrary the flocs of both of them gradually increase after coagulation and the flocs size of mhc is smaller than that of mmhc 2 due to compounding of fe3o4 after taking ph into consideration the removal efficiency of microplastics by mmhc 2 can be maintained above 85 in the range of ph 5 9 indicating that mmhc 2 has a wide applicability to ph finally with the zeta potential changing from 47 5 mv to 54 7 mv of the supernatant before coagulation to about 18 mv of the supernatant after coagulation it is indicated that charge neutralization as an important mechanism of coagulation occurs in the process of microplastics removal credit authorship contribution statement yutao zhang writing original draft jianhai zhao writing review editing
