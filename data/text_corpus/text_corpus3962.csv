19810,presence of iodinated x ray contrast media icms in source water is of high concern because of their potential to form highly toxic iodinated disinfection by products i dbps this study investigated kinetics mechanisms and products for oxidation of one icms iopamidol ipm by ferrate fe vi the obtained apparent second order rate constants for oxidation of ipm by fe vi ranged from 0 7 m 1 s 1 to 74 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 10 0 which were highly dependent on ph it was found that the oxidation of ipm by fe vi led to the formation of highly toxic i dbps iodoform if iodoacetic acid and triiodoacetic acid formations were observed during the oxidation and if dominated the formed i dbps the formation of i dbps was also governed by ph and the maximum formation of i dbps occurred at ph 9 0 transformation pathways of ipm by fe vi oxidation were speculated to proceed through deiodination amide hydrolysis and oxidation of amine reactions the deiodination reaction during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi contributed to the formation of i dbps the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was significantly higher than those of iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide which was consistent with the lowest molecular orbital energy gap of ipm although fe vi is considered as a green oxidant the formation of highly toxic i dbps during the oxidation of ipm should receive great attention graphical abstract image 1 keywords ferrate iopamidol kinetics iodinated disinfection by products 1 introduction iodinated x ray contrast media icms are widely administrated to image soft tissues during diagnostic tests these pharmaceuticals are metabolically stable in the body and can be discarded rapidly via urine and feces it has been reported that up to 120 g of icms are used per application with approximately 75 million patient applications annually christiansen 2005 as conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps cannot remove icms effectively they have been detected widely in wwtps effluents surface water and even drinking water seitz et al 2006 perez and barcelo 2007 four kinds of icms have been detected in an occurrence study of source waters from 10 cities in the united states and iopamidol ipm was the most frequently detected media with concentrations up to 2 7 μg l 1 duirk et al 2011 additionally 98 ng l 1 of ipm was found in the finished drinking water in european waterworks seitz et al 2006 which is a few orders of magnitude higher than those of many other micro pollutants simazaki et al 2015 because of the biological recalcitrance of ipm continued physicochemical efforts including ozone γ irradiation radical oxidation and ultrasound have been made to degrade ipm from water ning and graham 2008 seitz et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 wendel et al 2014 simazaki et al 2015 dong et al 2017a the removal of ipm however inevitably is accompanied by the formation of products or disinfection by products dbps that potentially can be even more toxic than the parent compound matsushita et al 2015 wendel et al 2016 for example it was reported that a deiodination reaction usually occurred during the oxidation of icms which primarily resulted in the oxidation of the side chains seitz et al 2008 eversloh et al 2014 the deiodination reaction may induce the release of inorganic iodine from icms which becomes a potential iodine source of iodinated dbps i dbps during oxidation or disinfection wendel et al 2016 the iodine present in the source water could be oxidized to hypoiodous acid hoi by oxidant which rapidly incorporates into any organic matter present and induces the formation of i dbps liu et al 2017 during the past decade it was verified that i dbps generally are more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmental toxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogs richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 as the mass fraction of iodine in ipm molecular is up to 50 ipm not only contributes substantially to total organic iodine in water but also acts as a potential iodine source for the formation i dbps previous studies have identified 46 biotransformation products of iopromide iohexol iomeprol and ipm from aerobic soil water and sediment water systems schulz et al 2008 kormos et al 2009 2010 these products which still contain iodine in their structures may become potential sources of the iodine in formation of i dbps during disinfection duirk et al 2011 thus the products of ipm during oxidation should receive great attention for toxicity evaluation with oxidizing power higher than those of the common oxidants e g permanganate ozone and hypochlorite ferrate fe vi could react with electron rich organic moieties including phenols anilines amines estrogens and pharmaceuticals sharma et al 2001 anquandah et al 2011 dong et al 2017b meanwhile fe vi has excellent disinfectant properties and can inactivate a wide variety of microorganisms at low fe vi dosages it was reported that fe vi could inactivate escherichia coli at lower dosages or shorter contact time than hypochlorite fe vi can also kill many chlorine resistant organisms including aerobic spore formers and sulphite reducing clostridia sharma 2007 moreover the reaction of fe vi promotes the coagulation process and subsequently forms a ferric hydroxide gel which could greatly enhance the aggregation and settling process jiang and wang 2003 thus fe vi is considered as a green oxidant for water and wastewater treatment it has been accepted that fe vi is one of the few oxidants that seldom forms halogenated hazardous byproducts interestingly kralchevska et al 2016 found that fe vi could oxidize iodide i into i3 in the presence of excess i more importantly formed i3 may react with natural organic matter to yield i dbps thus it would be meaningful to investigate whether or not toxic i dbps form during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi which could provide new insight for toxicity evaluation after fe vi oxidation in this study the oxidation kinetics of ipm by fe vi was firstly investigated at different phs then the formation of i dbps including iodoform if iodoacetic acid iaa and triiodoacetic acid tiaa during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was evaluated under different water qualities the high molecular weight transformation by products tbps of ipm by fe vi were also identified and on this basis the potential degradation pathways were proposed besides the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of other three icms by fe vi was further investigated for the first time this study verified the formation of toxic i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi which helps to better understand the product and toxicity evolution of emerging icms during fe vi oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials if 99 iaa 98 tiaa

obtained from a milli q system advantage a10 millipore billerica ma usa 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 kinetics kinetic experiments were conducted in 250 ml brown glass reactors in batch mode at ambient temperature 25 c a certain volume of fe vi stock solution was added to the reactor containing ipm with a total volume of 100 ml typically the initial experimental doses of ipm and fe vi were 10 μm and 0 1 mm fe vi respectively a relatively high initial concentration of ipm was adopted for kinetic determination and tbp identification the stock solutions of fe vi 1 5 mm were freshly prepared by dissolving solid k2feo4 in ph 9 1 buffer 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate which was determined by measuring fe vi absorbance at 510 nm ε 510nm 1150 m 1 cm 1 rush et al 1996 10 mm na2hpo4 buffer was used for ph 6 0 8 0 and 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate buffer was used for ph 9 0 10 0 the kinetic experiments usually lasted 30 min and aliquots 1 0 ml each of reaction solution were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals quenched with na2s2o3 s2o3 2 fe vi o molar ratio 2 0 filtered through 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filters ion chromatography acrodisc pall and analyzed for residual ipm concentration each experiment was conducted in triplicate and the mean values were reported with error bars representing the 95 confidence interval 2 2 2 formation of i dbps the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi of was studied as a function of reaction time ph ipm concentration and nom concentration all experiments were performed in triplicate using 50 ml amber glass bottles with polytetrafluoroethylene lined septum screw caps under headspace free conditions the ph of all reaction solutions was controlled at 9 0 0 1 with 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate buffer except when the effect of ph was examined similar experimental procedures were adopted when testing the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of other three icms by fe vi generally i dbp formation experiments lasted 72 h to examine the i dbp formation potential after 72 h 20 ml water samples were withdrawn and quenched with na2s2o3 s2o3 2 fe vi molar ratio 2 0 to quench the residual fe vi water samples were extracted and analyzed immediately after quenching to prevent potential hydrolytic loss of byproducts during storage 2 2 3 formation of i dbps in real waters to investigate i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi in real waters 500 μg l 1 ipm was spiked into three real waters including the river water from miyun reservoir rw sand filtered water from beijing drinking water treatment plant fw and secondary effluent from qinghe wastewater treatment plant wwtp whose major quality parameters are summarized in table s1 2 3 analysis ipm was detected with an agilent 1200 series hplc system equipped with an atlantis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 0 μm at uv wavelengths of 242 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol water 85 15 v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 50 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c the limit of quantitation of ipm by hplc was determined to be 8 0 μg l 1 if was analyzed after samples being extracted with methyl tert butyl ether using a gas chromatograph 7890 agilent ca usa equipped with an hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w usa and an electronic capture detector based on the modified usepa

at first detailed information on the spe of samples is provided in text s1 then the extracts were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms ms acquity lc xevo g2 qtof ms waters usa coupled with an eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm agilent the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 formic acid in water a and methanol b at a total flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the gradient elution program time in min mobile phase b was set as follows 0 10 15 90 and 20 10 both the electrospray ionization esi and esi modes were performed and compared at first for the products analysis because of the limited product detected under esi mode the ms system was operated at esi mode cone voltage 30 v capillary voltage 3 kv desolvation temperature 280 c source temperature 100 c desolvation gas 500 l h 1 and ms ms collision energy 15 35 ev the m z range was from 100 to 800 and the scan time was 0 1 s the molecular formula of a byproduct was determined by comparing the detected mass at a low collision voltage with the calculated mass according to the database of masslynx 4 0 software the chemical structures of some byproducts were also confirmed by their fragment spectra at a high collision voltage using the mass fragment function in the software 2 4 computational details in this work the ground state geometries and electronic structures of ipm were optimized by means of the hybrid density functional theory dft method using periodic boundary conditions at the b3lyp level of theory with the 6 311 g d p set performed on gaussian 09 program package frisch et al 2009 the optimization was repeated in solvent water described by the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model cances et al 1997 for the molecules which have more than one possible conformation the conformation with the lowest electronic energy was singled out and adopted in the ensuing calculations frequency calculations were computed on these geometries at the same level to verify that they are real minimums on the potential energy surface without any imaginary frequency the three dimensional diagrams of optimized structure the highest occupied molecular orbital homo lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and the electrostatic potential were constructed with gaussview 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation kinetics of ipm by fe vi generally the oxidation kinetics of fe vi are highly ph dependent four protonation species for fe vi exist in water eqs 1 3 which contribute to the reactivity variations in fe vi for example the redox potentials of monoprotonated fe vi vary significantly with 2 20 and 0 72 v in acidic and alkaline circumstances respectively noorhasan et al 2010 yang et al 2012 kim et al 2015 thus under lower phs fe vi usually has higher redox potentials ramseier et al 2011 lee et al 2014 1 h 3 feo 4 h 2 feo 4 h pk 1 1 5 2 h 2 feo 4 hfeo 4 h pk 2 3 5 3 hfeo 4 feo 4 2 h pk 3 7 2 the degradation kinetics of ipm by fe vi were firstly investigated at ph 6 0 10 0 the evolution of normalized ipm concentration by fe vi at ph 7 0 was shown in fig s1 the reaction of fe vi with ipm under pseudo first order conditions was tested and monitored plots of observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs showed linear relationships with concentrations of ipm in both acidic and alkaline circumstances r 2 0 99 the degradation rate of ipm by fe vi oxidation exhibited an obvious ph dependence which can be attributed to the species specific reactivity between fe vi and ipm the reactions between the two ipm species and four fe vi species eight in total are further summarized with eq 4 accordingly k app is given by eq 5 4 d ipm tot d t k app fe vi tot ipm tot i 1 2 3 4 j 1 2 k i j α i β j fe vi tot ipm tot 5 k app i 1 2 3 4 j 1 2 k i j α i β j where k app is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of ipm with fe vi fe vi tot h3feo4 h2feo4 hfeo4 feo4 2 ipm tot ipm ipm α i and β j are the molar fraction of fe vi and ipm i and j are each of the four fe vi species and two ipm species respectively and k ij is the species specific second order rate constant for the reaction between the fe vi species i with the ipm species j the kinetic model eq 4 could be further simplified based on the following facts 1 the reaction related to feo4 2 could be neglected because of a much lower reactivity of feo4 2 than those of hfeo4 and h2feo4 dong et al 2017b and 2 only ipm pkipm 4 5 hfeo4 and feo4 2 species were considered which dominated the ipm and fe vi species at ph 6 0 10 0 therefore the reaction of ipm with fe vi occurred predominantly between the anionic species of ipm and hfeo4 as shown in fig 1 the modeled k app fe vi ipm could match the measured k app fe vi ipm value well the obtained k app fe vi ipm ranged from 0 7 m 1 s 1 to 74 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 10 0 which were highly dependent on ph the k app fe vi ipm at ph 7 0 was determined to be 55 8 m 1 s 1 meanwhile the k app fe vi ipm decreased significantly with increasing ph which could be explained well by species specific reactions between fe vi species and ipm the species specific k app hfeo4 ipm of the reaction of hfeo4 with ipm was determined to be 86 5 m 1 s 1 respectively via least squares nonlinear regressions r 2 0 99 significantly higher than that of the reaction with feo4 2 and ipm 0 19 m 1 s 1 the contribution of main species to the overall reaction rate at ph 6 0 10 0 could be modeled with these species specific k app values the contribution of hfeo4 overweighed h2feo4 and feo4 2 during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi at ph 6 0 10 0 ning and graham 2008 reported the k app range for ipm with hydroxyl radical were in the range of 1 0 109 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 chlorination of ipm followed a second order reaction with a k app value up to 0 87 m 1 s 1 0 021 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 5 wendel et al 2014 overall the k app values for ipm with fe vi were obviously lower than hydroxyl radical while comparable to mild hypochlorite 3 2 formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was investigated as a function of time fig 2 shows the evolution of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi as fe vi ipm and nom did not include chlorine cl and bromine br elements cl or br containing i dbps would not form in this study and the observed i dbps species were if iaa and tiaa after 1 h all the if iaa and tiaa formations were detected during the whole time course the formation of if was always far higher than those of iaa and tiaa after 72 h the average if formation reached 64 29 7 04 μg l 1 whereas the iaa and tiaa formation concentrations were only 1 70 0 36 μg l 1 and 9 59 0 90 μg l 1 respectively meanwhile if iaa and tiaa exhibited different formation rates during the 72 h time course the if and tiaa concentrations increased with increasing time whereas the iaa concentration reached their maximum values after 12 h i e 2 10 0 15 μg l 1 then a decreasing trends of iaa concentration was observed this decrease of iaa concentration during chloramination as a function of time was also observed by liu et al 2017 probably due to its transformation into tiaa in the presence of excess ipm overall the different if iaa and tiaa concentrations formed during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi could be attributed to their relative stabilities and formation pathways chu et al 2009 fig 3 shows the formation of if iaa and tiaa as a function of ipm dose after 72 h it was found that the formation of i dbps was increased with increasing levels of ipm 10 50 μm for example the formation of if increased from 3 47 0 56 μg l 1 to 64 29 7 04 μg l 1 with the initial ipm concentration increased from 10 to 50 μm however when the initial ipm concentration reached 100 μm the formation of i dbps decreased slightly liu et al 2017 observed a similar trend that the formation of i dbps during chloramination exhibited a decreasing trend when the initial i concentration reached higher than 200 μm like i excess ipm also could compete for fe vi for the formation of free iodine therefore the molar ratio of ipm to fe vi is critical for the free iodine formation and transformation into i dbps during oxidation as mentioned the chemical reactivity of h2feo4 hfeo4 and feo4 2 reduced in order with phs increase from 6 0 to 10 0 the constitution of fe vi species changed from h2feo4 to hfeo4 and feo4 2 which influenced not only the degradation kinetics of ipm but also the formation of i dbps the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was further investigated at ph 6 0 10 0 fig 4 it was found that the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm was affected significantly by solution ph the highest formation of i dbps was observed at ph 9 0 with the increase of ph from 6 0 to 9 0 the summed formation amounts of i dbps increased from 5 42 0 95 μg l 1 to 75 59 8 23 μg l 1 the formation of i dbps decreased slightly when ph increased from 9 0 to 10 0 the ph dependent formation trend of i dbps may be attributed to ph dependent reactivity of fe vi kralchevska et al 2016 reported the second order rate constants between fe vi and i kapp fe vi i decreased from 3 9 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 0 12 m 1 s 1 at ph 10 3 zhang et al 2016 also found that fe vi could oxidized i into io3 under acidic and neutral circumstances with the increase of ph from 6 0 to 10 0 the io3 formation amounts during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi decreased significantly from 1215 29 6 μg l 1 to 127 8 7 μg l 1 fig s2 thus the i from the deiodination of ipm by fe vi was oxidized partly into io3 under acidic and neutral circumstances which subsequently limited the formation of i dbps as shown in fig s2 the dominant fate of iodine after the oxidation by fe vi was total organic iodine in the tbps of ipm previous study showed similar results with transformation molar ratio of ipm to i dbps around 2 duirk et al 2011 the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was hypothesized 1 released i is oxidized to hoi by fe vi 2 the formed hoi reacts with nom moieties via electrophilic substitution to form iodinated products or oxidizes nom moieties via electron transfer criquet et al 2015 to evaluate the role of nom on the formation of i dbps the effect of nom concentration 0 10 mgc l 1 was studied in fig 5 during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi i dbps was formed even in the absence of nom it was speculated that the tbps of ipm may become carbon precursors of i dbps however the formation amount of i dbps in absence of nom is obviously lower than those in the presence of nom 0 5 5 mgc l 1 when 1 0 mgc l 1 was added to the oxidation system the if iaa and tiaa formation after 72 h increased from 9 7 1 4 μg l 1 0 6 0 1 μg l 1 and 2 4 0 1 μg l 1 to 95 2 5 2 μg l 1 4 70 0 6 μg l 1 and 14 9 2 7 μg l 1 respectively when the nom concentration exceeded 1 0 mgc l 1 the formation of i dbps exhibited a decreasing trend the chemical structure of nom and its dbps formation potential after fe vi oxidation could be changed gan et al 2015 although nom acted as the main precursor for the i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi excess nom may compete with ipm for fe vi which subsequently reduces the formation of free iodine and i dbps 3 3 transformation pathways of ipm by fe vi oxidation uplc qtof ms ms analysis was adopted to investigate the hmwtps of ipm by fe vi as shown in fig s3 and table s2 ten hmwtps i e ipm705 ipm661 ipm651 ipm631 ipm609 ipm579 ipm535 ipm483 ipm453 ipm409 were identified after the oxidation of ipm by fe vi on the basis of these identified hmwtps tentative pathways for the reactions of ipm with fe vi were proposed overall the transformation of ipm by fe vi oxidation was tentatively ascribed to three pathways fig 6 1 deiodination 2 amide hydrolysis and 3 oxidation of amine hu et al 2017 deiodination from ipm is the prerequisite for the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm jeong et al 2010 observed the deiodination reaction during the degradation of icms by advanced oxidation processes it also has been reported that an iodo group had a higher potential to leave than a chloro group woo et al 2002 in this study the identification of ipm651 ipm535 ipm483 and ipm409 verified that the deiodination reaction took place during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi which facilitated the formation of free iodine and i dbps hu et al 2017 reported the amide hydrolysis of ipm side chain during peroxymonosulfate oxidation in this study amide hydrolysis and subsequent amine oxidation of ipm side chain also occurred yielding ipm705 ipm631 ipm661 and ipm409 in a previous study wendel et al 2014 identified 19 hmwtps after the chlorination of ipm they further isolated and identified five hmwtps and compared their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using mammalian cells with i dbps it was further found that four of the five hmwtps exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity whereas not one of the hmwtps was genotoxic wendel et al 2016 indicating that these 10 hmwtps identified in this study were not the forcing agents that induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the formation of small molecular weight i dbps i e if iaa and tiaa during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi are speculated to be responsible for the toxicity change which needs to be given sufficient attention 3 4 formation of i dbps during the oxidation of icms by fe vi the effect of fe vi oxidation on the formation of i dbps was further evaluated for three different icms including iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide similar to ipm iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide formed if iaa and tiaa during the fe vi oxidation in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 but unlike ipm which produced significant levels of i dbps up to 75 6 μg l 1 iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide did not form appreciable levels 10 0 μg l 1 duirk et al 2011 observed similar results that the formation amounts of i dbps from iohexol and iopromide were rather limited when treated with chlorine or monochloramine thus it seems that ipm has the highest chemical reactivity for fe vi oxidation among the four icms frontier orbital theory analysis which was considered as a reliable tool for the analysis of chemical reactivity was adopted to reveal the of i dbp formation difference from the four icms aihara 1999 in frontier orbital theory homo and lumo determine the way a molecule interacts with other species homo lumo energy gap is widely adopted in molecule reactivity analysis kumar et al 2015 as shown in fig 8 it was found that the homo of ipm was contracted and shifted mainly towards the heterocyclic ring which primarily acts as an electron donor whereas the lumo of ipm was distributed almost uniformly which acts as an electron acceptor the homo lumo energy gap of ipm was 3 94 ev while those of iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide were 4 43 4 23 and 4 69 ev respectively figs s4 6 the homo lumo energy gap results were consistent with the highest formation potential of i dbps during the icms oxidation by fe vi in fig 7 3 5 formation of i dbps in real water samples to evaluate the effect of water matrix on the i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi three real samples from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent river water rw and filtered water from a drinking water treatment plant dw spiked with 500 μg l 1 ipm were tested at ph 8 5 due to their different doc contents the concentrations of i dbps were normalized by the doc concentration as shown in fig 9 if iaa and tiaa were all observed after 72 h for all the three tested water samples the formation amounts of if were always higher than those of iaa and tiaa for example all the normalized if formation amounts were 1 0 μg mgc 1 while those of iaa and tiaa were 1 0 μg mgc 1 overall the doc normalized total yield of i dbps in the three real waters followed the descending order of fw rw wwtp which may be attributable to their different doc contents the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is widely adopted as an indicator of aromatic content and dbp formation potential of organic matter from the limited dataset in this study it appears that low suva254 nom was more reactive in the i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi than high suva254 nom high suva254 nom may compete with ipm for fe vi which limits the oxidation process of ipm and subsequent i dbp formation as ipm widely exists in the wastewater surface water and even drinking water the kinetic parameters in this study are useful for the selection and optimization of advanced process to eliminate ipm concentration moreover the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was of great interest because fe vi is usually considered as one of the few oxidants that seldom forms halogenated hazardous byproducts the formation of i dbps in this study could provide insights to evaluate i dbp formation mechanism and pathway during the oxidation of inorganic and organic iodine in future 4 conclusions based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn the obtained k app for the oxidation of ipm with fe vi ranged from 0 7 m 1 s 1 to 74 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 10 0 and hfeo4 and the ipm species control the overall reaction the oxidation of ipm by fe vi led to the formation of toxic if iaa and tiaa and maximum formation of i dbps occurred at ph 9 0 deiodination reaction during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi contributed to the formation of i dbps because of its lowest homo lumo energy gap among the four investigated icms ipm exhibited the highest formation of i dbps during fe vi oxidation acknowledgment this work was financially supported by the national

the united states and iopamidol ipm was the most frequently detected media with concentrations up to 2 7 μg l 1 duirk et al 2011 additionally 98 ng l 1 of ipm was found in the finished drinking water in european waterworks seitz et al 2006 which is a few orders of magnitude higher than those of many other micro pollutants simazaki et al 2015 because of the biological recalcitrance of ipm continued physicochemical efforts including ozone γ irradiation radical oxidation and ultrasound have been made to degrade ipm from water ning and graham 2008 seitz et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 wendel et al 2014 simazaki et al 2015 dong et al 2017a the removal of ipm however inevitably is accompanied by the formation of products or disinfection by products dbps that potentially can be even more toxic than the parent compound matsushita et al 2015 wendel et al 2016 for example it was reported that a deiodination reaction usually occurred during the oxidation of icms which primarily resulted in the oxidation of the side chains seitz et al 2008 eversloh et al 2014 the deiodination reaction may induce the release of inorganic iodine from icms which becomes a potential iodine source of iodinated dbps i dbps during oxidation or disinfection wendel et al 2016 the iodine present in the source water could be oxidized to hypoiodous acid hoi by oxidant which rapidly incorporates into any organic matter present and induces the formation of i dbps liu et al 2017 during the past decade it was verified that i dbps generally are more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmental toxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogs richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 as the mass fraction of iodine in ipm molecular is up to 50 ipm not only contributes substantially to total organic iodine in water but also acts as a potential iodine source for the formation i dbps previous studies have identified 46 biotransformation products of iopromide iohexol iomeprol and ipm from aerobic soil water and sediment water systems schulz et al 2008 kormos et al 2009 2010 these products which still contain iodine in their structures may become potential sources of the iodine in formation of i dbps during disinfection duirk et al 2011 thus the products of ipm during oxidation should receive great attention for toxicity evaluation with oxidizing power higher than those of the common oxidants e g permanganate ozone and hypochlorite ferrate fe vi could react with electron rich organic moieties including phenols anilines amines estrogens and pharmaceuticals sharma et al 2001 anquandah et al 2011 dong et al 2017b meanwhile fe vi has excellent disinfectant properties and can inactivate a wide variety of microorganisms at low fe vi dosages it was reported that fe vi could inactivate escherichia coli at lower dosages or shorter contact time than hypochlorite fe vi can also kill many chlorine resistant organisms including aerobic spore formers and sulphite reducing clostridia sharma 2007 moreover the reaction of fe vi promotes the coagulation process and subsequently forms a ferric hydroxide gel which could greatly enhance the aggregation and settling process jiang and wang 2003 thus fe vi is considered as a green oxidant for water and wastewater treatment it has been accepted that fe vi is one of the few oxidants that seldom forms halogenated hazardous byproducts interestingly kralchevska et al 2016 found that fe vi could oxidize iodide i into i3 in the presence of excess i more importantly formed i3 may react with natural organic matter to yield i dbps thus it would be meaningful to investigate whether or not toxic i dbps form during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi which could provide new insight for toxicity evaluation after fe vi oxidation in this study the oxidation kinetics of ipm by fe vi was firstly investigated at different phs then the formation of i dbps including iodoform if iodoacetic acid iaa and triiodoacetic acid tiaa during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was evaluated under different water qualities the high molecular weight transformation by products tbps of ipm by fe vi were also identified and on this basis the potential degradation pathways were proposed besides the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of other three icms by fe vi was further investigated for the first time this study verified the formation of toxic i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi which helps to better understand the product and toxicity evolution of emerging icms during fe vi oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials if 99 iaa 98 tiaa

obtained from a milli q system advantage a10 millipore billerica ma usa 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 kinetics kinetic experiments were conducted in 250 ml brown glass reactors in batch mode at ambient temperature 25 c a certain volume of fe vi stock solution was added to the reactor containing ipm with a total volume of 100 ml typically the initial experimental doses of ipm and fe vi were 10 μm and 0 1 mm fe vi respectively a relatively high initial concentration of ipm was adopted for kinetic determination and tbp identification the stock solutions of fe vi 1 5 mm were freshly prepared by dissolving solid k2feo4 in ph 9 1 buffer 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate which was determined by measuring fe vi absorbance at 510 nm ε 510nm 1150 m 1 cm 1 rush et al 1996 10 mm na2hpo4 buffer was used for ph 6 0 8 0 and 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate buffer was used for ph 9 0 10 0 the kinetic experiments usually lasted 30 min and aliquots 1 0 ml each of reaction solution were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals quenched with na2s2o3 s2o3 2 fe vi o molar ratio 2 0 filtered through 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filters ion chromatography acrodisc pall and analyzed for residual ipm concentration each experiment was conducted in triplicate and the mean values were reported with error bars representing the 95 confidence interval 2 2 2 formation of i dbps the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi of was studied as a function of reaction time ph ipm concentration and nom concentration all experiments were performed in triplicate using 50 ml amber glass bottles with polytetrafluoroethylene lined septum screw caps under headspace free conditions the ph of all reaction solutions was controlled at 9 0 0 1 with 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate buffer except when the effect of ph was examined similar experimental procedures were adopted when testing the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of other three icms by fe vi generally i dbp formation experiments lasted 72 h to examine the i dbp formation potential after 72 h 20 ml water samples were withdrawn and quenched with na2s2o3 s2o3 2 fe vi molar ratio 2 0 to quench the residual fe vi water samples were extracted and analyzed immediately after quenching to prevent potential hydrolytic loss of byproducts during storage 2 2 3 formation of i dbps in real waters to investigate i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi in real waters 500 μg l 1 ipm was spiked into three real waters including the river water from miyun reservoir rw sand filtered water from beijing drinking water treatment plant fw and secondary effluent from qinghe wastewater treatment plant wwtp whose major quality parameters are summarized in table s1 2 3 analysis ipm was detected with an agilent 1200 series hplc system equipped with an atlantis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 0 μm at uv wavelengths of 242 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol water 85 15 v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 50 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c the limit of quantitation of ipm by hplc was determined to be 8 0 μg l 1 if was analyzed after samples being extracted with methyl tert butyl ether using a gas chromatograph 7890 agilent ca usa equipped with an hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w usa and an electronic capture detector based on the modified usepa

spectrometry uplc qtof ms ms acquity lc xevo g2 qtof ms waters usa coupled with an eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm agilent the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 formic acid in water a and methanol b at a total flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the gradient elution program time in min mobile phase b was set as follows 0 10 15 90 and 20 10 both the electrospray ionization esi and esi modes were performed and compared at first for the products analysis because of the limited product detected under esi mode the ms system was operated at esi mode cone voltage 30 v capillary voltage 3 kv desolvation temperature 280 c source temperature 100 c desolvation gas 500 l h 1 and ms ms collision energy 15 35 ev the m z range was from 100 to 800 and the scan time was 0 1 s the molecular formula of a byproduct was determined by comparing the detected mass at a low collision voltage with the calculated mass according to the database of masslynx 4 0 software the chemical structures of some byproducts were also confirmed by their fragment spectra at a high collision voltage using the mass fragment function in the software 2 4 computational details in this work the ground state geometries and electronic structures of ipm were optimized by means of the hybrid density functional theory dft method using periodic boundary conditions at the b3lyp level of theory with the 6 311 g d p set performed on gaussian 09 program package frisch et al 2009 the optimization was repeated in solvent water described by the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model cances et al 1997 for the molecules which have more than one possible conformation the conformation with the lowest electronic energy was singled out and adopted in the ensuing calculations frequency calculations were computed on these geometries at the same level to verify that they are real minimums on the potential energy surface without any imaginary frequency the three dimensional diagrams of optimized structure the highest occupied molecular orbital homo lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and the electrostatic potential were constructed with gaussview 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation kinetics of ipm by fe vi generally the oxidation kinetics of fe vi are highly ph dependent four protonation species for fe vi exist in water eqs 1 3 which contribute to the reactivity variations in fe vi for example the redox potentials of monoprotonated fe vi vary significantly with 2 20 and 0 72 v in acidic and alkaline circumstances respectively noorhasan et al 2010 yang et al 2012 kim et al 2015 thus under lower phs fe vi usually has higher redox potentials ramseier et al 2011 lee et al 2014 1 h 3 feo 4 h 2 feo 4 h pk 1 1 5 2 h 2 feo 4 hfeo 4 h pk 2 3 5 3 hfeo 4 feo 4 2 h pk 3 7 2 the degradation kinetics of ipm by fe vi were firstly investigated at ph 6 0 10 0 the evolution of normalized ipm concentration by fe vi at ph 7 0 was shown in fig s1 the reaction of fe vi with ipm under pseudo first order conditions was tested and monitored plots of observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs showed linear relationships with concentrations of ipm in both acidic and alkaline circumstances r 2 0 99 the degradation rate of ipm by fe vi oxidation exhibited an obvious ph dependence which can be attributed to the species specific reactivity between fe vi and ipm the reactions between the two ipm species and four fe vi species eight in total are further summarized with eq 4 accordingly k app is given by eq 5 4 d ipm tot d t k app fe vi tot ipm tot i 1 2 3 4 j 1 2 k i j α i β j fe vi tot ipm tot 5 k app i 1 2 3 4 j 1 2 k i j α i β j where k app is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of ipm with fe vi fe vi tot h3feo4 h2feo4 hfeo4 feo4 2 ipm tot ipm ipm α i and β j are the molar fraction of fe vi and ipm i and j are each of the four fe vi species and two ipm species respectively and k ij is the species specific second order rate constant for the reaction between the fe vi species i with the ipm species j the kinetic model eq 4 could be further simplified based on the following facts 1 the reaction related to feo4 2 could be neglected because of a much lower reactivity of feo4 2 than those of hfeo4 and h2feo4 dong et al 2017b and 2 only ipm pkipm 4 5 hfeo4 and feo4 2 species were considered which dominated the ipm and fe vi species at ph 6 0 10 0 therefore the reaction of ipm with fe vi occurred predominantly between the anionic species of ipm and hfeo4 as shown in fig 1 the modeled k app fe vi ipm could match the measured k app fe vi ipm value well the obtained k app fe vi ipm ranged from 0 7 m 1 s 1 to 74 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 10 0 which were highly dependent on ph the k app fe vi ipm at ph 7 0 was determined to be 55 8 m 1 s 1 meanwhile the k app fe vi ipm decreased significantly with increasing ph which could be explained well by species specific reactions between fe vi species and ipm the species specific k app hfeo4 ipm of the reaction of hfeo4 with ipm was determined to be 86 5 m 1 s 1 respectively via least squares nonlinear regressions r 2 0 99 significantly higher than that of the reaction with feo4 2 and ipm 0 19 m 1 s 1 the contribution of main species to the overall reaction rate at ph 6 0 10 0 could be modeled with these species specific k app values the contribution of hfeo4 overweighed h2feo4 and feo4 2 during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi at ph 6 0 10 0 ning and graham 2008 reported the k app range for ipm with hydroxyl radical were in the range of 1 0 109 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 chlorination of ipm followed a second order reaction with a k app value up to 0 87 m 1 s 1 0 021 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 5 wendel et al 2014 overall the k app values for ipm with fe vi were obviously lower than hydroxyl radical while comparable to mild hypochlorite 3 2 formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was investigated as a function of time fig 2 shows the evolution of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi as fe vi ipm and nom did not include chlorine cl and bromine br elements cl or br containing i dbps would not form in this study and the observed i dbps species were if iaa and tiaa after 1 h all the if iaa and tiaa formations were detected during the whole time course the formation of if was always far higher than those of iaa and tiaa after 72 h the average if formation reached 64 29 7 04 μg l 1 whereas the iaa and tiaa formation concentrations were only 1 70 0 36 μg l 1 and 9 59 0 90 μg l 1 respectively meanwhile if iaa and tiaa exhibited different formation rates during the 72 h time course the if and tiaa concentrations increased with increasing time whereas the iaa concentration reached their maximum values after 12 h i e 2 10 0 15 μg l 1 then a decreasing trends of iaa concentration was observed this decrease of iaa concentration during chloramination as a function of time was also observed by liu et al 2017 probably due to its transformation into tiaa in the presence of excess ipm overall the different if iaa and tiaa concentrations formed during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi could be attributed to their relative stabilities and formation pathways chu et al 2009 fig 3 shows the formation of if iaa and tiaa as a function of ipm dose after 72 h it was found that the formation of i dbps was increased with increasing levels of ipm 10 50 μm for example the formation of if increased from 3 47 0 56 μg l 1 to 64 29 7 04 μg l 1 with the initial ipm concentration increased from 10 to 50 μm however when the initial ipm concentration reached 100 μm the formation of i dbps decreased slightly liu et al 2017 observed a similar trend that the formation of i dbps during chloramination exhibited a decreasing trend when the initial i concentration reached higher than 200 μm like i excess ipm also could compete for fe vi for the formation of free iodine therefore the molar ratio of ipm to fe vi is critical for the free iodine formation and transformation into i dbps during oxidation as mentioned the chemical reactivity of h2feo4 hfeo4 and feo4 2 reduced in order with phs increase from 6 0 to 10 0 the constitution of fe vi species changed from h2feo4 to hfeo4 and feo4 2 which influenced not only the degradation kinetics of ipm but also the formation of i dbps the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was further investigated at ph 6 0 10 0 fig 4 it was found that the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm was affected significantly by solution ph the highest formation of i dbps was observed at ph 9 0 with the increase of ph from 6 0 to 9 0 the summed formation amounts of i dbps increased from 5 42 0 95 μg l 1 to 75 59 8 23 μg l 1 the formation of i dbps decreased slightly when ph increased from 9 0 to 10 0 the ph dependent formation trend of i dbps may be attributed to ph dependent reactivity of fe vi kralchevska et al 2016 reported the second order rate constants between fe vi and i kapp fe vi i decreased from 3 9 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 0 12 m 1 s 1 at ph 10 3 zhang et al 2016 also found that fe vi could oxidized i into io3 under acidic and neutral circumstances with the increase of ph from 6 0 to 10 0 the io3 formation amounts during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi decreased significantly from 1215 29 6 μg l 1 to 127 8 7 μg l 1 fig s2 thus the i from the deiodination of ipm by fe vi was oxidized partly into io3 under acidic and neutral circumstances which subsequently limited the formation of i dbps as shown in fig s2 the dominant fate of iodine after the oxidation by fe vi was total organic iodine in the tbps of ipm previous study showed similar results with transformation molar ratio of ipm to i dbps around 2 duirk et al 2011 the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was hypothesized 1 released i is oxidized to hoi by fe vi 2 the formed hoi reacts with nom moieties via electrophilic substitution to form iodinated products or oxidizes nom moieties via electron transfer criquet et al 2015 to evaluate the role of nom on the formation of i dbps the effect of nom concentration 0 10 mgc l 1 was studied in fig 5 during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi i dbps was formed even in the absence of nom it was speculated that the tbps of ipm may become carbon precursors of i dbps however the formation amount of i dbps in absence of nom is obviously lower than those in the presence of nom 0 5 5 mgc l 1 when 1 0 mgc l 1 was added to the oxidation system the if iaa and tiaa formation after 72 h increased from 9 7 1 4 μg l 1 0 6 0 1 μg l 1 and 2 4 0 1 μg l 1 to 95 2 5 2 μg l 1 4 70 0 6 μg l 1 and 14 9 2 7 μg l 1 respectively when the nom concentration exceeded 1 0 mgc l 1 the formation of i dbps exhibited a decreasing trend the chemical structure of nom and its dbps formation potential after fe vi oxidation could be changed gan et al 2015 although nom acted as the main precursor for the i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi excess nom may compete with ipm for fe vi which subsequently reduces the formation of free iodine and i dbps 3 3 transformation pathways of ipm by fe vi oxidation uplc qtof ms ms analysis was adopted to investigate the hmwtps of ipm by fe vi as shown in fig s3 and table s2 ten hmwtps i e ipm705 ipm661 ipm651 ipm631 ipm609 ipm579 ipm535 ipm483 ipm453 ipm409 were identified after the oxidation of ipm by fe vi on the basis of these identified hmwtps tentative pathways for the reactions of ipm with fe vi were proposed overall the transformation of ipm by fe vi oxidation was tentatively ascribed to three pathways fig 6 1 deiodination 2 amide hydrolysis and 3 oxidation of amine hu et al 2017 deiodination from ipm is the prerequisite for the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm jeong et al 2010 observed the deiodination reaction during the degradation of icms by advanced oxidation processes it also has been reported that an iodo group had a higher potential to leave than a chloro group woo et al 2002 in this study the identification of ipm651 ipm535 ipm483 and ipm409 verified that the deiodination reaction took place during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi which facilitated the formation of free iodine and i dbps hu et al 2017 reported the amide hydrolysis of ipm side chain during peroxymonosulfate oxidation in this study amide hydrolysis and subsequent amine oxidation of ipm side chain also occurred yielding ipm705 ipm631 ipm661 and ipm409 in a previous study wendel et al 2014 identified 19 hmwtps after the chlorination of ipm they further isolated and identified five hmwtps and compared their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using mammalian cells with i dbps it was further found that four of the five hmwtps exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity whereas not one of the hmwtps was genotoxic wendel et al 2016 indicating that these 10 hmwtps identified in this study were not the forcing agents that induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the formation of small molecular weight i dbps i e if iaa and tiaa during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi are speculated to be responsible for the toxicity change which needs to be given sufficient attention 3 4 formation of i dbps during the oxidation of icms by fe vi the effect of fe vi oxidation on the formation of i dbps was further evaluated for three different icms including iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide similar to ipm iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide formed if iaa and tiaa during the fe vi oxidation in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 but unlike ipm which produced significant levels of i dbps up to 75 6 μg l 1 iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide did not form appreciable levels 10 0 μg l 1 duirk et al 2011 observed similar results that the formation amounts of i dbps from iohexol and iopromide were rather limited when treated with chlorine or monochloramine thus it seems that ipm has the highest chemical reactivity for fe vi oxidation among the four icms frontier orbital theory analysis which was considered as a reliable tool for the analysis of chemical reactivity was adopted to reveal the of i dbp formation difference from the four icms aihara 1999 in frontier orbital theory homo and lumo determine the way a molecule interacts with other species homo lumo energy gap is widely adopted in molecule reactivity analysis kumar et al 2015 as shown in fig 8 it was found that the homo of ipm was contracted and shifted mainly towards the heterocyclic ring which primarily acts as an electron donor whereas the lumo of ipm was distributed almost uniformly which acts as an electron acceptor the homo lumo energy gap of ipm was 3 94 ev while those of iohexol diatrizoate and iopromide were 4 43 4 23 and 4 69 ev respectively figs s4 6 the homo lumo energy gap results were consistent with the highest formation potential of i dbps during the icms oxidation by fe vi in fig 7 3 5 formation of i dbps in real water samples to evaluate the effect of water matrix on the i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi three real samples from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent river water rw and filtered water from a drinking water treatment plant dw spiked with 500 μg l 1 ipm were tested at ph 8 5 due to their different doc contents the concentrations of i dbps were normalized by the doc concentration as shown in fig 9 if iaa and tiaa were all observed after 72 h for all the three tested water samples the formation amounts of if were always higher than those of iaa and tiaa for example all the normalized if formation amounts were 1 0 μg mgc 1 while those of iaa and tiaa were 1 0 μg mgc 1 overall the doc normalized total yield of i dbps in the three real waters followed the descending order of fw rw wwtp which may be attributable to their different doc contents the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is widely adopted as an indicator of aromatic content and dbp formation potential of organic matter from the limited dataset in this study it appears that low suva254 nom was more reactive in the i dbp formation during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi than high suva254 nom high suva254 nom may compete with ipm for fe vi which limits the oxidation process of ipm and subsequent i dbp formation as ipm widely exists in the wastewater surface water and even drinking water the kinetic parameters in this study are useful for the selection and optimization of advanced process to eliminate ipm concentration moreover the formation of i dbps during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi was of great interest because fe vi is usually considered as one of the few oxidants that seldom forms halogenated hazardous byproducts the formation of i dbps in this study could provide insights to evaluate i dbp formation mechanism and pathway during the oxidation of inorganic and organic iodine in future 4 conclusions based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn the obtained k app for the oxidation of ipm with fe vi ranged from 0 7 m 1 s 1 to 74 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 10 0 and hfeo4 and the ipm species control the overall reaction the oxidation of ipm by fe vi led to the formation of toxic if iaa and tiaa and maximum formation of i dbps occurred at ph 9 0 deiodination reaction during the oxidation of ipm by fe vi contributed to the formation of i dbps because of its lowest homo lumo energy gap among the four investigated icms ipm exhibited the highest formation of i dbps during fe vi oxidation acknowledgment this work was financially supported by the national

bromodiiodomethane concentrations of relevant precursors like dissolved organic carbon doc bromide iodide and total iodine as well as other water quality parameters were also determined detailed information about the treatment process used at each location was recorded using a questionnaire the survey showed that one or more iodo thms were detected at 31 out of 64 water treatment systems wtss

deposits and brines richardson et al 2008 iodine concentrations comparable to those typically found in sea waters have also been reported in some inland surface waters moran et al 2002 it is interesting to note that iodo thms as well as iodo haas have been found in disinfected water from water sources with no detectable iodide mdl 0 13 μg l richardson et al 2008 leading the authors to presume other organic or inorganic iodine sources may have been involved in the presence of free chlorine hypochlorous acid hocl hoi is quickly oxidized further to iodate io3 which under aerobic conditions is the thermodynamically stable inorganic iodine species in water ullman et al 1990 iodate is the desired sink for iodine in drinking water due to its quick reduction to iodide in vivo and consequent expected low toxicity to humans smith et al 2010 the ability of free chlorine to oxidize hoi to iodate minimizes the potential for iodo thm formation in drinking water disinfection processes using chlorine bichsel and von gunten 1999 hua et al 2006 although formation of iodo thms in such processes has been reported richardson et al 2008 cancho et al 2000 however when using chloramine in the disinfection process hoi is much more stable and its reaction with nom is favoured bichsel and von gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000 the concentration of bromide in the source water has an important influence on the formation and speciation of iodo thms allard et al 2015 bromide reacts with chlorine to form hypobromous acid hobr hobr oxidizes hoi to io3 in a bromide catalyzed reaction with a higher reaction rate than hocl accelerating the process by which hoi is removed from the system and reducing the potential for iodo thm formation criquet et al 2012 hobr is also more reactive towards phenolic moieties from nom than hocl westerhoff et al 2004 criquet et al 2015 potentially leading to more brominated precursors that can react with hoi and shift the speciation of iodo thms formed toward more brominated iodinated species the important role of ammonium in the formation of organoiodinated compounds during chlorination has been observed in laboratory experiments karpel van leitner et al 1998 indeed the formation of iodo thms in water treatment plants using chloramines has been reported in many countries richardson et al 2008 cancho et al 2000 krasner et al 2006 hansson et al 1987 weinberg et al 2002 goslan et al 2009 in some cases leading to taste and odour issues hansson et al 1987 due to the formation of iodoform which has low odour 0 02 μg l and taste 5 μg l threshold concentrations cancho et al 2000 in water treatment plants using chloramines the formation of iodo thms has been predicted bichsel and von gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000 and found richardson et al 2008 goslan et al 2009 to be inversely correlated with the time allowed between the addition of chlorine and the addition of ammonia for the formation of monochloramine treatment processes that allow longer time for chlorine to react with precursors in the source water before the addition of ammonia have been reported to produce lower concentrations of iodo thms richardson et al 2008 goslan et al 2009 allard et al 2015 under these circumstances particularly challenging is the case for water treatment plants using source water with naturally occurring ammonium in such cases chloramines are formed at the first addition of chlorine and the formation of iodo thms is favoured richardson et al 2008 after the introduction of regulations limiting the concentrations of chlorine and bromine containing trihalomethanes thms the regulated thms in treated drinking water many water treatment plants in canada switched from chlorination to chloramination in an attempt to minimize the formation of the regulated thms however as discussed above evidence from the studies available suggests that the formation of iodo thms in water treated with chloramines tends to be higher than in water disinfected by chlorination with short free chlorine contact time before the addition of ammonia the concentration of iodo thms formed can be of the same order of magnitude as the concentration of regulated thms krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 published literature also suggests that iodine containing thms may be more toxic than chlorinated and brominated thms woo et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 the increased potential for iodo thm formation in water treatment plants using chloramines and or source water with naturally occurring ammonium combined with the potential toxicity of the unregulated dbps creates a dilemma for many water treatment systems the operators are caught between their efforts to maintain regulated dbps below the required limits and the desire to minimize the risk posed by emerging dbps like iodo thms yet still maintaining their treatment process disinfection efficacy this study was designed to investigate the occurrence of dbps in 65 water treatment systems across canada iodo thms were chosen among the target analytes due to 1 increasing use of chloramines during water treatment in canada 2 a significant presence of ammonium in source waters in some geographic regions of the country and 3 the concentrations of bromide iodide and natural organic matter were also expected to be high in these same geographic areas this study was conducted in 2009 2010 and was to our knowledge the first canadian study on the occurrence of iodo thms in drinking water the goal was to add canadian occurrence data for iodo thms to the accumulating body of data from other countries richardson et al 2008 ullman et al 1990 krasner et al 2006 hansson et al 1987 and to find information that would allow to predict water treatment systems that are susceptible to iodo thm formation 2 survey design 2 1 site selection sixty five water treatment systems wtss across canada were selected based on water source lake river ground water the size of the population served and the disinfection post disinfection treatment process used chlorination chloramination ozonation uv ultrafiltration fig 1 in the supplementary materials sm shows the geographic locations of the water treatment systems included in the survey based on the size of the population served approximately one third 28 of the systems chosen were large systems serving over 50 000 people one third 34 considered medium sized systems serving between 5000 and 50 000 people and one third 38 classified as small systems serving under 5000 people of the 65 wtss included in the survey 52 80 used chlorine as the main disinfection agent 12 18 used chloramines as the post disinfection agent i e secondary disinfectant and one system used no disinfection agent table 1 in the sm presents a list of the sites and some of the criteria used in their selection ten systems 15 used source waters with naturally occurring ammonium

selected iodo thm precursors dissolved organic carbon doc total organic carbon toc bromide iodide total iodine were determined in addition 33 non iodine containing neutral dbps thms haloacetaldehydes including chloral hydrate haloacetonitriles haloketones ndma and six substituted nitrosamines chloropicrin mx and 9 haloacetic acids were measured during the survey source water characteristics including ammonium and nitrite nitrate concentrations major ions and 36 metals were measured free and total chlorine water temperature turbidity and water ph were determined on site the characteristics of the water treatment process at the time of sampling including disinfection methods i e primary and secondary disinfectants were recorded using a questionnaire filled by the wts operator all water sampling was done by a health canada sampling specialist using protocols specific to each analysis samples were quenched acidified and then shipped by overnight courier where available or by the quickest available route to health canada and to the other participating laboratories during shipping water samples were kept under 10 c whenever possible samples were analysed as soon as received at the laboratories or according to their specified shelf life and handling protocols 2 3 sampling schedule samples were collected from wtss twice in the same year in the winter summer of 2009 and winter summer of 2010 samples were collected during these two seasons to capture the extremes of water temperature during the year and account for the well documented influence of water temperature on dbp formation krasner 2009 water temperature at the time of sampling is presented in table 3 in the sm for all wtss five samples were collected a source water sample before the treatment plant r a treated water sample at the exit of the treatment plant t and three samples from the distribution system at progressively distant points from the treatment facility d1 d2 d3 2 4 water sampling and stabilization for iodo thm analysis duplicate water samples were collected in 65 ml amber bottles pre loaded with 0 2 ml fresh ascorbic acid solution 0 114 m as a quenching agent and enough 0 2 n hcl solution based on a preliminary titration of the water samples at the site to achieve a final sample ph of 4 5 5 at some wtss higher concentrations of hcl solution up to 1 n had to be used to achieve the required ph while keeping the volume of acid solution limited 1 ml to avoid diluting the sample the bottles were filled ensuring no headspace after running the tap for 5 min most samples were analysed within 5 days of collection however a few samples were analysed within 10 days due to transportation delays from remote locations 3 laboratory work 3 1 water sample stability study a stability study of the six iodo thms at ph 4 5 in the presence of ascorbic acid was conducted and is described in the sm results showed that all iodo thms were stable for 10 days under the sampling and storing conditions described above however at day 10 a slight decrease in concentration was observed particularly for iodoform and also to a smaller extent for bdim and cdim see sm 3 2 analytical methods 3 2 1 iodo thm analysis iodo thms were analysed using an automated solid phase microextraction gas chromatography with electron capture detection method spme gc ecd the identity of the iodo thm peaks was confirmed for each sample by spiking the sample with authentic standards the method developed in our laboratory is presented in section 5 1 of the sm table 1 shows

alto california equipped with dual ecd detectors according to a method described previously williams et al 1997 4 results 4 1 iodo thm occurrence data one or more iodo thms were detected in the distributed water of 31 out of 65 wtss 48 tested under winter conditions and in 46 out of 65 wtss 71 tested under summer conditions total iodo thm concentrations calculated as the sum of concentrations of all congeners measured in one sample in treated water samples collected during winter and summer ranged from 0 02 μg l to 21 66 μg l fig 1 shows the distribution of the sampled wtss based on the highest total iodo thm concentration the highest total concentration measured during summer or winter campaigns in either the treated water or any of the three water samples from the distribution system water samples was used in fig 1 4 2 iodo thm speciation in the treated water iodo thms individual concentrations ranged from under mdl to a maximum of 2 27 μg l for dcim 2 91 μg l for dbim 2 06 μg l for bcim 4 31 μg l for cdim 2 71 μg l for bdim and 8 3 μg l for tim the highest concentration for all iodo thms was measured at the same wts wts 63 except for dcim for which the highest concentration was found at wts 48 all six iodo thm congeners were found in the treated drinking water at detectable levels at only 3 wtss 18 45 and 63 in the winter and 2 wtss in the summer 18 and 63 in the latter case tim was the largest contributor to the total iodo thm concentration dcim was the most significant congener found in the mid system samples d2 in 18 of 31 wtss winter and 24 of 46 wtss summer where iodo thms were detected dbim was the next major congener the congener with the highest concentration in 6 of 31 wtss winter and in 15 of 46 wtss summer table 7 in the sm presents total iodo thms concentrations and the major congener found in each wts in treated or d2 water sampled under winter and summer conditions fig 2 a and b present the speciation of iodo thms in the treated water of wtss 18 21 45 and 63 the sites where most congeners were detected measured under winter 2a and summer 2b conditions specific conditions favoring the formation of iodo thms at these sites include high iodide from 3 6 μg l 0 03 μm at site 21 131 4 μg l 1 03 μm at site 63 and bromide from 112μg l 1 4 μm at site 45 414μg l 5 μm at site 63 bromide iodide molar ratios ranging from 5 site 63 to 74 site 21 in the summer and the presence of ammonia in the source water at sites 18 21 and 63 for sites 18 21 and 63 ground water sources situated inland and not affected by wastewater the particular water characteristics are due to a special geology the wells are situated in sediments from former seabeds sites 18 and 21 are situated in a region with known underground salt deposits site 45 is a surface water source from a coastal location at all sites chlorine is used as disinfectant however at sites 18 21 and 63 chloramines are formed ab initio with the ammonium present in the source water 4 3 bromide iodide and total iodine in source waters bromide concentration in the source waters of the 65 wtss included in the survey ranged from under the mdl 5 μg l to 733 μg l the highest bromide concentration was found in a ground water sample winter from a coastal location wts 58 at this location a marked increase 740 in the bromide concentration in winter compared with the concentration in summer was observed and was attributed to see water intrusion of the 7 sites with source waters containing 100 μg l bromide 2 were coastal sites wts 45 and 58 and 5 were situated in regions with known high salinity soils wtss 63 18 21 48 and 47 iodide concentration in the source waters of the 65 wtss included in the survey ranged from under the mdl 0 018 μg l to 131 36 μg l the highest iodide concentration was found in a summer sample from an inland ground water source wts 63 the 7 sites with the highest iodide concentration in source waters 10 μg l iodide include 2 coastal sites wts 45 and 58 and 5 inland sites wtss 63 18 21 52 and 62 total iodine concentration in the source waters of the 65 wtss included in the survey ranged from below the mdl 0 14 μg l to 132 μg l with the highest concentration found in winter at wts 63 of the 9 sites with the highest total iodine concentration 10 μg l 3 were coastal sites wtss 45 43 and 58 and 5 were various inland sites across the country wtss 63 18 21 52 and 62 a summary of the seasonal concentrations for bromide iodide and total iodine in the source waters for the 65 wtss included in the survey is presented in table 2 the complete dataset for bromide iodide and total iodine can be found in the sm table 9 5 discussion 5 1 the iodine source the total concentration of iodo thms found in 55 of the 65 wtss investigated was under 1 μg l corresponding to 2 nm and in most cases the iodide concentration in the source waters of these wtss was also 1 μg l corresponding to 7 8 nm although the total iodine concentration was higher up to 5 5 μg l 43 nm total iodo thm concentrations between 1 μg l 2 nm and 21 66 μg l corresponding to 68 7 nm were found in 8 water systems wtss 18 43 45 46 47 48 63 65 see table 7 in sm at these wtss iodide concentrations in the source water ranged from under the mdl of 0 018 μg l 0 7 nm to 131 4 μg l 1 03 μm and total iodine concentrations ranged from 5 6 μg l 43 nm to 132 μg l 1 04 μm the highest total iodo thm concentrations were found at the 2 wtss 63 and 18 with the highest total iodine as well as iodide concentrations in the water source however in these two cases other factors beside the availability of the precursor may have contributed to the formation of the higher iodo thm concentrations more specifically both water sources also contained high bromide concentrations and naturally occurring ammonium as mentioned before the high bromide and iodide concentrations in ground water used by wts 18 21 and 63 appear to be due to their situation in sediments from former seabeds it is remarkable that the total iodine and the iodide iodate w w ratio in these source waters iodate concentration was calculated as the difference between total iodine and iodide concentrations with no significant contribution from organic iodinated compounds assumed at these sites is higher than the average values for sea water schnepfe 1972 collins 1975 however this is not unique as iodide has been found to be tremendously enriched in some brines associated with sediments by comparison to the normal evaporite associated brines collins 1975 overall no consistent correlation was observed between total iodo thms formed and the iodide concentration in the source water see figs 5 and 6 in the sm the data indicate that the presence of iodine in the form of iodide in the source water does not appear to be a requirement for the formation of iodo thms in one case wts 65 three iodo thms dcim bcim and dbim were found in both winter and summer treated t as well as mid point distribution d2 water samples with the highest concentration 1 1 μg l 4 6 nm measured in summer at d2 although iodide was only detected at a value close to mdl 0 049 μg l 0 4 nm in the winter and undetectable in the summer a similar situation was described by richardson et al 2008 who raised the possibility that there were other inorganic or organic sources of iodine beyond the inorganic iodide measured in the source waters this appears to be the situation at site 65 from our survey as the total iodine measured in the r and d2summer water samples was 6 5 μg l 51 nm r and 11 8 μg l 93 nm d2 respectively the source water of wts 65 is a river and the source of iodinated precursors may be anthropogenic input based on measurement of markers included in the 2009 2010 survey and not presented here our data show that iodide concentration in some source waters may have a high seasonal variability for example at wts 18 the iodide total iodine ratio was 34 4 in the winter and 86 6 in the summer due to a decrease of 47 μg l in iodide concentration between the winter and the summer samples while the measured total iodine concentration increased by only 3 μg l many factors could be involved in the seasonal variation of iodide concentration from changes in the solution oxidation reduction potential e h to changes in anion exchange and iodide adsorption on sediments all processes known to occur in brines associated with sediments collins 1975 in the particular case of those three water sources increased anion exchange and iodide desorption from sediments due to higher water leaching through the sediments during spring thaw appears the more reasonable hypothesis as these are deep wells with less than 10 c variation in temperature between winter and summer however this will need to be demonstrated which exceeded the scope of our survey in view of observations described above it appears that total iodine concentration which is stable throughout the year and includes both inorganic and organic potential iodine sources may be a better parameter then iodide to describe iodine availability for iodo thm formation however total iodo thm concentrations formed did not correlate well with total iodine concentrations in the source water see figs 7 and 8 in the sm showing that although total iodine can prove the existence of the necessary iodinated precursors the extent of iodo thm occurrence is heavily influenced by other water quality and treatment process factors 5 2 predicting the existence of an iodine source bromide concentration has previously been proposed as a marker for iodide concentration since iodide concentration in source waters is rarely measured by wtss in canada however bromide concentration has been reported to have a poor correlation with iodide concentrations in many source waters richardson et al 2008 our findings from this canadian survey support the observation that there is no meaningful correlation between bromide and iodide concentrations in source waters see figs 9 and 10 in the sm as total iodine appears to be both a better descriptor of iodine availability for the formation of iodo thms and to be a more conservative parameter we looked at the possible correlation between bromide and total iodine concentrations using the data from the wtss in the study total iodine concentrations also do not appear to be well correlated with bromide concentrations see figs 11 and 12 in the sm according to our data bromide concentration is not likely to be a reliable indicator for the presence of iodine precursors in the source water in fact as we now know that iodine precursors nature inorganic organic and source sea water influence brines associated with inland sediments from ancient sea beds waste water are so diverse it would be surprising if iodide total iodine and bromide concentrations were correlated the use of bromide concentration as a sole predictor of potential iodo thm formation may lead to overlooking some sites with low bromide concentration yet where iodide and other iodinated precursor concentrations are high enough that combined with favourable conditions may result in the formation of iodo thms during treatment 5 3 treatment process factors free chlorine vs chloramines chloramines were used as secondary disinfectants in 12 of the 65 wtss included in the survey table 3 shows a summary comparison between total iodo thm concentrations measured in water samples from wtss using chloramines vs wtss using chlorine in this study the use of chloramines even when iodine was present did not appear to be the main determining factor in the formation of iodo thms the proportion of wtss with detectable levels of iodo thms is certainly higher among wtss using chloramines as secondary disinfectants however the average and median total iodo thm concentrations are very similar for wtss using chlorine and chloramines it should be noted that information about the chlorine contact time before the addition of ammonia for wtss using chloramines was not available in this study both the proportion of wtss where iodo thms were found as well as the average and median total iodo thm concentrations increased considerably for the wtss using source waters with naturally occurring ammonia whether the secondary disinfectant used is chlorine breakpoint chlorination or chloramines 5 4 the importance of naturally occurring ammonium in the source water ammonium was found in the source water at concentrations over 0 1 mg l at 10 wtss 1 13 15 18 21 43 48 62 63 and 65 so chloramines were formed in the treated water from these wtss as soon as chlorine was added for disinfection ammonium was also present in the source water at 5 wtss 18 43 48 63 and 65 of the 8 wtss where total iodo thm concentrations were over 1 μg l this seems to indicate that the formation of higher iodo thm concentrations is related to the ab initio formation of chloramines as predicted by theory bichsel and von gunten 2000 and shown in laboratory experiments bichsel and von gunten 1999 hua et al 2006 a similar case was also observed during a previous survey targeting water systems that applied chloramines to treat source waters with high bromide content richardson et al 2008 for the 10 wts using chloramines where low levels of iodo thms were formed chlorine was added to the water before ammonia therefore hoi was quickly oxidized to iodate limiting the formation of iodo thms only two of the 12 wtss using chloramines in the treatment process had iodo thm concentrations over 1 μg l and those 2 wtss 18 and 63 also had naturally occurring ammonium in the source water high iodide and total iodine concentrations and molar bromide iodide ratios between 5 and 17 in these cases chloramines were formed at the first addition of chlorine and were the only disinfectants used throughout the process the hoi was able to react with nom for a prolonged period and consequently a variety of iodo thms including tim were formed in the treated water total iodo thms formed in water from wtss 18 and 63 were the highest measured in this survey and tim was the congener with the highest contribution to the total concentration 5 5 total iodo thm concentration may exceed regulated total thm concentration under specific treatment conditions data from this survey see fig 3 as well as previously published data richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 show that in some water systems and under specific treatment conditions the total iodo thm concentration can exceed the total regulated thm chloroform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane bromoform concentration this is particularly important as iodo thms are not routinely measured while monitoring total thm concentration is a regulatory requirement as such low levels of regulated total thms may lead utilities to overlook the presence of iodo thms in the treated water although iodo thms are suspected to be more toxic than their chlorinated brominated counterparts richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 a comparison between wtss 18 and 21 see selected water quality parameters in table 4 is interesting and may illustrate the differences in iodo thm formation in source waters where naturally occurring ammonium is used to form chloramines wts 18 or where chlorination past the breakpoint is used wts 21 the source waters at those two locations have high levels of naturally occurring bromide iodide and total iodine as well as high doc compared to other ground water sources significant concentrations of naturally occurring ammonium 3 3 mg l and 0 97 mg l in wts 18 and 21 respectively are also present at wts 18 all iodo thm congeners were detected adding up to a maximum total concentration of 9 18 μg l in mid point d2 summer distribution water tim was the major iodo thm congener formed 3 35 μg l at wts 21 the maximum total iodo thm concentration also measured in mid point summer distribution water was considerably lower 0 95 μg l dcim bcim and dbim were present and the major iodo thm congener was dbim 0 71 μg l wts 18 used chloramines as secondary disinfectants while wts 21 used chlorine as secondary disinfectant free chlorine residual concentration was 0 89 mg l as a result of the differences in the secondary disinfection agent the ratio between total iodo thms and total regulated thms is also significantly different between the two sites at wts 21 breakpoint chlorination in the summer the w w ratio of iodo thms to regulated thms is only about 1 09 compared to 153 at wts 18 chloramine for secondary disinfection see fig 3 and table 5 at wts 18 chloramines are the dominant oxidant species throughout the process leading to low formation of regulated thms and at the same time allowing the hoi an extended reaction time with chlorinated brominated precursors and nom to produce all 6 iodo thms in contrast at wts 21 after the initial formation of chloramines at the first addition of chlorine the continuation of the chlorine addition leads to the quick oxidation of hoi to iodate a process that is also favoured by the high molar ratio of bromide to iodide 74 in summer source water at wts 21 allard et al 2015 as a consequence the formation of iodo thms is interrupted early at wts 21 due to the disappearance of the iodination agent this is also reflected by the lower degree of iodine incorporation at wts 21 where the major congener is dbim compared to wts 18 where the major congener is tim the oxidant species in solution are now hocl and especially hobr and with enough nom available significant concentrations of regulated thms are formed 5 6 iodo thm speciation in the treated water the six iodo thm congeners were found with variable frequency in treated water see table 6 dcim was the iodo thm formed most often in the wtss investigated followed by its brominated equivalent dbim the triiodinated species tim and the diiodinated species cdim and bdim were found much less often with higher frequency in wtss using chloramines and at concentrations exceeding 1 μg l only in the treated water of wtss 18 and 63 where ammonia was present in the source water and chloramines were used as secondary disinfectants the formation of diiodianted and triiodinated congeners mostly in disinfection processes using chloramines is related to the prolonged presence of hoi in such systems in the absence of a stronger oxidation agent like chlorine leading to repeated substitution of nom reactive sites at wtss 18 21 and 63 the ammonium present in the source water and to a certain extent the dissolved organic matter dom react with chlorine and quench it making hoi the main oxidizing agent at wts 21 the high bromide iodide molecular ratio which favors the rapid oxidation of hoi to iodate and the use of excess chlorine past breakpoint chlorination result in the formation of dcim bcim and dbim in the winter in the summer sample the concentration of iodide is significantly higher and enough hoi exists in the system to lead to the formation of small amounts of the triiodinated species tim the water at wts 18 has a higher iodide concentration than at wts 21 and chlorination does not reach the breakpoint so only chloramines are present in the treated water all iodo thms are formed and the distribution is more favourable to chlorinated species on a molar basis than at wts 21 however significant concentrations of tim are also formed this results correspond to the expected iodo thm formation according to the low hox exposure in the presence of bromine described by allard et al 2015 in the summer water the increased concentration of iodide allows for increased concentration of hoi formation and leads to increased formation of tim at wts 63 the bromide iodide molar ratio is 5 however the iodide concentration is significantly higher chloramines are used as secondary disinfectants and iodide can be detected even in the treated water there is enough hoi reacting in the system to create a mixture of all iodo thms including significant amounts of tim site 45 differs from the three sites described above by the absence of ammonia in the source water the hydrobromous acid hobr formed after the addition of chlorine oxidizes hoi to iodate limiting the amount of iodo thms formed and favours the formation of bromine containing iodo thms this effect is even more apparent in the summer water when only dbim is formed corresponding to the high hox exposure in the presence of bromine mechanism allard et al 2015 5 7 seasonal variation of iodo thm concentration at the 29 sites where one or more iodo thm compounds were detected under both winter and summer conditions concentrations tended to be higher in summer than in winter the higher occurrence of iodo thm concentrations near mdls at many wtss leads to an increased frequency of detection in summer compared to winter at wtss 18 and 63 where all iodo thm congeners were detected in both seasons the increase in concentration between winter and summer was significant especially for the diiodinated and triiodinated thms in the distribution system samples see fig 4 this can be due to the higher concentration of iodide present in the source water in the summer which combined with a lower molar bromide iodide ratio 5 and 6 in the summer compared to 5 2 and 17 in the winter at wtss 18 and 63 respectively leads to the formation of higher hoi concentrations that can react repeatedly with nom leading to a high degree of iodine incorporation 5 8 variation of iodo thm concentration along the distribution system inconsistent and mostly insignificant variations in iodo thm congener concentrations were found at all sampling points during winter in the summer samples a slight tendency towards increased iodo thm congener concentrations with the residence i e reaction time was observed for most wtss this is in marked contrast with the significant variations in concentrations along the distribution system observed for the regulated thms the increased iodo thms concentrations in the mid point distribution d2 samples by comparison with treated t samples was significant at wts 18 25 and especially at wts 63 410 this is attributed to the high iodide concentration present in the source water which allowed the hoi reactions with nom to continue in the distribution system wts 63 in the summer is the only system in which iodide 8 3 μg l was still available in the treated water wts 18 treated water was not sampled for iodide which may explain the unusually large increase in iodo thm concentrations between t and d2 samples at this site most of which was due to tim and cdim increase in concentration see fig 5 a and b 6 conclusions iodo thms can form in drinking water during disinfection using either chlorine or chloramine in this survey one or more iodo thms were found in treated water samples from 45 71 out of 63 wtss using either chlorine or chloramines for secondary disinfection the detection frequency was higher in wtss using chloramines 83 vs wtss using chlorine 69 however the average and median total iodo thm concentrations were similar for wtss using chlorine and chloramines both the proportion of wtss where iodo thms were found as well as the average and median total iodo thm concentrations increased considerably for the wtss using source waters with naturally occurring ammonia whether the secondary disinfectant used was chlorine or chloramines dcim was the iodo thm formed most often in the wtss investigated followed by the brominated equivalent dbim all iodo thm congeners were found in the treated water of the two wtss where the highest total iodo thm concentrations were measured and where the major congener was tim in water samples from these wtss tim concentrations exceeded the odour 0 02 μg l and taste 5 μg l threshold concentrations cancho et al 2000 and would likely have impacted the consumer s acceptability of the water possibly leading to consumer avoidance of the drinking water in most treated and distributed waters from wtss using either chlorine or chloramines the total iodo thm concentrations were well under 1 μg l however at 8 locations including wtss using chlorine and wtss using chloramines for secondary disinfection total iodo thm concentrations were found to be in the same range as typical total regulated thm concentrations in fact the total iodo thm concentrations tended to be higher than total regulated thm concentrations in water from some wtss using source waters with naturally occurring ammonium and chloramines as disinfectants as was observed in two wtss data in this survey show that as predicted by theory naturally occurring ammonium in the source water can significantly increase the potential for the formation of iodo thms during disinfection especially if chloramines are used as disinfection agents ammonium concentration in the source water is therefore an important parameter to be considered when disinfection processes are designed and adding ammonium to the list of routinely tested parameters should be encouraged in our study total iodine was found to be the best indicator for the presence of iodine precursors that favour the formation of iodo thms however neither total iodine nor bromide analysis of source waters at the level of sensitivity required are currently routinely performed for screening water sources for iodo thm formation potential as such analytical procedures are now available from commercial laboratories they could be used more often and would bring important contributions to the evaluation of iodo thm formation potential and the optimization of the disinfection process iodo thms are occurring in canadian drinking water albeit at low concentrations and more information is needed about the toxicological properties of the individual iodo thms in order to evaluate the potential health risk for the canadian population using the drinking water the potential for the formation of significant concentrations of some iodo thms that would challenge at minimum the aesthetic objectives for drinking water quality has been demonstrated by data presented in this paper the fact that iodo thm formation does not correlate well with thm formation associated with the predictions that suggests that iodo thms may be more toxic than chlorinated and brominated thms challenges the basis of using total regulated thm concentrations as a proxy for limiting potential toxic effects of all dbps more research dedicated to understanding the toxicology of iodo thms and the role of source water quality and various treatment process factors that favour the formation of iodo thms in treated drinking water is

19811,the national survey of disinfection by products and selected emerging contaminants investigated the formation of various disinfection by products and contaminants in 65 water treatment systems wtss across canada results for six iodo trihalomethanes iodo thms are reported in this paper the participating water treatment systems included large medium and small systems using water sources and treatment processes which were representative of canadian drinking water five water samples source water treated water and three water samples along the distribution system were collected from each treatment system both under winter and summer conditions samples were stabilized shipped cold and analysed for six iodo thms dichloroiodomethane dcim dibromoiodomethane dbim bromochloroiodomethane bcim chlorodiiodomethane cdim bromodiiodomethane bdim and triiodomethane or iodoform tim using a spme gc ecd method developed in our laboratory mdls from 0 02 μg l for iodoform to 0 06 μg l for bromodiiodomethane concentrations of relevant precursors like dissolved organic carbon doc bromide iodide and total iodine as well as other water quality parameters were also determined detailed information about the treatment process used at each location was recorded using a questionnaire the survey showed that one or more iodo thms were detected at 31 out of 64 water treatment systems wtss under winter conditions and in 46 out of 64 wtss under summer conditions analytical results from one site were excluded due to sampling challenges total iodo thm concentrations measured during this survey ranged from 0 02 μg l to 21 66 μg l the highest total iodo thm concentration was measured in wts 63 where all six iodo thms were detected and iodoform was present in the highest concentration the highest iodo thm formation was found to occur in treatment systems where water sources had naturally occurring ammonium as well as high bromide high iodide and or total iodine concentrations in two such water systems the total concentration of iodo thms exceeded the concentration of regulated thms graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water iodo trihalomethanes chloramines survey bromide iodide 1 introduction chlorination is the most commonly used disinfection method for eliminating potentially pathogenic microorganisms during water disinfection various disinfection by products dbps with known or suspected toxicity are formed by reaction of the disinfectant with naturally occurring organic matter the challenge is therefore to minimize the formation of dbps without compromising disinfection efficiency in the last 40 years more than 500 dbps have been identified richardson 2005 including various iodine containing trihalomethanes iodo thms richardson et al 2008 bichsel and von gunten 2000 and iodine containing haloacetic acids iodo haas richardson et al 2008 the occurrence of the six iodo thms dcim dbim bcim cdim bdim and tim is due to the formation of hypoiodous acid hoi during the treatment process through the oxidation of iodide by oxidants used in the disinfection process e g free chlorine chloramines and the subsequent reaction of hoi with the natural organic matter nom present in the source water bichsel and von gunten 1999 formation of iodo thms during oxidation of waters containing iodine with chlorine dioxide has also been observed during laboratory experiments ye et al 2013 iodide occurs naturally in some source waters with higher concentrations typically associated with the vicinity of sea water or the presence of inland salt deposits and brines richardson et al 2008 iodine concentrations comparable to those typically found in sea waters have also been reported in some inland surface waters moran et al 2002 it is interesting to note that iodo thms as well as iodo haas have been found in disinfected water from water sources with no detectable iodide mdl 0 13 μg l richardson et al 2008 leading the authors to presume other organic or inorganic iodine sources may have been involved in the presence of free chlorine hypochlorous acid hocl hoi is quickly oxidized further to iodate io3 which under aerobic conditions is the thermodynamically stable inorganic iodine species in water ullman et al 1990 iodate is the desired sink for iodine in drinking water due to its quick reduction to iodide in vivo and consequent expected low toxicity to humans smith et al 2010 the ability of free chlorine to oxidize hoi to iodate minimizes the potential for iodo thm formation in drinking water disinfection processes using chlorine bichsel and von gunten 1999 hua et al 2006 although formation of iodo thms in such processes has been reported richardson et al 2008 cancho et al 2000 however when using chloramine in the disinfection process hoi is much more stable and its reaction with nom is favoured bichsel and von gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000 the concentration of bromide in the source water has an important influence on the formation and speciation of iodo thms allard et al 2015 bromide reacts with chlorine to form hypobromous acid hobr hobr oxidizes hoi to io3 in a bromide catalyzed reaction with a higher reaction rate than hocl accelerating the process by which hoi is removed from the system and reducing the potential for iodo thm formation criquet et al 2012 hobr is also more reactive towards phenolic moieties from nom than hocl westerhoff et al 2004 criquet et al 2015 potentially leading to more brominated precursors that can react with hoi and shift the speciation of iodo thms formed toward more brominated iodinated species the important role of ammonium in the formation of organoiodinated compounds during chlorination has been observed in laboratory experiments karpel van leitner et al 1998 indeed the formation of iodo thms in water treatment plants using chloramines has been reported in many countries richardson et al 2008 cancho et al 2000 krasner et al 2006 hansson et al 1987 weinberg et al 2002 goslan et al 2009 in some cases leading to taste and odour issues hansson et al 1987 due to the formation of iodoform which has low odour 0 02 μg l and taste 5 μg l threshold concentrations cancho et al 2000 in water treatment plants using chloramines the formation of iodo thms has been predicted bichsel and von gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000 and found richardson et al 2008 goslan et al 2009 to be inversely correlated with the time allowed between the addition of chlorine and the addition of ammonia for the formation of monochloramine treatment processes that allow longer time for chlorine to react with precursors in the source water before the addition of ammonia have been reported to produce lower concentrations of iodo thms richardson et al 2008 goslan et al 2009 allard et al 2015 under these circumstances particularly challenging is the case for water treatment plants using source water with naturally occurring ammonium in such cases chloramines are formed at the first addition of chlorine and the formation of iodo thms is favoured richardson et al 2008 after the introduction of regulations limiting the concentrations of chlorine and bromine containing trihalomethanes thms the regulated thms in treated drinking water many water treatment plants in canada switched from chlorination to chloramination in an attempt to minimize the formation of the regulated thms however as discussed above evidence from the studies available suggests that the formation of iodo thms in water treated with chloramines tends to be higher than in water disinfected by chlorination with short free chlorine contact time before the addition of ammonia the concentration of iodo thms formed can be of the same order of magnitude as the concentration of regulated thms krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 published literature also suggests that iodine containing thms may be more toxic than chlorinated and brominated thms woo et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 the increased potential for iodo thm formation in water treatment plants using chloramines and or source water with naturally occurring ammonium combined with the potential toxicity of the unregulated dbps creates a dilemma for many water treatment systems the operators are caught between their efforts to maintain regulated dbps below the required limits and the desire to minimize the risk posed by emerging dbps like iodo thms yet still maintaining their treatment process disinfection efficacy this study was designed to investigate the occurrence of dbps in 65 water treatment systems across canada iodo thms were chosen among the target analytes due to 1 increasing use of chloramines during water treatment in canada 2 a significant presence of ammonium in source waters in some geographic regions of the country and 3 the concentrations of bromide iodide and natural organic matter were also expected to be high in these same geographic areas this study was conducted in 2009 2010 and was to our knowledge the first canadian study on the occurrence of iodo thms in drinking water the goal was to add canadian occurrence data for iodo thms to the accumulating body of data from other countries richardson et al 2008 ullman et al 1990 krasner et al 2006 hansson et al 1987 and to find information that would allow to predict water treatment systems that are susceptible to iodo thm formation 2 survey design 2 1 site selection sixty five water treatment systems wtss across canada were selected based on water source lake river ground water the size of the population served and the disinfection post disinfection treatment process used chlorination chloramination ozonation uv ultrafiltration fig 1

under 5000 people of the 65 wtss included in the survey 52 80 used chlorine as the main disinfection agent 12 18 used chloramines as the post disinfection agent i e secondary disinfectant and one

selected iodo thm precursors dissolved organic carbon doc total organic carbon toc bromide iodide total iodine were determined in addition 33 non iodine containing neutral dbps thms haloacetaldehydes including chloral hydrate haloacetonitriles haloketones ndma and six substituted nitrosamines chloropicrin mx and 9 haloacetic acids were measured during the survey source water characteristics including ammonium and nitrite nitrate concentrations major ions and 36 metals were measured free and total chlorine water temperature turbidity and water ph were determined on site the characteristics of the water treatment process at the time of sampling including disinfection methods i e primary and secondary disinfectants were recorded using a questionnaire filled by the wts operator all water sampling was done by a health canada sampling specialist using protocols specific to each analysis samples were quenched acidified and then shipped by overnight courier where available or by the quickest available route to health canada and to the other participating laboratories during shipping water samples were kept under 10 c whenever possible samples were analysed as soon as received at the laboratories or according to their specified shelf life and handling protocols 2 3 sampling schedule samples were collected from wtss twice in the same year in the winter summer of 2009 and winter summer of 2010 samples were collected during these two seasons to capture the extremes of water temperature during the year and account for the well documented influence of water temperature on dbp formation krasner 2009 water temperature at the time of sampling is presented in table 3 in the sm for all wtss five samples were collected a source water sample before the treatment plant r a treated water sample at the exit of the treatment plant t and three samples from the distribution system at progressively distant points from the treatment facility d1 d2 d3 2 4 water sampling and stabilization for iodo thm analysis duplicate water samples were collected in 65 ml amber bottles pre loaded with 0 2 ml fresh ascorbic acid solution 0 114 m as a quenching agent and enough 0 2 n hcl solution based on a preliminary titration of the water samples at the site to achieve a final sample ph of 4 5 5 at some wtss higher concentrations of hcl solution up to 1 n had to be used to achieve the required ph while keeping the volume of acid solution limited 1 ml to avoid diluting the sample the bottles were filled ensuring no headspace after running the tap for 5 min most samples were analysed within 5 days of collection however a few samples were analysed within 10 days due to transportation delays from remote locations 3 laboratory work 3 1 water sample stability study a stability study of the six iodo thms at ph 4 5 in the presence of ascorbic acid was conducted and is described in the sm results showed that all iodo thms were stable for 10 days under the sampling and storing conditions described above however at day 10 a slight decrease in concentration was observed particularly for iodoform and also to a smaller extent for bdim and cdim see sm 3 2 analytical methods 3 2 1 iodo thm analysis iodo thms were analysed using an automated solid phase microextraction gas chromatography with electron capture detection method spme gc ecd the

distributed water of 31 out of 65 wtss 48 tested under winter conditions and in 46 out of 65 wtss 71 tested under summer conditions total iodo thm concentrations calculated as the sum of concentrations of all congeners measured in one sample in treated water samples collected during winter and summer ranged from 0 02 μg l to 21 66 μg l fig 1 shows the distribution of the sampled wtss based on the highest total iodo thm concentration the highest total concentration measured during summer or winter campaigns in either the treated water or any of the three water samples from the distribution system water samples was used in fig 1 4 2 iodo thm speciation in the treated water iodo thms individual concentrations ranged from under mdl to a maximum of 2 27 μg l for dcim 2 91 μg l for dbim 2 06 μg l for bcim 4 31 μg l for cdim 2 71 μg l for bdim and 8 3 μg l for tim the highest concentration for all iodo thms was measured at the same wts wts 63 except for dcim for which the highest concentration was found at wts 48 all six iodo thm congeners were found in the treated drinking water at detectable levels at only 3 wtss 18 45 and 63 in the winter and 2 wtss in the summer 18 and 63 in the latter case tim was the largest contributor to the total iodo thm concentration dcim was the most significant congener found in the mid system samples d2 in 18 of 31 wtss winter and 24 of 46 wtss summer where iodo thms were detected dbim was the next major congener the congener with the highest concentration in 6 of 31 wtss winter and in 15 of 46 wtss summer table 7 in the sm

the treated water of wtss 18 21 45 and 63 the sites where most congeners were detected measured under winter 2a and summer 2b conditions specific conditions favoring the formation of iodo thms at these sites include high iodide from 3 6 μg l 0 03 μm at site 21 131 4 μg l 1 03 μm at site 63 and bromide from 112μg l 1 4 μm at site 45 414μg l 5 μm at site 63 bromide iodide molar ratios ranging from 5 site 63 to 74 site 21 in the summer and the presence of ammonia in the source water at sites 18 21 and 63 for sites 18 21 and 63 ground water sources situated inland and not affected by wastewater the particular water characteristics are due to a special geology the wells are situated in sediments from former seabeds sites 18 and 21 are situated in a region with known underground salt deposits site 45 is a surface water source from a coastal location at all sites chlorine is used as disinfectant however at sites 18 21 and 63 chloramines are formed ab initio with the ammonium present in the source water 4 3 bromide iodide and total iodine in source waters bromide concentration in the source waters of the 65 wtss included in the survey ranged from under the mdl 5 μg l to 733 μg l the highest bromide concentration was found in a ground water sample winter from a coastal location wts 58 at this location a marked increase 740 in the bromide concentration in winter compared with the concentration in summer was observed and was attributed to see water intrusion of the 7 sites with source waters containing 100 μg l bromide 2 were coastal sites wts 45 and 58 and 5 were situated in regions with known high salinity soils wtss 63 18 21 48 and 47 iodide concentration in the source waters of the 65 wtss included in the survey ranged from under the mdl 0 018 μg l to 131 36 μg l the highest iodide concentration was found in a summer sample from an inland ground water source wts 63 the 7 sites with the highest iodide concentration in source waters 10 μg l iodide include 2 coastal sites wts 45 and 58 and 5 inland sites wtss 63 18 21 52 and 62 total iodine concentration in the source waters of the 65 wtss included in the survey ranged from below the mdl 0 14 μg l to 132 μg l with the highest concentration found in winter at wts 63 of the 9 sites with the highest total iodine concentration 10 μg l 3 were coastal sites wtss 45 43 and 58 and 5 were various inland sites across the country wtss 63 18 21 52 and 62 a summary of the seasonal concentrations for bromide iodide and total iodine in the source waters for the 65 wtss included in the survey is presented in table 2 the complete dataset for bromide iodide and total iodine can be found in the sm table 9 5 discussion 5 1 the iodine source the total concentration of iodo thms found in 55 of the 65 wtss investigated was under 1 μg l corresponding to 2 nm and in most cases the iodide concentration in the source waters of these wtss was also 1 μg l corresponding to 7 8 nm although the total iodine concentration was higher up to 5 5 μg l 43 nm total iodo thm concentrations between 1 μg l 2 nm and 21 66 μg l corresponding to 68 7 nm were found in 8 water systems wtss 18 43 45 46 47 48 63 65 see table 7 in sm at these wtss iodide concentrations in the source water ranged from under the mdl of 0 018 μg l 0 7 nm to 131 4 μg l 1 03 μm and total iodine concentrations ranged from 5 6 μg l 43 nm to 132 μg l 1 04 μm the highest total iodo thm concentrations were found at the 2 wtss 63 and 18 with the highest total iodine as well as iodide concentrations in the water source however in these two cases other factors beside the availability of the precursor may have contributed to the formation of the higher iodo thm concentrations more specifically both water sources also contained high bromide concentrations and naturally occurring ammonium as mentioned before the high bromide and iodide concentrations in ground water used by wts 18 21 and 63 appear to be due to their situation in sediments from former seabeds it is remarkable that the total iodine and the iodide iodate w w ratio in these source waters iodate concentration was calculated as the difference between total iodine and iodide concentrations with no significant contribution from organic iodinated compounds assumed at these sites is higher than the average values for sea water schnepfe 1972 collins 1975 however this is not unique as iodide has been found to be tremendously enriched in some brines associated with sediments by comparison to the normal evaporite associated brines collins 1975 overall no consistent correlation was observed between total iodo thms formed and the iodide concentration in the source water see figs 5 and 6 in the sm the data indicate that the presence of iodine in the form of iodide in the source water does not appear to be a requirement for the formation of iodo thms in one case wts 65 three iodo thms dcim bcim and dbim were found in both winter and summer treated t as well as mid point distribution d2 water samples with the highest concentration 1 1 μg l 4 6 nm measured in summer at d2 although iodide was only detected at a value close to mdl 0 049 μg l 0 4 nm in the winter and undetectable in the summer a similar situation was described by richardson et al 2008 who raised the possibility that there were other inorganic or organic sources of iodine beyond the inorganic iodide measured in the source waters this appears to be the situation at site 65 from our survey as the total iodine measured in the r and d2summer water samples was 6 5 μg l 51 nm r and 11 8 μg l 93 nm d2 respectively the source water of wts 65 is a river and the source of iodinated precursors may be anthropogenic input based on measurement of markers included in the 2009 2010 survey and not presented here our data show that iodide concentration in some source waters may have a high seasonal variability for example at wts 18 the iodide total iodine ratio was 34 4 in the winter and 86 6 in the summer due to a decrease of 47 μg l in iodide concentration between the winter and the summer samples while the measured total iodine concentration increased by only 3 μg l many factors could be involved in the seasonal variation of iodide concentration from changes in the solution oxidation reduction potential e h to changes in anion exchange and iodide adsorption on sediments all processes known to occur in brines associated with sediments collins 1975 in the particular case of those three water sources increased anion exchange and iodide desorption from sediments due to higher water leaching through the sediments during spring thaw appears the more reasonable hypothesis as these are deep wells with less than 10 c variation in temperature between winter and summer however this will need to be demonstrated which exceeded the scope of our survey in view of observations described above it appears that total iodine concentration which is stable throughout the year and includes both inorganic and organic potential iodine sources may be a better parameter then iodide to describe iodine availability for iodo thm formation however total iodo thm concentrations formed did not correlate well with total iodine concentrations in the source water see figs 7 and 8 in the sm showing that although total iodine can prove the existence of the necessary iodinated precursors the extent of iodo thm occurrence is heavily influenced by other water quality and treatment process factors 5 2 predicting the existence of an iodine source bromide concentration has previously been proposed as a marker for iodide concentration since iodide concentration in source waters is rarely measured by wtss in canada however bromide concentration has been reported to have a poor correlation with iodide concentrations in many source waters richardson et al 2008 our findings from this canadian survey support the observation that there is no meaningful correlation between bromide and iodide concentrations in source waters see figs 9 and 10 in the sm as total iodine appears to be both a better descriptor of iodine availability for the formation of iodo thms and to be a more conservative parameter we looked at the possible correlation between bromide and total iodine concentrations using the data from the wtss in the study total iodine concentrations also do not appear to be well correlated with bromide concentrations see figs 11 and 12 in the sm according to our data bromide concentration is not likely to be a reliable indicator for the presence of iodine precursors in the source water in fact as we now know that iodine precursors nature inorganic organic and source sea water influence brines associated with inland sediments from ancient sea beds waste water are so diverse it would be surprising if iodide total iodine and bromide concentrations were correlated the use of bromide concentration as a sole predictor of potential iodo thm formation may lead to overlooking some sites with low bromide concentration yet where iodide and other iodinated precursor concentrations are high enough that combined with favourable conditions may result in the formation of iodo thms during treatment 5 3 treatment process factors free chlorine vs chloramines chloramines were used as secondary disinfectants in 12 of the 65 wtss included in the survey table 3 shows a summary comparison between total iodo thm concentrations measured in water samples from wtss using chloramines vs wtss using chlorine in this study the use of chloramines even when iodine was present did not appear to be the main determining factor in the formation of iodo thms the proportion of wtss with detectable levels of iodo thms is certainly higher among wtss using chloramines as secondary disinfectants however the average and median total iodo thm concentrations are very similar for wtss using chlorine and chloramines it should be noted that information about the chlorine contact time before the addition of ammonia for wtss using chloramines was not available in this study both the proportion of wtss where iodo thms were found as well as the average and median total iodo thm concentrations increased considerably for the wtss using source waters with naturally occurring ammonia whether the secondary disinfectant used is chlorine breakpoint chlorination or chloramines 5 4 the importance of naturally occurring ammonium in the source water ammonium was found in the source water at concentrations over 0 1 mg l at 10 wtss 1 13 15 18 21 43 48 62 63 and 65 so chloramines were formed in the treated water from these wtss as soon as chlorine was added for disinfection ammonium was also present in the source water at 5 wtss 18 43 48 63 and 65 of the 8 wtss where total iodo thm concentrations were over 1 μg l this seems to indicate that the formation of higher iodo thm concentrations is related to the ab initio formation of chloramines as predicted by theory bichsel and von gunten 2000 and shown in laboratory experiments bichsel and von gunten 1999 hua et al 2006 a similar case was also observed during a previous survey targeting water systems that applied chloramines to treat source waters with high bromide content richardson et al 2008 for the 10 wts using chloramines where low levels of iodo thms were formed chlorine was added to the water before ammonia therefore hoi was quickly oxidized to iodate limiting the formation of iodo thms only two of the 12 wtss using chloramines in the treatment process had iodo thm concentrations over 1 μg l and those 2 wtss 18 and 63 also had naturally occurring ammonium in the source water high iodide and total iodine concentrations and molar bromide iodide ratios between 5 and 17 in these cases chloramines were formed at the first addition of chlorine and were the only disinfectants used throughout the process the hoi was able to react with nom for a prolonged period and consequently a variety of iodo thms including tim were formed in the treated water total iodo thms formed in water from wtss 18 and 63 were the highest measured in this survey and tim was the congener with the highest contribution to the total concentration 5 5 total iodo thm concentration may exceed regulated total thm concentration under specific treatment conditions data from this survey see fig 3 as well as previously published data richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 show that in some water systems and under specific treatment conditions the total iodo thm concentration can exceed the total regulated thm chloroform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane bromoform concentration this is particularly important as iodo thms are not routinely measured while monitoring total thm concentration is a regulatory requirement as such low levels of regulated total thms may lead utilities to overlook the presence of iodo thms in the treated water although iodo thms are suspected to be more toxic than their chlorinated brominated counterparts richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 a comparison between wtss 18 and 21 see selected water quality parameters in table 4 is interesting and may illustrate the differences in iodo thm formation in source waters where naturally occurring ammonium is used to form chloramines wts 18 or where chlorination past the breakpoint is used wts 21 the source waters at those two locations have high levels of naturally occurring bromide iodide and total iodine as well as high doc compared to other ground water sources significant concentrations of naturally occurring ammonium 3 3 mg l and 0 97 mg l in wts 18 and 21 respectively are also present at wts 18 all iodo thm congeners were detected adding up to a maximum total concentration of 9 18 μg l in mid point d2 summer distribution water tim was the major iodo thm congener formed 3 35 μg l at wts 21 the maximum total iodo thm concentration also measured in mid point summer distribution water was considerably lower 0 95 μg l dcim bcim and dbim were present and the major iodo thm congener was dbim 0 71 μg l wts 18 used chloramines as secondary disinfectants while wts 21 used chlorine as secondary disinfectant free chlorine residual concentration was 0 89 mg l as a result of the differences in the secondary disinfection agent the ratio between total iodo thms and total regulated thms is also significantly different between the two sites at wts 21 breakpoint chlorination in the summer the w w ratio of iodo thms to regulated thms is only about 1 09 compared to 153 at wts 18 chloramine for secondary disinfection see fig 3 and table 5 at wts 18 chloramines are the dominant oxidant species throughout the process leading to low formation of regulated thms and at the same time allowing the hoi an extended reaction time with chlorinated brominated precursors and nom to produce all 6 iodo thms in contrast at wts 21 after the initial formation of chloramines at the first addition of chlorine the continuation of the chlorine addition leads to the quick oxidation of hoi to iodate a process that is also favoured by the high molar ratio of bromide to iodide 74 in summer source water at wts 21 allard et al 2015 as a consequence the formation of iodo thms is interrupted early at wts 21 due to the disappearance of the iodination agent this is also reflected by the lower degree of iodine incorporation at wts 21 where the major congener is dbim compared to wts 18 where the major congener is tim the oxidant species in solution are now hocl and especially hobr and with enough nom available significant concentrations of regulated thms are formed 5 6 iodo thm speciation in the treated water the six iodo thm congeners were found with variable frequency in treated water see table 6 dcim was the iodo thm formed most often in the wtss investigated followed by its brominated equivalent dbim the triiodinated species tim and the diiodinated species cdim and bdim were found much less often with higher frequency in wtss using chloramines and at concentrations exceeding 1 μg l only in the treated water of wtss 18 and 63 where ammonia was present in the source water and chloramines were used as secondary disinfectants the formation of diiodianted and triiodinated congeners mostly in disinfection processes using chloramines is related to the prolonged presence of hoi in such systems in the absence of a stronger oxidation agent like chlorine leading to repeated substitution of nom reactive sites at wtss 18 21 and 63 the ammonium present in the source water and to a certain extent the dissolved organic matter dom react with chlorine and quench it making hoi the main oxidizing agent at wts 21 the high bromide iodide molecular ratio which favors the rapid oxidation of hoi to iodate and the use of excess chlorine past breakpoint chlorination result in the formation of dcim bcim and dbim in the winter in the summer sample the concentration of iodide is significantly higher and enough hoi exists in the system to lead to the formation of small amounts of the triiodinated species tim the water at wts 18 has a higher iodide concentration than at wts 21 and chlorination does not reach the breakpoint so only chloramines are present in the treated water all iodo thms are formed and the distribution is more favourable to chlorinated species on a molar basis than at wts 21 however significant concentrations of tim are also formed this results correspond to the expected iodo thm formation according to the low hox exposure in the presence of bromine described by allard et al 2015 in the summer water the increased concentration of iodide allows for increased concentration of hoi formation and leads to increased formation of tim at wts 63 the bromide iodide molar ratio is 5 however the iodide concentration is significantly higher chloramines are used as secondary disinfectants and iodide can be detected even in the treated water there is enough hoi reacting in the system to create a mixture of all iodo thms including significant amounts of tim site 45 differs from the three sites described above by the absence of ammonia in the source water the hydrobromous acid hobr formed after the addition of chlorine oxidizes hoi to iodate limiting the amount of iodo thms formed and favours the formation of bromine containing iodo thms this effect is even more apparent in the summer water when only dbim is formed corresponding to the high hox exposure in the presence of bromine mechanism allard et al 2015 5 7 seasonal variation of iodo thm concentration at the 29 sites where one or more iodo thm compounds were detected under both winter and summer conditions concentrations tended to be higher in summer than in winter the higher occurrence of iodo thm concentrations near mdls at many wtss leads to an increased frequency of detection in summer compared to winter at wtss 18 and 63 where all iodo thm congeners were detected in both seasons the increase in concentration between winter and summer was significant especially for the diiodinated and triiodinated thms in the distribution system samples see fig 4 this can be due to the higher concentration of iodide present in the source water in the summer which combined with a lower molar bromide iodide ratio 5 and 6 in the summer compared to 5 2 and 17 in the winter at wtss 18 and 63 respectively leads to the formation of higher hoi concentrations that can react repeatedly with nom leading to a high degree of iodine incorporation 5 8 variation of iodo thm concentration along the distribution system inconsistent and mostly insignificant variations in iodo thm congener concentrations were found at all sampling points during winter in the summer samples a slight tendency towards increased iodo thm congener concentrations with the residence i e reaction time was observed for most wtss this is in marked contrast with the significant variations in concentrations along the distribution system observed for the regulated thms the increased iodo thms concentrations in the mid point distribution d2 samples by comparison with treated t samples was significant at wts 18 25 and especially at wts 63 410 this is attributed to the high iodide concentration present in the source water which allowed the hoi reactions with nom to continue in the distribution system wts 63 in the summer is the only system in which iodide 8 3 μg l was still available in the treated water wts 18 treated water was not sampled for iodide which may explain the unusually large increase in iodo thm concentrations between t and d2 samples at this site most of which was due to tim and cdim increase in concentration see fig 5 a and b 6 conclusions iodo thms can form in drinking water during disinfection using either chlorine or chloramine in this survey one or more iodo thms were found in treated water samples from 45 71 out of 63 wtss using either chlorine or chloramines for secondary disinfection the detection frequency was higher in wtss using chloramines 83 vs wtss using chlorine 69 however the average and median total iodo thm concentrations were similar for wtss using chlorine and chloramines both the proportion of wtss where iodo thms were found as well as the average and median total iodo thm concentrations increased considerably for the wtss using source waters with naturally occurring ammonia whether the secondary disinfectant used was chlorine or chloramines dcim was the iodo thm formed most often in the wtss investigated followed by the brominated equivalent dbim all iodo thm congeners were found in the treated water of the two wtss where the highest total iodo thm concentrations were measured and where the major congener was tim in water samples from these wtss tim concentrations exceeded the odour 0 02 μg l and taste 5 μg l threshold concentrations cancho et al 2000 and would likely have impacted the consumer s acceptability of the water possibly leading to consumer avoidance of the drinking water in most treated and distributed waters from wtss using either chlorine or chloramines the total iodo thm concentrations were well under 1 μg l however at 8 locations including wtss using chlorine and wtss using chloramines for secondary disinfection total iodo thm concentrations were found to be in the same range as typical total regulated thm concentrations in fact the total iodo thm concentrations tended to be higher than total regulated thm concentrations in water from some wtss using source waters with naturally occurring ammonium and chloramines as disinfectants as was observed in two wtss data in this survey show that as predicted by theory naturally occurring ammonium in the source water can significantly increase the potential for the formation of iodo thms during disinfection especially if chloramines are used as disinfection agents ammonium concentration in the source water is therefore an important parameter to be considered when disinfection processes are designed and adding ammonium to the list of routinely tested parameters should be encouraged in our study total iodine was found to be the best indicator for the presence of iodine precursors that favour the formation of iodo thms however neither total iodine nor bromide analysis of source waters at the level of sensitivity required are currently routinely performed for screening water sources for iodo thm formation potential as such analytical procedures are now available from commercial laboratories they could be used more often and would bring important contributions to the evaluation of iodo thm formation potential and the optimization of the disinfection process iodo thms are occurring in canadian drinking water albeit at low concentrations and more information is needed about the toxicological properties of the individual iodo thms in order to evaluate the potential health risk for the canadian population using the drinking water the potential for the formation of significant concentrations of some iodo thms that would challenge at minimum the aesthetic objectives for drinking water quality has been demonstrated by data presented in this paper the fact that iodo thm formation does not correlate well with thm formation associated with the predictions that suggests that iodo thms may be more toxic than chlorinated and brominated thms challenges the basis of using total regulated thm concentrations as a proxy for limiting potential toxic effects of all dbps more research dedicated to understanding the toxicology of iodo thms and the role of source water quality and various treatment process factors that favour the formation of iodo thms in treated drinking water is

19812,biogenic manganese oxide biomnox can efficiently adsorb various minor metals the production of biomnox in reactors to remove metals during wastewater treatment processes is a promising biotechnological method however it is difficult to preferentially enrich manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob to produce biomnox during wastewater treatment processes a unique method of cultivating mnob using methane oxidizing bacteria mob to produce soluble microbial products is proposed here mnob were successfully enriched in a methane fed reactor containing mob biomnox production during the wastewater treatment process was confirmed long term continual operation of the reactor allowed simultaneous removal of mn ii co ii and ni ii the co ii mn ii and ni ii mn ii removal ratios were 53 and 19 respectively the degree to which mn ii was removed indicated that the enriched mnob used utilization associated products and or biomass associated products microbial community analysis revealed that methanol oxidizing bacteria belonging to the hyphomicrobiaceae family played important roles in the oxidation of mn ii by using utilization associated products methane oxidizing bacteria were found to be inhibited by mno2 but the maximum mn ii removal rate was 0 49 kg m 3 d 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological manganese oxidation downflow hanging sponge dhs reactor methane

metal industry and are used in modern products such as rechargeable batteries semiconductors photovoltaic cells and structural materials products containing minor metals eventually become waste and such waste is produced in large amounts in urban areas industrial wastewater is usually discharged without minor metals being recovered because the amounts of minor metals being produced are increasing it is necessary to recycle them to move toward a sustainable system widmer et al 2005 chatterjee 2012 gaines 2014 biotechnology using microorganisms has been used to recover metals from wastewater biomineralization the production of minerals by organisms is one such technique manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob can produce manganese oxide mnox by oxidizing soluble mn ii tebo et al 2004 2005 spiro et al 2010 the biologically produced mnox biomnox produced by mnob has a large surface area to mass ratio nelson et al 1999 villalobos et al 2003 and can adsorb a wide range of minor metal ions more effectively than abiotic mno2 toner et al 2006 villalobos et al 2005 webb et al 2006 wang et al 2009 making biomnox an attractive material for removing metals from aqueous systems abiotic mn ii oxidation is thermodynamically favored at higher ph morgan 2005 but biological oxidation occurs even around neutral ph values bargar et al 2000 therefore the use of biomnox to recover minor metals during wastewater treatment processes is promising miyata et al 2007 cao et al 2015 in previous studies mnob have been found in a wide variety of environmental systems including rivers and seas tipping 1984 tebo and emerson 1985 stein et al 2001 zhou et al 2016 polluted water bodies and soils in mining areas marble et al 1998 akob et al 2014 water supply facilities vandenabeele et al 1992 nitzsche et al 2015 and even extreme environments such as hydrothermal vent plumes cowen et al 1986 mandernack and tebo 1993 as a result mnob are phylogenetically diverse but are all heterotrophic aerobic bacteria that grow on organic substances chemolithoautotrophic mnob that can use the energy released through mn ii oxidation to grow have not previously been described however cao et al 2015 reported that mnob enrichment in a reactor containing other microorganisms failed at a high substrate concentration because mnob cannot compete with other heterotrophic bacteria to use the available substrates we have focused on low organic substrate concentrations to enrich mnob in wastewater treatment systems because mnob have been detected in oligotrophic environments such as wells and water distribution systems ghiorse 1984 we developed a unique method of enriching mnob by continually supplying organic substrates derived from nitrifier metabolism at low concentrations heterotrophic bacteria have always been found to coexist with nitrifiers in autotrophic nitrifying biofilms used in wastewater treatment systems kindaichi et al 2004 okabe et al 2005 matsumoto et al 2010 nitrifiers excrete organic substances as soluble microbial products smps which are produced in only small quantities but act as heterotrophic substrates we succeeded using this cross feeding technique in enriching mnob using nitrifiers and biological mn ii oxidation using a downflow hanging sponge dhs reactor providing only ammonium as a substrate cao et al 2015 in the present study we focused on mnob coupled with methane oxidizing bacteria mob we selected this method because application of methane as a substrate is more controllable than use of ammonium containing wastewaters in which the ammonium concentration usually fluctuates we expected that a higher biomnox production rate would be achieved using this system than employing a system using nitrifiers because the decrease in ph caused by nitrification decreases the mn ii oxidation activity but will not occur when mob are used we found that mnob grew on smps but it was unclear whether smps were always able to cause mnob enrichment because they have different compositions when different microbes are present soluble microbial products are usually classified as two distinct groups utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps barker and stuckey 1999 uaps are produced in proportion to the amount of substrate used laspidou and rittmann 2002a 2002b whereas baps are derived from the decay of biomass and are hydrophilic organic colloids and macromolecules polysaccharides proteins and or amino sugar like compounds jarusutthirak and amy 2006 natural polymers with high molecular weights secreted by microorganisms also known as extracellular polymeric substances are types of smps but have generally not been described as uaps or baps the biodegradable properties of uaps and baps are quite different jiang et al 2008 and it is unclear whether uaps or baps contribute to the enrichment of mnob in the presence of other microbes kato et al 2017 reported that biotic mn ii oxidation coupled with methane oxidation was successful under marine conditions although the oxidation rate was very low while no biomnox was observed in a system coupled with nitrification it is unclear whether biomnox production in the methane oxidation system occurs under freshwater conditions here we report that mnob enrichment is possible in a methane oxidation reactor containing mob under freshwater conditions we assessed how uaps and baps produced through mob metabolism affected mnob growth in addition the effects of the oxygen and mn ii concentrations on mn ii oxidation were investigated and putative mnob that were enriched in the reactor were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up two identical closed dhs reactors each a 1 0 l column 85 cm high and 4 cm in diameter were used for mnob enrichment mnob were enriched in the presence of mob to produce biomnox in both columns fig s1 each column contained a string of 20 polyurethane sponge cubes each 2 cm 2 cm 2 cm giving a total sponge volume of 160 cm3 connected to each other diagonally in series hanging within the gas phase air containing methane the substrate was fed into the top of each reactor using a pump the air flowed downward through the column and was emitted from the bottom of the column a mineral solution containing mn ii was supplied to the reactor and discharged from the bottom both reactors were kept in a temperature controlled room at 25 c but operated under different conditions runs 1 and 2 before a run was started the sponges were soaked in diluted activated sludge obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant to inoculate the biomass 2 2 operating conditions the operating conditions were changed over time to determine the effects of different methane mn ii and oxygen concentrations on mn oxidation the test conditions are shown in table 1 runs 1 and 2 had six and four phases respectively the influent mn ii methane and oxygen concentrations were 0 50 mg l 1 0 4 and 5 50 respectively the gas retention time based on the reactor volume was 1 4 h and the hydraulic retention time based on the sponge volume was 2 18 h the effluent water recirculation ratio was nine from day 65 to the end of the experiment day 1000 in both runs 2 3 substrate and artificial wastewater the substrate gas was prepared by adding specific concentrations of methane and or oxygen to air the artificial wastewater contained mn ii mncl2 4h2o and nano3 30 4 mg l 1 nahco3 100 mg l 1 na2hpo4 12h2o 11 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 5 mg l 1 feso4 7h2o 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 5h2o 0 025 mg

cocl2 6h2o 10 mg l 1 were added to the wastewater 2 4 analytical methods samples of the gas and wastewater influent and effluent were collected twice each week each water sample was passed through a ptfe membrane with 0 2 μm pores and the mn ii ni ii and co ii concentrations were determined by the periodate oxidation method using a hach water quality analyzer dr 2800 hach loveland co usa the gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography using a sgc 8apt instrument shimadzu kyoto japan the particles produced in the reactors were analyzed using leucoberbeline blue i sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to determine if they were mn oxides krumbein and altmann 1973 2 5 microbial community analysis biomass samples were collected by squeezing the upper middle and lower portions of the sponge carriers in the reactor used for run 1 on days 406 555 and 890 and the reactor used for run 2 on days 632 713 and 890 the biomass collected was washed with phosphate buffer dna was extracted using a fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna extracted from each of the three biomass samples from a run was diluted to the same final concentration after which the three samples were mixed polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16s rrna gene was performed using the primer sets 27f 5ʹ agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3ʹ and 519r 5ʹ agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3ʹ with a one shot la pcr mix takara bio otsu japan the polymerase chain reaction conditions were 5 min initial denaturation at 94 c followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 58 c and 60 s at 72 c and then final extension at 72 c for 5 min the polymerase chain reaction products were purified and sequenced using the emulsion method using a roche 454 pe genome sequencer flx 454 life sciences branford ct usa at hokkaido system science sapporo japan the sequences obtained were analyzed using qiime virtual box version 1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 operational taxonomic units were grouped based on the 97 identity of dna using the uclust method edgar 2010 and these operational taxonomic units were classified using the greengenes database mcdonald et al 2012 werner et al 2012 2 6 effect of mn oxides on mob activity as mentioned in the results section the methane removal performance was poor we suspected that biomnox produced in the reactor may have inhibited mob activity therefore a mob activity test was performed to determine if mno2 suppresses mob a mob specimen was prepared by cultivating activated sludge the same as used to inoculate the dhss in an atmosphere containing 4 methane for 1 week in a vial containing minerals a 40 ml aliquot of mob enriched biomass was added to each of a series of 122 ml vials containing an atmosphere containing methane and mno2 supplied by kishida chemical osaka japan at seven concentrations between 0 and 250 g l 1 the mob activity was measured by determining how much the methane concentration in the headspace decreased from the initial concentration of 4 over 8 h at 25 c 3 results 3 1 mn ii oxidation coupled with methane oxidation the dhs reactor used for run 1 was aerobic and methane was the only source of carbon the operating time was very long 1000 d after a long time mnob enrichment and mn ii oxidation coupled with methane oxidation were found suggesting that smps excreted by the mob could serve as the sole sources of energy for mnob growth during the early part of phase 1 days 0 154 mn ii was not removed even though the methane provided was almost completely consumed fig 1 a and b we concluded that no mn ii was removed possibly because of a smp deficiency so the methane loading rate based on the sponge volume was increased to 0 21 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1c to increase smp production as expected mn ii started to be removed and the mn ii removal rate steadily increased as the methane removal rate increased around day 90 reaching 0 06 kg m 3 d 1 on day 154 fig 1b fine black particles formed on the sponges which turned from light brown to black particles were found at the bottom of the dhs reactor fig s2 the black particles were confirmed to be biomnox using the leucoberbeline blue i method indicating that the mn ii removed had been oxidized by the mnob that had been cultivated 3 2 effect of methane oxidation activity on mn ii oxidation the growth of mnob on the smps produced by mob suggested that mn ii oxidation would stop when no methane was provided conversely the mn ii oxidation activity would increase if the methane loading rate was increased to test these predictions four different operating conditions were used in phases 2 to 5 of run 1 days 155 950 no methane was supplied in phase 2 days 155 200 and phase 4 days 562 631 surprisingly mn ii was removed for a long time almost 1 month even in phase 2 no methane supplied and the mn ii removal rate was 0 06 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1a and b the removal rate gradually decreased after that time a similar phenomenon was found in phase 4 during which the mn ii removal rate remained at 0 25 kg m 3 d 1 for 3 weeks then gradually decreased for 2 months it was expected that mn ii would no longer be removed as soon as methane stopped being supplied because mnob cannot use smps as substrates but the results contradicted this this phenomenon in run 1 could be explained by some mnob species surviving in the presence of biomass by using baps derived from cell lysis conversely recent studies reported that low level nutrition conditions induced the emergence of mn ii oxidizing activity liang et al 2016 and such a stress could trigger mn ii oxidizing gene expression liang et al 2017 however in the present study no distinct increase in mn ii removal was observed after the methane supply was stopped interestingly methane oxidation immediately recovered once methane supply started again in phase 3 days 201 631 and phase 5 days 632 950 fig 1c and the mn ii removal rate increased fig 1b many mob form a cyst under stressed conditions whittenbury and wilkinson 1970 which would be conductive to the rapid methane oxidation recovery however the mn ii removal rate increased very slowly and continued to increase for almost 1 year eventually reaching 0 25 and 0 35 kg m 3 d 1 at the end of phases 3 and 5 respectively the methane concentration was increased to increase mn ii oxidation in the middle of phase 3 however the expected sharp increase in the methane oxidation rate was not observed so the mn ii removal rate did not sharply increase either fig 1c as shown in fig 2 although the mn ii removal rate tended to increase as the methane oxidation rate increased there was no direct relationship between the mn ii removal rate and the methane oxidation rate because mn ii removal occurred even when no methane oxidation occurred these results suggest that the mn ii removal rate increased only slowly because mnob grew slowly using uaps and or baps 3 3 recovery of ni ii and co ii using biomnox the removal of minor metals along with the formation of biomnox was investigated by adding ni ii and co ii each at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 to the influent in phase 6 of run 1 days 951 1000 fig 3 both ni ii and co ii started to be removed soon after they had been added and the estimated molar ni ii and co ii to mn ii removal ratios were 40 and 45 respectively these high removal ratios were assumed to have been caused by ni ii and co ii being adsorbed effectively by the biomnox that had already formed in the reactor the removal efficiencies were expected to reach a plateau if ni ii and co ii continued to be added the ni ii removal ratio gradually decreased but the co ii removal ratio increased and the ni ii and co ii removal ratios eventually reached 19 and 53 respectively after phase 6 had run for about 50 d these ratios were comparable to those that have been found in other studies 9 and 45 for ni ii and co ii respectively in a study by cao et al 2015 for example kay et al 2001 and tani et al 2004 found that ni ii was adsorbed less effectively than co ii by biomnox these results suggest that biomnox formed by mnob coupled with methane oxidization offers only slightly better performance than biomnox formed through other methods bacteria have strong metal biosorption capacity the ni ii and co ii removal rates observed in the present study would contain the effect of biosorption however the contribution of biosorption on biomass must be small when the biomnox production rate is very high for example geobacillus thermoleovorans was reported to have a maximum ni ii biosorption ratio of 42 mg g 1 dry bacteria özdemir et al 2009 in contrast a removal rate of 0 12 kg ni ii m 3 d 1 was observed at around 0 17 kg ch4 m 3 d 1 of the methane removal rate in our experiment this volumetric ni ii removal rate can be converted to a removal rate per produced biomass of 1000 mg ni ii g 1 dry bacteria which consisted of the biosorption on bacteria and the adsorption on biomnox by using a growth yield of 0 70 g dry bacteria g 1 ch4 calculated based on the methane oxidation formula of equation 3 mentioned later assuming that the ni ii biosorption ratio of biomass in the reactor is the same as that of geobacillus thermoleovorans the contribution of biosorption to biomass was estimated to be only 4 2 42 1000 in addition we confirmed that there was no adsorption of ni ii and co ii on the sponge our experiments indicated that minor metals can be continually removed and recovered from wastewater by biomnox formed by mnob coupled with methane oxidization 3 4 mn oxidation through biological reactions no methane was supplied in phase 1 of run 2 days 0 243 to determine whether biological mn ii oxidation could occur under autotrophic conditions or through chemical reactions no mn ii oxidation was observed even after a very long time to allow for the possibility that slow reactions occurred fig 1g and h the effluent was approximately ph 7 5 indicating that chemical oxidation did not occur because a high oxidation reduction potential of 600 mv is required at 25 c takeno 2005 in contrast mn ii was clearly removed within 1 month of methane being supplied in phase 2 days 244 389 during which the methane loading rate was approximately 0 17 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1g and h these results indicate that autotrophic mnob were not present 3 5 influence of the oxygen concentration oxygen is essential to the oxidation of methane and mn ii and mob should compete with mn ii oxidation to consume oxygen we predicted that the oxygen concentration would directly influence methane and mn ii oxidation therefore in phase 3 of run 2 days 390 561 instead of supplying air containing 20 oxygen the reactor was operated at different oxygen concentrations specifically 50 days 391 481 10 days 482 538 and 5 days 539 558 in phase 4 days 803 839 air was again supplied stoichiometric formulae were used to estimate the amount of oxygen consumed in the reactor experimental stoichiometric formulae have been reported for two methane oxidation pathways the ribulose monophosphate pathway for mob type i and the serine pathway for mob type ii karthikeyan et al 2015 the stoichiometric formulae for the ribulose monophosphate pathway and serine pathway are shown below in equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 ch4 1 50 o2 0 118 nh 4 0 118 c4h8o2n 0 529 co2 1 71 h2o 0 118 h 2 ch4 1 57 o2 0 102 nh 4 0 102 c4h8o2n 0 593 co2 1 75 h2o 0 102 h the formula shown below which was derived using the mean stoichiometric coefficients for equations 1 and 2 was used to calculate the amount of oxygen consumed because both mob type i and mob type ii were detected table 2 3 ch4 1 535 o2 0 110 nh 4 0 110 c4h8o2n 0 561 co2 1 73 h2o 0 110 h the amount of oxygen consumed through mn ii oxidation was calculated using the reaction shown below de vrind et al 1986 4 mn2 0 5 o2 h2o mno2 2 h the oxygen provided would mainly have been consumed through the biological oxidation of both methane and mn ii because the total oxygen consumption calculated using the formulae shown above was roughly balanced fig 4 in particular we found that most of the oxygen was used for methane oxidation and sufficient methane oxidation occurred even at a low oxygen concentration 5 in contrast a small percentage of the oxygen was used for mn ii oxidation mn ii oxidation stopped completely at low oxygen concentration 5 even though oxygen was still present at a concentration of 1 6 in the reactor figs 1f and g and 4 we also found that increasing the oxygen concentration to 50 did not increase the amount of mn ii oxidation that occurred these results suggest that the oxygen concentration needs to remain higher than approximately 10 for steady mn ii oxidation to be maintained 3 6 mn ii oxidation activity and the influence of the mn ii concentration the maximum mn ii removal activity of the dhs reactor was determined by operating the reactor over a wide range of mn ii loading rates during phase 5 of run 1 days 632 950 and phase 4 of run 2 days 561 1000 by changing only the mn ii concentration in the influent the relationship between the mn ii loading rate and the removal rate was plotted fig 5 the straight line shown in fig 5 had a gradient close to 1 up to a mn ii loading rate of approximately 0 45 kg m 3 d 1 indicating that almost 100 of the mn ii in the influent was removed the mn ii removal efficiency decreased as the mn ii loading rate increased above that concentration but the removal activity increased finally reaching a removal rate of approximately 0 49 kg m 3 d 1 when the mn ii concentration remaining in the effluent was 7 1 mg l 1 however the removal activity decreased greatly when the mn ii loading rate became too strong at high mn ii loading rates the mn ii concentrations in the effluent were high 29 9 44 2 mg l 1 the decrease in mn ii removal activity suggests that mn ii at a high concentration may inhibit mn ii oxidation shortly after the addition of ni ii and co ii in phase 6 of run 1 the mn ii concentration of the effluent increased fig 1a this increase was likely caused by desorption of mn ii derived from the difference in metal adsorption affinity for biomnox fuller and harvey 2000 once the mn ii concentration was increased in the reactor the mn ii oxidizing activity should have been depressed because of the inhibition caused by the high concentration as mentioned above as a result a gradual decrease in mn ii removal rate was observed in phase 6 3 7 bacterial community analysis the results of the microbial community analyses of the six biomass samples collected when the methane oxidation rates were almost stable at 7 4 11 6 mol ch4 l 1 d 1 are shown in table 2 mob were detected in all of the samples methylocystaceae mob type ii and methylococcaceae type i were observed the most enriched mob were methylosinus type ii type i mob became dominant in both run 1 and run 2 after day 890 methylotrophs methanol oxidizing bacteria are commonly found in methane oxidation samples osaka et al 2008 ho et al 2016 beck et al 2013 oshkin et al 2015 methanol which is the first metabolic intermediate produced by mob is excreted as a uap hakemian and rosenzweig 2007 sirajuddin and rosenzweig 2015 after which methylotrophs can grow using the methanol he et al 2012 we detected methylotrophs belonging to the methylophilaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae families methylophilaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae use the ribulose monophosphate and serine pathways respectively surprisingly when reviewing the methylotroph strains we found that some mnob were affiliated with the hyphomicrobiaceae family hyphomicrobium t37 strain tyler and marshall 1967 pedomicrobium manganicum gebers 1981 and pedomicrobium sp larsen et al 1999 can oxidize mn ii bacteria belonging to the hyphomicrobiaceae family contributed high percentages of the bacteria found in all of the samples on day 713 of run 2 when the mn ii removal rate was relatively high 0 34 kg m 3 d 1 the hyphomicrobiaceae contributed 19 5 of the total bacterial count these results suggest that the methylotrophs we detected which would have been mnob and grown on uaps produced by mob played important roles in the removal of mn ii and the production of mno2 pseudomonas and bacillus have been thoroughly investigated as model mnob in the present study we found pseudomonas but no bacillus some pseudomonas can use methanol as a substrate peel and quayle 1961 anthony and zatman 1964 suggesting that the pseudomonas we detected grew preferentially on both uaps and baps and played roles in the oxidation of mn ii large amounts of bacteria affiliated with pedobacter and chitinophaga were found in run 1 and large amounts of bacteria affiliated with soehngenia were found in run 2 these bacteria would not have contributed to the oxidation of mn ii interestingly large differences were not found between the microbial communities in the biomass samples collected when mn ii oxidation occurred and did not occur and mn ii was not supplied for 70 d on day 632 in run 2 3 8 inhibition of mob activity by mno2 the mn ii oxidation activity did not increase markedly when the methane loading rate was increased because the methane consumption rate did not increase as expected reaching a maximum of only 0 24 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1c and h hatamoto et al 2010 found that a dhs reactor has a high methane oxidation potential of 2 2 kg cod m 3 d 1 corresponding to 0 55 kg ch4 m 3 d 1 which is approximately two times higher than we found in our system i e coupled with mn ii oxidation once mn ii oxidation had been established much of the biomnox was found on the sponge carriers meaning the mob were in contact with the biomnox we assumed that manganese oxides inhibit mob activity which explains why we observed low methane oxidation rates to confirm this we conducted seven batch tests using mob enriched sludge containing different amounts of mno2 the methane oxidation activity of the sludge estimated from the batch test results decreased as the mno2 concentration increased fig 6 the activities at high mno2 concentrations 50 g l 1 decreased to approximately half the activity when no mno2 was present the biomnox concentrations in the sponge measured at the end of operation reached 86 5 g l 1 run1 and 52 2 g l 1 run2 which were comparable to concentrations in the batch tests this clearly suggested that the mob activity in the dhs reactor would have been suppressed by the biomnox that was produced although the intensity of inhibition would have been different at the biofilm and in the suspended mob in addition a portion approximately 1 5 but not all of the produced biomnox precipitated in the bottom of the dhs in each run 4 discussion the results of continuous mn ii treatment and batch experiments indicated that both biomnox and abiotic mno2 inhibited mob activity this inhibition caused the methane removal rate to reach a lower plateau and the mn ii removal rate to reach a maximum of 0 49 kg l 1 d 1 although mnob were successfully enriched along with mob enrichment such inhibition by mno2 has not previously been reported for mob or any other bacteria however metal oxides such as zno cuo and tio2 have been found to inhibit the growth of microbes stankic et al 2016 it is thought that these metal oxides generate reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative stress in cells resulting in membrane damage beyth et al 2015 however it is difficult to determine whether this mechanism explains inhibition by mno2 the inhibitory mechanism is unclear and will need to be determined to improve the mn ii oxidation performance microorganisms must have different tolerances for mno2 the dominant mob changed dramatically when each reactor was operated for a very long time methylocaldum and methylosarcina genera dominated the biomass on day 890 when a lot of biomnox was formed on the sponge carriers but neither genera were detected before day 890 these findings suggest that mob affiliated with these genera may have higher tolerances for mno2 than the other mob that were detected in contrast methylobacter which were not found in any of the biomass samples may tolerate mno2 poorly hatamoto et al 2010 found that this genus was dominant in mob in the upper part of a similar dhs reactor used to biologically remove only dissolved methane it can be expected that mnob will have tolerances for biomnox that they produce pedomicrobium and hyphomicrobium which are known to oxidize mn ii were detected at high population densities in every biomass sample in contrast the methylotenera also obligate methylotrophs but not mnob populations were very small hatamoto et al 2010 found that non mnob methylophilus were enriched in a methane removal reactor the discrepancy in the methylotroph population we found would have been caused by the toxicity of the mno2 present indicating that all bacteria that grew in the mn ii oxidizing reactors were very tolerant of mno2 the relatively high populations of unclassified bacteria belonging to the bradyrhizobiaceae family may also have been mnob that could use methanol it is well known that heavy metal ions are toxic to microbes lemire et al 2013 hobman and crossman 2015 the toxic effects that occur depend on the metal ion concentrations in our study oxidation activity was inhibited by mn ii even at relatively low mn ii concentrations of around 30 mg l 1 mnob activity was inhibited in the presence of mn ii even though mn ii ions were used to produce biomnox this inhibition of mn ii oxidation has been described in a few previous publications adams and ghiorse 1985 jung and schweisfurth 1979 these results suggest that mnob might oxidize mn ii to eliminate its toxicity in contrast the mob we detected tolerated mn ii no previous reports of the effects of mn ii on mob have been published one advantage of the oxidation of mn ii by mnob in addition to mitigating the toxicity of mn ii is the production of energy thermodynamically some energy is produced through the oxidation of mn ii to mn oxides it has been reported that mnob might grow using this oxidation energy kepkay and nealson 1987 ehrlich and salerno 1990 however no evidence for autotrophic growth of mnob has previously been published brouwers et al 2000 we attempted to culture mnob under autotrophic conditions run 2 phase 1 for 243 d but we failed to confirm that they had been cultivated the characteristics of mnob that can grow using only mn ii are still unknown the other advantage of oxidizing mn ii is that the biomnox produced play roles in encouraging the use of substrates mn oxides can degrade a wide range of complex organic compounds including humic substances stone 1987 tebo et al 2004 non biodegradable substances are broken down into degradable ones by mn oxides sunda and kieber 1994 in our study the enrichment of mnob and mn ii oxidation were found even when no methane was present therefore baps which are persistent were probably used as substrates fig 2 a simplified microbial community and substrate flow model was drawn for the methane and mn ii oxidation coupled system based on our results fig 7 methanol oxidizing bacteria of the hyphomicrobium genus that can oxidize mn ii dominated the reactor these bacteria used the methanol uap derived from mob metabolism and would have played important roles in the oxidation of mn ii suggesting that the performance could be improved if methanol rather than methane was supplied directly other ways of enriching mnob are proposed next mn ii oxidation should be caused by mnob which can only be grown on activated or dead sludge in the reactor installing sponge carriers containing large amounts of abiotic mno2 before starting a run should allow mnob enrichment to occur by providing the substrate preferred by mnob such as a k medium this is predicted because mno2 inhibits the growth of mob and this inhibition may apply to microbes other than mnob we previously found that cultivating mnob is impossible on k medium because they are outcompeted by other bacteria cao et al 2015 5 conclusions we developed a new technique for producing biomnox to remove minor metals from wastewater mnob enrichment was achieved by coupling the system with methane oxidation in a dhs reactor mnob can grow using uaps and or baps derived from mob metabolism as substrates the maximum mn ii removal rate was 0 49 kg m 3 d 1 because the uap and bap production rates were limited by mob activity being inhibited by the biomnox that was formed the system simultaneously removed co ii and ni ii as mn ii oxidation occurred and we identified the key putative mnob acknowledgments this research was

19812,biogenic manganese oxide biomnox can efficiently adsorb various minor metals the production of biomnox in reactors to remove metals during wastewater treatment processes is a promising biotechnological method however it is difficult to preferentially enrich manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob to produce biomnox during wastewater treatment processes a unique method of cultivating mnob using methane oxidizing bacteria mob to produce soluble microbial products is proposed here mnob were successfully enriched in a methane fed reactor containing mob biomnox production during the wastewater treatment process was confirmed long term continual operation of the reactor allowed simultaneous removal of mn ii co ii and ni ii the co ii mn ii and ni ii mn ii removal ratios were 53 and 19 respectively the degree to which mn ii was removed indicated that the enriched mnob used utilization associated products and or biomass associated products microbial community analysis revealed that methanol oxidizing bacteria belonging to the hyphomicrobiaceae family played important roles in the oxidation of mn ii by using utilization associated products methane oxidizing bacteria were found to be inhibited by mno2 but the maximum mn ii removal rate was 0 49 kg m 3 d 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological manganese oxidation downflow hanging sponge dhs reactor methane

metal industry and are used in modern products such as rechargeable batteries semiconductors photovoltaic cells and structural materials products containing minor metals eventually become waste and such waste is produced in large amounts in urban areas industrial wastewater is usually discharged without minor metals being recovered because the amounts of minor metals being produced are increasing it is necessary to recycle them to move toward a sustainable system widmer et al 2005 chatterjee 2012 gaines 2014 biotechnology using microorganisms has been used to recover metals from wastewater biomineralization the production of minerals by organisms is one such technique manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob can produce manganese oxide mnox by oxidizing soluble mn ii tebo et al 2004 2005 spiro et al 2010 the biologically produced mnox biomnox produced by mnob has a large surface area to mass ratio nelson et al 1999 villalobos et al 2003 and can adsorb a wide range of minor metal ions more effectively than abiotic mno2 toner et al 2006 villalobos et al 2005 webb et al 2006 wang et al 2009 making biomnox an attractive material for removing metals from aqueous systems abiotic mn ii oxidation is thermodynamically favored at higher ph morgan 2005 but biological oxidation occurs even around neutral ph values bargar et al 2000 therefore the use of biomnox to recover minor metals during wastewater treatment processes is promising miyata et al 2007 cao et al 2015 in previous studies mnob have been found in a wide variety of environmental systems including rivers and seas tipping 1984 tebo and emerson 1985 stein et al 2001 zhou et al 2016 polluted water bodies and soils in mining areas marble et al 1998 akob et al 2014 water supply facilities vandenabeele et al 1992 nitzsche et al 2015 and even extreme environments such as hydrothermal vent plumes cowen et al 1986 mandernack and tebo 1993 as a result mnob are phylogenetically diverse but are all heterotrophic aerobic bacteria that grow on organic substances chemolithoautotrophic mnob that can use the energy released through mn ii oxidation to grow have not previously been described however cao et al 2015 reported that mnob enrichment in a reactor containing other microorganisms failed at a high substrate concentration because mnob cannot compete with other heterotrophic bacteria to use the available substrates we have focused on low organic substrate concentrations to enrich mnob in wastewater treatment systems because mnob have been detected in oligotrophic environments such as wells and water distribution systems ghiorse 1984 we developed a unique method of enriching mnob by continually supplying organic substrates derived from nitrifier metabolism at low concentrations heterotrophic bacteria have always been found to coexist with nitrifiers in autotrophic nitrifying biofilms used in wastewater treatment systems kindaichi et al 2004 okabe et al 2005 matsumoto et al 2010 nitrifiers excrete organic substances as soluble microbial products smps which are produced in only small quantities but act as heterotrophic substrates we succeeded using this cross feeding technique in enriching mnob using nitrifiers and biological mn ii oxidation using a downflow hanging sponge dhs reactor providing only ammonium as a substrate cao et al 2015 in the present study we focused on mnob coupled with methane oxidizing bacteria mob we selected this method because application of methane as a substrate is more controllable than use of ammonium containing wastewaters in which the ammonium concentration usually fluctuates we expected that a higher biomnox production rate would be achieved using this system than employing a system using nitrifiers because the decrease in ph caused by nitrification decreases the mn ii oxidation activity but will not occur when mob are used we found that mnob grew on smps but it was unclear whether smps were always able to cause mnob enrichment because they have different compositions when different microbes are present soluble microbial products are usually classified as two distinct groups utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps barker and stuckey 1999 uaps are produced in proportion to the amount of substrate used laspidou and rittmann 2002a 2002b whereas baps are derived from the decay of biomass and are hydrophilic organic colloids and macromolecules polysaccharides proteins and or amino sugar like compounds jarusutthirak and amy 2006 natural polymers with high molecular weights secreted by microorganisms also known as extracellular polymeric substances are types of smps but have generally not been described as uaps or baps the biodegradable properties of uaps and baps are quite different jiang et al 2008 and it is unclear whether uaps or baps contribute to the enrichment of mnob in the presence of other microbes kato et al 2017 reported that biotic mn ii oxidation coupled with methane oxidation was successful under marine conditions although the oxidation rate was very low while no biomnox was observed in a system coupled with nitrification it is unclear whether biomnox production in the methane oxidation system occurs under freshwater conditions here we report that mnob enrichment is possible in a methane oxidation reactor containing mob under freshwater conditions we assessed how uaps and baps produced through mob metabolism affected mnob growth in addition the effects of the oxygen and mn ii concentrations on mn ii oxidation were investigated and putative mnob that were enriched in the reactor were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up two identical closed dhs reactors each a 1 0 l column 85 cm high and 4 cm in diameter were used for mnob enrichment mnob were enriched in the presence of mob to produce biomnox in both columns fig s1 each column contained a string of 20 polyurethane sponge cubes each 2 cm 2 cm 2 cm giving a total sponge volume of 160 cm3 connected to each other diagonally in series hanging within the gas phase air containing methane the substrate was fed into the top of each reactor using a pump the air flowed downward through the column and was emitted from the bottom of the column a mineral solution containing mn ii was supplied to the reactor and discharged from the bottom both reactors were kept in a temperature controlled room at 25 c but operated under different conditions runs 1 and 2 before a run was started the sponges were soaked in diluted activated sludge obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant to inoculate the biomass 2 2 operating conditions the operating conditions were changed over time to determine the effects of different methane mn ii and oxygen concentrations on mn oxidation the test conditions are shown in table 1 runs 1 and 2 had six and four phases respectively the influent mn ii methane and oxygen concentrations were 0 50 mg l 1 0 4 and 5 50 respectively the gas retention time based on the reactor volume was 1 4 h and the hydraulic retention time based on the sponge volume was 2 18 h the effluent water recirculation ratio was nine from day 65 to the end of the experiment day 1000 in both runs 2 3 substrate and artificial wastewater the substrate gas was prepared by adding specific concentrations of methane and or oxygen to air the artificial wastewater contained mn ii mncl2 4h2o and nano3 30 4 mg l 1 nahco3 100 mg l 1 na2hpo4 12h2o 11 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 5 mg l 1 feso4 7h2o 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 5h2o 0 025 mg

cocl2 6h2o 10 mg l 1 were added to the wastewater 2 4 analytical methods samples of the gas and wastewater influent and effluent were collected twice each week each water sample was passed through a ptfe membrane with 0 2 μm pores and the mn ii ni ii and co ii concentrations were determined by the periodate oxidation method using a hach water quality analyzer dr 2800 hach loveland co usa the gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography using a sgc 8apt instrument shimadzu kyoto japan the particles produced in the reactors were analyzed using leucoberbeline blue i sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to determine if they were mn oxides krumbein and altmann 1973 2 5 microbial community analysis biomass samples were collected by squeezing the upper middle and lower portions of the sponge carriers in the reactor used for run 1 on days 406 555 and 890 and the reactor used for run 2 on days 632 713 and 890 the biomass collected was washed with phosphate buffer dna was extracted using a fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna extracted from each of the three biomass samples from a run was diluted to the same final concentration after which the three samples were mixed polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16s rrna gene was performed using the primer sets 27f 5ʹ agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3ʹ and 519r 5ʹ agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3ʹ with a one shot la pcr mix takara bio otsu japan the polymerase chain reaction conditions were 5 min initial denaturation at 94 c followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 58 c and 60 s at 72 c and then final extension at 72 c for 5 min the polymerase chain reaction products were purified and sequenced using the emulsion method using a roche 454 pe genome sequencer flx 454 life sciences branford ct usa at hokkaido system science sapporo japan the sequences obtained were analyzed using qiime virtual box version 1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 operational taxonomic units were grouped based on the 97 identity of dna using the uclust method edgar 2010 and these operational taxonomic units were classified using the greengenes database mcdonald et al 2012 werner et al 2012 2 6 effect of mn oxides on mob activity as mentioned in the results section the methane removal performance was poor we suspected that biomnox produced in the reactor may have inhibited mob activity therefore a mob activity test was performed to determine if mno2 suppresses mob a mob specimen was prepared by cultivating activated sludge the same as used to inoculate the dhss in an atmosphere containing 4 methane for 1 week in a vial containing minerals a 40 ml aliquot of mob enriched biomass was added to each of a series of 122 ml vials containing an atmosphere containing methane and mno2 supplied by kishida chemical osaka japan at seven concentrations between 0 and 250 g l 1 the mob activity was measured by determining how much the methane concentration in the headspace decreased from the initial concentration of 4 over 8 h at 25 c 3 results 3 1 mn ii oxidation coupled with methane oxidation the dhs reactor used for run 1 was aerobic and methane was the only source of carbon the operating time was very long 1000 d after a long time mnob enrichment and mn ii oxidation coupled with methane oxidation were found suggesting that smps excreted by the mob could serve as the sole sources of energy for mnob growth during the early part of phase 1 days 0 154 mn ii was not removed even though the methane provided was almost completely consumed fig 1 a and b we concluded that no mn ii was removed possibly because of a smp deficiency so the methane loading rate based on the sponge volume was increased to 0 21 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1c to increase smp production as expected mn ii started to be removed and the mn ii removal rate steadily increased as the methane removal rate increased around day 90 reaching 0 06 kg m 3 d 1 on day 154 fig 1b fine black particles formed on the sponges which turned from light brown to black particles were found at the bottom of the dhs reactor fig s2 the black particles were confirmed to be biomnox using the leucoberbeline blue i method indicating that the mn ii removed had been oxidized by the mnob that had been cultivated 3 2 effect of methane oxidation activity on mn ii oxidation the growth of mnob on the smps produced by mob suggested that mn ii oxidation would stop when no methane was provided conversely the mn ii oxidation activity would increase if the methane loading rate was increased to test these predictions four different operating conditions were used in phases 2 to 5 of run 1 days 155 950 no methane was supplied in phase 2 days 155 200 and phase 4 days 562 631 surprisingly mn ii was removed for a long time almost 1 month even in phase 2 no methane supplied and the mn ii removal rate was 0 06 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1a and b the removal rate gradually decreased after that time a similar phenomenon was found in phase 4 during which the mn ii removal rate remained at 0 25 kg m 3 d 1 for 3 weeks then gradually decreased for 2 months it was expected that mn ii would no longer be removed as soon as methane stopped being supplied because mnob cannot use smps as substrates but the results contradicted this this phenomenon in run 1 could be explained by some mnob species surviving in the presence of biomass by using baps derived from cell lysis conversely recent studies reported that low level nutrition conditions induced the emergence of mn ii oxidizing activity liang et al 2016 and such a stress could trigger mn ii oxidizing gene expression liang et al 2017 however in the present study no distinct increase in mn ii removal was observed after the methane supply was stopped interestingly methane oxidation immediately recovered once methane supply started again in phase 3 days 201 631 and phase 5 days 632 950 fig 1c and the mn ii removal rate increased fig 1b many mob form a cyst under stressed conditions whittenbury and wilkinson 1970 which would be conductive to the rapid methane oxidation recovery however the mn ii removal rate increased very slowly and continued to increase for almost 1 year eventually reaching 0 25 and 0 35 kg m 3 d 1 at the end of phases 3 and 5 respectively the methane concentration was increased to increase mn ii oxidation in the middle of phase 3 however the expected sharp increase in the methane oxidation rate was not observed so the mn ii removal rate did not sharply increase either fig 1c as shown in fig 2 although the mn ii removal rate tended to increase as the methane oxidation rate increased there was no direct relationship between the mn ii removal rate and the methane oxidation rate because mn ii removal occurred even when no methane oxidation occurred these results suggest that the mn ii removal rate increased only slowly because mnob grew slowly using uaps and or baps 3 3 recovery of ni ii and co ii using biomnox the removal of minor metals along with the formation of biomnox was investigated by adding ni ii and co ii each at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 to the influent in phase 6 of run 1 days 951 1000 fig 3 both ni ii and co ii started to be removed soon after they had been added and the estimated molar ni ii and co ii to mn ii removal ratios were 40 and 45 respectively these high removal ratios were assumed to have been caused by ni ii and co ii being adsorbed effectively by the biomnox that had already formed in the reactor the removal efficiencies were expected to reach a plateau if ni ii and co ii continued to be added the ni ii removal ratio gradually decreased but the co ii removal ratio increased and the ni ii and co ii removal ratios eventually reached 19 and 53 respectively after phase 6 had run for about 50 d these ratios were comparable to those that have been found in other studies 9 and 45 for ni ii and co ii respectively in a study by cao et al 2015 for example kay et al 2001 and tani et al 2004 found that ni ii was adsorbed less effectively than co ii by biomnox these results suggest that biomnox formed by mnob coupled with methane oxidization offers only slightly better performance than biomnox formed through other methods bacteria have strong metal biosorption capacity the ni ii and co ii removal rates observed in the present study would contain the effect of biosorption however the contribution of biosorption on biomass must be small when the biomnox production rate is very high for example geobacillus thermoleovorans was reported to have a maximum ni ii biosorption ratio of 42 mg g 1 dry bacteria özdemir et al 2009 in contrast a removal rate of 0 12 kg ni ii m 3 d 1 was observed at around 0 17 kg ch4 m 3 d 1 of the methane removal rate in our experiment this volumetric ni ii removal rate can be converted to a removal rate per produced biomass of 1000 mg ni ii g 1 dry bacteria which consisted of the biosorption on bacteria and the adsorption on biomnox by using a growth yield of 0 70 g dry bacteria g 1 ch4 calculated based on the methane oxidation formula of equation 3 mentioned later assuming that the ni ii biosorption ratio of biomass in the reactor is the same as that of geobacillus thermoleovorans the contribution of biosorption to biomass was estimated to be only 4 2 42 1000 in addition we confirmed that there was no adsorption of ni ii and co ii on the sponge our experiments indicated that minor metals can be continually removed and recovered from wastewater by biomnox formed by mnob coupled with methane oxidization 3 4 mn oxidation through biological reactions no methane was supplied in phase 1 of run 2 days 0 243 to determine whether biological mn ii oxidation could occur under autotrophic conditions or through chemical reactions no mn ii oxidation was observed even after a very long time to allow for the possibility that slow reactions occurred fig 1g and h the effluent was approximately ph 7 5 indicating that chemical oxidation did not occur because a high oxidation reduction potential of 600 mv is required at 25 c takeno 2005 in contrast mn ii was clearly removed within 1 month of methane being supplied in phase 2 days 244 389 during which the methane loading rate was approximately 0 17 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1g and h these results indicate that autotrophic mnob were not present 3 5 influence of the oxygen concentration oxygen is essential to the oxidation of methane and mn ii and mob should compete with mn ii oxidation to consume oxygen we predicted that the oxygen concentration would directly influence methane and mn ii oxidation therefore in phase 3 of run 2 days 390 561 instead of supplying air containing 20 oxygen the reactor was operated at different oxygen concentrations specifically 50 days 391 481 10 days 482 538 and 5 days 539 558 in phase 4 days 803 839 air was again supplied stoichiometric formulae were used to estimate the amount of oxygen consumed in the reactor experimental stoichiometric formulae have been reported for two methane oxidation pathways the ribulose monophosphate pathway for mob type i and the serine pathway for mob type ii karthikeyan et al 2015 the stoichiometric formulae for the ribulose monophosphate pathway and serine pathway are shown below in equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 ch4 1 50 o2 0 118 nh 4 0 118 c4h8o2n 0 529 co2 1 71 h2o 0 118 h 2 ch4 1 57 o2 0 102 nh 4 0 102 c4h8o2n 0 593 co2 1 75 h2o 0 102 h the formula shown below which was derived using the mean stoichiometric coefficients for equations 1 and 2 was used to calculate the amount of oxygen consumed because both mob type i and mob type ii were detected table 2 3 ch4 1 535 o2 0 110 nh 4 0 110 c4h8o2n 0 561 co2 1 73 h2o 0 110 h the amount of oxygen consumed through mn ii oxidation was calculated using the reaction shown below de vrind et al 1986 4 mn2 0 5 o2 h2o mno2 2 h the oxygen provided would mainly have been consumed through the biological oxidation of both methane and mn ii because the total oxygen consumption calculated using the formulae shown above was roughly balanced fig 4 in particular we found that most of the oxygen was used for methane oxidation and sufficient methane oxidation occurred even at a low oxygen concentration 5 in contrast a small percentage of the oxygen was used for mn ii oxidation mn ii oxidation stopped completely at low oxygen concentration 5 even though oxygen was still present at a concentration of 1 6 in the reactor figs 1f and g and 4 we also found that increasing the oxygen concentration to 50 did not increase the amount of mn ii oxidation that occurred these results suggest that the oxygen concentration needs to remain higher than approximately 10 for steady mn ii oxidation to be maintained 3 6 mn ii oxidation activity and the influence of the mn ii concentration the maximum mn ii removal activity of the dhs reactor was determined by operating the reactor over a wide range of mn ii loading rates during phase 5 of run 1 days 632 950 and phase 4 of run 2 days 561 1000 by changing only the mn ii concentration in the influent the relationship between the mn ii loading rate and the removal rate was plotted fig 5 the straight line shown in fig 5 had a gradient close to 1 up to a mn ii loading rate of approximately 0 45 kg m 3 d 1 indicating that almost 100 of the mn ii in the influent was removed the mn ii removal efficiency decreased as the mn ii loading rate increased above that concentration but the removal activity increased finally reaching a removal rate of approximately 0 49 kg m 3 d 1 when the mn ii concentration remaining in the effluent was 7 1 mg l 1 however the removal activity decreased greatly when the mn ii loading rate became too strong at high mn ii loading rates the mn ii concentrations in the effluent were high 29 9 44 2 mg l 1 the decrease in mn ii removal activity suggests that mn ii at a high concentration may inhibit mn ii oxidation shortly after the addition of ni ii and co ii in phase 6 of run 1 the mn ii concentration of the effluent increased fig 1a this increase was likely caused by desorption of mn ii derived from the difference in metal adsorption affinity for biomnox fuller and harvey 2000 once the mn ii concentration was increased in the reactor the mn ii oxidizing activity should have been depressed because of the inhibition caused by the high concentration as mentioned above as a result a gradual decrease in mn ii removal rate was observed in phase 6 3 7 bacterial community analysis the results of the microbial community analyses of the six biomass samples collected when the methane oxidation rates were almost stable at 7 4 11 6 mol ch4 l 1 d 1 are shown in table 2 mob were detected in all of the samples methylocystaceae mob type ii and methylococcaceae type i were observed the most enriched mob were methylosinus type ii type i mob became dominant in both run 1 and run 2 after day 890 methylotrophs methanol oxidizing bacteria are commonly found in methane oxidation samples osaka et al 2008 ho et al 2016 beck et al 2013 oshkin et al 2015 methanol which is the first metabolic intermediate produced by mob is excreted as a uap hakemian and rosenzweig 2007 sirajuddin and rosenzweig 2015 after which methylotrophs can grow using the methanol he et al 2012 we detected methylotrophs belonging to the methylophilaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae families methylophilaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae use the ribulose monophosphate and serine pathways respectively surprisingly when reviewing the methylotroph strains we found that some mnob were affiliated with the hyphomicrobiaceae family hyphomicrobium t37 strain tyler and marshall 1967 pedomicrobium manganicum gebers 1981 and pedomicrobium sp larsen et al 1999 can oxidize mn ii bacteria belonging to the hyphomicrobiaceae family contributed high percentages of the bacteria found in all of the samples on day 713 of run 2 when the mn ii removal rate was relatively high 0 34 kg m 3 d 1 the hyphomicrobiaceae contributed 19 5 of the total bacterial count these results suggest that the methylotrophs we detected which would have been mnob and grown on uaps produced by mob played important roles in the removal of mn ii and the production of mno2 pseudomonas and bacillus have been thoroughly investigated as model mnob in the present study we found pseudomonas but no bacillus some pseudomonas can use methanol as a substrate peel and quayle 1961 anthony and zatman 1964 suggesting that the pseudomonas we detected grew preferentially on both uaps and baps and played roles in the oxidation of mn ii large amounts of bacteria affiliated with pedobacter and chitinophaga were found in run 1 and large amounts of bacteria affiliated with soehngenia were found in run 2 these bacteria would not have contributed to the oxidation of mn ii interestingly large differences were not found between the microbial communities in the biomass samples collected when mn ii oxidation occurred and did not occur and mn ii was not supplied for 70 d on day 632 in run 2 3 8 inhibition of mob activity by mno2 the mn ii oxidation activity did not increase markedly when the methane loading rate was increased because the methane consumption rate did not increase as expected reaching a maximum of only 0 24 kg m 3 d 1 fig 1c and h hatamoto et al 2010 found that a dhs reactor has a high methane oxidation potential of 2 2 kg cod m 3 d 1 corresponding to 0 55 kg ch4 m 3 d 1 which is approximately two times higher than we found in our system i e coupled with mn ii oxidation once mn ii oxidation had been established much of the biomnox was found on the sponge carriers meaning the mob were in contact with the biomnox we assumed that manganese oxides inhibit mob activity which explains why we observed low methane oxidation rates to confirm this we conducted seven batch tests using mob enriched sludge containing different amounts of mno2 the methane oxidation activity of the sludge estimated from the batch test results decreased as the mno2 concentration increased fig 6 the activities at high mno2 concentrations 50 g l 1 decreased to approximately half the activity when no mno2 was present the biomnox concentrations in the sponge measured at the end of operation reached 86 5 g l 1 run1 and 52 2 g l 1 run2 which were comparable to concentrations in the batch tests this clearly suggested that the mob activity in the dhs reactor would have been suppressed by the biomnox that was produced although the intensity of inhibition would have been different at the biofilm and in the suspended mob in addition a portion approximately 1 5 but not all of the produced biomnox precipitated in the bottom of the dhs in each run 4 discussion the results of continuous mn ii treatment and batch experiments indicated that both biomnox and abiotic mno2 inhibited mob activity this inhibition caused the methane removal rate to reach a lower plateau and the mn ii removal rate to reach a maximum of 0 49 kg l 1 d 1 although mnob were successfully enriched along with mob enrichment such inhibition by mno2 has not previously been reported for mob or any other bacteria however metal oxides such as zno cuo and tio2 have been found to inhibit the growth of microbes stankic et al 2016 it is thought that these metal oxides generate reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative stress in cells resulting in membrane damage beyth et al 2015 however it is difficult to determine whether this mechanism explains inhibition by mno2 the inhibitory mechanism is unclear and will need to be determined to improve the mn ii oxidation performance microorganisms must have different tolerances for mno2 the dominant mob changed dramatically when each reactor was operated for a very long time methylocaldum and methylosarcina genera dominated the biomass on day 890 when a lot of biomnox was formed on the sponge carriers but neither genera were detected before day 890 these findings suggest that mob affiliated with these genera may have higher tolerances for mno2 than the other mob that were detected in contrast methylobacter which were not found in any of the biomass samples may tolerate mno2 poorly hatamoto et al 2010 found that this genus was dominant in mob in the upper part of a similar dhs reactor used to biologically remove only dissolved methane it can be expected that mnob will have tolerances for biomnox that they produce pedomicrobium and hyphomicrobium which are known to oxidize mn ii were detected at high population densities in every biomass sample in contrast the methylotenera also obligate methylotrophs but not mnob populations were very small hatamoto et al 2010 found that non mnob methylophilus were enriched in a methane removal reactor the discrepancy in the methylotroph population we found would have been caused by the toxicity of the mno2 present indicating that all bacteria that grew in the mn ii oxidizing reactors were very tolerant of mno2 the relatively high populations of unclassified bacteria belonging to the bradyrhizobiaceae family may also have been mnob that could use methanol it is well known that heavy metal ions are toxic to microbes lemire et al 2013 hobman and crossman 2015 the toxic effects that occur depend on the metal ion concentrations in our study oxidation activity was inhibited by mn ii even at relatively low mn ii concentrations of around 30 mg l 1 mnob activity was inhibited in the presence of mn ii even though mn ii ions were used to produce biomnox this inhibition of mn ii oxidation has been described in a few previous publications adams and ghiorse 1985 jung and schweisfurth 1979 these results suggest that mnob might oxidize mn ii to eliminate its toxicity in contrast the mob we detected tolerated mn ii no previous reports of the effects of mn ii on mob have been published one advantage of the oxidation of mn ii by mnob in addition to mitigating the toxicity of mn ii is the production of energy thermodynamically some energy is produced through the oxidation of mn ii to mn oxides it has been reported that mnob might grow using this oxidation energy kepkay and nealson 1987 ehrlich and salerno 1990 however no evidence for autotrophic growth of mnob has previously been published brouwers et al 2000 we attempted to culture mnob under autotrophic conditions run 2 phase 1 for 243 d but we failed to confirm that they had been cultivated the characteristics of mnob that can grow using only mn ii are still unknown the other advantage of oxidizing mn ii is that the biomnox produced play roles in encouraging the use of substrates mn oxides can degrade a wide range of complex organic compounds including humic substances stone 1987 tebo et al 2004 non biodegradable substances are broken down into degradable ones by mn oxides sunda and kieber 1994 in our study the enrichment of mnob and mn ii oxidation were found even when no methane was present therefore baps which are persistent were probably used as substrates fig 2 a simplified microbial community and substrate flow model was drawn for the methane and mn ii oxidation coupled system based on our results fig 7 methanol oxidizing bacteria of the hyphomicrobium genus that can oxidize mn ii dominated the reactor these bacteria used the methanol uap derived from mob metabolism and would have played important roles in the oxidation of mn ii suggesting that the performance could be improved if methanol rather than methane was supplied directly other ways of enriching mnob are proposed next mn ii oxidation should be caused by mnob which can only be grown on activated or dead sludge in the reactor installing sponge carriers containing large amounts of abiotic mno2 before starting a run should allow mnob enrichment to occur by providing the substrate preferred by mnob such as a k medium this is predicted because mno2 inhibits the growth of mob and this inhibition may apply to microbes other than mnob we previously found that cultivating mnob is impossible on k medium because they are outcompeted by other bacteria cao et al 2015 5 conclusions we developed a new technique for producing biomnox to remove minor metals from wastewater mnob enrichment was achieved by coupling the system with methane oxidation in a dhs reactor mnob can grow using uaps and or baps derived from mob metabolism as substrates the maximum mn ii removal rate was 0 49 kg m 3 d 1 because the uap and bap production rates were limited by mob activity being inhibited by the biomnox that was formed the system simultaneously removed co ii and ni ii as mn ii oxidation occurred and we identified the key putative mnob acknowledgments this research was

19813,while the presence of iron is generally not seen as favorable for uv based treatment systems due to lamp fouling and decreased uv transmittance we show that low levels of iron can lead to improvements in the abatement of chemicals in the uv hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process the oxidation potential of an iron assisted uv h2o2 uv254 h2o2 iron process was evaluated at neutral ph using iron levels below usepa secondary drinking water standards 0 3 mg l para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as a hydroxyl radical ho probe to quantify ho steady state concentrations compounds degraded by different mechanisms including carbamazepine cbz ho oxidation and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma direct photolysis were used to investigate the effect of iron on compound degradation for uv h2o2 systems the effects of iron species fe2 and fe3 iron concentration 0 0 3 mg l h2o2 concentration 0 10 mg l and background water matrix low carbon tap lct and well water on ho production and compound removal were examined iron assisted uv h2o2 efficiency was most influenced by the target chemical and the water matrix added iron to uv h2o2 was shown to increase the steady state ho concentration by approximately 25 in all well water scenarios while cbz removal was unchanged by iron addition 0 3 mg l iron improved ndma removal rates in both lct and well water matrices by 15 1 and 4 6 respectively furthermore the combination of uv fe without h2o2 was also shown to enhance ndma removal when compared to uv photolysis alone indicating the presence of degradation pathways other than ho oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv advanced oxidation process uv aop hydroxyl radical ho photo fenton micropollutants 1 introduction uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops combine uv light with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or other radical promoters to simultaneously photolyze and oxidize through production of the highly reactive non selective hydroxyl radical ho micropollutants in water supplies swaim et al 2008 oppenländer 2003 while highly effective against many persistent pollutants the water matrix treated by uv aops can greatly impact micropollutant abatement for example carbonate species dissolved organic matter dom and nitrite ions are known to scavenge ho lowering the ho steady state concentration thereby decreasing target pollutant oxidation rosenfeldt and linden 2007 in addition light screening by the water matrix can reduce photolysis of pollutants and production of ho by reducing the photons available for absorbance by the added ho radical promoter the presence of iron in water is commonly associated with decreased uv transmittance uvt and can lead to fouling of the quartz sleeves which results in decreased uv intensity in uv reactors wait et al 2007 for these reasons uv system manufacturers recommend total iron levels less than 0 3 mg l oram 2014 in addition the environmental protection agency epa has a secondary maximum contaminant limit smcl of 0 3 mg l total iron 5 μm since the presence of iron in potable water is often perceived as unfavorable though not toxic oxidized iron can cause staining of household items and taste and odor issues although seemingly desirable to remove iron prior to uv aops iron in the presence of light and h2o2 has been shown to increase the net production of oxidizing species in uv aops utilizing h2o2 uv h2o2 potentially through fenton and photo fenton reactions under different water quality conditions tokumura et al 2011 similar to aops the primary oxidant produced and responsible for chemical transformation in the fenton reaction is generally considered to be ho equation 1 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h under acidic ph 3 conditions in the absence of complexing organic ligands soluble ferrous fe2 and ferric fe3 iron are cycled autocatalytically to produce ho equations 1 and 2 photoassisted fenton photo fenton reactions where fe3 is photoreduced to fe2 have been shown to enhance chemical removal rates compared to dark fenton reactions pignatello et al 2006 this is due to increased generation of ho directly by h2o2 photolysis equation 3 and indirectly from regenerating fe2 equation 4 when fe3 undergoes photoreduction to fe2 via ligand to metal charge transfer lmct 3 h2o2 hν 2ho φ 0 5 4 fe3 l n hν fe2 l n 1 l while commonly viewed as an economical and relatively easy treatment option for micropollutant abatement fenton and photo fenton applications have been mainly limited to non potable water treatment due to the need for acidification to prevent iron precipitation subsequent neutralization can result in iron sludge production and added costs for sludge disposal researchers have explored the use of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts to stabilize fe3 at neutral ph teel et al 2001 doumic et al 2015 sun and pignatello 1992 kim and vogelpohl 1998 gao et al 2015 however the use of a catalyst can have several disadvantages including the need to remove or regenerate the catalyst gao et al 2015 and the potential to generate toxic intermediates trovó et al 2011 the rate of fenton and photo fenton reactions decrease as the ph is increased above 3 because fe3 precipitates to amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides however even under neutral ph conditions stable iron complexes can form and participate in fenton and

efficiencies at neutral ph these photo uv254 fenton studies have commonly been evaluated for wastewater treatment applications and use iron levels that far exceed up to 50 mg l the 0 3 mg l total iron limit in the smcl by the epa and recommended by uv manufacturers additionally the h2o2 concentrations evaluated were greater than concentrations typical of conventional uv h2o2 systems 10 mg l based on some surprising results during a routine study of the uv h2o2 process for chemical abatement in groundwater we were motivated to evaluate the potential for enhanced oxidation via an iron assisted uv h2o2 process at neutral ph under the low levels of iron commonly present in well water and meeting the epa smcl the goal of this study was to better understand the effect of low levels of iron on organic compound abatement in the uv h2o2 advanced oxidation system the steady state ho production in uv h2o2 fe systems under varied fe2 and fe3 0 0 3 mg l and h2o2 0 10 mg l concentrations was examined chemical specific responses to uv h2o2 fe were evaluated using carbamazepine cbz and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as target pollutants known to exhibit varied responses to uv based treatment a steady state ho kinetic model was adapted to compare with experimental results and evaluate the influence of iron on cbz and ndma degradation 2 experimental 2 1 chemical selection para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was selected as a chemical probe to measure ho production in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 fe systems because of its low quantum yield of direct photolysis φ 0 013 mol es 1 and high and well established second order reaction rate constant with ho 5 0 109 m 1s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 ndma and cbz were selected as target compounds based on their unique photochemical and physicochemical properties shown in table 1 for instance pcba and cbz with second order ho rate constants k ho that are respectively 21 and 13 times higher than ndma degrade mainly through ho oxidation in contrast ndma with a relatively high degradation quantum yield φ 0 25 mol es 1 low k ho 3 30 108 m 1s 1 and strong molar absorptivity from 200 to 275 nm degrades mainly through photolysis sharpless and linden 2003 2 2 experimental approach the following experimental conditions were evaluated for their effect on ho generation and removal rates of cbz and ndma h2o2 concentration 5 and 10 mg l total iron concentration 0 1 and 0 3 mg l iron species fe2 and fe3 and background water matrix a quasi collimated dual beam low pressure uv device was used for sample exposure four low pressure uv lpuv lamps 15 w g15t8 philips netherlands were housed above two 4 inch apertures each equipped with a manual shutter incident uv irradiance at 254 nm was measured by a calibrated radiometer and detector international light inc model 1700 sed 240 w uv fluence was calculated by multiplying the average irradiance by the exposure time in seconds the average irradiance was determined by correcting the incident irradiance for sample depth absorbance at 254 nm surface reflectance and petri factor bolton and linden 2003 samples were taken at fluence values ranging from 0 to 1000 mj cm2 the specific order of micropollutant iron and h2o2 addition to the test water was kept consistent throughout all experiments solutions were spiked with the target chemical at a concentration equal to 100 the detection limit of the high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument resulting in starting concentrations of 0 5 mg l for ndma and pcba and 1 0 mg l for cbz iron stock solutions of 10 15 mg l fe were prepared daily both iron and h2o2 were added shortly before uv exposure to achieve the desired fe and h2o2 concentrations klassen et al 1994 after exposure residual h2o2 was quenched with sodium thiosulfate keen et al 2013 2 3 reagents and test waters analytical grade pcba cbz and ndma were purchased from sigma aldrich 98 and used without further purification all stock solutions chemicals h2o2 bdh sodium thiosulfate sigma aldrich ferrous sulfate heptahydrate fluka chemika and ferric chloride fisher scientific were prepared in ultrapure water resistance 18 mω cm 1 10 phenanthroline reagent powder packets for total and ferrous iron determination were purchased from hach loveland colorado usa low carbon tap water which is tap water filtered through activated carbon for dissolved organic carbon doc and chlorine removal and raw well water from wells near minneapolis mn served as the two test water matrices for exposures table 2 shows the relevant water quality data for both matrices 2 4 analysis an agilent 1200 series hplc equipped with a uv detector and a reverse phase c 18 column all from agilent santa clara ca usa was used to analyze chemical

with a 0 2 μm acrodisc supor membrane filter the supporting information si details the hplc methods for chemical analysis stock and sample iron concentrations were measured using 1 10 phenanthroline reagent powder packets and confirmed with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes samples for icp oes analysis were acidified with nitric acid ph 2 for preservation verification of hach method iron measurements with icp oes measurements are provided in the si 2 5 control experiments several control experiments were performed to assess if 1 iron was complexing with target chemicals 2 dark fenton reactions were contributing to chemical degradation 3 loss of iron was occurring from adsorption and 4 water quality parameters mainly ph and temperature were changing during dark and photo fenton experiments and 5 h2o2 concentration remained constant under uv exposure and in the presence and absence of organics complete control test results are reported in the si with relevant findings reported below results from control experiments indicate iron was not complexing with the target chemical and settling out of solution dark fenton reactions did not result in chemical removal this may be attributed to the short time period 20 min the samples were allowed to mix minimal 3 iron was lost due to adsorption to the borosilicate glass vessel during dark and uv exposures up to a 4 c temperature change occurred after exposing a 75 ml sample for the maximum uv fluence rate 18 min changes in ph from pre to post irradiated samples were minimal 0 3 ph units the concentration of h2o2 was consistent in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 fe exposed samples therefore photolysis of organic matter present in well water did not result in increased h2o2 production upon addition of fe2 to the lct and well water matrix fe2 was observed to instantaneously oxidize to fe3 3 results 3 1 hydroxyl radical quantification to compare and assess radical production for uv h2o2 and iron assisted uv h2o2 experiments at neutral ph steady state ho concentrations were determined using pcba ho calculations can be found in si illustrated in fig 1 are steady state ho concentrations in lct and well water addition of iron was shown to increase ho levels in all well water scenarios by 22 8 and 26 7 for 5 and 10 mg l h2o2 concentrations respectively relative to conditions where iron was not present added iron increased ho steady state concentrations 2 16 in lct water when using 10 mg l h2o2 however only scenarios with added fe2 were determined to be statistically different p 0 05 fig 1 although the mean ho steady state concentrations for uv 5 mg l h2o2 fe were slightly higher than uv h2o2 alone for lct water these differences were not significant p 0 34 3 2 degradation kinetics of selected compounds degradation kinetics were measured to test the influence of iron concentration h2o2 concentration and iron species on chemical removal rates for uv h2o2 systems fluence based units were chosen to normalize against changes in experimental conditions i e changes in uvt and provide a comparative unit for future uv h2o2 fe studies the fluence based degradation of pcba cbz or ndma is represented by the pseudo first order rate constant k obs which can be determined by plotting the following equation and determining the slope k obs 5 l n c c o k o b s f where ln c c o is the natural log of the ratio of chemical concentration following uv exposure at a given fluence over the initial chemical concentration and f is the uv fluence mj cm2 pseudo first order kinetics were observed for all experiments e g fig s2 results are presented in fig 2 k obs values for pcba and cbz were on average 75 and 60 lower in well water compared to lct water whereas these values for ndma were only slightly lower 8 this is because the well water contained higher concentrations of ho scavengers mainly carbonate species and dom see table 2 cbz and ndma responded differently to uv h2o2 fe fig 2 in comparing control scenarios without iron uv 5 mg l h2o2 and uv 10 mg l h2o2 to uv h2o2 fe ndma degradation rates in lct and well water increased with 0 3 mg l iron addition by 15 1 and 4 6 p 0 05 one tailed t test respectively cbz removal was neither improved nor inhibited by iron addition in the well water despite potentially higher levels of ho present as was determined using pcba as a probe compound this observation is consistent with previous findings de la cruz et al 2012 where cbz degradation was minimally changed by the addition of 5 mg l fe2 to uv h2o2 50 mg l 3 3 modeled degradation rates all results were modeled following methods outlined by sharpless and linden 2003 to compare predicted and experimental degradation rate constants of uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 fe chemical kinetic parameters used in the model are presented in table 1 it is worth noting that two parameters commonly used in photo fenton models are shield factor to account for iron shielding h2o2 from uv254 light and the reaction rate of fe2 oxidation by h2o2 k fenton emmenegger et al 1998 vermilyea and voelker 2009 the model presented considers shielding effects from iron by incorporating the absorbance of the water sample however k fenton was not included since the current model was used as a tool for comparison between experimental and empirical chemical specific degradation results and not for prediction chemical degradation kinetics in uv h2o2 processes are typically modeled by including the direct photolysis rate k d and indirect photolysis rate k i 6 d c d t k d k i c the kinetics of uv h2o2 have been extensively presented in the literature rosenfeldt and linden 2007 baeza and knappe 2011 and the specific modeling undertaken here is presented in the si fig 3 compares the experimental k o b s and predicted k model rate constants for lct and well water observed and modeled first order degradation rate constants for pcba cbz and ndma control scenarios no added iron are overall in good agreement there are clear differences between experimental and modeled reaction rates for pcba and ndma scenarios with iron addition fig 3 based on data presented in fig 3c and d cbz removal remained unchanged with iron addition as previously concluded where the degradation kinetics of cbz with and without iron addition were shown to be unchanged fig 2 and fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 observed hydroxyl radical production using pcba as a probe compound ho production determined using various probe compounds such as benzene cyclohexane and atrazine is often used as a parameter to evaluate the efficiency of fenton and photo fenton processes gallard and de laat 2000 southworth and voelker 2003 vermilyea and voelker 2009 zepp et al 1992 pignatello et al 1999 in this study where h2o2 is in excess and a deep uv producing light source is used ho is assumed to be the reactive species responsible for chemical degradation because it is produced simultaneously from h2o2 photolysis and reduction of h2o2 by fe2 pcba was used as a probe to determine ho production in uv h2o2 systems in the presence of low levels of iron fig 1 shows that the ho steady state concentration in well water as determined by pcba increased 22 8 and 26 7 for 5 and 10 mg l h2o2 with iron addition however this increase in ho steady state concentration with added iron was not observed in lct water as previously discussed the efficiency of ho production in fenton and photo fenton processes is highly ph dependent while ph of the lct 6 72 and well water 7 78 differ the iron redox chemistry will be consistent within this ph range since past a ph of 4 fe2 will form fe2 hydroxides specifically fe oh 2 and amorphous fe3 hydroxides begin to form around a ph of 3 in the absence of chelating ligands pignatello et al 2006 the presence of organic ligands such as carboxylate moieties in dom and carbonate species at neutral ph in the well water likely increased fenton and photo fenton reactivity by stabilizing fe3 thus preventing its precipitation southworth and voelker 2003 emmenegger et al 1998 king and farlow 2000 clarizia et al 2017 the presence of stable iron complexes is particularly advantageous for photo fenton systems since they absorb light more efficiently and as a result fe3 complexes yield more fe2 per photon of light absorbed i e an increased quantum yield when compared to aquo fe3 complexes pignatello et al 2006 the well water background matrix containing almost three times as much dissolved organic carbon and over six times the alkalinity when compared to the lct water likely promoted the formation of stable fe3 complexes whereas less reactive aquo iron complexes were present in the lct water 4 2 chemical response to uv h2o2 fe interestingly trends in cbz and ndma removal rates for uv h2o2 fe did not follow trends in increased ho production from added iron added iron was shown to enhance p 0 05 ndma removal in both lct 9 4 and well water 3 9 whereas it had no effect on cbz degradation in either water source since cbz and pcba degrade mainly through ho oxidation trends in cbz removal were expected to reflect trends in pcba removal for uv h2o2 fe because the net ho production should be the same in all uv h2o2 fe scenarios in contrast enhanced ndma removal with iron addition was expected to be negligible since direct photolysis is the major degradation mechanism for ndma differences in cbz and ndma removal behavior in uv h2o2 fe scenarios in well and lct water suggest an alternative degradation pathway to ho oxidation previous work de la cruz et al 2012 neamţu et al 2014 also observed chemical specific responses to photo uv254 fenton at neutral ph for example of the eight micropollutants studied by neamţu et al 2014 removal of two chemicals gabapentin and metformin were not improved with iron addition while the oxidation rate for atenolol was 22 enhanced in the presence of iron under the same experimental conditions two hypotheses are proposed to explain chemical specific responses to uv254 h2o2 fe systems first other oxidants are being produced during h2o2 fe photolysis ho while assumed to be the dominant reactive species since h2o2 is in excess and a deep uv light source at 254 nm is being used is most likely not the only radical species produced in the uv h2o2 fe system radical species identified in photo fenton and other aops are the peroxyl radical roo the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and its conjugated base the superoxide anion o2 pignatello et al 2006 reactive species unique to fenton reactions are iron oxo species mainly the ferryl ion feo2 keenan and sedlak 2008 minero et al 2013 bauer and fallmann 1997 mártire et al 2002 gligorovski et al 2015 pignatello et al 1999 vermilyea and voelker 2009 although ferryl and ho react via different mechanisms with contaminants electron transfer versus ring addition and hydrogen atom abstraction respectively their products are often identical and both have a high affinity to react with aromatic compounds vione et al 2014 it is therefore unlikely ferryl would react with pcba and not cbz the second hypothesis is that there is a physical process or chemical reaction between iron and the target compound for example complexation of the carboxylate group on pcba with fe3 could result in photooxidation through lmct similarly ndma s amine moiety may be a viable ligand for iron s coordination sites also resulting in photooxidation through lmct this mechanism would be less likely for cbz either due to steric repulsion from its three fused rings or the lesser availability of the amide n atom relative to the carboxylate o atom for pcba for fe complexation an additional explanation for the observation that cbz removal in the uv h2o2 fe system is less than ndma is that superoxide o2 reduces an initial cbz oxidation product back to the parent compound pignatello et al 2006 effectively inhibiting its transformation a similar process is known to occur for when cbz is oxidized by triplet state dissolved organic matter but in this case the reducing agents are electron rich moieties of the organic matter canonica and laubscher 2008 further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesized mechanism in uv254 h2o2 fe systems to better understand if added iron was contributing directly to chemical removal separate time based uv fe experiments were performed in the absence of h2o2 pcba and cbz were not removed in uv fe experiments results not shown interestingly ndma removal increased by 52 5 in lct water and 7 8 in well water when compared to uv photolysis alone as illustrated in fig 4 as shown the oxidation state of the initial iron species added did not impact nmda removal this is likely due to the rapid oxidation of the low concentration of added fe2 to fe3 additional discussion on the role of iron species is provided in section 4 4 these results confirm that significant levels of ho are not being produced in uv fe systems and suggest that fe complexed ndma is possibly being degraded following lmct furthermore lower ndma removal observed in well water suggests that iron may be complexing with ligands in the water matrix organic carboxylates and inorganic carbonate rather than with ndma to our knowledge no other studies have directly evaluated ndma removal in the presence of uv254 and low levels of iron using ndma as a probe compound wink et al 1991 published evidence of an oxidative species produced concurrently with ho as a result of dark and acidic fenton reactions results from stop flow spectrophotometry wink et al 1991 and quenching studies wink et al 1994 suggest transient a is the predominant radical responsible for ndma removal however transient a has yet to be identified within the literature and whether or not this radical could be present in uv h2o2 fe and uv fe systems at neutral ph is unknown 4 3 ratio of h2o2 to iron concentration the ratio of h2o2 to fe concentration h2o2 fe is a parameter commonly used to assess and optimize fenton and photo fenton efficiency to degrade various constituents in natural and engineered systems pérez et al 2002 tang and huang 1996 1997 gallard and de laat 2000 because the concentration of fe2 and h2o2 control the rate of fenton reactions emmenegger et al 1998 pérez et al 2002 vermilyea and voelker 2009 a past photo uv vis fenton study pérez et al 2002 using higher h2o2 0 10 000 mg l and fe2 0 400 mg l concentrations when compared to the present study found h2o2 fe2 ratios between 10 1 to 40 1 most effective for total organic carbon removal the h2o2 fe2 ratio was evaluated for the relatively low levels of fe and h2o2 concentrations found in drinking water treatment by comparing h2o2 fe ratios to the estimated removal rates from iron addition k fe k fe representing a fraction of the overall rate constant k obs was estimated by subtracting the observed degradation rate constant for uv h2o2 systems without iron from systems with iron a h2o2 fe ratio of 100 3 h2o2 10 mg l fe 0 3 mg l was shown to consistently achieve the highest pcba and ndma degradation rates due to iron addition k fe in lct and well water regardless of iron species as illustrated in fig 5 this ratio is within the range of h2o2 fe ratios aforementioned a higher h2o2 fe ratio is favored in photo fenton systems since excess h2o2 can react with fe2 to form ho whereas excess fe can prevent photons of light from reaching iron complexes h2o2 and the target chemical however too high of a h2o2 concentration can also negatively impact chemical removal by scavenging ho and increasing the absorbance of the sample gallard and de laat 2000 sharpless and linden 2003 a benefit of using low levels of fe and h2o2 is that reductions in uv transmittance and ho scavenging by h2o2 k ho 2 7 107 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 and fe2 k ho 3 2 108 m 1s 1 kwan and voelker 2002 reported at ph 5 are minimized 4 4 influence of iron species several studies chen and pignatello 1997 gallard and de laat 2000 found that added fe2 resulted in greater initial ho production when compared to added fe3 due to the fast reaction between fe2 and h2o2 and slow reduction of fe3 to fe2 however when h2o2 is in molar excess of fe2 fe2 will rapidly oxidize to fe3 and the system behavior would be independent of the species added initially pignatello et al 2006 at neutral ph and in the presence of dom and uv light pcba and ndma removal rates were found to be independent of the iron species added this is likely attributed to the low concentrations of iron added in the presence and absence of h2o2 added fe2 was observed to quickly oxidize resulting in fe3 formation this explains why first order degradation kinetics were observed in all fe2 and fe3 scenarios and why fe2 addition did not result in higher ho production when compared to scenarios with added fe3 in summary these observations indicate that the reaction is not kinetically limited by reduction of fe3 to fe2 under either set of starting conditions 4 4 modeled results a kinetic model was developed to better understand the influence added iron had on chemical degradation in uv h2o2 systems and to determine if a rate constant describing the increased chemical removal due to added iron could be obtained and used in future uv h2o2 fe models in comparing theoretical to experimental rate constants determined for uv h2o2 fe systems fig 3 modeled results demonstrate that uv h2o2 fe reactions were not uniform for example iron assisted uv h2o2 experimental rates k obs were on average 9 25 and 4 9 higher than predicted rates k model for pcba and ndma respectively therefore no single uniform factor can be used to account for enhanced chemical removal in iron enhanced uv h2o2 systems 5 conclusion while photo fenton applications have traditionally been used for non potable water treatment along with ph adjustment to prevent iron precipitation the goal of the present study was to evaluate the potential for enhanced oxidation by iron at levels below the usepa smcl naturally present in circumneutral ph ground waters the ability of low levels of iron to enhance oxidative transformation of contaminants in uv and uv h2o2 systems at neutral ph was observed to be most influenced by the water matrix and the physiochemical properties of the target chemical ho production was observed to increase in well water ndma degradation was increased in both water types and cbz removal was not enhanced in lct or well water chemical specific responses to uv h2o2 fe suggest that compound degradation in uv h2o2 fe systems is due in part to alternative degradation pathways other than ho oxidation interestingly without h2o2 addition added iron was shown to enhance ndma removal in both water matrices when compared to uv photolysis alone it was hypothesized ndma may be complexing with iron and undergoing lmct given the low levels of iron used in this study the fraction of iron able to participate in photo fenton reactions or potentially form a complex with the target compound was likely determined by the formation of stable iron complexes future work is needed to determine the mechanisms responsible for chemical specific abatement in uv254 h2o2 fe and uv254 fe systems low levels of iron were shown to increase the oxidation potential of uv h2o2 in well water using pcba as a probe compound and assuming all decay of pcba was due to oh radical generation added iron to uv h2o2 was shown to increase ho production on average by 25 in the well water matrix tested this result indicates uv h2o2 systems applied in a low iron water matrix could benefit from enhanced pollutant removal for example in well water a 30 reduction in pcba was achieved by uv h2o2 at a fluence of 430 mj cm2 whereas a fluence of 330 mj cm2 with uv h2o2 fe achieved the same these results should be further evaluated in a pilot scale uv h2o2 system with ground water containing

19813,while the presence of iron is generally not seen as favorable for uv based treatment systems due to lamp fouling and decreased uv transmittance we show that low levels of iron can lead to improvements in the abatement of chemicals in the uv hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process the oxidation potential of an iron assisted uv h2o2 uv254 h2o2 iron process was evaluated at neutral ph using iron levels below usepa secondary drinking water standards 0 3 mg l para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as a hydroxyl radical ho probe to quantify ho steady state concentrations compounds degraded by different mechanisms including carbamazepine cbz ho oxidation and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma direct photolysis were used to investigate the effect of iron on compound degradation for uv h2o2 systems the effects of iron species fe2 and fe3 iron concentration 0 0 3 mg l h2o2 concentration 0 10 mg l and background water matrix low carbon tap lct and well water on ho production and compound removal were examined iron assisted uv h2o2 efficiency was most influenced by the target chemical and the water matrix added iron to uv h2o2 was shown to increase the steady state ho concentration by approximately 25 in all well water scenarios while cbz removal was unchanged by iron addition 0 3 mg l iron improved ndma removal rates in both lct and well water matrices by 15 1 and 4 6 respectively furthermore the combination of uv fe without h2o2 was also shown to enhance ndma removal when compared to uv photolysis alone indicating the presence of degradation pathways other than ho oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv advanced oxidation process uv aop hydroxyl radical ho photo fenton micropollutants 1 introduction uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops combine uv light with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or other radical promoters to simultaneously photolyze and oxidize through production of the highly reactive non selective hydroxyl radical ho micropollutants in water supplies swaim et al 2008 oppenländer 2003 while highly effective against many persistent pollutants the water matrix treated by uv aops can greatly impact micropollutant abatement for example carbonate species dissolved organic matter dom and nitrite ions are known to scavenge ho lowering the ho steady state concentration thereby decreasing target pollutant oxidation rosenfeldt and linden 2007 in addition light screening by the water matrix can reduce photolysis of pollutants and production of ho by reducing the photons available for absorbance by the added ho radical promoter the presence of iron in water is commonly associated with decreased uv transmittance uvt and can lead to fouling of the quartz sleeves which results in decreased uv intensity in uv reactors wait et al 2007 for these reasons uv system manufacturers recommend total iron levels less than 0 3 mg l oram 2014 in addition the environmental protection agency epa has a secondary maximum contaminant limit smcl of 0 3 mg l total iron 5 μm since the presence of iron in potable water is often perceived as unfavorable though not toxic oxidized iron can cause staining of household items and taste and odor issues although seemingly desirable to remove iron prior to uv aops iron in the presence of light and h2o2 has been shown to increase the net production of oxidizing species in uv aops utilizing h2o2 uv h2o2 potentially through fenton and photo fenton reactions under different water quality conditions tokumura et al 2011 similar to aops the primary oxidant produced and

complexing organic ligands soluble ferrous fe2 and ferric fe3 iron are cycled autocatalytically to produce ho equations 1 and 2 photoassisted fenton photo fenton reactions where fe3 is photoreduced to fe2 have been shown to enhance chemical removal rates compared to dark fenton reactions pignatello et al 2006 this is due to increased generation of ho directly by h2o2 photolysis equation 3 and indirectly from regenerating fe2 equation 4 when fe3 undergoes photoreduction to fe2 via ligand to metal charge transfer lmct 3 h2o2 hν 2ho φ 0 5 4 fe3 l n hν fe2 l n 1 l while commonly viewed as an economical and relatively easy treatment option for micropollutant abatement fenton and photo fenton applications have been mainly limited to non potable water treatment due to the need for acidification to prevent iron precipitation subsequent neutralization can result in iron sludge production and added costs for sludge disposal researchers have explored the use of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts to stabilize fe3 at neutral ph teel et al 2001 doumic et al 2015 sun and pignatello 1992 kim and vogelpohl 1998 gao et al 2015 however the use of a catalyst can have several disadvantages including the need to remove or regenerate the catalyst gao et al 2015 and the potential to generate toxic intermediates trovó et al 2011 the rate of fenton and photo fenton reactions decrease as the ph is increased above 3 because fe3 precipitates to amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides however even under neutral ph conditions stable iron complexes can form and participate in fenton and photo fenton reactions southworth and voelker 2003 minero et al 2013 clarizia et al 2017 several studies klamerth et al 2010 ortega gómez et al 2016 vermilyea and voelker 2009 bernabeu et al 2012 southworth and voelker 2003 rubio et al 2013 de la cruz et al 2012 neamţu et al 2014 have demonstrated the ability of photo fenton reactions at neutral ph to degrade micropollutants without catalyst

efficiencies at neutral ph these photo uv254 fenton studies have commonly been evaluated for wastewater treatment applications and use iron levels that far exceed up to 50 mg l the 0 3 mg l total iron limit in the smcl by the epa and recommended by uv manufacturers additionally the h2o2 concentrations evaluated were greater than concentrations typical of conventional uv h2o2 systems 10 mg l based on some surprising results during a routine study of the uv h2o2 process for chemical abatement in groundwater we were motivated to evaluate the potential for enhanced oxidation via an iron assisted uv h2o2 process at neutral ph under the low levels of iron commonly present in well water and meeting the epa smcl the goal of this study was to better understand the effect of low levels of iron on organic compound abatement in the uv h2o2 advanced oxidation system the steady state ho production in uv h2o2 fe systems under varied fe2 and fe3 0 0 3 mg l and h2o2 0 10 mg l concentrations was examined chemical specific responses to uv h2o2 fe were evaluated using carbamazepine cbz and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as target pollutants known to exhibit varied responses to uv based treatment a steady state ho kinetic model was adapted to compare with experimental results and evaluate the influence of iron on cbz and ndma degradation 2 experimental 2 1 chemical selection para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was selected as a chemical probe to measure ho production in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 fe systems because of its low quantum yield of direct photolysis φ 0 013 mol es 1 and high and well established second order reaction rate constant with ho 5 0 109 m 1s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 ndma and cbz were selected as target compounds based on their unique photochemical and physicochemical properties shown in table 1 for instance pcba and cbz with second order ho rate constants k ho that are respectively 21 and 13 times higher than ndma degrade mainly through ho oxidation in contrast ndma with a relatively high degradation quantum yield φ 0 25 mol es 1 low k ho 3 30 108 m 1s 1 and strong molar absorptivity from 200 to 275 nm degrades mainly through photolysis sharpless and linden 2003 2 2 experimental approach the following experimental conditions were evaluated for their effect on ho generation and removal rates of cbz and ndma h2o2 concentration 5 and 10 mg l total iron concentration 0 1 and 0 3 mg l iron species fe2 and fe3 and background water matrix a quasi collimated dual beam low pressure uv device was used for sample exposure four low pressure uv lpuv lamps 15 w g15t8 philips netherlands were housed above two 4 inch apertures each equipped with a manual shutter incident uv irradiance at 254 nm was measured by a calibrated radiometer and detector international light inc model 1700 sed 240 w uv fluence was calculated by multiplying the average irradiance by the exposure time in seconds the average irradiance was determined by correcting the incident irradiance for sample depth absorbance at 254 nm surface reflectance and petri factor bolton and linden 2003 samples were taken at fluence values ranging from 0 to 1000 mj cm2 the specific order of micropollutant iron and h2o2 addition to the test water was kept consistent throughout all experiments solutions were spiked with the target chemical at a concentration equal to 100 the detection limit of the high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument resulting in starting concentrations of 0 5 mg l for ndma and pcba and 1 0 mg l for cbz iron stock solutions of 10 15 mg l fe were prepared daily both iron and h2o2 were added shortly before uv exposure to achieve the desired fe and h2o2 concentrations klassen et al 1994 after exposure residual h2o2 was quenched with sodium thiosulfate keen et al 2013 2 3 reagents and test waters analytical grade pcba cbz and ndma were purchased from sigma aldrich 98 and used without further purification all stock solutions chemicals h2o2 bdh sodium thiosulfate sigma aldrich ferrous sulfate heptahydrate fluka chemika and ferric chloride fisher scientific were prepared in ultrapure water resistance 18 mω cm 1 10 phenanthroline reagent powder packets for total and ferrous iron determination were purchased from hach loveland colorado usa low carbon tap water which is tap water filtered through activated carbon for dissolved organic carbon doc and chlorine removal and raw well water from wells near minneapolis mn served as the two test water matrices for exposures table 2 shows the relevant water quality data for both matrices 2 4 analysis an agilent 1200 series hplc equipped with a uv detector and a reverse phase c 18 column all from agilent santa clara ca usa was used to analyze chemical concentrations pcba and ndma samples were filtered with 0 45 μm nylon filter vwr for removal of particulate iron prior to hplc analysis because of interferences with the nylon filter cbz was filtered with a 0 2 μm acrodisc supor membrane filter the supporting information si details the hplc methods for chemical analysis stock and sample iron concentrations were measured using 1 10 phenanthroline reagent powder packets and confirmed with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes samples for icp oes analysis were acidified with nitric acid ph 2 for preservation verification of hach method iron measurements with icp oes measurements are provided in the si 2 5 control experiments several control experiments were performed to assess if 1 iron was complexing with target chemicals 2 dark fenton reactions were contributing to chemical degradation 3 loss of iron was occurring from adsorption and 4 water quality parameters mainly ph and temperature were changing during dark and photo fenton experiments and 5 h2o2 concentration remained constant under uv exposure and in the presence and absence of organics complete control test results are reported in the si with relevant findings reported below results from control experiments indicate iron was not complexing with the target chemical and settling out of solution dark fenton reactions did not result in chemical removal this may be attributed to the short time period 20 min the samples were allowed to mix minimal 3 iron was lost due to adsorption to the borosilicate glass vessel during dark and uv exposures up to a 4 c temperature change occurred after exposing a 75 ml sample for the maximum uv fluence rate 18 min changes in ph from pre to post irradiated samples were minimal 0 3 ph units the concentration of h2o2 was consistent in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 fe exposed samples therefore photolysis of organic matter present in well water did not result in increased h2o2 production upon addition of fe2 to the lct and well water matrix fe2 was observed to instantaneously oxidize to fe3 3 results 3 1 hydroxyl radical quantification to compare and assess radical production for uv h2o2 and iron assisted uv h2o2 experiments at neutral ph steady state ho concentrations were determined using pcba ho calculations can be found in si illustrated in fig 1 are steady state ho concentrations in lct and well water addition of iron was shown to increase ho levels in all well water scenarios by 22 8 and 26 7 for 5 and 10 mg l h2o2 concentrations respectively relative to conditions where iron was not present added iron increased ho steady state concentrations 2 16 in lct water when using 10 mg l h2o2 however only scenarios with added fe2 were determined to be statistically different p 0 05 fig 1 although the mean ho steady state concentrations for uv 5 mg l h2o2 fe were slightly higher than uv h2o2 alone for lct water these differences were not significant p 0 34 3 2 degradation kinetics of selected compounds degradation kinetics were measured to test the influence of iron concentration h2o2 concentration and iron species on chemical removal rates for uv h2o2 systems fluence based units were chosen to normalize against changes in experimental conditions i e changes in uvt and provide a comparative unit for future uv h2o2 fe studies the fluence based degradation of pcba cbz or ndma is represented by the pseudo first order rate constant k obs which can be determined by plotting the following equation and determining the slope k obs 5 l n c c o k o b s f where ln c c o is the natural log of the ratio of chemical concentration following uv exposure at a given fluence over the initial chemical concentration and f is the uv fluence mj cm2 pseudo first order kinetics were observed for all experiments e g fig s2 results are presented in fig 2 k obs values for pcba and cbz were on average 75 and 60 lower in well water compared to lct water whereas these values for ndma were only slightly lower 8 this is because the well water contained higher concentrations of ho scavengers mainly carbonate species and dom see table 2 cbz and ndma responded differently to uv h2o2 fe fig 2 in comparing control scenarios without iron uv 5 mg l h2o2 and uv 10 mg l h2o2 to uv h2o2 fe ndma degradation rates in lct and well water increased with 0 3 mg l iron addition by 15 1 and 4 6 p 0 05 one tailed t test respectively cbz removal was neither improved nor inhibited by iron addition in the well water despite potentially higher levels of ho present as was determined using pcba as a probe compound this observation is consistent with previous findings de la cruz et al 2012 where cbz degradation was minimally changed by the addition of 5 mg l fe2 to uv h2o2 50 mg l 3 3 modeled degradation rates all results were modeled following methods outlined by sharpless and linden 2003 to compare predicted and experimental degradation rate constants of uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 fe chemical kinetic parameters used in the model are presented in table 1 it is worth noting that two parameters commonly used in photo fenton models are shield factor to account for iron shielding h2o2 from uv254 light and the reaction rate of fe2 oxidation by h2o2 k fenton emmenegger et al 1998 vermilyea and voelker 2009 the model presented considers shielding effects from iron by incorporating the absorbance of the water sample however k fenton was not included since the current model was used as a tool for comparison between experimental and empirical chemical specific degradation results and not for prediction chemical degradation kinetics in uv h2o2 processes are typically modeled by including the direct photolysis rate k d and indirect photolysis rate k i 6 d c d t k d k i c the kinetics of uv h2o2 have been extensively presented in the literature rosenfeldt and linden 2007 baeza and knappe 2011 and the specific modeling undertaken here is presented in the si fig 3 compares the experimental k o b s and predicted k model rate constants for lct and well water observed and modeled first order degradation rate constants for pcba cbz and ndma control scenarios no added iron are overall in good agreement there are clear differences between experimental and modeled reaction rates for pcba and ndma scenarios with iron addition fig 3 based on data presented in fig 3c and d cbz removal remained unchanged with iron addition as previously concluded where the degradation kinetics of cbz with and without iron addition were shown to be unchanged fig 2 and fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 observed hydroxyl radical production using pcba as a probe compound ho production determined using various probe compounds such as benzene cyclohexane and atrazine is often used as a parameter to evaluate the efficiency of fenton and photo fenton processes gallard and de laat 2000 southworth and voelker 2003 vermilyea and voelker 2009 zepp et al 1992 pignatello et al 1999 in this study where h2o2 is in excess and a deep uv producing light source is used ho is assumed to be the reactive species responsible for chemical degradation because it is produced simultaneously from h2o2 photolysis and reduction of h2o2 by fe2 pcba was used as a probe to determine ho production in uv h2o2 systems in the presence of low levels of iron fig 1 shows that the ho steady state concentration in well water as determined by pcba increased 22 8 and 26 7 for 5 and 10 mg l h2o2 with iron addition however this increase in ho steady state concentration with added iron was not observed in lct water as previously discussed the efficiency of ho production in fenton and photo fenton processes is highly ph dependent while ph of the lct 6 72 and well water 7 78 differ the iron redox chemistry will be consistent within this ph range since past a ph of 4 fe2 will form fe2 hydroxides specifically fe oh 2 and amorphous fe3 hydroxides begin to form around a ph of 3 in the absence of chelating ligands pignatello et al 2006 the presence of organic ligands such as carboxylate moieties in dom and carbonate species at neutral ph in the well water likely increased fenton and photo fenton reactivity by stabilizing fe3 thus preventing its precipitation southworth and voelker 2003 emmenegger et al 1998 king and farlow 2000 clarizia et al 2017 the presence of stable iron complexes is particularly advantageous for photo fenton systems since they absorb light more efficiently and as a result fe3 complexes yield more fe2 per photon of light absorbed i e an increased quantum yield when compared to aquo fe3 complexes pignatello et al 2006 the well water background matrix containing almost three times as much dissolved organic carbon and over six times the alkalinity when compared to the lct water likely promoted the formation of stable fe3 complexes whereas less reactive aquo iron complexes were present in the lct water 4 2 chemical response to uv h2o2 fe interestingly trends in cbz and ndma removal rates for uv h2o2 fe did not follow trends in increased ho production from added iron added iron was shown to enhance p 0 05 ndma removal in both lct 9 4 and well water 3 9 whereas it had no effect on cbz degradation in either water source since cbz and pcba degrade mainly through ho oxidation trends in cbz removal were expected to reflect trends in pcba removal for uv h2o2 fe because the net ho production should be the same in all uv h2o2 fe scenarios in contrast enhanced ndma removal with iron addition was expected to be negligible since direct photolysis is the major degradation mechanism for ndma differences in cbz and ndma removal behavior in uv h2o2 fe scenarios in well and lct water suggest an alternative degradation pathway to ho oxidation previous work de la cruz et al 2012 neamţu et al 2014 also observed chemical specific responses to photo uv254 fenton at neutral ph for example of the eight micropollutants studied by neamţu et al 2014 removal of two chemicals gabapentin and metformin were not improved with iron addition while the oxidation rate for atenolol was 22 enhanced in the presence of iron under the same experimental conditions two hypotheses are proposed to explain chemical specific responses to uv254 h2o2 fe systems first other oxidants are being produced during h2o2 fe photolysis ho while assumed to be the dominant reactive species since h2o2 is in excess and a deep uv light source at 254 nm is being used is most likely not the only radical species produced in the uv h2o2 fe system radical species identified in photo fenton and other aops are the peroxyl radical roo the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and its conjugated base the superoxide anion o2 pignatello et al 2006 reactive species unique to fenton reactions are iron oxo species mainly the ferryl ion feo2 keenan and sedlak 2008 minero et al 2013 bauer and fallmann 1997 mártire et al 2002 gligorovski et al 2015 pignatello et al 1999 vermilyea and voelker 2009 although ferryl and ho react via different mechanisms with contaminants electron transfer versus ring addition and hydrogen atom abstraction respectively their products are often identical and both have a high affinity to react with aromatic compounds vione et al 2014 it is therefore unlikely ferryl would react with pcba and not cbz the second hypothesis is that there is a physical process or chemical reaction between iron and the target compound for example complexation of the carboxylate group on pcba with fe3 could result in photooxidation through lmct similarly ndma s amine moiety may be a viable ligand for iron s coordination sites also resulting in photooxidation through lmct this mechanism would be less likely for cbz either due to steric repulsion from its three fused rings or the lesser availability of the amide n atom relative to the carboxylate o atom for pcba for fe complexation an additional explanation for the observation that cbz removal in the uv h2o2 fe system is less than ndma is that superoxide o2 reduces an initial cbz oxidation product back to the parent compound pignatello et al 2006 effectively inhibiting its transformation a similar process is known to occur for when cbz is oxidized by triplet state dissolved organic matter but in this case the reducing agents are electron rich moieties of the organic matter canonica and laubscher 2008 further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesized mechanism in uv254 h2o2 fe systems to better understand if added iron was contributing directly to chemical removal separate time based uv fe experiments were performed in the absence of h2o2 pcba and cbz were not removed in uv fe experiments results not shown interestingly ndma removal increased by 52 5 in lct water and 7 8 in well water when compared to uv photolysis alone as illustrated in fig 4 as shown the oxidation state of the initial iron species added did not impact nmda removal this is likely due to the rapid oxidation of the low concentration of added fe2 to fe3 additional discussion on the role of iron species is provided in section 4 4 these results confirm that significant levels of ho are not being produced in uv fe systems and suggest that fe complexed ndma is possibly being degraded following lmct furthermore lower ndma removal observed in well water suggests that iron may be complexing with ligands in the water matrix organic carboxylates and inorganic carbonate rather than with ndma to our knowledge no other studies have directly evaluated ndma removal in the presence of uv254 and low levels of iron using ndma as a probe compound wink et al 1991 published evidence of an oxidative species produced concurrently with ho as a result of dark and acidic fenton reactions results from stop flow spectrophotometry wink et al 1991 and quenching studies wink et al 1994 suggest transient a is the predominant radical responsible for ndma removal however transient a has yet to be identified within the literature and whether or not this radical could be present in uv h2o2 fe and uv fe systems at neutral ph is unknown 4 3 ratio of h2o2 to iron concentration the ratio of h2o2 to fe concentration h2o2 fe is a parameter commonly used to assess and optimize fenton and photo fenton efficiency to degrade various constituents in natural and engineered systems pérez et al 2002 tang and huang 1996 1997 gallard and de laat 2000 because the concentration of fe2 and h2o2 control the rate of fenton reactions emmenegger et al 1998 pérez et al 2002 vermilyea and voelker 2009 a past photo uv vis fenton study pérez et al 2002 using higher h2o2 0 10 000 mg l and fe2 0 400 mg l concentrations when compared to the present study found h2o2 fe2 ratios between 10 1 to 40 1 most effective for total organic carbon removal the h2o2 fe2 ratio was evaluated for the relatively low levels of fe and h2o2 concentrations found in drinking water treatment by comparing h2o2 fe ratios to the estimated removal rates from iron addition k fe k fe representing a fraction of the overall rate constant k obs was estimated by subtracting the observed degradation rate constant for uv h2o2 systems without iron from systems with iron a h2o2 fe ratio of 100 3 h2o2 10 mg l fe 0 3 mg l was shown to consistently achieve the highest pcba and ndma degradation rates due to iron addition k fe in lct and well water regardless of iron species as illustrated in fig 5 this ratio is within the range of h2o2 fe ratios aforementioned a higher h2o2 fe ratio is favored in photo fenton systems since excess h2o2 can react with fe2 to form ho whereas excess fe can prevent photons of light from reaching iron complexes h2o2 and the target chemical however too high of a h2o2 concentration can also negatively impact chemical removal by scavenging ho and increasing the absorbance of the sample gallard and de laat 2000 sharpless and linden 2003 a benefit of using low levels of fe and h2o2 is that reductions in uv transmittance and ho scavenging by h2o2 k ho 2 7 107 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 and fe2 k ho 3 2 108 m 1s 1 kwan and voelker 2002 reported at ph 5 are minimized 4 4 influence of iron species several studies chen and pignatello 1997 gallard and de laat 2000 found that added fe2 resulted in greater initial ho production when compared to added fe3 due to the fast reaction between fe2 and h2o2 and slow reduction of fe3 to fe2 however when h2o2 is in molar excess of fe2 fe2 will rapidly oxidize to fe3 and the system behavior would be independent of the species added initially pignatello et al 2006 at neutral ph and in the presence of dom and uv light pcba and ndma removal rates were found to be independent of the iron species added this is likely attributed to the low concentrations of iron added in the presence and absence of h2o2 added fe2 was observed to quickly oxidize resulting in fe3 formation this explains why first order degradation kinetics were observed in all fe2 and fe3 scenarios and why fe2 addition did not result in higher ho production when compared to scenarios with added fe3 in summary these observations indicate that the reaction is not kinetically limited by reduction of fe3 to fe2 under either set of starting conditions 4 4 modeled results a kinetic model was developed to better understand the influence added iron had on chemical degradation in uv h2o2 systems and to determine if a rate constant describing the increased chemical removal due to added iron could be obtained and used in future uv h2o2 fe models in comparing theoretical to experimental rate constants determined for uv h2o2 fe systems fig 3 modeled results demonstrate that uv h2o2 fe reactions were not uniform for example iron assisted uv h2o2 experimental rates k obs were on average 9 25 and 4 9 higher than predicted rates k model for pcba and ndma respectively therefore no single uniform factor can be used to account for enhanced chemical removal in iron enhanced uv h2o2 systems 5 conclusion while photo fenton applications have traditionally been used for non potable water treatment along with ph adjustment to prevent iron precipitation the goal of the present study was to evaluate the potential for enhanced oxidation by iron at levels below the usepa smcl naturally present in circumneutral ph ground waters the ability of low levels of iron to enhance oxidative transformation of contaminants in uv and uv h2o2 systems at neutral ph was observed to be most influenced by the water matrix and the physiochemical properties of the target chemical ho production was observed to increase in well water ndma degradation was increased in both water types and cbz removal was not enhanced in lct or well water chemical specific responses to uv h2o2 fe suggest that compound degradation in uv h2o2 fe systems is due in part to alternative degradation pathways other than ho oxidation interestingly without h2o2 addition added iron was shown to enhance ndma removal in both water matrices when compared to uv photolysis alone it was hypothesized ndma may be complexing with iron and undergoing lmct given the low levels of iron used in this study the fraction of iron able to participate in photo fenton reactions or potentially form a complex with the target compound was likely determined by the formation of stable iron complexes future work is needed to determine the mechanisms responsible for chemical specific abatement in uv254 h2o2 fe and uv254 fe systems low levels of iron were shown to increase the oxidation potential of uv h2o2 in well water using pcba as a probe compound and assuming all decay of pcba was due to oh radical generation added iron to uv h2o2 was shown to increase ho production on average by 25 in the well water matrix tested this result indicates uv h2o2 systems applied in a low iron water matrix could benefit from enhanced pollutant removal for example in well water a 30 reduction in pcba was achieved by uv h2o2 at a fluence of 430 mj cm2 whereas a fluence of 330 mj cm2 with uv h2o2 fe achieved the same these results should be further evaluated in a pilot scale uv h2o2 system with ground water containing

19814,an effective approach for eutrophication control and phosphate recovery remains a longstanding challenge herein we present a new technique for phosphate sequestration in lake and phosphate recovery using novel magnetically recoverable magnetite lanthanum hydroxide m la oh 3 hybrids that can be prepared using a simple one pot synthesis method batch studies show that m la oh 3 exhibits a strong sorption towards phosphate with sorption capacities of up to 52 7 mg p g at ph 7 0 in water a simple model indicates that the efficiency of m la oh 3 for phosphate sequestration in lake is significantly attenuated by 34 45 compared to that in water due to interference from sediment particles however our results demonstrate that sediments suspensions mixed with a m la oh 3 content of 1 3 exhibit a capability of up to 1 2 mg p g for sequestering external phosphate compared with that of 0 2 mg p g for pristine sediment at ph 7 3 m la oh 3 mixed sediment suspensions appear to effectively sequester phosphate over an environmentally relevant ph range from 4 to 8 5 phosphorus p fractionation experiments indicate that the enhanced phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 mixed sediment suspensions is mainly due to the increased fractions of naoh p and inorganic p this work indicates that the m la oh 3 has the potential for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic separation lanthanum hydroxide eutrophication control lake restoration phosphorus fractionation 1 introduction about 30 50 of global water sources are facing the problem of eutrophication as a consequence of excessive dissolved phosphorus p in freshwaters funes et al 2016 liu et al 2016 to counteract the occurrence of eutrophication the successful reduction of dissolved p mainly as the form of phosphate in freshwater highly depends on both of controlling internal p release from sediments and limiting introduction of external p inputs ye et al 2017 despite the great progress in limiting p inputs from point contaminant sources of p particularly wastewater discharges fang et al 2017a b the control of non point p sources such as agricultural runoffs is still problematic as a result the external p inputs into freshwaters from these sources still occur in addition the capacity of lake sediments to reduce the continuously introduced p is limited and can be affected by redox conditions sondergaard et al 2003 several techniques such as sediment dredging sediment oxygenation sediment capping with metal salts e g aluminum al and calcium ca have been adopted to sequester immobilize phosphate in sediment of which the control of p release using chemical salts or materials receives increasing attention due to its high efficiency and energy effectiveness funes et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 the addition of al or fe has been widely applied for p sequestration in lake restoration through effectively precipitating phosphate in sediment deppe and benndorf 2002 funes et al 2016 yamada et al 2012 although these materials can effectively reduce dissolved p from freshwater the capped p in lake sediment may be re released into overlying water phase due to the aging of materials and variations of environmental conditions such as ph and redox potential deppe and benndorf 2002 egemose et al 2009 owing to the strong affinity of lanthanum la with phosphate la based bentonite i e phoslock was first invented for phosphate removal copetti et al 2016 douglas et al 1999 2016 haghseresht et al 2009 robb et al 2003 and later a number of la based materials such as la modified alumina and zeolite lanthanum hydroxide have been developed for effectively sequestering p in sediments with a promising p sorption capacity of up to 108 mg g lesnichaya et al 2009 xie et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 it shows that la can be stably present in sediments with a negligible effect on aquatic organisms copetti et al 2016 balusamy et al 2015 despite the advantage of la for phosphate removal the extensive application of no recyclable la based materials leads to the high chemical consumption of non renewable and expensive la resource a potentially feasible solution is to magnetize the nanoparticles through hybridizing with biocompatible fe3o4 nanoparticles so that they can be separated recovered and reused and this technique has recently been extensively applied for developing magnetic sorbents and catalysts funes et al 2016 2017 fang et al 2017a b lai et al 2016 wang et al 2016 motivated by this concept p recovery from lake sediment and overlying water using a la based magnetic material appears an alternative solution for tackling p resource depletion restoring eutrophic lake and avoiding high consumption of la resource however there is limited knowledge in this regard that can be found in the literature a very recent work reported a core shell fe3o4 sio2 la oh 3 magnetic sorbents for phosphate removal from wastewater lai et al 2016 however their method is relatively tedious and complicated thus a more facile synthesis method that can produce more effective la based magnetic sorbents is needed moreover most studies have been focusing on p removal or recovery from wastewater the application of such technique for p sequestration and recovery from lake has been rarely studied in particular the effects of sediment particles on the performance of the magnetic la sorbents for p removal from lake during resuspension sedimentation process at the water sediment interface remain unclear thus this work is devoted to developing a facile one step hydrothermal method to synthesize magnetite lanthanum hydroxide magnetic hybrids m la oh 3 for p recovery from lake the m la oh 3 magnetic sorbents were prepared and systematically characterized by x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem and vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the sorption performance of m la oh 3 for phosphate sorption from aqueous solution was first investigated in terms of sorption kinetics and capacity and the effects of ph hereafter the efficiency of m la oh 3 for phosphate recovery from sediment suspension and the effects of sediment particles on the performance of the magnetic sorbents was systematically assessed finally the p fraction in pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediment before and after loading external phosphate as well as after m la oh 3 extraction were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagents of

hydrothermal method was adopted for the preparation of m la oh 3 based on the nominal mass ratio of la oh 3 the synthesized sorbents were designated as m 5 la oh 3 m 10 la oh 3 m 20 la oh 3 m 30 la oh 3 m 50 la oh 3 and m 60 la oh 3 the actual contents of la in the m la oh 3 were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms optima 5300 dv perkin elmer detailed description of synthesis method and determination of la contents are given in text s1 of supplementary material the crystalline structure of the synthesized sorbents was characterized using a bruker d8 focus x ray diffractometer by applying monochromated cukα radiation λ 0 15418 nm in the range of 20 80 º2θ the morphology particle size and elemental composition of the sorbents were analyzed by a jeol 2100f tem equipped energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds operating at 200 kv the magnetic property of the samples was measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm ppms 9t quantum design usa the brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas of the synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids were determined through n2 adsorption desorption over a micromeritics asap 2010 system at 77 k 2 3 phosphate sorption in synthetic water both sorption kinetic and isotherm experiments were first performed in 50 ml polypropylene pp plastic tubes to study and compare the removal efficiency of phosphate by the synthesized m la oh 3 with different la oh 3 ratios at ph 7 0 0 1 a preliminary experiment showed that the adsorption of phosphate to the plastic tube is negligible the sorption kinetics study was carried out by spiking an appropriate amount of phosphate stock solution into each 40 ml m la oh 3 suspension 0 1 g l to achieve an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l the ph of the suspensions was maintained at ph 7 0 0 1 and the ionic strength was controlled with 0 01 m nacl at each reaction time sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm mixed cellulose membrane filter and the filtrate was stored for further analysis the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted with the same ionic strength of 0 01 m nacl as above at ph 7 0 0 1 appropriate amounts of phosphate stock solution were spiked into 0 1 g l of m la oh 3 stock solution to obtain varying initial phosphate concentrations of 1 10 mg p l the sample tubes were then shaken in a mechanical shaker at 25 1 c at 300 rpm for desired time depending on different experiments i e up to 3 h for kinetic experiments and 2 h for sorption isotherm experiments the effect of ph on the phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 sorbents was also investigated with a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l and an initial p concentration of 5 mg p l at 25 1 c in a ph range of 3 11 by adjusting ph with naoh or hcl thermodynamics of phosphate sorption by the m la oh 3 was investigated with a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l and an initial p concentration of 5 mg p l at ph 7 0 0 1 at 25 35 and 45 c respectively the effect of redox state on the phosphate sorption capacity of the m la oh 3 was further investigated with a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l and an initial p concentration of 5 9 mg p l at ph 7 0 0 1 by comparing the phosphate sorption without controlling o2 with that under anoxic conditions in a lab2000 anaerobic glovebox o2 1 ppm etelux instrument after reaction all samples were collected after filtering suspensions through 0 22 μm cellulose membrane filters and then analyzed using the method given in section 2 5 in addition the loss of la from the m 50 la oh 3 as a function of time and ph was investigated with a m 50 la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l with and without the addition of p 5 mg p l after reaction certain time the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose membrane filters and the filtrates were then analyzed using the method described in section 2 5 all sorption experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 phosphate sequestration and recovery in the presence of sediment particles lake sediment and overlying water samples were collected from east lake located in the largest city wuhan of the central china n30º32 44 45 e114º21 54 01 fig s1 the geological location and detailed description of east lake are given in text s2 of supplementary material this lake is considered as the largest urban lake in china which is a typical urban shallow lake with a water area of 33 7 km2 and an average depth of 2 8 m yun et al 2014 the lake receives about 27 104 m3 a of municipal wastewater from the city and the water is also suffering from eutrophication showing a poor water quality of grade iv according to the chinese environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 prior to phosphate sequestration and recovery experiments the phosphate contents in sediment and overlying water were determined using the method described in section 2 5 and the chemical composition of sediment the content of phosphate as tp fraction and the water quality of overlying water were determined and are listed in table s1 and s2 the sampled sediment was air dried passed through a 100 mesh sieve homogenized and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to further use before phosphate sequestration experiments in sediments 0 2 g sediment was added into 40 ml sampled water and spiked with proper amounts of m 50 la oh 3 sorbent to achieve a content from 1 to 3 w w for the m la oh 3 in sediment i e the content of m 50 la oh 3 ranged from 0 05 to 0 15 g l in suspensions to investigate the effects of different dosage of sorbent on phosphate sequestration and recovery the mass ratios of the m la oh 3 to sediment were set at 0 1 2 and 3 to evaluate the effects of mixing sediment particles on the performance of the m la oh 3 both sorption kinetic and isotherm experiments were undertaken in 50 ml pp plastic tubes to investigate the rate constant of sorption and sorption capacity of m la oh 3 amended sediment to sequester phosphate in comparison to that of pristine sediment for sorption kinetic experiments proper amounts of phosphate stock solution was added into 40 ml the prepared pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediment suspensions to achieve an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l to simulate the rate constant of the pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediments to sequester phosphate from external sources respectively for sorption isotherm experiments different amounts of phosphate stock solution were added into the pristine or m la oh 3 amended sediments to achieve initial phosphate concentrations of up to 10 mg p l to study their capacity of sequestering external phosphate the ph value of suspension solutions was not intentionally controlled and found at around 7 3 0 2 throughout the whole period of sorption experiments because of high buffering capability of sediment the sample tubes were shaken in a mechanical shaker at 25 1 c at 300 rpm for desired time depending on different experiments i e 0 2 h for kinetic experiments and 2 h for sorption isotherm experiments after sorption experiments both water and sediment samples were taken at desired time for further analysis using the method described in section 2 5 all experiments were performed in triplicate for phosphate recovery experiments m la oh 3 sorbent particles were first recovered from the suspensions after phosphate sorption in brief a handheld bar ndfeb magnet was pre wrapped with plastic film to avoid directly contact of the magnet with the particles and then dipped into the suspensions to collect the magnetic m la oh 3 particles after the collection the particles the bar magnet was removed and the magnetic particles on the film was washed into a certain volume of water the recovery experiments of m la oh 3 particles were performed for the samples with different mass ratios of m la oh 3 to sediment ranging from 1 to 3 the contents of magnetic particles in solutions were determined by dissolving the recovered magnetic particles in 1 m hcl and analyzing the content of la in solutions phosphate desorption experiments were then carried out by reacting the recovered m la oh 3 sorbent particles in naoh solutions with a concentration from 0 1 to 1 m on a shaker at 300 rpm for 2 h and the concentrations of phosphate in supernatants were determined to calculate the recovery rate of phosphate the kinetic data were fitted with pseudo first eq 1 and second eq 2 order equations 1 d q e d t k 1 q e t q t 2 d q e d t k 2 q

microscopic images of fe3o4 pure la oh 3 and m la oh 3 hybrids are depicted in fig 1 the particles size of fe3o4 is 10 nm fig 1a which is more than half the size of fe3o4 obtained by lai et al via co precipitation method lai et al 2016 lanthanum hydroxide has a rod like morphology with a length of 100 350 nm and a diameter of 5 40 nm which is in line with the observation by wang and li 2002 fig 1b both the fe3o4 and la oh 3 were closely associated with the morphology of individual fe3o4 and la oh 3 intact fig 1c and d the eds spectra of the hybrid m la oh 3 show the presence of la fe and o which further confirms the successful association of fe3o4 and la oh 3 fig 1e this morphology is significantly different from that core shell structured fe3o4 sio2 la2o3 that was synthesized via multistep method by lai et al 2016 table s3 shows that the contents of la oh 3 in the m la oh 3 sorbents are 4 6 0 9 11 3 0 8 18 6 1 1 32 5 2 3 47 1 8 and 56 5 1 6 respectively which is close to their respective nominal value meanwhile all m la oh 3 hybrids exhibit a high crystalline structure of la oh 3 in comparison to that amorphous la oh 3 particles were generally obtained in previous studies dithmer et al 2015 reitzel et al 2013 the xrd patterns of m la oh 3 with different la oh 3 la oh 3 fe3o4 ratios are shown in fig 2 a characteristic peaks at 2θ 15 5 27 1 and 27 9 due to reflections from 100 110 and 101 planes of hexagonal la oh 3 were observed for m la oh 3 hybrids li et al 2010 the intensity of these characteristic peaks decreases gradually when lowering the content of la oh 3 in m la oh 3 hybrids in addition characteristic peaks derived from 311 and 440 planes of magnetite were also observed for the hybrid materials xing et al 2014 demonstrating the as synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids have the intact crystal structure of both la oh 3 and fe3o4 the vsm analysis shows no hysteresis loops in all m la oh 3 samples fig 2b demonstrating their superparamagnetic property that can benefit for particle sorbent separation and re dispersion for phosphate sorption and recovery fang et al 2017a b the saturation magnetization values ms of m la oh 3 are in a range of 27 6 40 3 emu g which is smaller than that of 52 4 emu g for fe3o4 increasing la oh 3 content generally leads to a lower magnetization value which is due to the dilution of the magnetization of fe3o4 by la oh 3 however the synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids still show relatively high magnetization with minimal value of 27 6 emu g that can satisfy the magnetic separation of sorbent particles during recover process moreover the synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids show a high bet surface area ranging from 98 4 to 190 1 m2 g with increasing the content of la oh 3 the surface area gradually decreases from 190 1 m2 g for m 5 la oh 3 146 6 m2 g for m 50 la oh 3 but a decline to 98 4 m2 g by further increasing the content of la oh 3 60 i e m 60 la oh 3 however the bet surface areas of all m la oh 3 are significantly higher than that i e 62 m2 g developed through multiple step coated fe3o4 sio2 la oh 3 lai et al 2016 3 2 sorption kinetics of phosphate in water the kinetic experiments were conducted to compare the rate constant of sorption kinetics of different m la oh 3 hybrids for removing phosphate at ph 7 0 results show that phosphate sorption to m la oh 3 is very rapid and can finally reach an equilibrium within 120 min for an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l and a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l fig 3 a and b the high affinity between la and p contributes for the rapid sorption fig 1 fang et al 2017a b su et al 2013 the results are depicted in fig 3a and b and the fitted parameters are listed in table 1 and table s4 our results show that both kinetic models can well describe the sorption kinetic data as high correlation coefficient r2 values of 0 938 for pseudo first order model and 0 945 for the pseudo second order model table 1 and table s4 the relatively higher r2 values obtained with pseudo second order model fig 2b indicates that the phosphate sorption to m la oh 3 is likely a process of chemisorption of phosphate by m la oh 3 hybrids which is also in an agreement with the findings of phosphate sorption to other lanthanum based sorbents and other metal hydr oxides such as zro2 reported in the literature chen et al 2016 fang et al 2015 2017 with increasing the content of la oh 3 from 10 to higher content the phosphate sorption rate constant k2 decreases from 0 0048 to a value of 0 0005 0 0007 g mg min while the sorption capacity of the m la oh 3 increases from 30 4 to 57 5 mg g at ph 7 0 table 1 this indicates that the enhanced sorption of phosphate is mainly ascribed to its sorption to la oh 3 phase 3 3 sorption isotherms of phosphate in synthetic water the phosphate sorption isotherm experiments were performed to examine maximum phosphate sorption capacity of the m la oh 3 with different la oh 3 contents the results are illustrated in fig 3c and d and the fitted parameters are listed in table 1 and table s4 our results show that the regression of phosphate sorption isotherms using the langmuir isotherm equation has relatively higher r2 values i e from 0 940 to 0 986 compared to that using the freundlich equation r2 ranges from 0 799 to 0 974 indicating a monolayer coverage of phosphate on the surface of m la oh 3 hybrids bulut et al 2008 m 50 la oh 3 and m 60 la oh 3 exhibit relatively comparable maximum phosphate sorption capacities of 52 2 and 52 9 mg p g that are notably higher than m la oh 3 with lower contents of 5 30 la oh 3 i e sorption capacity ranges from 12 3 41 1 mg p g at ph 7 0 table 1 fig 3c the maximum phosphate sorption capacity by m la oh 3 was compared to other magnetic or la based sorbents reported in the literature as shown in table 2 the maximum adsorption capacity of the m la oh 3 is among one of the most promising magnetic la based sorbents for phosphate removal from water under comparable ph conditions which is even higher than that of pure la oh 3 sorbent from 18 1 to 35 1 mg p g xie et al 2014 the high sorption can be explained from the content of la that is responsible for sorbing phosphate ions despite the use efficiency of la within the m la oh 3 is relatively lower than that zeolite la oh 3 66 mg p g xie et al 2015 the magnetic separability of the magnetic m la oh 3 allows us to efficiently recover the la element after treatment considering that the enhancement of phosphate sorption by additional coating 10 of la oh 3 in m la oh 3 i e m 60 la oh 3 in comparison to that m 50 la oh 3 is negligible m 50 la oh 3 hybrid is suggested as optimum magnetic sorbent for phosphate sorption in this study 3 4 effects of ph on phosphate sorption the effects of ph on the phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 were further studied and the results are illustrated in fig s2 a it shows that the phosphate removal extents of phosphate initial concentration 5 mg p l by m la oh 3 0 1 g l exhibit similar pattern they gradually increase when ph increases from 3 5 to 7 5 while the removal extents rapidly diminish at a higher ph value and reaches minimum removal extents of 10 20 at ph of 9 0 11 0 fig s2 at ph from 3 5 to 7 5 the fraction of bivalent hpo4 2 species gradually increases and predominates in water in addition to the presence of monovalent h2po4 species fig s3 even though the presence of hpo4 2 species favours phosphate sorption to the positively charged surface of m la oh 3 zhang et al 2014 the surface of m la oh 3 becomes less positively charged playing more significant influence on sorption of phosphate as a result of enhancing ph xu et al 2017 this finding is in line with previous studies of phosphate sorption by la based sorbents lai et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 this can lead to the fact that the efficiency of the m la oh 3 for amending sediment to sequester phosphate becomes rather poor at relatively high alkaline conditions e g ph 8 5 as a result of a high photosynthetic activity in eutrophic lakes lópez archilla et al 2004 hence it is essentially important to apply the m la oh 3 for sediment remediation prior to the occurrence of phytoplankton blooming in addition the loss kinetics of la from the m 50 la oh 3 was further investigated at three typical ph values i e 4 5 7 5 and 10 5 respectively as shown in fig s2 b less than 0 8 of la 0 27 mg l was released from the sorbent at ph 7 5 and 10 5 after 2 h of reaction time in water indicating a relatively stable physicochemical property at neutral and alkaline conditions however at ph 4 5 the loss of la gradually increased with prolonging reaction time fig s2 b and about 11 of la 3 7 mg l in solution was lost from the sorbent after reaction for 2 h it suggests that ph could be a key factor affecting the stability of la on the sorbent as also demonstrated in fig s2 c showing the loss of la increased by decreasing ph from 10 5 to 4 5 a similar trend was observed for la release from la oh 3 by xie et al 2014 despite the relatively high potential of la loss occurs especially at acidic conditions the presence of excessive p can slightly restrict the loss of la from the sorbent at acidic conditions fig s2 c this is likely due to the strong affinity of p with la xu et al 2017 however it should be noted that the application of la based sorbents at very acidic conditions e g ph 4 should be in caution since the potential of la release is relatively higher than at neutral and alkaline conditions in addition the presence of other organic ligands such as humic acid in lake may further influence the stability of la in water hence the long term stability of la in the sorbents under different conditions should be systematically investigated in future work before their practical application for the lake remediation 3 5 sorption mechanisms the chemical composition and chemical state of m 50 la oh 3 before and after the phosphate sorption at ph 7 0 were studied to further explore the surface complexation of phosphate with m la oh 3 using xps the xps survey and high resolution spectra are illustrated in fig 4 and fig s4 and the fitted peak parameters are listed in table s5 the xps p 2p spectrum at the binding energy of 134 2 ev after phosphate sorption indicates the successful phosphate loading on m 50 la oh 3 fig 4a and s4 despite it is difficult to identify the p species on m la oh 3 the p 2p peak at 134 2 ev is found between 132 3 ev and 135 2 ev for metal oxide associated hpo4 2 and h2po4 species respectively probably indicating the coexisting of both hpo4 2 and h2po4 species on m 50 la oh 3 without formation of lap precipitates yao et al 2013 notable changes of the xps o 1s spectra before and after phosphate sorption were observed fig 4b peak fitting suggests that xps o 1s spectra consist of three oxygen contributions at 530 3 o2 531 9 oh op and 533 2 ev h2o respectively fang et al 2015 huang et al 2013 the increased relative intensity at 531 9 ev from 28 9 to 58 3 and decreased intensity at 530 3 ev from 38 2 to 27 1 for m 50 la oh 3 after phosphate sorption are likely attributed to the binding of p with ola or ofe table s5 subsequently leading to the formation of inner sphere complexation laop and feop bonding fig 4b d fang et al 2015 similar xps spectra change was also observed for phosphate sorption onto iron oxide nanosheets in our previous study fang et al 2015 phosphate sorption mechanisms were further studied in terms of thermodynamics of phosphate sorption at ph 7 0 results show that the phosphate sorption capacity of m 50 la oh 3 increases slightly from 52 2 mg g to 64 5 mg p g by enhancing temperature from 25 to 45 c fig s5 table s6 indicating endothermic nature of phosphate sorption by m 50 la oh 3 that commonly occurs for the inner sphere surface complexation ruyter hooley et al 2015 3 6 phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake water in the presence of sediment particles our preliminary results indicate that m 50 la oh 3 is the optimum choice for phosphate recovery from lake due to its high capacity for phosphate sequestration and relatively less la coating in comparison to other m la oh 3 sorbents figs s6 and s7 which is in line with the findings from phosphate sorption in water table 1 hereby the magnetic m 50 la oh 3 was used to evaluate the effects of sediment particles on the performance of the m 50 la oh 3 for sequestering and recovering phosphate from lake the sampled sediment was mixed with different amounts of m 50 la oh 3 to achieve a m 50 la oh 3 mass ratio of 1 2 and 3 respectively as shown in fig 5 a pristine and m la oh 3 mixed sediment suspensions can rapidly sequester phosphate within 120 min after loading 5 mg p l of external phosphate at ph 7 3 0 2 the sorption kinetics data were fitted with the pseudo first order eq 1 and second order eq 2 equations while the results are depicted in fig 5a and the fitted parameters are listed in table s7 results show that the sorption of phosphate by sediments follows the pseudo second order kinetic model because of relatively higher r2 values of 0 980 table s7 the sorption rate constant k 2 decreases from 1 10 to 0 28 g mg min with increasing the m 50 la oh 3 content of 0 3 due to the relatively low k 2 of phosphate sorption to pure m 50 la oh 3 table 1 table s7 but the k 2 values for m 50 la oh 3 amended sediments are significant higher than those amended with other materials such as attapulgite reported by yin et al 2016 the addition of 1 3 of m 50 la oh 3 significantly enhances the capacity of the sediment suspensions for sequestering phosphate from 0 29 to 0 92 mg p g for an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l which is about 1 6 5 times higher than that for the pristine sediment 0 18 mg p g fig 5a table s7 showing a significantly enhanced capacity for phosphate sequestration after m la oh 3 amendment compared to the pristine sediment suspensions the capacities of the sediment suspension mixed with different contents of m 50 la oh 3 were examined by performing sorption isotherm experiments as shown in fig 5b and table s8 the capacity of pristine sediment suspension for sequestering phosphate is only 0 2 mg p g due to the poor sorption of phosphate by sediment particles mainly quartz and fe2o3 table s1 elzinga and sparks 2007 fang et al 2017a b the mixture of sediment suspension using m 50 la oh 3 1 3 leads to a significant enhanced capacity of sediment suspension for phosphate sequestration from 0 2 pristine sediment to 1 2 mg p g table s8 which are significantly higher than the sediments amended using other materials such as zeolite hydrous zirconia about 0 75 mg p g for 3 7 sorbent amended sediment compared to about 0 65 mg p g for pristine sediment fan et al 2017 and calcium rich attapulgite about 0 7 mg p g for 5 sorbent amended sediment compared to about 0 4 mg p g for pristine sediment at ph 7 yin et al 2016 change of ph in overlying water may occur as a result of biogeological process it is already shown in our study that the phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 is highly ph dependent fig s2 here we further investigated the effects of ph on the phosphate sequestration by pristine and m 50 la oh 3 amended sediments fig 6 shows that only 15 20 of external phosphate 5 mg p l can be sequestered by pristine sediment at a generally environmental ph range from 4 to 8 5 xu et al 2017 whereas additional internal phosphate releases from sediment at ph 9 0 this was also observed in a study conducted by yin et al 2016 the addition of m 50 la oh 3 from a mass ratio of up to 3 can notably sequester about 70 90 of externally introduced phosphate i e 5 mg p l within ph range of 4 8 5 even though the sequestration extent of phosphate by 3 w w of m 50 la oh 3 amended sediments drops to about 25 at ph 10 2 fig 6 different from sequestering p from water phase the direct contact of sediment particles with m la oh 3 may affect its performance to sequester p zielińska and oleszczuk 2016 assuming that there is no attenuation effect the theoretic capacity of the phosphate sequestration by m 50 la oh 3 amended sediment can be calculated using following equation eq 5 5 c t o t a l c a l f m l a c m l a f s e d c s e d where f m la and f sed represent the fractions of m la oh 3 hybrid and sediment in mixture respectively c m la mg p g m la and c sed mg p g sed are sequestered phosphate by m 50 la oh 3 and sediment phase respectively which can be obtained according to table 1 and s7 c total cal mg p g is theoretically calculated total sequestered phosphate by m 50 la oh 3 amended sediment fig 7 a shows that the experimentally obtained c total values for the m 50 la oh 3 amended sediment are significantly lower than the theoretically calculated values using eq 5 demonstrating a notable attenuation 34 3 44 7 of decrease effects of sediment particles on performance of the m 50 la oh 3 to sequester phosphate in lake since the lake sediment accounts for more than 97 of total mass in our system the attenuation effects of m 50 la oh 3 on the phosphate sequestration by sediment can be ignored hereby the actual capacity of the m 50 la oh 3 for sequestering phosphate can be further estimated and the results are illustrated in fig 7b it shows that the capacity of phosphate sequestration by the m 50 la oh 3 phase is 22 0 32 7 and 34 4 mg p g when the content of the m 50 la oh 3 in sediment is 1 2 and 3 respectively which is much lower than that of the m 50 la oh 3 in water without the interference of sediment particles 52 7 mg p g table 1 previous studies have already demonstrated the negligible influence of background anions such as carbonate sulfate and organic matters on the sorption of phosphate by la oh 3 fang et al 2017a and our results shows that the contribution of fe3o4 to the overall phosphate sorption by the m la oh 3 is minor fig s8 our evidence herein confirms the strong attenuation effect of sediment particles on the efficiency of the m 50 la oh 3 in phosphate sequestration as also reported in biochar amended soil for sequestering organic pollutants zielińska and oleszczuk 2016 nevertheless the high dose content of m 50 la oh 3 in sediment e g 2 3 can relatively compensate such attenuation effect as shown in fig 7 superparamagnetic property of m la oh 3 allows an effective sorbent particle and finally phosphate recovery from lake fang et al 2017a b funes et al 2016 fig 8 a shows that about 71 3 76 8 of dosed m 50 la oh 3 can be recovered from sediment suspensions indicating the potential feasibility of retrieving magnetic sorbents from lake after lake restoration however further effort to gain knowledge on the recoverability of magnetic sorbents from sediment in field trials is still needed in future work the further desorption of phosphate using 0 01 1 m naoh can achieve a recovery ratio of up to 78 1 fig 8b the poor desorption of phosphate from m la oh 3 using low concentration of naoh e g 0 01 m has also been observed in previous studies lai et al 2016 which is likely due to the strong inner sphere complexation of p with ola xu et al 2017 3 7 change of sedimentary p fractions and environmental implications phosphorus fractionation experiments were performed to gain knowledge of the dynamic change of phosphate fractions in pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediments before and after introducing external phosphate as well as after recovery of magnetic m la oh 3 from sediment at about ph 7 3 fig 9 a shows the tp fraction in pristine sediment slightly increases from 156 4 to 188 6 mg p kg after 120 min sorption with external phosphate the faintly enhanced tp fraction is likely attributed to the enhanced fraction of naoh p that is due to the limited sorption of phosphate by metal hydr oxides e g fe and al within the sediment table s1 elzinga and sparks 2007 by applying 3 m 50 la oh 3 in sediment the tp fraction in the amended sediment increases from 156 4 to 854 4 mg p kg after 120 min fig 9b the similar patterns were also observed for ip and naoh p fractions fig 9b which is likely attributed to the strong sorption capability of m 50 la oh 3 fig 5 after the extraction of the phosphate sorbed m 50 la oh 3 from sediment via magnetic separation the fractions of tp ip and naoh p decline fig 9b in comparison to non magnetic la based sorbents douglas et al 1999 lesnichaya et al 2009 xie et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2014 the magnetic m la oh 3 not only shows a strong capacity of sequestering phosphate in water sediment but also allows us to recover the non renewable la and p resources the m la oh 3 can also remain highly effective performance in sediment suspensions within a relatively broad environmentally relevant ph range fig 6 showing that the magnetic m la oh 3 is useful for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake however additional effort in relation to the performance of the m la oh 3 in field scale under different environmental conditions e g ph and redox state during long term exposure is still needed though our results indicate that the change of redox state shows the insignificant effect on the phosphate removal by the m la oh 3 after 24 h reaction time fig s8 in addition the ecological effects of the residual m la oh 3 in sediments should be carefully addressed in future work 4 conclusions in this study magnetite lanthanum hydroxide m la oh 3 hybrids were developed through a simple one pot precipitation and hydrothermal process for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake our results show that m la oh 3 exhibits a strong sorption towards phosphate at ph 7 in synthetic water with a sorption capacity of up to 52 7 mg p g the strong phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 is likely governed by the formation of inner sphere surface complexation of p with lao and feo in spite of the strong attenuation effects of sediment particles on the performance of m la oh 3 sediment suspension mixed with m la oh 3 exhibits a significantly enhanced capability for sequestering phosphate compared to the pristine sediment suspension owing to its effectively magnetic separability over 71 3 of m la oh 3 can be recovered from sediment suspensions after phosphate sorption and consequently allowing la and phosphate recovery from water the application of m la oh 3 for lake restoration does not affect other phosphorus fractions but enhances the fractions of ip and naoh p that are mainly attributed to the binding of phosphate with m la oh

19814,an effective approach for eutrophication control and phosphate recovery remains a longstanding challenge herein we present a new technique for phosphate sequestration in lake and phosphate recovery using novel magnetically recoverable magnetite lanthanum hydroxide m la oh 3 hybrids that can be prepared using a simple one pot synthesis method batch studies show that m la oh 3 exhibits a strong sorption towards phosphate with sorption capacities of up to 52 7 mg p g at ph 7 0 in water a simple model indicates that the efficiency of m la oh 3 for phosphate sequestration in lake is significantly attenuated by 34 45 compared to that in water due to interference from sediment particles however our results demonstrate that sediments suspensions mixed with a m la oh 3 content of 1 3 exhibit a capability of up to 1 2 mg p g for sequestering external phosphate compared with that of 0 2 mg p g for pristine sediment at ph 7 3 m la oh 3 mixed sediment suspensions appear to effectively sequester phosphate over an environmentally relevant ph range from 4 to 8 5 phosphorus p fractionation experiments indicate that the enhanced phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 mixed sediment suspensions is mainly due to the increased fractions of naoh p and inorganic p this work indicates that the m la oh 3 has the potential for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic separation lanthanum hydroxide eutrophication control lake restoration phosphorus fractionation 1 introduction about 30 50 of global water sources are facing the problem of eutrophication as a consequence of excessive dissolved phosphorus p in freshwaters funes et al 2016 liu et al 2016 to counteract the occurrence of eutrophication the successful reduction of dissolved p mainly as the form of phosphate in freshwater highly depends on both of controlling internal p release from sediments and limiting introduction of external p inputs ye et al 2017 despite the great progress in limiting p inputs from point contaminant sources of p particularly wastewater discharges fang et al 2017a b the control of non point p sources such as agricultural runoffs is still problematic as a result the external p inputs into freshwaters from these sources still occur in addition the capacity of lake sediments to reduce the continuously introduced p is limited and can be affected by redox conditions sondergaard et al 2003 several techniques such as sediment dredging sediment oxygenation sediment capping with metal salts e g aluminum al and calcium ca have been adopted to sequester immobilize phosphate in sediment of which the control of p release using chemical salts or materials receives increasing attention due to its high efficiency and energy effectiveness funes et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 the addition of al or fe has been widely applied for p sequestration in lake restoration through effectively precipitating phosphate in sediment deppe and benndorf 2002 funes et al 2016 yamada et al 2012 although these materials can effectively reduce dissolved p from freshwater the capped p in lake sediment may be re released into overlying water phase due to the aging of materials and variations of environmental conditions such as ph and redox potential deppe and benndorf 2002 egemose et al 2009 owing to the strong affinity of lanthanum la with phosphate la based bentonite i e phoslock was first invented for phosphate removal copetti et al 2016 douglas et al 1999 2016 haghseresht et al 2009 robb et al 2003 and later a number of la based materials such as la modified alumina and zeolite lanthanum hydroxide have been developed for effectively sequestering p in sediments with a promising p sorption capacity of up to 108 mg g lesnichaya et al 2009 xie et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 it shows that la can be stably present in sediments with a negligible effect on aquatic organisms copetti et al 2016 balusamy et al 2015 despite the advantage of la for phosphate removal the extensive application of no recyclable la based materials leads to the high chemical consumption of non renewable and expensive la resource a potentially feasible solution is to magnetize the nanoparticles through hybridizing with biocompatible fe3o4 nanoparticles so that they can be separated recovered and reused and this technique has recently been extensively applied for developing magnetic sorbents and catalysts funes et al 2016 2017 fang et al 2017a b lai et al 2016 wang et al 2016 motivated by this concept p recovery from lake sediment and overlying water using a la based magnetic material appears an alternative solution for tackling p resource depletion restoring eutrophic lake and avoiding high consumption of la resource however there is limited knowledge in this regard that can be found in the literature a very recent work reported a core shell fe3o4 sio2 la oh 3 magnetic sorbents for phosphate removal from wastewater lai et al 2016 however their method is relatively tedious and complicated thus a more facile synthesis method that can produce more effective la based magnetic sorbents is needed moreover most studies have been focusing on p removal or recovery from wastewater the application of such technique for p sequestration and recovery from lake has been rarely studied in particular the effects of sediment particles on the performance of the magnetic la sorbents for p removal from lake during resuspension sedimentation process at the water sediment interface remain unclear thus this work is devoted to developing a facile one step hydrothermal method to synthesize magnetite lanthanum hydroxide magnetic hybrids m la oh 3 for p recovery from lake the m la oh 3 magnetic sorbents were prepared and systematically characterized by x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem and vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the sorption performance of m la oh 3 for phosphate sorption from aqueous solution was first investigated in terms of sorption kinetics and capacity and the effects of ph hereafter the efficiency of m la oh 3 for phosphate recovery from sediment suspension and the effects of sediment particles on the performance of the magnetic sorbents was systematically assessed finally the p fraction in pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediment before and after loading external phosphate as well as after m la oh 3 extraction were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagents of

hydrothermal method was adopted for the preparation of m la oh 3 based on the nominal mass ratio of la oh 3 the synthesized sorbents were designated as m 5 la oh 3 m 10 la oh 3 m 20 la oh 3 m 30 la oh 3 m 50 la oh 3 and m 60 la oh 3 the actual contents of la in the m la oh 3 were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms optima 5300 dv perkin elmer detailed description of synthesis method and determination of la contents are given in text s1 of supplementary material the crystalline structure of the synthesized sorbents was characterized using a bruker d8 focus x ray diffractometer by applying monochromated cukα radiation λ 0 15418 nm in the range of 20 80 º2θ the morphology particle size and elemental composition of the sorbents were analyzed by a jeol 2100f tem equipped energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds operating at 200 kv the magnetic property of the samples was measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm ppms 9t quantum design usa the brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas of the synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids were determined through n2 adsorption desorption over a micromeritics asap 2010 system at 77 k 2 3 phosphate sorption in synthetic water both sorption kinetic and isotherm experiments were first performed in 50 ml polypropylene pp plastic tubes to study and compare the removal efficiency of phosphate by the synthesized m la oh 3 with different la oh 3 ratios at ph 7 0 0 1 a preliminary experiment showed that the adsorption of phosphate to the plastic tube is negligible the sorption kinetics study was carried out by spiking an appropriate amount of phosphate stock solution into each 40 ml m la oh 3 suspension 0 1 g l to achieve an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l the ph of the suspensions was maintained at ph 7 0 0 1 and the ionic strength was controlled with 0 01 m nacl at each reaction time sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm mixed cellulose membrane filter and the filtrate was stored for further analysis the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted with the same ionic strength of 0 01 m nacl as above at ph 7 0 0 1 appropriate amounts of phosphate stock solution were spiked into 0 1 g l of m la oh 3 stock solution to obtain varying initial phosphate concentrations of 1 10 mg p l the sample tubes were then shaken in a mechanical shaker at 25 1 c at 300 rpm for desired time depending on different experiments i e up to 3 h for kinetic experiments and 2 h for sorption isotherm experiments the effect of ph on the phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 sorbents was also investigated with a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l and an initial p concentration of 5 mg p l at 25 1 c in a ph range of 3 11 by adjusting ph with naoh or hcl thermodynamics of phosphate sorption by the m la oh 3 was investigated with a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l and an initial p concentration of 5 mg p l at ph 7 0 0 1 at 25 35 and 45 c respectively the effect of redox state on the phosphate sorption capacity of the m la oh 3 was further investigated with a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l and an initial p concentration of 5 9 mg p l at ph 7 0 0 1 by comparing the phosphate sorption without controlling o2 with that under anoxic conditions in a lab2000 anaerobic glovebox o2 1 ppm etelux instrument after reaction all samples were collected after filtering suspensions through 0 22 μm cellulose membrane filters and then analyzed using the method given in section 2 5 in addition the loss of la from the m 50 la oh 3 as a function of time and ph was investigated with a m 50 la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l with and without the addition of p 5 mg p l after reaction certain time the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose membrane filters and the filtrates were then analyzed using the method described in section 2 5 all sorption experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 phosphate sequestration and recovery in the presence of sediment particles lake sediment and overlying water samples were collected from east lake located in the largest city wuhan of the central china n30º32 44 45 e114º21 54 01 fig s1 the geological location and detailed description of east lake are given in text s2 of supplementary material this lake is considered as the largest urban lake in china which is a typical urban shallow lake with a water area of 33 7 km2 and an average depth of 2 8 m yun et al 2014 the lake receives about 27 104 m3 a of municipal wastewater from the city and the water is also suffering from eutrophication showing a poor water quality of grade iv according to the chinese environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 prior to phosphate sequestration and recovery experiments the phosphate contents in sediment and overlying water were determined using the method described in section 2 5 and the chemical composition of sediment the content of phosphate as tp fraction and the water quality of overlying water were determined and are listed in table s1 and s2 the sampled sediment was air dried passed through a 100 mesh sieve homogenized and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to further use before phosphate sequestration experiments in sediments 0 2 g sediment was added into 40 ml sampled water and spiked with proper amounts of m 50 la oh 3 sorbent to achieve a content from 1 to 3 w w for the m la oh 3 in sediment i e the content of m 50 la oh 3 ranged from 0 05 to 0 15 g l in suspensions to investigate the effects of different dosage of sorbent on phosphate sequestration and recovery the mass ratios of the m la oh 3 to sediment were set at 0 1 2 and 3 to evaluate the effects of mixing sediment particles on the performance of the m la oh 3 both sorption kinetic and isotherm experiments were undertaken in 50 ml pp plastic tubes to investigate the rate constant of sorption and sorption capacity of m la oh 3 amended sediment to sequester phosphate in comparison to that of pristine sediment for sorption kinetic experiments proper amounts of phosphate stock solution was added into 40 ml the prepared pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediment suspensions to achieve an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l to simulate the rate constant of the pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediments to sequester phosphate from external sources respectively for sorption isotherm experiments different amounts of phosphate stock solution were added into the pristine or m la oh 3 amended sediments to achieve initial phosphate concentrations of up to 10 mg p l to study their capacity of sequestering external phosphate the ph value of suspension solutions was not intentionally controlled and found at around 7 3 0 2 throughout the whole period of sorption experiments because of high buffering capability of sediment the sample tubes were shaken in a mechanical shaker at 25 1 c at 300 rpm for desired time depending on different experiments i e 0 2 h for kinetic experiments and 2 h for sorption isotherm experiments after sorption experiments both water and sediment samples were taken at desired time for further analysis using the method described in section 2 5 all experiments were performed in triplicate for phosphate recovery experiments m la oh 3 sorbent particles were first recovered from the suspensions after phosphate sorption in brief a handheld bar ndfeb magnet was pre wrapped with plastic film to avoid directly contact of the magnet with the particles and then dipped into the suspensions to collect the magnetic m la oh 3 particles after the collection the particles the bar magnet was removed and the magnetic particles on the film was washed into a certain volume of water the recovery experiments of m la oh 3 particles were performed for the samples with different mass ratios of m la oh 3 to sediment ranging from 1 to 3 the contents of magnetic particles in solutions were determined by dissolving the recovered magnetic particles in 1 m hcl and analyzing the content of la in solutions phosphate desorption experiments were then carried out by reacting the recovered m la oh 3 sorbent particles in naoh solutions with a concentration from 0 1 to 1 m on a shaker at 300 rpm for 2 h and the concentrations of phosphate in supernatants were determined to calculate the recovery rate of phosphate the kinetic data were fitted with pseudo first eq 1 and second eq 2 order equations 1 d q e d t k 1 q e t q t 2 d q e d t k 2 q

microscopic images of fe3o4 pure la oh 3 and m la oh 3 hybrids are depicted in fig 1 the particles size of fe3o4 is 10 nm fig 1a which is more than half the size of fe3o4 obtained by lai et al via co precipitation method lai et al 2016 lanthanum hydroxide has a rod like morphology with a length of 100 350 nm and a diameter of 5 40 nm which is in line with the observation by wang and li 2002 fig 1b both the fe3o4 and la oh 3 were closely associated with the morphology of individual fe3o4 and la oh 3 intact fig 1c and d the eds spectra of the hybrid m la oh 3 show the presence of la fe and o which further confirms the successful association of fe3o4 and la oh 3 fig 1e this morphology is significantly different from that core shell structured fe3o4 sio2 la2o3 that was synthesized via multistep method by lai et al 2016 table s3 shows that the contents of la oh 3 in the m la oh 3 sorbents are 4 6 0 9 11 3 0 8 18 6 1 1 32 5 2 3 47 1 8 and 56 5 1 6 respectively which is close to their respective nominal value meanwhile all m la oh 3 hybrids exhibit a high crystalline structure of la oh 3 in comparison to that amorphous la oh 3 particles were generally obtained in previous studies dithmer et al 2015 reitzel et al 2013 the xrd patterns of m la oh 3 with different la oh 3 la oh 3 fe3o4 ratios are shown in fig 2 a characteristic peaks at 2θ 15 5 27 1 and 27 9 due to reflections from 100 110 and 101 planes of hexagonal la oh 3 were observed for m la oh 3 hybrids li et al 2010 the intensity of these characteristic peaks decreases gradually when lowering the content of la oh 3 in m la oh 3 hybrids in addition characteristic peaks derived from 311 and 440 planes of magnetite were also observed for the hybrid materials xing et al 2014 demonstrating the as synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids have the intact crystal structure of both la oh 3 and fe3o4 the vsm analysis shows no hysteresis loops in all m la oh 3 samples fig 2b demonstrating their superparamagnetic property that can benefit for particle sorbent separation and re dispersion for phosphate sorption and recovery fang et al 2017a b the saturation magnetization values ms of m la oh 3 are in a range of 27 6 40 3 emu g which is smaller than that of 52 4 emu g for fe3o4 increasing la oh 3 content generally leads to a lower magnetization value which is due to the dilution of the magnetization of fe3o4 by la oh 3 however the synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids still show relatively high magnetization with minimal value of 27 6 emu g that can satisfy the magnetic separation of sorbent particles during recover process moreover the synthesized m la oh 3 hybrids show a high bet surface area ranging from 98 4 to 190 1 m2 g with increasing the content of la oh 3 the surface area gradually decreases from 190 1 m2 g for m 5 la oh 3 146 6 m2 g for m 50 la oh 3 but a decline to 98 4 m2 g by further increasing the content of la oh 3 60 i e m 60 la oh 3 however the bet surface areas of all m la oh 3 are significantly higher than that i e 62 m2 g developed through multiple step coated fe3o4 sio2 la oh 3 lai et al 2016 3 2 sorption kinetics of phosphate in water the kinetic experiments were conducted to compare the rate constant of sorption kinetics of different m la oh 3 hybrids for removing phosphate at ph 7 0 results show that phosphate sorption to m la oh 3 is very rapid and can finally reach an equilibrium within 120 min for an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l and a m la oh 3 dosage of 0 1 g l fig 3 a and b the high affinity between la and p contributes for the rapid sorption fig 1 fang et al 2017a b su et al 2013 the results are depicted in fig 3a and b and the fitted parameters are listed in table 1 and table s4 our results show that both kinetic models can well describe the sorption kinetic data as high correlation coefficient r2 values of 0 938 for pseudo first order model and 0 945 for the pseudo second order model table 1 and table s4 the relatively higher r2 values obtained with pseudo second order model fig 2b indicates that the phosphate sorption to m la oh 3 is likely a process of chemisorption of phosphate by m la oh 3 hybrids which is also in an agreement with the findings of phosphate sorption to other lanthanum based sorbents and other metal hydr oxides such as zro2 reported in the literature chen et al 2016 fang et al 2015 2017 with increasing the content of la oh 3 from 10 to higher content the phosphate sorption rate constant k2 decreases from 0 0048 to a value of 0 0005 0 0007 g mg min while the sorption capacity of the m la oh 3 increases from 30 4 to 57 5 mg g at ph 7 0 table 1 this indicates that the enhanced sorption of phosphate is mainly ascribed to its sorption to la oh 3 phase 3 3 sorption isotherms of phosphate in synthetic water the phosphate sorption isotherm experiments were performed to examine maximum phosphate sorption capacity of the m la oh 3 with different la oh 3 contents the results are illustrated in fig 3c and d and the fitted parameters are listed in table 1 and table s4 our results show that the regression of phosphate sorption isotherms using the langmuir isotherm equation has relatively higher r2 values i e from 0 940 to 0 986 compared to that using the freundlich equation r2 ranges from 0 799 to 0 974 indicating a monolayer coverage of phosphate on the surface of m la oh 3 hybrids bulut et al 2008 m 50 la oh 3 and m 60 la oh 3 exhibit relatively comparable maximum phosphate sorption capacities of 52 2 and 52 9 mg p g that are notably higher than m la oh 3 with lower contents of 5 30 la oh 3 i e sorption capacity ranges from 12 3 41 1 mg p g at ph 7 0 table 1 fig 3c the maximum phosphate sorption capacity by m la oh 3 was compared to other magnetic or la based sorbents reported in the literature as shown in table 2 the maximum adsorption capacity of the m la oh 3 is among one of the most promising magnetic la based sorbents for phosphate removal from water under comparable ph conditions which is even higher than that of pure la oh 3 sorbent from 18 1 to 35 1 mg p g xie et al 2014 the high sorption can be explained from the content of la that is responsible for sorbing phosphate ions despite the use efficiency of la within the m la oh 3 is relatively lower than that zeolite la oh 3 66 mg p g xie et al 2015 the magnetic separability of the magnetic m la oh 3 allows us to efficiently recover the la element after treatment considering that the enhancement of phosphate sorption by additional coating 10 of la oh 3 in m la oh 3 i e m 60 la oh 3 in comparison to that m 50 la oh 3 is negligible m 50 la oh 3 hybrid is suggested as optimum magnetic sorbent for phosphate sorption in this study 3 4 effects of ph on phosphate sorption the effects of ph on the phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 were further studied and the results are illustrated in fig s2 a it shows that the phosphate removal extents of phosphate initial concentration 5 mg p l by m la oh 3 0 1 g l exhibit similar pattern they gradually increase when ph increases from 3 5 to 7 5 while the removal extents rapidly diminish at a higher ph value and reaches minimum removal extents of 10 20 at ph of 9 0 11 0 fig s2 at ph from 3 5 to 7 5 the fraction of bivalent hpo4 2 species gradually increases and predominates in water in addition to the presence of monovalent h2po4 species fig s3 even though the presence of hpo4 2 species favours phosphate sorption to the positively charged surface of m la oh 3 zhang et al 2014 the surface of m la oh 3 becomes less positively charged playing more significant influence on sorption of phosphate as a result of enhancing ph xu et al 2017 this finding is in line with previous studies of phosphate sorption by la based sorbents lai et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 this can lead to the fact that the efficiency of the m la oh 3 for amending sediment to sequester phosphate becomes rather poor at relatively high alkaline conditions e g ph 8 5 as a result of a high photosynthetic activity in eutrophic lakes lópez archilla et al 2004 hence it is essentially important to apply the m la oh 3 for sediment remediation prior to the occurrence of phytoplankton blooming in addition the loss kinetics of la from the m 50 la oh 3 was further investigated at three typical ph values i e 4 5 7 5 and 10 5 respectively as shown in fig s2 b less than 0 8 of la 0 27 mg l was released from the sorbent at ph 7 5 and 10 5 after 2 h of reaction time in water indicating a relatively stable physicochemical property at neutral and alkaline conditions however at ph 4 5 the loss of la gradually increased with prolonging reaction time fig s2 b and about 11 of la 3 7 mg l in solution was lost from the sorbent after reaction for 2 h it suggests that ph could be a key factor affecting the stability of la on the sorbent as also demonstrated in fig s2 c showing the loss of la increased by decreasing ph from 10 5 to 4 5 a similar trend was observed for la release from la oh 3 by xie et al 2014 despite the relatively high potential of la loss occurs especially at acidic conditions the presence of excessive p can slightly restrict the loss of la from the sorbent at acidic conditions fig s2 c this is likely due to the strong affinity of p with la xu et al 2017 however it should be noted that the application of la based sorbents at very acidic conditions e g ph 4 should be in caution since the potential of la release is relatively higher than at neutral and alkaline conditions in addition the presence of other organic ligands such as humic acid in lake may further influence the stability of la in water hence the long term stability of la in the sorbents under different conditions should be systematically investigated in future work before their practical application for the lake remediation 3 5 sorption mechanisms the chemical composition and chemical state of m 50 la oh 3 before and after the phosphate sorption at ph 7 0 were studied to further explore the surface complexation of phosphate with m la oh 3 using xps the xps survey and high resolution spectra are illustrated in fig 4 and fig s4 and the fitted peak parameters are listed in table s5 the xps p 2p spectrum at the binding energy of 134 2 ev after phosphate sorption indicates the successful phosphate loading on m 50 la oh 3 fig 4a and s4 despite it is difficult to identify the p species on m la oh 3 the p 2p peak at 134 2 ev is found between 132 3 ev and 135 2 ev for metal oxide associated hpo4 2 and h2po4 species respectively probably indicating the coexisting of both hpo4 2 and h2po4 species on m 50 la oh 3 without formation of lap precipitates yao et al 2013 notable changes of the xps o 1s spectra before and after phosphate sorption were observed fig 4b peak fitting suggests that xps o 1s spectra consist of three oxygen contributions at 530 3 o2 531 9 oh op and 533 2 ev h2o respectively fang et al 2015 huang et al 2013 the increased relative intensity at 531 9 ev from 28 9 to 58 3 and decreased intensity at 530 3 ev from 38 2 to 27 1 for m 50 la oh 3 after phosphate sorption are likely attributed to the binding of p with ola or ofe table s5 subsequently leading to the formation of inner sphere complexation laop and feop bonding fig 4b d fang et al 2015 similar xps spectra change was also observed for phosphate sorption onto iron oxide nanosheets in our previous study fang et al 2015 phosphate sorption mechanisms were further studied in terms of thermodynamics of phosphate sorption at ph 7 0 results show that the phosphate sorption capacity of m 50 la oh 3 increases slightly from 52 2 mg g to 64 5 mg p g by enhancing temperature from 25 to 45 c fig s5 table s6 indicating endothermic nature of phosphate sorption by m 50 la oh 3 that commonly occurs for the inner sphere surface complexation ruyter hooley et al 2015 3 6 phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake water in the presence of sediment particles our preliminary results indicate that m 50 la oh 3 is the optimum choice for phosphate recovery from lake due to its high capacity for phosphate sequestration and relatively less la coating in comparison to other m la oh 3 sorbents figs s6 and s7 which is in line with the findings from phosphate sorption in water table 1 hereby the magnetic m 50 la oh 3 was used to evaluate the effects of sediment particles on the performance of the m 50 la oh 3 for sequestering and recovering phosphate from lake the sampled sediment was mixed with different amounts of m 50 la oh 3 to achieve a m 50 la oh 3 mass ratio of 1 2 and 3 respectively as shown in fig 5 a pristine and m la oh 3 mixed sediment suspensions can rapidly sequester phosphate within 120 min after loading 5 mg p l of external phosphate at ph 7 3 0 2 the sorption kinetics data were fitted with the pseudo first order eq 1 and second order eq 2 equations while the results are depicted in fig 5a and the fitted parameters are listed in table s7 results show that the sorption of phosphate by sediments follows the pseudo second order kinetic model because of relatively higher r2 values of 0 980 table s7 the sorption rate constant k 2 decreases from 1 10 to 0 28 g mg min with increasing the m 50 la oh 3 content of 0 3 due to the relatively low k 2 of phosphate sorption to pure m 50 la oh 3 table 1 table s7 but the k 2 values for m 50 la oh 3 amended sediments are significant higher than those amended with other materials such as attapulgite reported by yin et al 2016 the addition of 1 3 of m 50 la oh 3 significantly enhances the capacity of the sediment suspensions for sequestering phosphate from 0 29 to 0 92 mg p g for an initial phosphate concentration of 5 mg p l which is about 1 6 5 times higher than that for the pristine sediment 0 18 mg p g fig 5a table s7 showing a significantly enhanced capacity for phosphate sequestration after m la oh 3 amendment compared to the pristine sediment suspensions the capacities of the sediment suspension mixed with different contents of m 50 la oh 3 were examined by performing sorption isotherm experiments as shown in fig 5b and table s8 the capacity of pristine sediment suspension for sequestering phosphate is only 0 2 mg p g due to the poor sorption of phosphate by sediment particles mainly quartz and fe2o3 table s1 elzinga and sparks 2007 fang et al 2017a b the mixture of sediment suspension using m 50 la oh 3 1 3 leads to a significant enhanced capacity of sediment suspension for phosphate sequestration from 0 2 pristine sediment to 1 2 mg p g table s8 which are significantly higher than the sediments amended using other materials such as zeolite hydrous zirconia about 0 75 mg p g for 3 7 sorbent amended sediment compared to about 0 65 mg p g for pristine sediment fan et al 2017 and calcium rich attapulgite about 0 7 mg p g for 5 sorbent amended sediment compared to about 0 4 mg p g for pristine sediment at ph 7 yin et al 2016 change of ph in overlying water may occur as a result of biogeological process it is already shown in our study that the phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 is highly ph dependent fig s2 here we further investigated the effects of ph on the phosphate sequestration by pristine and m 50 la oh 3 amended sediments fig 6 shows that only 15 20 of external phosphate 5 mg p l can be sequestered by pristine sediment at a generally environmental ph range from 4 to 8 5 xu et al 2017 whereas additional internal phosphate releases from sediment at ph 9 0 this was also observed in a study conducted by yin et al 2016 the addition of m 50 la oh 3 from a mass ratio of up to 3 can notably sequester about 70 90 of externally introduced phosphate i e 5 mg p l within ph range of 4 8 5 even though the sequestration extent of phosphate by 3 w w of m 50 la oh 3 amended sediments drops to about 25 at ph 10 2 fig 6 different from sequestering p from water phase the direct contact of sediment particles with m la oh 3 may affect its performance to sequester p zielińska and oleszczuk 2016 assuming that there is no attenuation effect the theoretic capacity of the phosphate sequestration by m 50 la oh 3 amended sediment can be calculated using following equation eq 5 5 c t o t a l c a l f m l a c m l a f s e d c s e d where f m la and f sed represent the fractions of m la oh 3 hybrid and sediment in mixture respectively c m la mg p g m la and c sed mg p g sed are sequestered phosphate by m 50 la oh 3 and sediment phase respectively which can be obtained according to table 1 and s7 c total cal mg p g is theoretically calculated total sequestered phosphate by m 50 la oh 3 amended sediment fig 7 a shows that the experimentally obtained c total values for the m 50 la oh 3 amended sediment are significantly lower than the theoretically calculated values using eq 5 demonstrating a notable attenuation 34 3 44 7 of decrease effects of sediment particles on performance of the m 50 la oh 3 to sequester phosphate in lake since the lake sediment accounts for more than 97 of total mass in our system the attenuation effects of m 50 la oh 3 on the phosphate sequestration by sediment can be ignored hereby the actual capacity of the m 50 la oh 3 for sequestering phosphate can be further estimated and the results are illustrated in fig 7b it shows that the capacity of phosphate sequestration by the m 50 la oh 3 phase is 22 0 32 7 and 34 4 mg p g when the content of the m 50 la oh 3 in sediment is 1 2 and 3 respectively which is much lower than that of the m 50 la oh 3 in water without the interference of sediment particles 52 7 mg p g table 1 previous studies have already demonstrated the negligible influence of background anions such as carbonate sulfate and organic matters on the sorption of phosphate by la oh 3 fang et al 2017a and our results shows that the contribution of fe3o4 to the overall phosphate sorption by the m la oh 3 is minor fig s8 our evidence herein confirms the strong attenuation effect of sediment particles on the efficiency of the m 50 la oh 3 in phosphate sequestration as also reported in biochar amended soil for sequestering organic pollutants zielińska and oleszczuk 2016 nevertheless the high dose content of m 50 la oh 3 in sediment e g 2 3 can relatively compensate such attenuation effect as shown in fig 7 superparamagnetic property of m la oh 3 allows an effective sorbent particle and finally phosphate recovery from lake fang et al 2017a b funes et al 2016 fig 8 a shows that about 71 3 76 8 of dosed m 50 la oh 3 can be recovered from sediment suspensions indicating the potential feasibility of retrieving magnetic sorbents from lake after lake restoration however further effort to gain knowledge on the recoverability of magnetic sorbents from sediment in field trials is still needed in future work the further desorption of phosphate using 0 01 1 m naoh can achieve a recovery ratio of up to 78 1 fig 8b the poor desorption of phosphate from m la oh 3 using low concentration of naoh e g 0 01 m has also been observed in previous studies lai et al 2016 which is likely due to the strong inner sphere complexation of p with ola xu et al 2017 3 7 change of sedimentary p fractions and environmental implications phosphorus fractionation experiments were performed to gain knowledge of the dynamic change of phosphate fractions in pristine and m la oh 3 amended sediments before and after introducing external phosphate as well as after recovery of magnetic m la oh 3 from sediment at about ph 7 3 fig 9 a shows the tp fraction in pristine sediment slightly increases from 156 4 to 188 6 mg p kg after 120 min sorption with external phosphate the faintly enhanced tp fraction is likely attributed to the enhanced fraction of naoh p that is due to the limited sorption of phosphate by metal hydr oxides e g fe and al within the sediment table s1 elzinga and sparks 2007 by applying 3 m 50 la oh 3 in sediment the tp fraction in the amended sediment increases from 156 4 to 854 4 mg p kg after 120 min fig 9b the similar patterns were also observed for ip and naoh p fractions fig 9b which is likely attributed to the strong sorption capability of m 50 la oh 3 fig 5 after the extraction of the phosphate sorbed m 50 la oh 3 from sediment via magnetic separation the fractions of tp ip and naoh p decline fig 9b in comparison to non magnetic la based sorbents douglas et al 1999 lesnichaya et al 2009 xie et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2014 the magnetic m la oh 3 not only shows a strong capacity of sequestering phosphate in water sediment but also allows us to recover the non renewable la and p resources the m la oh 3 can also remain highly effective performance in sediment suspensions within a relatively broad environmentally relevant ph range fig 6 showing that the magnetic m la oh 3 is useful for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake however additional effort in relation to the performance of the m la oh 3 in field scale under different environmental conditions e g ph and redox state during long term exposure is still needed though our results indicate that the change of redox state shows the insignificant effect on the phosphate removal by the m la oh 3 after 24 h reaction time fig s8 in addition the ecological effects of the residual m la oh 3 in sediments should be carefully addressed in future work 4 conclusions in this study magnetite lanthanum hydroxide m la oh 3 hybrids were developed through a simple one pot precipitation and hydrothermal process for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake our results show that m la oh 3 exhibits a strong sorption towards phosphate at ph 7 in synthetic water with a sorption capacity of up to 52 7 mg p g the strong phosphate sorption by m la oh 3 is likely governed by the formation of inner sphere surface complexation of p with lao and feo in spite of the strong attenuation effects of sediment particles on the performance of m la oh 3 sediment suspension mixed with m la oh 3 exhibits a significantly enhanced capability for sequestering phosphate compared to the pristine sediment suspension owing to its effectively magnetic separability over 71 3 of m la oh 3 can be recovered from sediment suspensions after phosphate sorption and consequently allowing la and phosphate recovery from water the application of m la oh 3 for lake restoration does not affect other phosphorus fractions but enhances the fractions of ip and naoh p that are mainly attributed to the binding of phosphate with m la oh
