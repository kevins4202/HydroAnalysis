1390,deep eutectic solvents dess have achieved the rising attention of the scientific community because of their distinctive physicochemical properties and variety of applications herein des composed of choline chloride as hydrogen bond acceptor hba and glycolic acid as hydrogen bond donor hbd was synthesized next the prepared des was examined as a functionalization agent for rice husk ash rha to form a novel adsorbent des rha to ensure the formation of des and to recognize the modifications occurred due to the functionalization process a comprehensive characterization study was performed using 1hnmr ftir spectroscopy tga xrd fesem hr tem and bet surface area potential of the prepared des rha was investigated for the uptake of ofloxacin ofl from an aqueous environment the impact of relevant process parameters was evaluated under optimum conditions and the data were examined applying various kinetic and isotherm models as per the regression findings adsorption kinetics data were well described by pseudo second order model and the isotherm data were in good agreement with langmuir temkin rp and freundlich isotherm models further the adsorption procedure was endothermic and spontaneous the high regeneration and adsorption capacity of des rha than untreated rha adds a promising approach to eliminate emerging pollutants present in effluent sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rice husk ash des functionalized rha ofloxacin adsorption isotherms kinetics 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used for the prevention and cure of human and animal diseases originated due to different pathogenic bacteria because body cannot metabolize these antibiotics therefore direct discharge of these antibiotics take place into the environment presently pollution with antibiotics has created pandemonium in the aquatic environment due to its large consumption and discharge hapeshi et al 2013 according to the statistics india gets the 3rd position worldwide in production of pharmaceutical compounds afterwards europe and north america with an estimated turnover of usd 75 billion per year by 2020 kaur et al 2021a among different categories of antibiotics fluoroquinolones are widely prescribed due to their broad spectrum activity and remarkable tissue permeation ofloxacin ofl which is also a fluoroquinolones antibiotic is prescribed generally because of its well known effectiveness against many common bacterial infections due to the large consumption ofl is generally found in wastewater groundwater and surface water because of its non biodegradable and genotoxic nature conventional management methods can remove only small fractions of it residual concentrations always exist in the atmosphere for longer periods water pollution due to these antibiotics may lead to serious consequences like the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria radjenovic et al 2009 kaur et al 2021b to avoid the adverse effects of these antibiotics suitable methods are required for their removal from the environment many physical chemical biological and advanced oxidation methods like filtration coagulation ion exchange flocculation reverse osmosis uv h2o2 ozonation etc have been explored for separation degradation of ofl from wastewater gadipelly et al 2014 pal 2018 kaur et al 2018b these techniques have proven to be energy intensive and inexpedient lin et al 2016 kaur et al 2019a moreover the distinct cod removal competence of these methods for different nature and organic load of the wastewater hinders their practical applications on the other hand chemical oxidation and biodegradation processes exhibit limitations like production of more stable intermediates and toxic by products than their parent compound during treatment processes adsorption is considered one of the most assured physical technique due to the merits of being convenient inexpensive efficient and effective for the adsorption of organic pollutants with no unwanted by products mohamed et al 2015 tremendous endeavours have been done for exploring the different types of adsorbents with excellent performance as a result numerous natural and engineered materials have been evolved to adsorb pharmaceuticals from aqueous systems ofl was selected for adsorption studies because its concentrations from 0 005 31 7 μg l 1 remains present in water bodies and continuously enters freshwater resources kaur et al 2019b moreover deposition of these contaminants as the bio solids form may cause adverse effects to terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems several kinds of low cost natural and abundantly available agricultural waste materials such as sago waste barley straw rice husk ash and tea leaves have been studied previously agri residue rice husk is the outermost layer of paddy that contains about 22 25 5 of the mass it accounts for around 1 5th of the uncultured rice production of 545 million metric tons at the universal scale in india s annual report of rice husk generation it is around 18 to 22 million tons lataye et al 2008 discarding the rice husk is the main problem faced by rice mills the main cause of management and transportation difficulties of rice husk is its lower molecular weight as a result abundant amounts of rice husk produced by rice mills is burnt or dumped as waste which causes ecological and various health issues from last decade scientific community has paid much attention towards production of several value added products such as sic silicon nitride sio2 elemental si magnesium silicide and activated carbon by physicochemical treatments of rice husk bahrami et al 2016 when the rice husk burns into the incinerators as fuel it is called rice husk ash rha due to its distinctive physical and chemical characteristics like high sio2 contents 87 to 97 wt silica high porosity light weight and high external surface area rha finds wide industrial application in comparison with other agri residue materials soltani et al 2015 bahrami et al 2017a rha is now used in many sectors like coatings pigments cement industry insulators rubber filler etc soltani et al 2017 specifically rha has been used for synthesis of thermoelectric materials development of metal matrix composites porous silica monoliths and for improving electrical and thermomechanical properties bahrami et al 2016 bahrami et al 2017b bahrami et al 2020 from last three decades comprehensive scientific investigations have been done on the formulation properties uses of rha and many researches and patents have been published in this area moreover good regeneration and reusability of rha makes it the most used agri residue material as compared to others since the main components of rice husk are silica and carbon it is favorable to utilize as an adsorbent naiya et al 2009 the proficient potential of rha as an operative adsorbent has been proved by its moderate adsorption capacity for heavy metals and various organic pollutants naiya et al 2009 kaur et al 2021c in rha silica is mainly responsible for the high removal of the contaminants because it provides high porosity and specific surface area to achieve better adsorption performance it is essential to modify it in various adsorption studies ionic liquids ils have been applied as functionalization agent for different precursors such as carbon nanotubes clay activated carbon etc the unique physicochemical properties of ils are the main reason behind its selection as organic modifier despite many outstanding features of ils its toxic un decaying nature and the high price of preparation and purification restricts its use in commercial applications mahajan et al 2019 dess are eco friendly solvents and are observed as a substitute to ils due to similar physicochemical properties low cost easy synthesis method and no requirement of further purification in general dess are combination of a hbd and a hba starting compounds of biodegradable natural and non hazardous nature the strong hydrogen bonding between these components results the mixture of very low melting point than starting compounds most dess do not react with water and possibility of change in its physical and chemical properties adds an additional advantage kaur et al 2018b the green nature of des makes it better substitute of hazardous chemicals in the process of functionalization in this study des was prepared using choline chloride as hba and glycolic acid as hbd in a 3 1 mol ratio gc3 1 formation of des was ensured by 1hnmr ftir and tga characterization techniques further prepared des was studied as functionalization agent for rha to form the new adsorbent des functionalized rha des rha was characterized extensively by xrd fesem hr tem ftir and bet surface area to diagnose the changes developed because of the functionalization process des rha was employed as adsorbent for uptake of ofl from its aqueous solution for comparison preliminary experiments were performed for bare rha also operating conditions were optimized by varying adsorbent dose solution ph and contact time moreover at optimized conditions kinetics isotherm and thermodynamic studies were also conducted 2 materials methods 2 1 materials for experimental studies rice husk ash rha was procured from satyam agro solvex khanna punjab india it was washed with warm water and dried at 70 c temperature overnight the dried rha sample was screened with particle size of 180 600 μm using is sieves is 437 1979 the ofl

were procured from tci and spectrochem respectively and h2so4 and naoh both were procured from himedia laboratories pvt ltd india 2 2 synthesis of des the synthesis of choline chloride based des was done by using glycolic acid as a hydrogen bond donor and choline chloride chcl as hba in same manner as reported earlier sharma et al 2019 sharma et al 2020 both components were weighted accurately using an electronic balance mettler toledo with the uncertainty of 0 0001 g glycolic acid and chcl were introduced into a small glass flask in 3 1 mol ratio respectively gc3 1 after proper mixing mixture was heated using a thermostatic oil bath with continuous stirring oil bath was maintained at 70 c 0 1 c using a temperature controller heating was stopped when the colorless and transparent liquid was produced it was allowed to cool at room temperature and left overnight to ensure the formation of des 2 3 functionalization of rha by des gc3 1 functionalized rha was prepared by following the method reported in literature pam 2019 the block diagram of the methodology for preparation of des rha is presented in fig 1 20 g of washed and dried rha was mixed with 100 ml gc3 1 with continuous stirring at 70 c the mixture was sonicated for 3 h at 65 c des rha was then washed 3 4 times using distilled water and filtered with whatmann no 1 filter paper finally it was oven dried at 100 c for 24 h before use to ensure complete moisture removal 2 4 characterization of des and des functionalized rha the synthesized des gc 3 1 was characterized to evaluate its properties and confirm the hydrogen bonding between the original components of des to check the thermal stability of prepared gc 3 1 tga analysis was performed perkinelmer sta6000 the moisture content of gc 3 1 was also examined employing the karl fischer titration method esico 1760 1hnmr and ft ir analysis was performed to ensure the h bonding between glycolic acid and chcl the 1hnmr of the prepared des gc3 1 was determined by operating bruker avance neo 500 mhz nmr spectrometer at room temperature the des sample for nmr analysis was made by dissolving 25 mg of the des in 0 5 ml of dmso in a 5 mm nmr tube the homogeneous mixture of gc3 1 and dmso was made using a vortex mixer further to determine the functional properties of the bare and des functionalized rha these were analyzed by ft ir perkinelmer which provided the theoretical basis for exploring the mechanism of the adsorption process in order to characterize the morphology of rha and des rha images were generated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jeol jsm 7500f the edx test of rha was also performed to analyse its elemental composition moreover for a better understanding of the morphology high resolution pictures were taken with the help of tecnai g2 f20 transmission electron microscope the specific surface area of the prepared des rha was evaluated employing n2 adsorption desorption technique established on the bet model at 77 k micromeritics gemini 2372 pore size distribution was determined with the help of the barrett joyner halenda bjh approach moreover for the macromolecular structure of the des rha xrd analysis was carried out employing a miniflex x ray diffractometer with cukα as the source of radiation 2 5 adsorption experiments all the experiments concerning ofl adsorption on the rha and des rha were conducted in batch mode applying the classical procedure the influence of many process parameters on the ofl uptake capacity including adsorbent dosage 0 1 4 g l 1 solution ph 2 to 10 and adsorption time 30 720 min were first studied with a specified initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 and experimentation time of 720 min for each set of experiment the 100 ml synthetic ofl waste water sample was taken into 150 ml flask the mixtures were continuously stirred using an orbital shaker incubator with temperature control remi cis 24 plus at an agitation speed of 150 rpm and 303 k temperature the solution initial ph was altered by utilizing 0 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh solution after completion of the experiments the samples were withdrawn from the incubator shaker and des rha was taken out by filtration the remaining ofl concentration in liquid was computed using a double beam uv visible spectrophotometer electronic corporation india ltd at a wavelength λmax of 288 nm using the calibration curve all the experimentations were performed in triplicates then an average of these data were taken for reducing the error the ofl removal and adsorption capacity of both bare rha and des rha adsorbents were then computed using the following relationship 1 ofl removal c 0 c f c 0 100 moreover the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 was evaluated as 2 absorption

l 1 is the amount of des rha used in the experiment based on the removal efficiency values the most suitable conditions were selected for further kinetics isotherms and particle diffusion studies 2 6 kinetics studies it is essential to explore adsorption kinetics since it can anticipate the adsorption rate of ofl from its aquatic medium and can facilitate in understanding the mechanism of adsorption reactions the adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted at three distinct initial concentrations c o 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 at optimized parameters where m 2 g l 1 t 720 min and ph 6 5 at t 303 k and stirrer speed of 150 rpm the kinetics of ofl sorption on the des rha was studied employing pseudo first order malik 2003 pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 and intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 the first and second non linear kinetic models were designed by using eqs 3 and 4 pseudo first order model is given as 3 q t q e 1 exp k f t where q t and q e are

4 q t tk s q e 2 1 tk s q e where k s is the reaction rate constant g mg 1 min 1 of pseudo second order adsorption the initial rate of adsorption h g mg 1 min 1 is shown as 5 h k s q e 2 moreover weber morris model was proposed to define the intra particle diffusion ipd mechanism and rate controlling step aravindhan et al 2007 the ipd mechanism was tested graphically through the relationship between qt mg g 1 and t ½ min the ipd model suggested by weber and morris is detailed as following weber and morris 1963 6 q t k id t 1 2 i where k id mg g 1 min 1 2 is diffusion rate constant and i mg g 1 is the intercept of the intra particle diffusion plot 2 7 isotherms studies the adsorption equilibrium isotherms of ofl by des rha were conducted at diverse temperatures 288 303 and 318 k the initial ofl stock concentration varies from 10 to 100 mg l 1 the des rha dose of 2 g l 1 was taken and the experiments were conducted at previously optimized process parameters under constant shaking at 150 rpm the equilibrium concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer after 480 min langmuir langmuir 1918 freundlich freundlich 1906 temkin temkin and pyzhev 1940 and r p redlich and peterson 1959 isotherm models were used to analyse the equilibrium data from the adsorption isotherm experiments as given in eqs 7 10 respectively 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n 9 q e b t in k t c e 10 q e k r c e 1 a r c e β where k l l mg 1 represents the langmuir constant that is connected with the adsorption energy q m mg g 1 is the optimum adsorption capacity of ofl on des rha k f is the freundlich model constant which links with adsorption capacity of des rha mg g 1 n stands for heterogeneity factor g l 1 r is the worldwide gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k b 1 represents the heat of adsorption kj mol 1 and k t denotes to equilibrium binding constant l g 1 correlating with the maximum binding energy the parameters of the isotherm models were obtained with the help of nonlinear regressions 2 8 thermodynamic studies temperature is one of the main affecting features of the adsorption process to better understand the adsorption process the thermodynamic study is essential since it can exhibit the variation in energy through the method and ascertain its viability and nature the adsorption thermodynamic constraints calculated by the thermodynamic model are functional in determining the direction of the process and driving force for the sorption studies of ofl on des rha three thermodynamic variables h s and g standard enthalpy change standard entropy change and gibb s free energy change were computed the thermodynamic parameters were calculated using van t hoff equation eq 11 11 ln k d g 0 rt s 0 r h 0 r 1 t where k d denotes to equilibrium constant r denotes to gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k and t is the temperature k the magnitude of h and s may be obtained from the slope and intercept respectively from the graph of ln kd against 1 t 2 9 reusability test the reusability studies of des rha were examined for three cycles by repeating the adsorption desorption process the used des rha adsorbent was revived at different temperatures like 100 150 and 200 c in a hot air oven overnight afterwards the adsorption process was accompanied in a shaker with agitation rate of 150 rpm for 12 h at optimized conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results of synthesized des and des rha synthesized des gc3 1 was characterized for various relevant properties the thermal stability of gc3 1 was evaluated using tga analysis perkinelmer sta6000 and is depicted in fig s1 the tga analysis has mainly three different steps of mass reduction i e removal of moisture content the discharge of volatile substance and burning of material soltani et al 2015 tga was performed from 25 c to 400 c at the heating rate of 10 c min 1 in n2 gas environment using 25 mg of des sample the combustion profiles of gc3 1 represented its high thermal stability the moisture content of synthesized des was evaluated as 0 3 wt to verify the h bonding between chcl and glycolic acid ft ir was performed and the spectra are revealed in fig 2 a the bands signify a distinctive broadband around 3292 cm 1 which indicates h bonding among the chcl and glycolic acid in the des in the medium region intense bands with peaks at 1744 1173 and 1088 cm 1 wavenumbers were noticed this demonstrates the carbonyl group of glycolic acid and h bond among the oh group of glycolic acid and cl of chcl respectively sharma et al 2018 the structure of prepared des was determined by 1h nmr spectra and is shown in fig s2 regardless of the dilution of dmso the molecular structure of des was found unaffected 3 1 1 ftir studies ft ir spectra of rha and des rha is illustrated in fig 2 b the presence of a broad peak at 3425 and 3457 cm 1 shows the stretching vibration of oh and sioh in des rha spectra the existence of a peak at 3002 cm 1 is assigned to the coupling of des with the surface hydroxyl group of rice husk ash the band around 1092 cm 1 is related to siosi bonding vibrations and at 468 and 794 cm 1 to sih bonds in rha a prominent new peak that appeared in the des rha at 1739 cm 1 is due to the presence of cooh group of glycolic acid on the surface the possible hydrogen bonding in gc3 1 and its optimized chemical structure using gaussian 16 software are represented in fig 3 a and b respectively 3 1 2 xrd studies xrd spectra of rha and des rha samples are represented in fig s3 the xrd pattern of the samples exhibited wide peaks between 22 and 27 2θ for rha and des rha both which correspond to the presence of cristoballite sio2 because of the addition of des in rha matrix two extra peaks were observed at little high 2θ around 29 34 and 44 34 that explain the aggregation of rha particles with des because of the existence of functional groups co oh and wrapping of des onto the rha surface wang et al 2007 the results indicate that rha and des rha are having the characteristic of amorphous disordered structure which is potentially capable for adsorption of materials soltani et al 2015 bahrami et al 2016 3 1 3 bet surface area the specific bet surface areas of rha and des rha were 32 6 m2 g 1 and 23 12 m2 g 1 respectively as expected the specific surface area of des rha diminishes as compared to the bare rha because the condensation of adjoining silanol groups at the pore openings forms siloxane bonds that essentially closes the narrower pores these narrow pores are thus not available for adsorption by nitrogen vansant et al 1995 the average pore diameter was found 6 5 nm and 1 44 nm representing that rha is mesoporous by nature and is an appropriate sorbent for the adsorption of ofl in addition the pore volume was decreased from 5 22 to 0 030 cc g 1 after the functionalization by des which is further proof that des was embedded inside the pore hole of rha gregg et al 1967 the comparative adsorption efficiency of the bare rha and des rha was examined it is seen that both adsorbents exhibited different adsorption capacities where the des rha had higher adsorption capacity than rha 3 1 4 fesem edx and hr tem fesem figures of rha des rha and ofl adsorbed des rha are depicted in fig s4 a b c d and e f respectively the bare surface of rha possesses a membranous fissure and vesicular nature which has a plate like morphology on the other hand in the fesem images of des rha the agglomerated masses are attached due to hydrogen bonding among chcl and glycolic acid this provides evidence of the capability of des to functionalize rha without changing physical and chemical properties with non destructive way the irregular agglomerations can be perceived for bare rha while des rha exhibited fewer agglomerative behavior which recommends a superior distribution and a greater performance of the des rha adsorbent for ofl removal clearly there is not any type of definite damage to the structure or morphology after treating the rha with des after adsorption all the porous surfaces are completely occupied with ofl molecules as shown in fig s4 e f the edx test of washed and dried rha was performed to analyse its elemental composition and is presented in table s1 results revealed the presence of different elements such as silica calcium sodium magnesium potassium carbon and oxygen nevertheless the highest inorganic constituent present in rha was silica after oxygen for a better understanding of the morphology of rha and des rha high resolution imaging was also recorded it provided evidence of a successful functionalization of des over rha as shown in fig s5 in contrast to the tem micrographs of rha samples a the images of des rha clearly showed a dark texture of des uniformly covering the entire rha surface this uniform distribution of des activated the surface particles and sorted them together in a uniform manner throughout hydrogen bonding onto the rha surface completely treated the rice husk ash as shown in fig s5 d and e the presence of dark black spots determines how deep the effect of des penetrated into the rice husk ash matrix without any aggregation these tem observations are in agreement with the results from the different characterization results discussed above 3 2 optimization of operating conditions the influences of des functionalized rha dosage solution ph and adsorption time for the uptake of ofl drug were examined by performing batch adsorption studies for comparison results for bare rha were also represented for all experimental conditions the effect of different parameters was evaluated and the experimental condition was optimized the experiments were repeated twice and a good reproducibility was achieved with a 5 of average standard deviation 3 2 1 effect of rha and des rha dose on ofl removal the influence of adsorbent dosage on ofl removal efficiency was evaluated for des rha and rha both by maintaining remaining variables constant c o 25 mg l 1 ph 2 time period 720 min fig 4 represents the ofl removal with varying adsorbent dosage an increase in adsorbent dosage leads to increasing active sites concentration which helps to enhance the ofl elimination up to a definite range and thereafter the removal rate became nearly stable at dose 2 g l 1 for both adsorbents the gradual ofl removal becomes extremely less as the ofl antibiotic amounts on the adsorbent and in the bulk solution approaches equilibrium with each other yu et al 2003 furthermore des rha represented high removal efficiency with 77 03 of the ofl using the des rha dose of 2 g l 1 on the other hand at a 2 g l 1 dose of rha the removal was only 51 51 opposite to this qe declines as the amount of adsorbent increases not presented here consequently 2 g l 1 dosage of des rha was optimum thus all the further experimental studies were performed with 2 g l 1 dosage for des rha and rha both for ofl removal 3 2 2 influence of ph on removal efficiency the solution ph plays a prominent role in adsorption process because it can affect the uptake capacity of adsorbent the removal of ofl by des rha and bare rha was determined at distinct solution ph 2 to 10 by keeping other variables constant c o 25 mg l 1 dosage of adsorbent 2 g l 1 time period 720 min and the ofl deduction percentage is illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that for des rha with enhancement in ph up to 4 the ofl removal is close to 70 nevertheless when ph increased beyond 4 the ofl uptake started rising being maximum 77 at ph 6 5 moreover for ph 6 5 the ofl elimination was found to reduce and becomes nearly constant to 61 at all ph beyond ph 8 for bare rha the maximum ofl removal of 59 was observed at ph 2 however for all the ph 2 a continuous decrease in performance was observed this variation in performance can be attributed to des functionalization the acid dissociation constants for ofloxacin ofl are 6 08 pka1 and 8 25 pka2 therefore ofl is mainly cationic ofl for ph 6 08 and anionic ofl for ph 8 25 in between 6 08 ph 8 25 the ofl is a zwitterionic compound ofl goyne et al 2005 further in the aqueous solution of ofl the distribution of different forms of ofl is not very sharp and ofl formation starts from ph 4 0 and ofl starts from ph 6 5 because des used in this work is a combination of glycolic acid and chcl so it indicates high electronegativity due to existence of cl ion as displayed in fig 5 for ph less than 4 ofl removal is the result of electrostatic forces within des and ofl as ph rises more ph 4 the ofl particles begins to achieve zwitterionic form and at this ph value 4 ph 6 5 electrostatic relationships between des and ofl reduces because of the few opportunity of ofl and adsorption is directed by h bonding within ofl and des rha combination as shown in fig 6 this occurs because of the reality that des has great h bonding chances while the adsorbate nature is zwitterionic kaur et al 2018a beyond ph 6 5 the development of ofl starts and subsequently the sorption due to h bonding weakens causing diminished ofl elimination it is concluded from the outcomes that the highly acidic and nearly neutral ph favours the ofl removal whereas at alkaline ph lower ofl removal occurred in both the bare rha and des rha system as a result in the present work it is proposed that adsorption studies of both adsorbents rha and des rha are ph dependent and performed the major role in the adsorption of ofl the des rha presented greater removal 77 03 than bare rha finally natural ph range 6 5 was selected for all experiments in this study 3 2 3 effect of time period on removal efficiency fig 7 represents the influence of adsorption time on ofl uptake of des rha and rha adsorbents the optimum dose of adsorbents 2 g l 1 and ph 6 5 were considered for the study of effect of time the time profile of adsorption fig 7 represents that adsorption of ofl on des rha was fast the results showed that ofl uptake increased during the first 480 min and reached the maximum because of the available vacant active adsorbent sites and after 480 min the adsorption reached an equilibrium state chakraborty et al 2011 from bet analysis results it is evident that surface area and pore volume of rha is more than des rha but the adsorption performance of des rha is superior to rha it indicates that trapping of ofl in pores is not the main adsorption mechanism thus this quick adsorption observed can be attributed to the attraction force among the ofl and des rha electrostatic interaction among the positively charged adsorbent surface and the negatively charged molecules of ofl at their respective ph 3 3 kinetic representation analyzing the adsorption kinetics is an essential step to estimate the removal rate of ofl from water ecosystem and to explore the adsorption procedure fitting of experimental findings to the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were performed using nonlinear regression the data sets and fittings are represented in fig 8 where the adsorption capacities are plotted against time the correlation coefficients r2 found good fit with the studied data to the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic studies and resultant model variables are given in table 1 while matching the correlation coefficients r2 values it demonstrated that for pseudo second order it was close to unity r2 0 99 which indicates that sorption of ofl on des rha follows pseudo second order the results of the kinetic study indicate that sorption procedure doesn t only depend on electrostatic interactions within adsorbate and adsorbent but on other mechanism as well hydrogen bonding chaturvedi et al 2020 to analyse the diffusion mechanism during the adsorption process of ofl on des rha the intra particle diffusion ipd model was used to investigate the rate governing steps in adsorption process the use of weber and morris plot qt verses t1 2 fig 9 approves that adsorption is solely controlled by internal diffusion if the graphs represents linearity and crosses via origin the mechanism of the ofl adsorption on des rha is explained in two steps as shown in fig 9 where first step shows the rapid sorption rate because of the presence of higher no of active sites on the adsorbent surface it is called as intra particle diffusion process gercel et al 2007 further intra particle diffusion diminishes and attains the final equilibrium stage of adsorption as shown by second linear segment in the figure this portion of the graph represented the equilibrium diffusion mechanism where ofl molecules slowly diffused through the pores of the des rha and was adsorbed by its internal surfaces thus we can say that the adsorption mechanism of ofl follows multistep mechanism the magnitude of intra particle diffusion variables are shown in table 1 where the obtained values of constants k id 1 and k id 2 increases with initial ofl concentration because of enhancement in driving force for adsorption process furthermore the linear lines do not cross across the origin thus it is concluded that in the adsorption of ofl on des rha intra particle diffusion is not the sole rate limiting step but surface adsorption also plays its role in sorption 3 4 equilibrium isotherms the adsorption of the ofl on des rha at several temperatures and concentrations were examined and is represented in fig 10 the equilibrium data were well suited with the langmuir temkin rp and freundlich isotherm models and the related constraints are listed in table 2 it is recognised from table 2 that except freundlich isotherm model all other isotherm models fitted well with the experimental data with the high correlation coefficients r2 0 99 the better fitting of experimental data with the langmuir isotherm model as compared to freundlich indicates that des rha surface had large number of adsorption active sites and the adsorption process of the ofl was dominated by monolayer adsorption sharma 2011 it is observed from fig 10 that the interactions between ofl on des rha was related to reaction temperature the sorption ability of the ofl improved with the increase of reaction temperature demonstrating that high temperature is best for enhancing the adsorption capacity 3 5 thermodynamics the calculated thermodynamics constraints are mentioned in table 3 the ve value of g at each reaction temperature directed that adsorption of ofl on the des rha surface was instantaneous in nature and thermodynamically favorable usually when the g value ranges between 20 kj mol 1 to 40 kj mol 1 it indicates that adsorption process is physisorption by nature on other hand when the g values less than 40 kj mol 1 then it follows the chemisorption adsorption process the determined values of g are close to 20 kj mol 1 demonstrating that the adsorption mechanism of ofl on des rha is by physisorption the decrease in g value with the enhancement in temperature from 288 k to 303 k indicated increase in adsorption efficiency at high temperatures moreover the ve value of parameter h established the endothermic nature of ofl adsorption onto des rha furthermore the increase in the randomness of the adsorbate molecules at the liquid solid interface was approved by the positive s values sharma 2011 thus from the thermodynamic study it can be determined that sorption of ofl on des rha was endothermic and spontaneous by nature 3 6 reusability of des rha the exhausted des rha represented very good regeneration behavior fig 11 after 3 adsorption desorption cycles the ofl uptake of des rha was reduced slightly at lower regeneration temperatures while regenerating at 100 c 150 c and 200 c temperatures the reduction in removal percentage of ofl after 3 cycles were 14 2 18 2 and 26 1 respectively with the raise in regeneration temperature decrease in removal efficiency of ofl was observed it may be because of the reduction in the active sites of the des rha surface or slight degradation of des at high temperatures these results confirm that des rha has good recycle ability and can be reused repeatedly for removal of pharmaceutical wastes from industrial effluents 3 7 comparative study the adsorption capacity of des rha was compared with different types of earlier used sorbents for ofl uptake table 4 represents the ofl removal capacity of des rha with other

1390,deep eutectic solvents dess have achieved the rising attention of the scientific community because of their distinctive physicochemical properties and variety of applications herein des composed of choline chloride as hydrogen bond acceptor hba and glycolic acid as hydrogen bond donor hbd was synthesized next the prepared des was examined as a functionalization agent for rice husk ash rha to form a novel adsorbent des rha to ensure the formation of des and to recognize the modifications occurred due to the functionalization process a comprehensive characterization study was performed

relevant process parameters was evaluated under optimum conditions and the data were examined applying various kinetic and isotherm models as per the regression findings adsorption kinetics data were well described by pseudo second order model and the isotherm data were in good agreement with langmuir temkin rp and freundlich isotherm models further the adsorption procedure was endothermic and spontaneous the high regeneration and adsorption capacity of des rha than untreated rha adds a promising approach to eliminate emerging pollutants present in effluent sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rice husk ash des functionalized rha ofloxacin adsorption isotherms kinetics 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used for the prevention and cure of human and animal diseases originated due to different pathogenic bacteria because body cannot metabolize these antibiotics therefore direct discharge of these antibiotics take place into the environment presently pollution with antibiotics has created pandemonium in the aquatic environment due to its large consumption and discharge hapeshi et al 2013 according to the statistics india gets the 3rd position worldwide in production of pharmaceutical compounds afterwards europe and north america with an estimated turnover of usd 75 billion per year by 2020 kaur et al 2021a among different categories of antibiotics fluoroquinolones are widely prescribed due to their broad spectrum activity and remarkable tissue permeation ofloxacin ofl which is also a fluoroquinolones antibiotic is prescribed generally because of its well known effectiveness against many common bacterial infections due to the large consumption ofl is generally found in wastewater groundwater and surface water because of its non biodegradable and genotoxic nature conventional management methods can remove only small fractions of it residual concentrations always exist in the atmosphere for longer periods water pollution due to these antibiotics may lead to serious consequences like the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria radjenovic et al 2009 kaur et al 2021b to avoid the adverse effects of these antibiotics suitable methods are required for their removal from the environment many physical chemical biological and advanced oxidation methods like filtration coagulation ion exchange flocculation reverse osmosis uv h2o2 ozonation etc have been explored for separation degradation of ofl from wastewater gadipelly et al 2014 pal 2018 kaur et al 2018b these techniques have proven to be energy intensive and inexpedient lin et al 2016 kaur et al 2019a moreover the distinct cod removal competence of these methods for different nature and organic load of the wastewater hinders their practical applications on the other hand chemical oxidation and biodegradation processes exhibit limitations like production of more stable intermediates and toxic by products than their parent compound during treatment processes adsorption is considered one of the most assured physical technique due to the merits of being convenient inexpensive efficient and effective for the adsorption of organic pollutants with no unwanted by products mohamed et al 2015 tremendous endeavours have been done for exploring the different types of adsorbents with excellent performance as a result numerous natural and engineered materials have been evolved to adsorb pharmaceuticals from aqueous systems ofl was selected for adsorption studies because its concentrations from 0 005 31 7 μg l 1 remains present in water bodies and continuously enters freshwater resources kaur et al 2019b moreover deposition of these contaminants as the bio solids form may cause adverse effects to terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems several kinds of low cost natural and abundantly available agricultural waste materials such as sago waste barley straw rice husk ash and tea leaves have been studied previously agri residue rice husk is the outermost layer of paddy that contains about 22 25 5 of the mass it accounts for around 1 5th of the uncultured rice production of 545 million metric tons at the universal scale in india s annual report of rice husk generation it is around 18 to 22 million tons lataye et al 2008 discarding the rice husk is the main problem faced by rice mills the main cause of management and transportation difficulties of rice husk is its lower molecular weight as a result abundant amounts of rice husk produced by rice mills is burnt or dumped as waste which causes ecological and various health issues from last decade scientific community has paid much attention towards production of several value added products such as sic silicon nitride sio2 elemental si magnesium silicide and activated carbon by physicochemical treatments of rice husk bahrami et al 2016 when the rice husk burns into the incinerators as fuel it is called rice husk ash rha due to its distinctive physical and chemical characteristics like high sio2 contents 87 to 97 wt silica high porosity light weight and high external surface area rha finds wide industrial application in comparison with other agri residue materials soltani et al 2015 bahrami et al 2017a rha is now used in many sectors like coatings pigments cement industry insulators rubber filler etc soltani et al 2017 specifically rha has been used for synthesis of thermoelectric materials development of metal matrix composites porous silica monoliths and for improving electrical and thermomechanical properties bahrami et al 2016 bahrami et al 2017b bahrami et al 2020 from last three decades comprehensive scientific investigations have been done on the formulation properties uses of rha and many researches and patents have been published in this area moreover good regeneration and reusability of rha makes it the most used agri residue material as compared to others since the main components of rice husk are silica and carbon it is favorable to utilize as an adsorbent naiya et al 2009 the proficient potential of rha as an operative adsorbent has been proved by its moderate adsorption capacity for heavy metals and various organic pollutants naiya et al 2009 kaur et al 2021c in rha silica is mainly responsible for the high removal of the contaminants because it provides high porosity and specific surface area to achieve better adsorption performance it is essential to modify it in various adsorption studies ionic liquids ils have been applied as functionalization agent for different precursors such as carbon nanotubes clay activated carbon etc the unique physicochemical properties of ils are the main reason behind its selection as organic modifier despite many outstanding features of ils its toxic un decaying nature and the high price of preparation and purification restricts its use in commercial applications mahajan et al 2019 dess are eco friendly solvents and are observed as a substitute to ils due to similar physicochemical properties low cost easy synthesis method and no requirement of further purification in general dess are combination of a hbd and a hba starting compounds of biodegradable natural and non hazardous nature the strong hydrogen bonding between these components results the mixture of very low melting point than starting compounds most dess do not react with water and possibility of change in its physical and chemical properties adds an additional advantage kaur et al 2018b the green nature of des makes it better substitute of hazardous chemicals in the process of functionalization in this study des was prepared using choline chloride as hba and glycolic acid as hbd in a 3 1 mol ratio gc3 1 formation of des was ensured by 1hnmr ftir and tga characterization techniques further prepared des was studied as functionalization agent for rha to form the new adsorbent des functionalized rha des rha was characterized extensively by xrd fesem hr tem ftir and bet surface area to diagnose the changes developed because of the functionalization process des rha was employed as adsorbent for uptake of ofl from its aqueous solution for comparison preliminary experiments were performed for bare rha also operating conditions were optimized by varying adsorbent dose solution ph and contact time moreover at optimized conditions kinetics isotherm and thermodynamic studies were also conducted 2 materials methods 2 1 materials for experimental studies rice husk ash rha was procured from satyam agro solvex khanna punjab india it was washed with warm water and dried at 70 c temperature overnight the dried rha sample was screened with particle size of 180 600 μm using is sieves is 437 1979 the ofl antibiotic with chemical formula c18h20fn3o4 and a molecular weight of 361 373 g mol 1 was purchased from shri ramesh industries himachal pradesh india reagents like choline chloride and glycolic acid were procured from tci and spectrochem respectively and h2so4 and naoh both were procured from himedia laboratories pvt ltd india 2 2 synthesis of des the synthesis of choline chloride based des was done by using glycolic acid as a hydrogen bond donor and choline chloride chcl as hba in same manner as reported earlier sharma et al 2019 sharma et al 2020 both components were weighted accurately using an electronic balance mettler toledo with the uncertainty of 0 0001 g glycolic acid and chcl were introduced into a small glass flask in 3 1 mol ratio respectively gc3 1 after proper mixing mixture was heated using a thermostatic oil bath with continuous stirring oil bath was maintained at 70 c 0 1 c using a temperature controller heating was stopped when the colorless and transparent liquid was produced it was allowed to cool at room temperature and left overnight to ensure the formation of des 2 3 functionalization of rha by des gc3 1 functionalized rha was prepared by following the method reported in literature pam 2019 the block diagram of the methodology for preparation of des rha is presented in fig 1 20 g of washed and dried rha was mixed with 100 ml gc3 1 with continuous stirring at 70 c the mixture was sonicated for 3 h at 65 c des rha was then washed 3 4 times using distilled water and filtered with whatmann no 1 filter paper finally it was oven dried at 100 c for 24 h before use to ensure complete moisture removal 2 4 characterization of des and des functionalized rha the synthesized des gc 3 1 was characterized to evaluate its properties and confirm the hydrogen bonding between the original components of des to check the thermal stability of prepared gc 3 1 tga analysis was performed perkinelmer sta6000 the moisture content of gc 3 1 was also examined employing the karl fischer titration method esico 1760 1hnmr and ft ir analysis was performed to ensure the h bonding between glycolic acid and chcl the 1hnmr of the prepared des gc3 1 was determined by operating bruker avance neo 500 mhz nmr spectrometer at room temperature the des sample for nmr analysis was made by dissolving 25 mg of the des in 0 5 ml of dmso in a 5 mm nmr tube the homogeneous mixture of gc3 1 and dmso was made using a vortex mixer further to determine the functional properties of the bare and des functionalized rha these were analyzed by ft ir perkinelmer which provided the theoretical basis for exploring the mechanism of the adsorption process in order to characterize the morphology of rha and des rha images were generated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jeol jsm 7500f the edx test of rha was also performed to analyse its elemental composition moreover for a better understanding of the morphology high resolution pictures were taken with the help of tecnai g2 f20 transmission electron microscope the specific surface area of the prepared des rha was evaluated employing n2 adsorption desorption technique established on the bet model at 77 k micromeritics gemini 2372 pore size distribution was determined with the help of the barrett joyner halenda bjh approach moreover for the macromolecular structure of the des rha xrd analysis was carried out employing a miniflex x ray diffractometer with cukα as the source of radiation 2 5 adsorption experiments all the experiments concerning ofl adsorption on the rha and des rha were conducted in batch mode applying the classical procedure the influence of many process parameters on the ofl uptake capacity including adsorbent dosage 0 1 4 g l 1 solution ph 2 to 10 and adsorption time 30 720 min were first studied with a specified initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 and experimentation time of 720 min for each set of experiment the 100 ml synthetic ofl waste water sample was taken into 150 ml flask the mixtures were continuously stirred using an orbital shaker incubator with temperature control remi cis 24 plus at an agitation speed of 150 rpm and 303 k temperature the solution initial ph was altered by utilizing 0 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh solution after completion of the experiments the samples were withdrawn from the incubator shaker and des rha was taken out by filtration the remaining ofl concentration in liquid was computed using a double beam uv visible spectrophotometer electronic corporation india ltd at a wavelength λmax of 288 nm using the calibration curve all the experimentations were performed in triplicates then an average of these data were taken for reducing the error the ofl removal and adsorption capacity of both bare rha and des rha adsorbents were then computed using the following relationship 1 ofl removal c 0 c f c 0 100 moreover the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 was evaluated as 2 absorption

l 1 is the amount of des rha used in the experiment based on the removal efficiency values the most suitable conditions were selected for further kinetics isotherms and particle diffusion studies 2 6 kinetics studies it is essential to explore adsorption kinetics since it can anticipate the adsorption rate of ofl from its aquatic medium and can facilitate in understanding the mechanism of adsorption reactions the adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted at three distinct initial concentrations c o 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 at optimized parameters where m 2 g l 1 t 720 min and ph 6 5 at t 303 k and stirrer speed of 150 rpm the kinetics of ofl sorption on the des rha was studied employing pseudo first order malik 2003 pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 and intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 the first and second non linear kinetic models were designed by using eqs 3 and 4 pseudo first order model is given as 3 q t q e 1 exp k f t where q t and q e are

4 q t tk s q e 2 1 tk s q e where k s is the reaction rate constant g mg 1 min 1 of pseudo second order adsorption the initial rate of adsorption h g mg 1 min 1 is shown as 5 h k s q e 2 moreover weber morris model was proposed to define the intra particle diffusion ipd mechanism and rate controlling step aravindhan et al 2007 the ipd mechanism was tested graphically through the relationship between qt mg g 1 and t ½ min the ipd model suggested by weber and morris is detailed as following weber and morris 1963 6 q t k id t 1 2 i where k id mg g 1 min 1 2 is diffusion rate constant and i mg g 1 is the intercept of the intra particle diffusion plot 2 7 isotherms studies the adsorption equilibrium isotherms of ofl by des rha were conducted at diverse temperatures 288 303 and 318 k the initial ofl stock concentration varies from 10 to 100 mg l 1 the des rha dose of 2 g l 1 was taken and the experiments were conducted at previously optimized process parameters under constant shaking at 150 rpm the equilibrium concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer after 480 min langmuir langmuir 1918 freundlich freundlich 1906 temkin temkin and pyzhev 1940 and r p redlich and peterson 1959 isotherm models were used to analyse the equilibrium data from the adsorption isotherm experiments as given in eqs 7 10 respectively 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n 9 q e b t in k t c e 10 q e k r c e 1 a r c e β where k l l mg 1 represents the langmuir constant that is connected with the adsorption energy q m mg g 1 is the optimum adsorption capacity of ofl on des rha k f is the freundlich model constant which links with adsorption capacity of des rha mg g 1 n stands for heterogeneity factor g l 1 r is the worldwide gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k b 1 represents the heat of adsorption kj mol 1 and k t denotes to equilibrium binding constant l g 1 correlating with the maximum binding energy the parameters of the isotherm models were obtained with the help of nonlinear regressions 2 8 thermodynamic studies temperature is one of the main affecting features of the adsorption process to better understand the adsorption process the thermodynamic study is essential since it can exhibit the variation in energy through the method and ascertain its viability and nature the adsorption thermodynamic constraints calculated by the thermodynamic model are functional in determining the direction of the process and driving force for the sorption studies of ofl on des rha three thermodynamic variables h s and g standard enthalpy change standard entropy change and gibb s free energy change were computed the thermodynamic parameters were calculated using van t hoff equation eq 11 11 ln k d g 0 rt s 0 r h 0 r 1 t where k d denotes to equilibrium constant r denotes to gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k and t is the temperature k the magnitude of h and s may be obtained from the slope and intercept respectively from the graph of ln kd against 1 t 2 9 reusability test the reusability studies of des rha were examined for three cycles by repeating the adsorption desorption process the used des rha adsorbent was revived at different temperatures like 100 150 and 200 c in a hot air oven overnight afterwards the adsorption process was accompanied in a shaker with agitation rate of 150 rpm for 12 h at optimized conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results of synthesized des and des rha synthesized des gc3 1 was characterized for various relevant properties the thermal stability of gc3 1 was evaluated using tga analysis perkinelmer sta6000 and is depicted in fig s1 the tga analysis has mainly three different steps of mass reduction i e removal of moisture content the discharge of volatile substance and burning of material soltani et al 2015 tga was performed from 25 c to 400 c at the heating rate of 10 c min 1 in n2 gas environment using 25 mg of des sample the combustion profiles of gc3 1 represented its high thermal stability the moisture content of synthesized des was evaluated as 0 3 wt to verify the h bonding between chcl and glycolic acid ft ir was performed and the spectra are revealed in fig 2 a the bands signify a distinctive broadband around 3292 cm 1 which indicates h bonding among the chcl and glycolic acid in the des in the medium region intense bands with peaks at 1744 1173 and 1088 cm 1 wavenumbers were noticed this demonstrates the carbonyl group of glycolic acid and h bond among the oh group of glycolic acid and cl of chcl respectively sharma et al 2018 the structure of prepared des was determined by 1h nmr spectra and is shown in fig s2 regardless of the dilution of dmso the molecular structure of des was found unaffected 3 1 1 ftir studies ft ir spectra of rha and des rha is illustrated in fig 2 b the presence of a broad peak at 3425 and 3457 cm 1 shows the stretching vibration of oh and sioh in des rha spectra the existence of a peak at 3002 cm 1 is assigned to the coupling of des with the surface hydroxyl group of rice husk ash the band around 1092 cm 1 is related to siosi bonding vibrations and at 468 and 794 cm 1 to sih bonds in rha a prominent new peak that appeared in the des rha at 1739 cm 1 is due to the presence of cooh group of glycolic acid on the surface the possible hydrogen bonding in gc3 1 and its optimized chemical structure using gaussian 16 software are represented in fig 3 a and b respectively 3 1 2 xrd studies xrd spectra of rha and des rha samples are represented in fig s3 the xrd pattern of the samples exhibited wide peaks between 22 and 27 2θ for rha and des rha both which correspond to the presence of cristoballite sio2 because of the addition of des in rha matrix two extra peaks were observed at little high 2θ around 29 34 and 44 34 that explain the aggregation of rha particles with des because of the existence of functional groups co oh and wrapping of des onto the rha surface wang et al 2007 the results indicate that rha and des rha are having the characteristic of amorphous disordered structure which is potentially capable for adsorption of materials soltani et al 2015 bahrami et al 2016 3 1 3 bet surface area the specific bet surface areas of rha and des rha were 32 6 m2 g 1 and 23 12 m2 g 1 respectively as expected the specific surface area of des rha diminishes as compared to the bare rha because the condensation of adjoining silanol groups at the pore openings forms siloxane bonds that essentially closes the narrower pores these narrow pores are thus not available for adsorption by nitrogen vansant et al 1995 the average pore diameter was found 6 5 nm and 1 44 nm representing that rha is mesoporous by nature and is an appropriate sorbent for the adsorption of ofl in addition the pore volume was decreased from 5 22 to 0 030 cc g 1 after the functionalization by des which is further proof that des was embedded inside the pore hole of rha gregg et al 1967 the comparative adsorption efficiency of the bare rha and des rha was examined it is seen that both adsorbents exhibited different adsorption capacities where the des rha had higher adsorption capacity than rha 3 1 4 fesem edx and hr tem fesem figures of rha des rha and ofl adsorbed des rha are depicted in fig s4 a b c d and e f respectively the bare surface of rha possesses a membranous fissure and vesicular nature which has a plate like morphology on the other hand in the fesem images of des rha the agglomerated masses are attached due to hydrogen bonding among chcl and glycolic acid this provides evidence of the capability of des to functionalize rha without changing physical and chemical properties with non destructive way the irregular agglomerations can be perceived for bare rha while des rha exhibited fewer agglomerative behavior which recommends a superior distribution and a greater performance of the des rha adsorbent for ofl removal clearly there is not any type of definite damage to the structure or morphology after treating the rha with des after adsorption all the porous surfaces are completely occupied with ofl molecules as shown in fig s4 e f the edx test of washed and dried rha was performed to analyse its elemental composition and is presented in table s1 results revealed the presence of different elements such as silica calcium sodium magnesium potassium carbon and oxygen nevertheless the highest inorganic constituent present in rha was silica after oxygen for a better understanding of the morphology of rha and des rha high resolution imaging was also recorded it provided evidence of a successful functionalization of des over rha as shown in fig s5 in contrast to the tem micrographs of rha samples a the images of des rha clearly showed a dark texture of des uniformly covering the entire rha surface this uniform distribution of des activated the surface particles and sorted them together in a uniform manner throughout hydrogen bonding onto the rha surface completely treated the rice husk ash as shown in fig s5 d and e the presence of dark black spots determines how deep the effect of des penetrated into the rice husk ash matrix without any aggregation these tem observations are in agreement with the results from the different characterization results discussed above 3 2 optimization of operating conditions the influences of des functionalized rha dosage solution ph and adsorption time for the uptake of ofl drug were examined by performing batch adsorption studies for comparison results for bare rha were also represented for all experimental conditions the effect of different parameters was evaluated and the experimental condition was optimized the experiments were repeated twice and a good reproducibility was achieved with a 5 of average standard deviation 3 2 1 effect of rha and des rha dose on ofl removal the influence of adsorbent dosage on ofl removal efficiency was evaluated for des rha and rha both by maintaining remaining variables constant c o 25 mg l 1 ph 2 time period 720 min fig 4 represents the ofl removal with varying adsorbent dosage an increase in adsorbent dosage leads to increasing active sites concentration which helps to enhance the ofl elimination up to a definite range and thereafter the removal rate became nearly stable at dose 2 g l 1 for both adsorbents the gradual ofl removal becomes extremely less as the ofl antibiotic amounts on the adsorbent and in the bulk solution approaches equilibrium with each other yu et al 2003 furthermore des rha represented high removal efficiency with 77 03 of the ofl using the des rha dose of 2 g l 1 on the other hand at a 2 g l 1 dose of rha the removal was only 51 51 opposite to this qe declines as the amount of adsorbent increases not presented here consequently 2 g l 1 dosage of des rha was optimum thus all the further experimental studies were performed with 2 g l 1 dosage for des rha and rha both for ofl removal 3 2 2 influence of ph on removal efficiency the solution ph plays a prominent role in adsorption process because it can affect the uptake capacity of adsorbent the removal of ofl by des rha and bare rha was determined at distinct solution ph 2 to 10 by keeping other variables constant c o 25 mg l 1 dosage of adsorbent 2 g l 1 time period 720 min and the ofl deduction percentage is illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that for des rha with enhancement in ph up to 4 the ofl removal is close to 70 nevertheless when ph increased beyond 4 the ofl uptake started rising being maximum 77 at ph 6 5 moreover for ph 6 5 the ofl elimination was found to reduce and becomes nearly constant to 61 at all ph beyond ph 8 for bare rha the maximum ofl removal of 59 was observed at ph 2 however for all the ph 2 a continuous decrease in performance was observed this variation in performance can be attributed to des functionalization the acid dissociation constants for ofloxacin ofl are 6 08 pka1 and 8 25 pka2 therefore ofl is mainly cationic ofl for ph 6 08 and anionic ofl for ph 8 25 in between 6 08 ph 8 25 the ofl is a zwitterionic compound ofl goyne et al 2005 further in the aqueous solution of ofl the distribution of different forms of ofl is not very sharp and ofl formation starts from ph 4 0 and ofl starts from ph 6 5 because des used in this work is a combination of glycolic acid and chcl so it indicates high electronegativity due to existence of cl ion as displayed in fig 5 for ph less than 4 ofl removal is the result of electrostatic forces within des and ofl as ph rises more ph 4 the ofl particles begins to achieve zwitterionic form and at this ph value 4 ph 6 5 electrostatic relationships between des and ofl reduces because of the few opportunity of ofl and adsorption is directed by h bonding within ofl and des rha combination as shown in fig 6 this occurs because of the reality that des has great h bonding chances while the adsorbate nature is zwitterionic kaur et al 2018a beyond ph 6 5 the development of ofl starts and subsequently the sorption due to h bonding weakens causing diminished ofl elimination it is concluded from the outcomes that the highly acidic and nearly neutral ph favours the ofl removal whereas at alkaline ph lower ofl removal occurred in both the bare rha and des rha system as a result in the present work it is proposed that adsorption studies of both adsorbents rha and des rha are ph dependent and performed the major role in the adsorption of ofl the des rha presented greater removal 77 03 than bare rha finally natural ph range 6 5 was selected for all experiments in this study 3 2 3 effect of time period on removal efficiency fig 7 represents the influence of adsorption time on ofl uptake of des rha and rha adsorbents the optimum dose of adsorbents 2 g l 1 and ph 6 5 were considered for the study of effect of time the time profile of adsorption fig 7 represents that adsorption of ofl on des rha was fast the results showed that ofl uptake increased during the first 480 min and reached the maximum because of the available vacant active adsorbent sites and after 480 min the adsorption reached an equilibrium state chakraborty et al 2011 from bet analysis results it is evident that surface area and pore volume of rha is more than des rha but the adsorption performance of des rha is superior to rha it indicates that trapping of ofl in pores is not the main adsorption mechanism thus this quick adsorption observed can be attributed to the attraction force among the ofl and des rha electrostatic interaction among the positively charged adsorbent surface and the negatively charged molecules of ofl at their respective ph 3 3 kinetic representation analyzing the adsorption kinetics is an essential step to estimate the removal rate of ofl from water ecosystem and to explore the adsorption procedure fitting of experimental findings to the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were performed using nonlinear regression the data sets and fittings are represented in fig 8 where the adsorption capacities are plotted against time the correlation coefficients r2 found good fit with the studied data to the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic studies and resultant model variables are given in table 1 while matching the correlation coefficients r2 values it demonstrated that for pseudo second order it was close to unity r2 0 99 which indicates that sorption of ofl on des rha follows pseudo second order the results of the kinetic study indicate that sorption procedure doesn t only depend on electrostatic interactions within adsorbate and adsorbent but on other mechanism as well hydrogen bonding chaturvedi et al 2020 to analyse the diffusion mechanism during the adsorption process of ofl on des rha the intra particle diffusion ipd model was used to investigate the rate governing steps in adsorption process the use of weber and morris plot qt verses t1 2 fig 9 approves that adsorption is solely controlled by internal diffusion if the graphs represents linearity and crosses via origin the mechanism of the ofl adsorption on des rha is explained in two steps as shown in fig 9 where first step shows the rapid sorption rate because of the presence of higher no of active sites on the adsorbent surface it is called as intra particle diffusion process gercel et al 2007 further intra particle diffusion diminishes and attains the final equilibrium stage of adsorption as shown by second linear segment in the figure this portion of the graph represented the equilibrium diffusion mechanism where ofl molecules slowly diffused through the pores of the des rha and was adsorbed by its internal surfaces thus we can say that the adsorption mechanism of ofl follows multistep mechanism the magnitude of intra particle diffusion variables are shown in table 1 where the obtained values of constants k id 1 and k id 2 increases with initial ofl concentration because of enhancement in driving force for adsorption process furthermore the linear lines do not cross across the origin thus it is concluded that in the adsorption of ofl on des rha intra particle diffusion is not the sole rate limiting step but surface adsorption also plays its role in sorption 3 4 equilibrium isotherms the adsorption of the ofl on des rha at several temperatures and concentrations were examined and is represented in fig 10 the equilibrium data were well suited with the langmuir temkin rp and freundlich isotherm models and the related constraints are listed in table 2 it is recognised from table 2 that except freundlich isotherm model all other isotherm models fitted well with the experimental data with the high correlation coefficients r2 0 99 the better fitting of experimental data with the langmuir isotherm model as compared to freundlich indicates that des rha surface had large number of adsorption active sites and the adsorption process of the ofl was dominated by monolayer adsorption sharma 2011 it is observed from fig 10 that the interactions between ofl on des rha was related to reaction temperature the sorption ability of the ofl improved with the increase of reaction temperature demonstrating that high temperature is best for enhancing the adsorption capacity 3 5 thermodynamics the calculated thermodynamics constraints are mentioned in table 3 the ve value of g at each reaction temperature directed that adsorption of ofl on the des rha surface was instantaneous in nature and thermodynamically favorable usually when the g value ranges between 20 kj mol 1 to 40 kj mol 1 it indicates that adsorption process is physisorption by nature on other hand when the g values less than 40 kj mol 1 then it follows the chemisorption adsorption process the determined values of g are close to 20 kj mol 1 demonstrating that the adsorption mechanism of ofl on des rha is by physisorption the decrease in g value with the enhancement in temperature from 288 k to 303 k indicated increase in adsorption efficiency at high temperatures moreover the ve value of parameter h established the endothermic nature of ofl adsorption onto des rha furthermore the increase in the randomness of the adsorbate molecules at the liquid solid interface was approved by the positive s values sharma 2011 thus from the thermodynamic study it can be determined that sorption of ofl on des rha was endothermic and spontaneous by nature 3 6 reusability of des rha the exhausted des rha represented very good regeneration behavior fig 11 after 3 adsorption desorption cycles the ofl uptake of des rha was reduced slightly at lower regeneration temperatures while regenerating at 100 c 150 c and 200 c temperatures the reduction in removal percentage of ofl after 3 cycles were 14 2 18 2 and 26 1 respectively with the raise in regeneration temperature decrease in removal efficiency of ofl was observed it may be because of the reduction in the active sites of the des rha surface or slight degradation of des at high temperatures these results confirm that des rha has good recycle ability and can be reused repeatedly for removal of pharmaceutical wastes from industrial effluents 3 7 comparative study the adsorption capacity of des rha was compared with different types of earlier used sorbents for ofl uptake table 4 represents the ofl removal capacity of des rha with other sorbents reported in the literature from this study it is practical to recommend des rha as an appropriate adsorbent for removal of pharmaceutical waste 4 conclusions choline chloride based des gc 3 1 was prepared and applied as functionalization agent for rha the rha and des rha both were characterized using ftir tga xrd fesem edx hr tem 1hnmr and bet the capability of the des rha to adsorb ofl from its aqueous solution was measured the removal conditions were optimized by performing preliminary experiments to be ph 6 5 with dosage of adsorbent 2 g l 1 and time period of 480 min pseudo second order kinetics defined the adsorption rate order for ofl and des rha combination langmuir temkin and rp isotherm models were the best explanation for this adsorption system des rha represented improved ofl adsorption capacity as compared to rha the maximum adsorption capacity perceived for des rha in these experiments was 26 79 mg g 1 gc 3 1 des was found as a good functionalization agent for rha and could potentially be used for the removal of ofl moreover good recycle ability of des rha makes it more attractive for removal of emerging contaminants from waste water credit author

1391,several scientific fields such as global carbon sequestration deep geological radioactive waste disposal and oil recovery fracking encounter safety assessment issues originating from pore scale processes such as mineral precipitation and dissolution these processes occur in situations where the pore solution contains chemical complexity such as ph ionic strength redox chemistry etc and the porous matrix contains physical complexity such as pore size distribution surface charge surface roughness etc thus to comprehend the participation of each physicochemical phenomenon on governing mineral precipitation it is essential to investigate the precipitation behavior of a given mineral in different confined volumes in this study a counter diffusion approach was used to investigate barite precipitation in two porous materials micritic chalk and compacted kaolinite the two materials present similar water and anionic tracer diffusivities and total accessible porosities but distinct pore size distributions with pore throats of c a 660 nm in chalk versus c a 35 nm in kaolinite x ray tomography results obtained on the two materials showed a distinct distribution of barite precipitates a 500 μm thick homogeneous layer in chalk versus spherical clusters spread in a thickness of 2 mm in kaolinite mass balance calculations showed that barite precipitation led to a porosity decrease in the chalk reacted zone from 45 to 12 and in the kaolinite reacted zone from 36 to 34 5 in contrast water tracer diffusion experiments showed that diffusivity decreased by a factor of 28 in chalk and by a factor of 1000 in kaolinite such a discrepancy was attributed to the difference in the pore size distribution that would lead to the distinct barite precipitation patterns capable of altering in a very different manner the connectivity within the reacted zone of the two selected porous media such local alterations in connectivity linked to pore volume reduction would also magnify surface charge effects on ionic transport as indicated by chloride diffusion experiments and electrophoric tests using zeta potential measurements indeed 36cl was strongly more hindered than water when diffused in reacted materials with a diffusivity decrease by a factor of 450 in chalk and a total restriction of 36cl in kaolinite these experiments clearly provide an insight of how local pore structure properties combined with mineral reactivity could help in predicting the evolution of pore scale clogging and its impact on water and ionic diffusive transport keywords diffusion precipitation chalk kaolinite barite surface charge pore structure 1 introduction in france switzerland and belgium argillaceous rock formations are considered potential host rocks for radioactive waste disposal facilities gaucher et al 2004 nagra 2002 similar indurated rocks are also envisaged as cap rocks to seal anthropogenic co2 reservoirs for global carbon sequestration gcs bachu 2002 berthe et al 2011 fleury and brosse 2018 these rocks are selected due to their low permeabilities which makes diffusion the main mass transport process and their high concentrations of clay minerals whose negatively charged surfaces are capable of adsorbing radionuclides under cationic form andra 2005 however the degradation of radioactive waste in disposal facilities and similarly the use of different trapping methods to capture co2 in reservoir rock may generate some physicochemical imbalances that can enhance mineral dissolution and or precipitation processes since these processes change the mineral composition of rock matrix they can potentially alter the rock containment properties dagnelie et al 2017 de windt et al 2008 and lead to safety assessment issues assessments of the long term evolution of rock containment properties are generally performed using numerical chemistry transport codes in these codes the porosity change is estimated from mineralogical volume balance due to precipitation dissolution feedback on diffusivity is then determined by the empirical archie s relationship which links the change in diffusivity to the porosity changes i e d e d o ϕ m where d e is the effective diffusive coefficient in m2 s 1 d o is the diffusion coefficient in bulk water in m2 s 1 ϕ is the total porosity of the porous sample and m is a fitting factor also known as the cementation factor archie 1942 however very few lab scale experiments are available to assess the validity of this relationship when used in numerical models that couple changes in transport process with mineral reactivity i e chemical interactions and diffusive processes via strong porosity changes chagneau et al 2015a rajyaguru et al 2019 recently rajyaguru et al 2019 showed that the distinct precipitation behavior of barite and gypsum in a chalk sample led to a very different impact on the diffusivity of a water tracer the authors noted that this difference in precipitation behavior stems from the combined effect of mineral intrinsic properties solubility precipitation rate and spatial variability in the properties of chalk pore structure reactive surface similarly singurindy and berkowitz 2003 studied calcite dissolution by sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid solutions and gypsum re precipitation in a compacted sand matrix this study showed that the flow rate and concentration of acid in the injected solution controlled the pattern of calcite dissolution channels and gypsum morphology other studies outlined that nucleation phenomena governed local mineral growth poonoosamy et al 2016 prieto 2014 that pore pressure controlled crystal stability in confined media putnis and mauthe 2001 andra 2005 and that both processes collectively defined the possibility of precipitation in a given pore class emmanuel et al 2010 one could infer from these studies that the nature of precipitation and its feedback on diffusion is potentially governed by the pore size distribution of the hosted material than by the porosity volume of void itself contrary to the paradigm of the widely used archie s law these studies also outline that local mineral distribution and morphology can be used to qualitatively decipher the average change in intrinsic properties of a reacted sample furthermore formation of secondary minerals surfaces could also generate surface charge effects that were not visible in a porous material under intact form in this case ionic species diffusivity may differ from that of neutral species such as a water tracer depending upon ph electrolyte concentration and the presence of potential determining ions the sulfate alkali minerals may possess varying amounts of negative or positive surface charges gonzález caballero et al 1988 hang et al 2009 for instance chagneau et al 2015b investigated the impact of celestite precipitation on transport properties through compacted illite the authors showed that the reacted zone in illite allowed water tracer to diffuse whereas 36cl diffusion was completely restricted they proposed that the presence of additional negative surface charges on celestite combined with surface charges on illite resulted in total porosity clogging and restriction of 36cl diffusion through the reacted zone chagneau et al 2015b all of these experimental and theoretical observations indicate that reactive transport in porous media is a process that strongly couples chemical reactivity of minerals with local transport properties of the host pore structure the objective of the present work is twofold the first goal is to experimentally investigate the role of pore size distribution on barite precipitation in two reference porous media having similar initial diffusive properties but distinct pore size distributions chalk and compacted kaolinite barite was chosen as its formation is of concern in geothermal reservoirs and hydraulic fracturing mundhenk et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 and as it is capable of trapping radium in mill tailings of former uranium mines besançon et al 2020 chautard et al 2020 and in nuclear waste disposal facilities brandt et al 2018 vinograd et al 2018 the second objective is to quantify the impact of barite precipitates on diffusive transport properties neutral species tritiated water and ionic species 36cl were used as reference tracers since both the barite precipitates and the host pore surfaces were charged and therefore expected to generate a combined surface charge effect that could govern ionic species transport through the reacted samples results from these experiments may be used to improve safety assessments tests in sites of nuclear waste disposal and or carbon sequestration where robust numerical models are needed to predict the change in ionic transport properties diffusivity through host rocks in response to local clogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation and characterization kaolinite kga 2 clay powder with particle size 150 μm was provided by cnrs poitiers university this clay was saturated with na using five saturation cycles in a 1 mol l 1 nacl solution and a dialysis procedure was used to remove chloride from the samples until the silver nitrate test for cl was negative then each size fraction was air dried sieved through a 50 μm mesh to remove coarse aggregates and stored at 25 c chalk samples were selected from upper cretaceous formations belonging to the chalk aquifer of the paris basin in the champagne region france descostes et al 2012 rajyaguru et al 2019 the samples were derived from a core section 85 mm diameter of a borehole that crossed the lower campanian age stratigraphic layer approximately 83 my the extracted core was then sliced into 0 67 cm thick and 3 3 cm diameter slices perpendicular to the bedding plane using a diamond wire saw no lubricating fluid was used mercury intrusion and extrusion porosimetry miep characterization was carried out both on na kaolinite compacted at a dry density of 1690 kg m 3 and a chalk sample using a micromeritics autopore iii 9420 apparatus the total porosity and the mean pore throat derived from this analysis were 36 and 35 nm respectively for kaolinite and 45 and 660 nm for chalk 2 2 experimental setup used for kaolinite and chalk a schematic representation of the diffusion cell connected to two reservoirs used in kaolinite study is represented in figure s1 in supporting information the through diffusion setup developed by tertre et al 2018 was used for studying precipitation in the kaolinite sample this setup consists of a diffusion cell made of polyetheretherketone peek and characterized by an inner diameter of 9 49 mm and two aqueous counter reservoirs i e an upstream reservoir and a downstream reservoir the compacted kaolinite sample were prepared by a direct compaction in the diffusion cell at a bulk dry density of 1690 kg m 3 based on the dry mass of the solid placed in the cell and the volume of the cell leading to a sample thickness of 10 mm three porous layers were placed on each face of the sample they were composed of 1 whatman cellulose nitrate membrane filters manufactured by ge healthcare of 0 8 μm mesh 2 stainless steel filter plates pore diameter 10 μm from the mott industrial division and 3 two grids nominal spaces of 280 μm and 450 μm for monofilaments with diameters equal to 120 μm and 200 μm respectively from goodfellow these porous layers ensure homogeneous solution supply at each face of the sample the air from the sample pore space was replaced with pore water using ascendant capillary method in a vertically standing positioned diffusion cell in this method the downstream face was kept under vacuum by connecting the inlet and outlet holes to a vacuum pump simultaneously at upstream the inlet was connected to nitrogen pentoxide gas bottle while the outlet was connected to a 0 1 m nacl solution reservoir using a peristaltic pump the vacuum pump and nitrogen pentoxide were disconnected once solution from upstream reached the downstream face both faces were then connected to two reservoirs containing 0 1 m nacl solution and an equilibration process of two weeks was initiated to ensure an ionic charge balance between the reservoir electrolytes and the pore solution for the current study the first diffusion cell labeled kao a was used to acquire diffusion parameters for tritiated water hto and 36cl through kaolinite before and after the reactive diffusion experiment the second cell labeled kaob was used to determine the 3d evolution of barite precipitates in the kaolinite pore network 30 days and 60 days after the start of the reactive diffusion experiment using x ray microtomography investigation the barite precipitation experiments in chalk were carried out using a static diffusion cell as developed by descostes et al 2012 in this setup the chalk sample was sandwiched between upstream and downstream reservoirs with volumes of 178 ml and 140 ml respectively a schematic view is reported in figure s2 in supporting information a sample holder held the sandwiched sample and all the parts upstream reservoir sample sample holder and downstream reservoir were assembled glued and screwed together to generate a complete through diffusion cell two similar cells were prepared one for the determination of the radioactive tracer s diffusive behavior through intact and reacted chalk labeled cha a and the second one for the postmortem characterization of reacted chalk by x ray microtomography and sem observations labeled chab the details on the preparation of the cell the equilibration step and the concentration of ions in reservoir solutions can be found in rajyaguru et al 2019 2 3 barite precipitation in chalk and kaolinite in kaolinite sample precipitation was launched by replacing the upstream reservoir solution with 20 ml of fresh 100 mmol l 1 nacl solution containing 4 mmol l 1 of bacl2 and similarly the downstream reservoir solution was replaced with 20 ml of 100 mmol l 1 nacl solution containing 4 mmol l 1 na2so4 the upstream solution was spiked with 25 μl of 133ba source elsb45 cerca n 5245 with an activity of 1 78 mbq l 1 using the initial ratio of stable barium concentration and 133ba activity in upstream the sampled activities were converted into stable barium concentrations for this operation 100 μl of the upstream solution was periodically sampled and mixed with 900 μl of ultrapure water the activity measurement was determined using a gamma counter packard 1480 wizard similarly sulfate concentration was measured using ionic chromatography dionex 500 equipped with an as14 ionpac column in 100 μl of sampled downstream solution and diluted in 900 μl of ultrapure water for the chalk experiments the upstream reservoir was filled with a chalk equilibrated solution i e 160 mmol l 1 of nacl 20 mmol l 1 of cacl2 and 0 4 mmol l 1 of nahco3 containing 20 mmol l 1 of bacl2 downstream reservoir with 20 mmol l 1 na2so4 the reservoir monitoring protocol described for the kaolinite case was also used for chalk to obtain barium and sulfate concentration evolution throughout the duration of the experiments a detailed information of reservoirs solution chemistry obtained by rajyaguru et al 2019 is reported in table s1 in supporting information for both sample types the aim of periodic chemistry monitoring was to determine the time at which reactants achieve quasi equilibrium state in their respective reservoir such information is required to calculate the total barite amount having precipitated in samples and the time at which tracer diffusivity tests for reacted samples could be initiated one must note that in the rest of the article reservoirs labeled as upstream and downstream reservoir are used to distinguish barium and sulfate reservoirs and do not bear any advective meaning 2 4 postmortem 3d imaging μct 3d views of the barite precipitated zones in the kaolinite and chalk samples were obtained by performing x ray microtomography μct on the cells kao b and cell chab both cells had similar experimental conditions reactant concentration volume of reservoirs sample geometry as kao a and cha a cells for the kaolinite experiment after 30 days and 60 days since starting of the reactive diffusion experiment the circulation of reactants in kao b was temporarily stopped for 1 day the whole diffusion cell was disconnected from the reservoirs and placed in an x ray microtomography μct apparatus after tomography imaging the cell was connected back to the reservoirs to continue the barite precipitation process in the case of chalk the size of the experimental setup prevented any μct imaging during the experiment thus cha b cell was dismantled after 140 days and barite precipitated chalk sample was removed from the supporting ring and then used for imaging for both studies a skyscan 1272 microtomography apparatus brucker was used to acquire images the μct images for the kaolinite and chalk samples were compared to determine the formation of a precipitated zone in compacted porous media kaolinite and natural porous media micritic chalk in kaolinite the maximal spatial resolution of reacted zone was 16 μm due to sample size in chalk a piece of reacted zone considered as a representative elementary volume was imaged with a spatial resolution of 1 μm 2 5 tracers through diffusion tests for the kaolinite sample after the equilibration step of kao a sample explained in section 2 2 the upstream reservoir solution was completely replaced with 100 ml of fresh solution with 100 mmol l 1 of nacl this reservoir was spiked with 180 μl of tritiated water labeled cerca elsb45 n 760 112 4 and 65 μl of 36cl labeled e z 1760 100 1 to achieve volumetric activities of 1 mbq l 1 for hto and 0 5 mbq l 1 for 36cl similarly the downstream reservoir solution was replaced with 10 ml of fresh solution with 100 mmol l 1 of nacl to ensure a constant activity gradient between both reservoirs the downstream solution at each sampling was renewed with 10 ml of fresh solution the protocol to measure tracer activity is as follows 100 μl of the sampled solutions were mixed with 900 μl of ultrapure water and 4 ml of ultima gold scintillation liquid in a 5 ml scintillation bottle the activities were measured using a packard tri carb 2500 liquid scintillation recorder once tracer diffusivity was obtained at intact condition the tracers were out diffused from sample pore solution by replacing both reservoirs with 100 ml of tracer free solution for two weeks using reservoir monitoring step described in section 2 3 the reactant quasi equilibrium step was achieved after 85 days since the beginning of experiment at this stage hto and 36cl tracers with volumetric activities similar to the intact case 1 mbq l 1 for hto and 0 5 mbq l 1 for 36cl were directly injected into the upstream solution this step ensured that similar initial tracers activity values were achieved for pure diffusion and reactive diffusion step in the reactive diffusion experiment as the diffusive parameters were estimated under ongoing precipitation process a careful direct injection of tracer in upstream solution was done to ensure no disturbance of solution chemistry similarly the downstream solution at each sampling was not renewed contrary to intact case but the activity change was directly measured by a periodic withdrawal of 100 μl of solution from the reservoir one must note that the protocol for activity measurement using liquid scintillation recorder is the same as the protocol used at intact conditions for chalk water tracer diffusivity in an intact sample has already been reported in rajyaguru et al 2019 the barite precipitation process in cell cha a was continued for a total experimental time of 300 days one must note that the chemistry monitoring in this experiments was done only for 140 days at this stage the upstream solution was directly spiked with hto labeled cerca elsb45 n 760 112 4 and 36cl labeled e z 1760 100 1 to achieve volumetric activities of 0 40 mbq l 1 for hto and 0 30 mbq l 1 for 36cl respectively the protocol used for the measurement of the activity consisted of mixing 4 ml of ultima gold scintillation liquid with either 50 μl of the upstream solution plus 900 μl of ultrapure water or 1 ml of the downstream solution in a 5 ml scintillation bottle one milliliter of tracer free solution was added in the downstream reservoir of the chalk cell at each sampling to keep the volume of the downstream reservoir constant for kaolinite and chalk hto and 36cl diffusive parameters values in intact and reacted conditions were estimated by a numerical fitting of the activity data using i mode see next section 2 6 treatment of the experimental diffusive results the experimental activity datasets for both hto and 36cl were interpreted numerically using fick s second law for one dimensional transport crank 1975 1 c t d e α 2 c x 2 d e ε r d ρ app δ 2 c δ x 2 where c is the

conditions from eqs 2 3 and 4 semi analytical solutions to determine the cumulative activity in downstream reservoirs are given in literature by didierjean et al 2004 the semi analytical solutions were implemented in cea s interpretation model of diffusion experiments i mode tool radwan et al 2006 for the through diffusion setup the associated errors in the measured cumulative activities in the downstream reservoirs were calculated using the gaussian error propagation method the mathematical equation for this operation was taken from bazer bachi et al 2006 these equations are detailed in the supporting information note that the hto and 36cl diffusive data obtained on reacted samples were also interpreted using this simplified description of the current experimental system e g one dimensional transport charge induced mechanisms not taken into account in this case the limitations related to this modeling approach were acknowledged assuming that such interpretation should only bring indications about how diffusive transport is impaired 3 results 3 1 μct imaging of the barite precipitate the μct image of the chalk sample obtained after 140 days reported in fig 1a shows that barite precipitates form a thin reacted zone in the center of the sample for kaolinite the μct images reported in fig 1b obtained after 30 days and fig 1c obtained after 60 days show spherical barite precipitates evenly distributed in the reacted zone which is further slightly shifted towards barium inlet surface the shifting of the precipitated zone might be due combined effect of barium sorption on kaolinite pore surface barium distribution coefficient k d obtained from batch experiments is equal to 3 10 3 m3 kg 1 see supporting information and smaller self diffusion coefficient in water of ba2 compared to so4 2 ions d 0 ba 8 5 10 10 m2 s 1 vs d 0 so4 10 7 10 10 m2 s 1 li and gregory 1973 because the scan resolution 16 μm is much larger than the mean size of pores each of the spheres in reality represents a cluster of small barite precipitates distributed within the matrix see fig s4 in the supporting information for sem images acquired from a similar study 3 2 diffusion of hto and 36cl through intact materials the activity data for hto for intact chalk sample have been already reported in rajyaguru et al 2019 these authors estimated a value of d e hto chalk equal to 41 5 10 11 m2 s 1 the modeled experimental curve for hto at intact conditions is reported in fig 2 a for comparison with the reacted conditions we must recall that the chalk sample at intact conditions is composed of large pore volumes with pore throat of 660 nm at intact conditions it can be assumed that the effect of the chalk surface charge would be negligible on diffusivity of 36cl ion moreover the self diffusion coefficient of 36cl in water is slightly lower than hto li and gregory 1973 d 0 hto 2 10 10 m2 s 1 and d 0 36cl 1 7 10 10 m2 s 1 or d 0 hto d 0 36cl 1 17 using this relationship the diffusivity coefficient of 36cl at intact conditions in chalk can be assumed to be equal to d e 36cl chalk 35 3 10 11 m2 s 1 this value of effective diffusion coefficient was then used in i mode to calculate the modeled experimental curve of 36cl reported in fig 2 b for comparison for intact kaolinite the experimental cumulative activity data obtained for hto and 36cl are reported in fig 2 c d and they were numerically reproduced using i mode with d e hto kaolinite 29 10 11 m2 s 1 and d e 36cl kaolinite 24 10 11 m2 s 1 the values of effective diffusion coefficient for hto and 36cl are close to those determined by glaus et al 2010 for the kga 1b type of kaolinite at a dry density of 1900 kg m 3 the small difference in the effective diffusion coefficient values d e hto d e 36cl 1 20 for both species through intact kaolinite is within the expected limit thus diffusive tests show that both hto and 36cl tracers have a similar diffusion rate through kaolinite at a dry density of 1690 kg m 3 finally a complete overview of diffusive parameters obtained at intact conditions are summarized in table 1 3 3 diffusive property changes in chalk and kaolinite samples deduced from mass balance calculations and tracer tests fig 3a and fig 3b show the concentration evolution of reactants in the upstream and downstream reservoirs of cells cha a and kao a in both cases barium and sulfate ions were not detected in their counter reservoirs and were not reported in these figures since the solubility of barite is very low ksp barite 10 9 97 putnis et al 1995 the supersaturation to initiate precipitation around 10 4 to 10 5 mol l 1 of equal barium and sulfate concentrations is easily reached at this stage most of barium and sulfate ions would have participated in barite precipitation resulting in a porosity reduction in both samples after 140 days of experiment based on the barium concentration evolution in reservoirs the amount of barium contributing to barite precipitation in chalk and kaolinite was equal to 2 7 mmol and 0 04 mmol respectively using i a molar volume of 52 1 cm3 mol 1 for barite and ii the initial porosity the volume occupied by barite in chalk was 0 14 cm3 corresponding to overall 2 5 decrease in porosity at sample scale similarly for the kaolinite experiment barite precipitates occupied 0 0021 cm3 corresponding to an overall 0 5 decrease in porosity table s3 in supporting information to assess the impact of precipitation on diffusivity tracers tests were carried out for the kaolinite experiment once reservoir monitoring confirmed that quasi equilibrium state was reached i e after 85 days and for chalk experiment after 300 days fig 2 for chalk barite precipitation led to a significant decrease of hto and 36cl diffusivity values with d e hto chalk 13 5 10 11 m2 s 1 and d e 36cl chalk 1 1 10 11 m2 s 1 respectively values reported in table 1 similarly for kaolinite precipitation led to a hto diffusivity decrease with d e hto kaolinite 0 15 10 11 m2 s 1 and a total hindering of 36cl diffusion the modeled curves are reported in supporting information in fig s5 and the associated diffusivity coefficient values in supporting information in table s2 the calculated porosity values along with hto diffusivity data showed that barite precipitation led to a more significant change in kaolinite transport properties than for chalk 4 discussion 4 1 pore structure driven barite precipitation and changes in sample transport properties in section 3 1 post mortem characterization of chalk and kaolinite by μct imaging showed two distinct barite precipitate patterns in chalk sample evenly distributed barite precipitates formed a thin wall at the center of the sample whereas in kaolinite sample the barite precipitates formed evenly distributed isolated clusters over a broad zone in the center of the sample due to the sample geometry and adopted experimental approach it was not possible to quantify how these precipitates evolved over time at pore scale nevertheless observations from recent literature connected to present work can allow us to decipher key parameters governing distinct barite precipitation in chalk and kaolinite samples a study dealing with barite precipitation in compacted sand sample showed that barite would precipitate with two different growth rates in different pore volumes poonoosamy et al 2015 indeed these growth behaviors also controlled their final morphology and distribution in compacted sand samples poonoosamy et al 2016 this study showed micro crystalline barite precipitate growth in larger pore volumes 100 μm and nano crystalline barite precipitates growth on the small pore walls 10 μm the micro crystalline barite precipitated with a growth rate of 3 9 10 13 m2 s 1 whereas nano crystalline barite precipitated with a growth rate of 2 7 10 12 m2 s 1 indeed the supersaturation threshold to initiate micro crystalline barite precipitation was equal to 4 08 whereas nano crystalline barite precipitated at a lower supersaturation threshold value equal to 3 6 respectively prasianakis et al 2017 these calculations were based on classical nucleation theory that states that mineral forming from pore solution grows via homogeneous nucleation and mineral forming on a foreign substrate pore walls in this case grows via heterogeneous nucleation classical nucleation theory states that a mineral requires an interfacial energy to form stable precipitate as it grows on foreign substrate but mineral requires higher threshold energy to form from the pore solution kashchiev and van rosmalen 2003 nielsen and sohnel 1969 this interfacial energy is key to determine the cluster of nuclei required to form a stable precipitate and a given mineral could obtain different morphologies depending upon the nucleation path it undertakes to initiate precipitation henzler et al 2018 kawano et al 2009 loste et al 2004 prieto 2014 these observations present a direct link between pore volumes and mineral intrinsic property solubility growth rate controlling precipitation in a given pore size distribution in present study barite precipitation was initiated through a counter diffusion setup where ba2 ion from reservoir 1 and so4 2 ion from reservoir 2 would diffuse into the sample and progressively increase their concentration into the sample pore solutions interaction of both ions would supersaturate the pore solutions with respect to barite mineral in pores located in the first points of meeting over passage of time as more and more ba2 and so4 2 would diffuse and interact in these first points of meeting they would increase the barite supersaturation in pore volumes until a threshold is achieved from where barite precipitation could be initiated in these pore volumes as barite mineral starts to precipitate it consumes significant amount of ba2 and so4 2 ions from pore solution the chalk sample in our study is a natural material and it has larger heterogeneities in its pore structure these heterogeneities will control the local diffusion of ions from sample surface until the first points of meeting in the center of the sample generating a slight variation in local supersaturation in pores in the pores where threshold supersaturation is achieved depending upon their pore size precipitation is initiated and the transport experiment is no longer dependent upon pure diffusion these first precipitates would reduce barium and sulfate concentration in pore solutions and thus enhancing diffusion of these ions towards these pores from neighboring pore solution leading to evolution of reacted front around these first points of precipitation along with low solubility barite also possess slow kinetics of precipitation as mean pore size of chalk sample is 660 nm a longer time is required to fill such pores with barite mineral this means that a concentration gradient between these pores of first precipitation and neighboring pores continues for a longer time and ba2 and so4 2 diffusion is restricted around these pores it is for this reason most of the barite precipitation is restricted to the center of the sample in chalk case the mean pore throat of kaolinite sample is 35 nm that is 19 times smaller than for chalk sample this means that once precipitation is initiated in pore volumes it will take much shorter time to fill these pore volumes than the large pore volumes in chalk case these precipitates even in small volumes would strongly reduce the pore size and generate partially filled pores where surface charge effects between barite wall and kaolinite wall will start to become dominant for ionic diffusion due to such restriction there is no further concentration gradient possible between these pore volumes and neighboring pore volumes and resulting in pore connectivity loss thus ba2 and so4 2 ions will need to find another pathway to meet and supersaturate pore solution to initiate precipitation the low solubility of barite will ensure that supersaturation in such other places is easily achieved as more and more of such pores are filled all the possible pore connectivity allowing ba2 and so4 2 to meet and supersaturate pore solution is completely restricted finally the evolution of this system should stop connected pathways required for so4 2 to diffuse and meet ba2 to supersaturate the pore solutions such sharper pore filling also resulted in broader precipitation front where precipitates are evenly distributed it is noteworthy that the reliability of this hypothesis can only be fully assessed by performing a rather advanced modeling incorporating all these coupled mechanisms which is out of the scope of this study the diffusion tests conducted before and after precipitation experiments showed that generation of barite precipitated zone had distinct impact on transport properties of chalk and kaolinite samples in chalk this precipitation process led to hto diffusivity decrease by a factor of 2 and 36cl diffusivity decrease by a factor of 30 to further analyze the impact of pore connectivity loss on global transport properties of samples let us consider the chalk reacted zone thickness equal to 500 μm with maximum and minimum thicknesses of 1 mm and 300 μm respectively similarly the thickness of barite reacted zone in kaolinite sample is approximately equal to 2 mm with maximum and minimum thicknesses equal to 3 mm and 1 mm respectively these values were estimated from μct images and sem observations see fig s2 and fig s3 in the supporting information for each selected thickness mass balance calculations were performed to determine residual porosity in the reacted zones of chalk and kaolinite samples the minimum and maximum porosity reduction values for each case are also reported in table 1 considering the mean experimental thickness barite precipitation led to chalk porosity reduction from 45 to 12 and for kaolinite porosity decreases from 36 to 34 5 respectively these data apparently contradict the drastic drop of diffusivity in kaolinite considering the rather moderate decrease of porosity in the reacted zone compared to chalk table 1 to further discuss this point we calculated the corresponding values of geometric factor which takes into account the effect of tortuosity and constrictivity of the pore space table 1 the concept of geometric factor and associated diffusivity calculations are explained in supporting information in chalk barite precipitation decreased geometric factor of hto by a factor of 8 due to its limited diffusion through the remaining connected pore network in 12 of residual porosity in this pore network the partially filled pores with smaller diameter and strong edl effects between barite and chalk surface would further impose strong restricted 36cl diffusion it is for this reason barite precipitation led to decrease in geometric factor for 36cl by a factor of 115 for kaolinite mass balance calculations showed that barite precipitation resulted in 1 5 porosity decrease and 34 5 residual porosity in reacted zone however diffusivity tests for hto show its diffusivity decrease by a factor of 200 and geometric factor decrease by a factor of 1000 these results show that the residual porosity in the reacted zone contains very small connected network that would allow hto diffusion the partially filled pores in residual porosity have very small pore sizes 35 nm with strong charge effects between kaolinite and barite surface thus this connected network is not accessible for 36cl ion transport and resulting in its complete diffusion restriction 4 2 ionic transport alteration driven by local barite precipitation in previous section we noted that barite precipitation led to generation of two distinct connected network within the reacted zone each of this reacted zone contains 1 pore completely filled with barite 2a pore partially filled with small volume of barite 2b pore filled with significant volume of barite 3 empty pores with no presence of barite the pores fully occupied with barite would correspond to dead end pores through which no diffusion could occur the partially filled pores with small and significant barite volumes along with empty pores would account for pore connectivity in reacted zone and possible hto and 36cl diffusion since diffusion tests showed contradictory diffusive behavior of both tracers through reacted zones of chalk and kaolinite sample the simple 1d diffusion equation reported in section 2 5 is unable to explain underlying causes for contradictory diffusion behavior of hto and 36cl before and after precipitation process moreover the water layer adjacent to mineral surface generates electric double layer of either negative or positive charge depending on the charge of this surface and that of the ions the diffusion of the ions may be retarded appelo and wersin 2007 sposito 2008 stumm and morgan 2012 moreover natural chalk materials and kaolinite are also known to present surface charge at full water saturation conditions al mahrouqi et al 2017 andra 2005 in present study depending upon the size of newly formed residual pore volumes the thickness of free water layer would vary and it is sandwiched in between newly formed surfaces composed of either barite barite barite chalk or barite kaolinite respectively barite mineral surface charge can be controlled and even reversed by varying ph ionic strength and by increasing the presence of potential determining ions pdis such as ba2 and so4 2 bokern et al 2003 hang et al 2007 depending upon the local pore chemistry each pore volume could either possess positive surface charge where 36cl diffusion could be retarded or negative surface charge which could inhibit 36cl diffusion indeed the strength of these surface charges depend upon the pore size local ionic strength and presence of potential determining ions thus combination of these pore volumes generate a residual pore size distribution with varying electric double layer thickness and surface charge in each pore indeed the theoretical and experimental works carried by muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 soler et al 2019 tournassat and steefel 2015 show that such varying pore volumes clearly control the nature of cationicpr and anionic species transport to explore such surface charge effects on ion mobility electrophoretic mobility using zeta potential measurements was determined in the current study on chalk kaolinite and barite powder under the different pore chemistry found in our reactive experiments for that purpose barium or sulfate was added in chalk or kaolinite pore water solutions at a concentration varying from 10 to 5 mol l 1 to 10 2 mol l 1 these values were chosen assuming that when hto and 36cl diffusion tests are launched the reacted zone can be then divided into two main zones the first zone called zone ba would contain precipitates that are equilibrated with pore solution containing an excess of barium ions that cannot easily diffuse anymore through the reacted zone in this case one can assume that the barium concentration value would be close to the value measured in the upstream reservoir when the quasi equilibrium is reached i e ca 5 10 3 and ca 1 5 10 3 mol l 1 in chalk or kaolinite experiments respectively fig 3 similarly precipitates in second zone called zone so4 would be equilibrated with pore solution containing an excess of sulfate ions with concentrations close to ca 1 10 3 and ca 1 5 10 3 mol l 1 in chalk or kaolinite experiments respectively fig 3 conversely sulfate or barium concentrations in zone ba or zone so4 resp should be controlled by the barite solubility at a value close to 10 5 mol l 1 for each case three replicates of batch experiments were prepared consisting of 0 06 g of mineral powder suspended in 9 ml of pore water the suspended solution was equilibrated by shaking tube for 15 h finally 1 ml of solution was injected in zetameter setup labeled zetasizer nano from malvern panalytical and the evolution of zeta potential was measured with the mean acquisition time of 2 3 min for chalk or barite powder suspended in chalk pore water the ph was equal to 7 6 or 7 2 respectively for kaolinite or barite suspended in kaolinite pore water the ph was equal to 5 8 or 5 5 respectively zeta potential results reported in fig 4 indicate that barite powder showed positive zeta potential values under all the experimental conditions except in the case of sulfate concentration greater than 10 3 mol l 1 in chalk pore water chalk powder surface was always negatively charge independently of the reactant concentration while kaolinite was mainly under negative form except for barium concentration higher than 10 3 mol l 1 based on these data and on how barite precipitation mechanisms can occur in confined pores we propose a schematic representation of newly formed surfaces in the reacted zone and their possible impact of solute diffusion fig 5 case 1 concerns large pores completely filled with barite mineral in chalk sample these pores contribute as dead end pores and contribute to no diffusion of both hto and 36cl case 2 deals with smaller pores found both in chalk and kaolinite materials where barite precipitation has occurred on the kaolinite chalk pore surface in case 2a barite overgrowth partially masks covers the initial material for chalk case 2a cha shows two possible scenarios where one side of pore composed of chalk surface will always maintain negative surface charge the other side of pore surface is composed of barite of either negative or positive surface charge depending upon pdis concentration in contrast case 2a kao shows pores composed on one side with positively charged kaolinite surface and on other side with either negatively or positively charged barite surface both of these cases clearly show the distinct evolution of surface charge properties for barite precipitation in kaolinite and chalk samples finally barite overgrowth can also completely cover the pore surface and would remain in direct contact with the remaining pore water case2b thus in such pores for both chalk and kaolinite case the pdis would control barite surface charge that in turn governs the nature of ionic transport both of case 1 and case 2 a b could explain the selective restriction of anionic species transport through the reacted zones of chalk and kaolinite samples nevertheless as kaolinite pore volumes are much smaller compared to chalk barite precipitation would significantly reduce the diameter of these pores thus the newly formed surface charge properties in case2a kao and case2b kao would have a much more pronounced effect on ionic transport in the kaolinite case these considerations may satisfactorily explain the reduction of 36cl diffusivity in chalk and its complete restriction in kaolinite after the occurrence of clogging phenomenon in the future course of this project dedicated complementary post mortem analyses such as fib sem xrf xrd measurements are planned to be carried out to determine precipitates morphology in pores smaller than 50 nm with possibility of determining concentration of residual ionic species such investigation would further bring in new arguments to quantify the analysis presented in this work the experimental results presented in this work also highlight the limitation of simple diffusion equation reported in section 2 5 without taking into account edl effects to quantify such effects surface charge behavior of barite barite barite chalk barite kaolinite with varying free water thickness ph is and potential determining ion concentrations is being studied using a multi component diffusion theory the authors believe that such numerical task in future scope of work will further strengthen arguments presented in this article 5 conclusions the present study aimed at understanding pore scale clogging mechanism under diffusive controlled transport regime it is expected that such process would affect containment properties of natural rocks that are envisaged i to host deep geological facilities for radioactive waste storage or ii as cap rocks for global carbon sequestration the investigation of barite precipitation in chalk and compacted kaolinite samples showed that in a diffusion controlled transport pore size distribution is key in controlling the initiation points of precipitation these points of initiation would then determine the final pattern of reacted zone and generate a unique feedback on transport properties of the porous sample moreover the electrophoretic measurements also showed that ph and pdis can have a tremendous influence on transport of ionic species during clogging process the emerging local chemical complexities mineral distribution mineral surface charge could then potentially change the nature of ionic transport through the newly formed reacted zone the experiments performed with two different materials evidenced that clogging was mainly driven by local physicochemical process pore structure effects combined with mineral reactivity in this case averaged porosity loss alone in clogged zone is not sufficient to determine the alteration extent of rock transport properties the present work therefore shows that the applicability of relationships such as archie s law is limited in this context and that there is a need to quantify the nature of clogging in porous material of varying physical complexities and under varying chemical complexities declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary material image 1 appendix a supplementary data

1391,several scientific fields such as global carbon sequestration deep geological radioactive waste disposal and oil recovery fracking encounter safety assessment issues originating from pore scale processes such as mineral precipitation and dissolution these processes occur in situations where the pore solution contains chemical complexity such as ph ionic strength redox chemistry etc and the porous matrix contains physical complexity such as pore size distribution surface charge surface roughness etc thus to comprehend the participation of each physicochemical phenomenon on governing mineral precipitation it is essential to investigate the precipitation behavior of a given mineral in different confined volumes in this study a counter diffusion approach was used to investigate barite precipitation in two porous materials micritic chalk and compacted kaolinite the two materials present similar water and anionic tracer diffusivities and total accessible porosities but distinct pore size distributions with pore throats of c a 660 nm in chalk versus c a 35 nm in kaolinite x ray tomography results obtained on the two materials showed a distinct distribution of barite precipitates a 500 μm thick homogeneous layer in chalk versus spherical clusters spread in a thickness of 2 mm in kaolinite mass balance calculations showed that barite precipitation led to a porosity decrease in the chalk reacted zone from 45 to 12 and in the kaolinite reacted zone from 36 to 34 5 in contrast water tracer diffusion experiments showed that diffusivity decreased by a factor of 28 in chalk and by a factor of 1000 in kaolinite such a discrepancy was attributed to the difference in the pore size distribution that would lead to the distinct barite precipitation patterns capable of altering in a very different manner the connectivity within the reacted zone of the two selected porous media such local alterations in connectivity linked to pore volume reduction would also magnify surface charge effects on ionic transport as indicated by chloride diffusion experiments and electrophoric tests using zeta potential measurements indeed 36cl was strongly more hindered than water when diffused in reacted materials with a diffusivity decrease by a factor of 450 in chalk and a total restriction of 36cl in kaolinite these experiments clearly provide an insight of how local pore structure properties combined with mineral reactivity could help in predicting the evolution of pore scale clogging and its impact on water and ionic diffusive transport keywords diffusion precipitation chalk kaolinite barite surface charge pore structure 1 introduction in france switzerland and belgium argillaceous rock formations are considered potential host rocks for radioactive waste disposal facilities gaucher et al 2004 nagra 2002 similar indurated rocks are also envisaged as cap rocks to seal anthropogenic co2 reservoirs for global carbon sequestration gcs bachu 2002 berthe et al 2011 fleury and brosse 2018 these rocks are selected due to their low permeabilities which makes diffusion the main mass transport process and their high concentrations of clay minerals whose negatively charged surfaces are capable of adsorbing radionuclides under cationic form andra 2005 however the degradation of radioactive waste in disposal facilities and similarly the use of different trapping methods to capture co2 in reservoir rock may generate some physicochemical imbalances that can enhance mineral dissolution and or precipitation processes since these processes change the mineral composition of rock matrix they can potentially alter the rock containment properties dagnelie et al 2017 de windt et al 2008 and lead to safety assessment issues assessments of the long term evolution of rock containment properties are generally performed using numerical chemistry transport codes in these codes the porosity change is estimated from mineralogical volume balance due to precipitation dissolution feedback on diffusivity is then determined by the empirical archie s relationship which links the change in diffusivity to the porosity changes i e d e d o ϕ m where d e is the effective diffusive coefficient in m2 s 1 d o is the diffusion coefficient in bulk water in m2 s 1 ϕ is the total porosity of the porous sample and m is a fitting factor also known as the cementation factor archie 1942 however very few lab scale experiments are available to assess the validity of this relationship when used in numerical models that couple changes in transport process with mineral reactivity i e chemical interactions and diffusive processes via strong porosity changes chagneau et al 2015a rajyaguru et al 2019 recently rajyaguru et al 2019 showed that the distinct precipitation behavior of barite and gypsum in a chalk sample led to a very different impact on the diffusivity of a water tracer the authors noted that this difference in precipitation behavior stems from the combined effect of mineral intrinsic properties solubility precipitation rate and spatial variability in the properties of chalk pore structure reactive surface similarly singurindy and berkowitz 2003 studied calcite dissolution by sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid solutions and gypsum re precipitation in a compacted sand matrix this study showed that the flow rate and concentration of acid in the injected solution controlled the pattern of calcite dissolution channels and gypsum morphology other studies outlined that nucleation phenomena governed local mineral growth poonoosamy et al 2016 prieto 2014 that pore pressure controlled crystal stability in confined media putnis and mauthe 2001 andra 2005 and that both processes collectively defined the possibility of precipitation in a given pore class emmanuel et al 2010 one could infer from these studies that the nature of precipitation and its feedback on diffusion is potentially governed by the pore size distribution of the hosted material than by the porosity volume of void itself contrary to the paradigm of the widely used archie s law these studies also outline that local mineral distribution and morphology can be used to qualitatively decipher the average change in intrinsic properties of a reacted sample furthermore formation of secondary minerals surfaces could also generate surface charge effects that were not visible in a porous material under intact form in this case ionic species diffusivity may differ from that of neutral species such as a water tracer depending upon ph electrolyte concentration and the presence of potential determining ions the sulfate alkali minerals may possess varying amounts of negative or positive surface charges gonzález caballero et al 1988 hang et al 2009 for instance chagneau et al 2015b investigated the impact of celestite precipitation on transport properties through compacted illite the authors showed that the reacted zone in illite allowed water tracer to diffuse whereas 36cl diffusion was completely restricted they proposed that the presence of additional negative surface charges on celestite combined with surface charges on illite resulted in total porosity clogging and restriction of 36cl diffusion through the reacted zone chagneau et al 2015b all of these experimental and theoretical observations indicate that reactive transport in porous media is a process that strongly couples chemical reactivity of minerals with local transport properties of the host pore structure the objective of the present work is twofold the first goal is to experimentally investigate the role of pore size distribution on barite precipitation in two reference porous media having similar initial diffusive properties but distinct pore size distributions chalk and compacted kaolinite barite was chosen as its formation is of concern in geothermal reservoirs and hydraulic fracturing mundhenk et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 and as it is capable of trapping radium in mill tailings of former uranium mines besançon et al 2020 chautard et al 2020 and in nuclear waste disposal facilities brandt et al 2018 vinograd et al 2018 the second objective is to quantify the impact of barite precipitates on diffusive transport properties neutral species tritiated water and ionic species 36cl were used as reference tracers since both the barite precipitates and the host pore surfaces were charged and therefore expected to generate a combined surface charge effect that could govern ionic species transport through the reacted samples results from these experiments may be used to improve safety assessments tests in sites of nuclear waste disposal and or carbon sequestration where robust numerical models are needed to predict the change in ionic transport properties diffusivity through host rocks in response to local clogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation and characterization kaolinite kga 2 clay powder with particle size 150 μm was provided by cnrs poitiers university this clay was saturated with na using five saturation cycles in a 1 mol l 1 nacl solution and a dialysis procedure was used to remove chloride from the samples until the silver nitrate test for cl was negative then each size fraction was air dried sieved through a 50 μm mesh to remove coarse aggregates and stored at 25 c chalk samples were selected from upper cretaceous formations belonging to the chalk aquifer of the paris basin in the champagne region france descostes et al 2012 rajyaguru et al 2019 the samples were derived from a core section 85 mm diameter of a borehole that crossed the lower campanian age stratigraphic layer approximately 83 my the extracted core was then sliced into 0 67 cm thick and 3 3 cm diameter slices perpendicular to the bedding plane using a diamond wire saw no lubricating fluid was used mercury intrusion and extrusion porosimetry miep characterization was carried out both on na kaolinite compacted at a dry density of 1690 kg m 3 and a chalk sample using a micromeritics autopore iii 9420 apparatus the total porosity and the mean pore throat derived from this analysis were 36 and 35 nm respectively for kaolinite and 45 and 660 nm for chalk 2 2 experimental setup used for kaolinite and chalk a schematic representation of the diffusion cell connected to two reservoirs used in kaolinite study is represented in figure s1 in supporting information the through diffusion setup developed by tertre et al 2018 was used for studying precipitation in the kaolinite sample this setup consists of a diffusion cell made of polyetheretherketone peek and characterized by an inner diameter of 9 49 mm and two aqueous counter reservoirs i e an upstream reservoir and a downstream reservoir the compacted kaolinite sample were prepared by a direct compaction in the diffusion cell at a bulk dry density of 1690 kg m 3 based on the dry mass of the solid placed in the cell and the volume of the cell leading to a sample thickness of 10 mm three porous layers were placed on each face of the sample they were composed of 1 whatman cellulose nitrate membrane filters manufactured by ge healthcare of 0 8 μm mesh 2 stainless steel filter plates pore diameter 10 μm from the mott industrial division and 3 two grids nominal spaces of 280 μm and 450 μm for monofilaments with diameters equal to 120 μm and 200 μm respectively from goodfellow these porous layers ensure homogeneous solution supply at each face of the sample the air from the sample pore space was replaced with pore water using ascendant capillary method in a vertically standing positioned diffusion cell in this method the downstream face was kept under vacuum by connecting the inlet and outlet holes to a vacuum pump simultaneously at upstream the inlet was connected to nitrogen pentoxide gas bottle while the outlet was connected to a 0 1 m nacl solution reservoir using a peristaltic pump the vacuum pump and nitrogen pentoxide were disconnected once solution from upstream reached the downstream face both faces were then connected to two reservoirs containing 0 1 m nacl solution and an equilibration process of two weeks was initiated to ensure an ionic charge balance between the reservoir electrolytes and the pore solution for the current study the first diffusion cell labeled kao a was used to acquire diffusion parameters for tritiated water hto and 36cl through kaolinite before and after the reactive diffusion experiment the second cell labeled kaob was used to determine the 3d evolution of barite precipitates in the kaolinite pore network 30 days and 60 days after the start of the reactive diffusion experiment using x ray microtomography investigation the barite precipitation experiments in chalk were carried out using a static diffusion cell as developed by descostes et al 2012 in this setup the chalk sample was sandwiched between upstream and downstream reservoirs with volumes of 178 ml and 140 ml respectively a schematic view is reported in figure s2 in supporting information a sample holder held the sandwiched sample and all the parts upstream reservoir sample sample holder and downstream reservoir were assembled glued and screwed together to generate a complete through diffusion cell two similar cells were prepared one for the determination of the radioactive tracer s diffusive behavior through intact and reacted chalk labeled cha a and the second one for the postmortem characterization of reacted chalk by x ray microtomography and sem observations labeled chab the details on the preparation of the cell the equilibration step and the concentration of ions in reservoir solutions can be found in rajyaguru et al 2019 2 3 barite precipitation in chalk and kaolinite in kaolinite sample precipitation was launched by replacing the upstream reservoir solution with 20 ml of fresh 100 mmol l 1 nacl solution containing 4 mmol l 1 of bacl2 and similarly the downstream reservoir solution was replaced with 20 ml of 100 mmol l 1 nacl solution containing 4 mmol l 1 na2so4 the upstream solution was spiked with 25 μl of 133ba source elsb45 cerca n 5245 with an activity of 1 78 mbq l 1 using the initial ratio of stable barium concentration and 133ba activity in upstream the sampled activities were converted into stable barium concentrations for this operation 100 μl of the upstream solution was periodically sampled and mixed with 900 μl of ultrapure water the activity measurement was determined using a gamma counter packard 1480 wizard similarly sulfate concentration was measured using ionic chromatography dionex 500 equipped with an as14 ionpac column in 100 μl of sampled downstream solution and diluted in 900 μl of ultrapure water for the chalk experiments the upstream reservoir was filled with a chalk equilibrated solution i e 160 mmol l 1 of nacl 20 mmol l 1 of cacl2 and 0 4 mmol l 1 of nahco3 containing 20 mmol l 1 of bacl2 downstream reservoir with 20 mmol l 1 na2so4 the reservoir monitoring protocol described for the kaolinite case was also used for chalk to obtain barium and sulfate concentration evolution throughout the duration of the experiments a detailed information of reservoirs solution chemistry obtained by rajyaguru et al 2019 is reported in table s1 in supporting information for both sample types the aim of periodic chemistry monitoring was to determine the time at which reactants achieve quasi equilibrium state in their respective reservoir such information is required to calculate the total barite amount having precipitated in samples and the time at which tracer diffusivity tests for reacted samples could be initiated one must note that in the rest of the article reservoirs labeled as upstream and downstream reservoir are used to distinguish barium and sulfate reservoirs and do not bear any advective meaning 2 4 postmortem 3d imaging μct 3d views of the barite precipitated zones in the kaolinite and chalk samples were obtained by performing x ray microtomography μct on the cells kao b and cell chab both cells had similar experimental conditions reactant concentration volume of reservoirs sample geometry as kao a and cha a cells for the kaolinite experiment after 30 days and 60 days since starting of the reactive diffusion experiment the circulation of reactants in kao b was temporarily stopped for 1 day the whole diffusion cell was disconnected from the reservoirs and placed in an x ray microtomography μct apparatus after tomography imaging the cell was connected back to the reservoirs to continue the barite precipitation process in the case of chalk the size of the experimental setup prevented any μct imaging during the experiment thus cha b cell was dismantled after 140 days and barite precipitated chalk sample was removed from the supporting ring and then used for imaging for both studies a skyscan 1272 microtomography apparatus brucker was used to acquire images the μct images for the kaolinite and chalk samples were compared to determine the formation of a precipitated zone in compacted porous media kaolinite and natural porous media micritic chalk in kaolinite the maximal spatial resolution of reacted zone was 16 μm due to sample size in chalk a piece of reacted zone considered as a representative elementary volume was imaged with a spatial resolution of 1 μm 2 5 tracers through diffusion tests for the kaolinite sample after the equilibration step of kao a sample explained in section 2 2 the upstream reservoir solution was completely replaced with 100 ml of fresh solution with 100 mmol l 1 of nacl this reservoir was spiked with 180 μl of tritiated water labeled cerca elsb45 n 760 112 4 and 65 μl of 36cl labeled e z 1760 100 1 to achieve volumetric activities of 1 mbq l 1 for hto and 0 5 mbq l 1 for 36cl similarly the downstream reservoir solution was replaced with 10 ml of fresh solution with 100 mmol l 1 of nacl to ensure a constant activity gradient between both reservoirs the downstream solution at each sampling was renewed with 10 ml of fresh solution the protocol to measure tracer activity is as follows 100 μl of the sampled solutions were mixed with 900 μl of ultrapure water and 4 ml of ultima gold scintillation liquid in a 5 ml scintillation bottle the activities were measured using a packard tri carb 2500 liquid scintillation recorder once tracer diffusivity was obtained at intact condition the tracers were out diffused from sample pore solution by replacing both reservoirs with 100 ml of tracer free solution for two weeks using reservoir monitoring step described in section 2 3 the reactant quasi equilibrium step was achieved after 85 days since the beginning of experiment at this stage hto and 36cl tracers with volumetric activities similar to the intact case 1 mbq l 1 for hto and 0 5 mbq l 1 for 36cl were directly injected into the upstream solution this step ensured that similar initial tracers activity values were achieved for pure diffusion and reactive diffusion step in the reactive diffusion experiment as the diffusive parameters were estimated under ongoing precipitation process a careful direct injection of tracer in upstream solution was done to ensure no disturbance of solution chemistry similarly the downstream solution at each sampling was not renewed contrary to intact case but the activity change was directly measured by a periodic withdrawal of 100 μl of solution from the reservoir one must note that the protocol for activity measurement using liquid scintillation recorder is the same as the protocol used at intact conditions for chalk water tracer diffusivity in an intact sample has already been reported in rajyaguru et al 2019 the barite precipitation process in cell cha a was continued for a total experimental time of 300 days one must note that the chemistry monitoring in this experiments was done only for 140 days at this stage the upstream solution was directly spiked with hto labeled cerca elsb45 n 760 112 4 and 36cl labeled e z 1760 100 1 to achieve volumetric activities of 0 40 mbq l 1 for hto and 0 30 mbq l 1 for 36cl respectively the protocol used for the measurement of the activity consisted of mixing 4 ml of ultima gold scintillation liquid with either 50 μl of the upstream solution plus 900 μl of ultrapure water or 1 ml of the downstream solution in a 5 ml scintillation bottle one milliliter of tracer free solution was added in the downstream reservoir of the chalk cell at each sampling to keep the volume of the downstream reservoir constant for kaolinite and chalk hto and 36cl diffusive parameters values in intact and reacted conditions were estimated by a numerical fitting of the activity data using i mode see next section 2 6 treatment of the experimental diffusive results the experimental activity datasets for both hto and 36cl were interpreted numerically using fick s second law for one dimensional transport crank 1975 1 c t d e α 2 c x 2 d e ε r d ρ app δ 2 c δ x 2 where c is the

were implemented in cea s interpretation model of diffusion experiments i mode tool radwan et al 2006 for the through diffusion setup the associated errors in the measured cumulative activities in the downstream reservoirs were calculated using the gaussian error propagation method the mathematical equation for this operation was taken from bazer bachi et al 2006 these equations are detailed in the supporting information note that the hto and 36cl diffusive data obtained on reacted samples were also interpreted using this simplified description of the current experimental system e g one dimensional transport charge induced mechanisms not taken into account in this case the limitations related to this modeling approach were acknowledged assuming that such interpretation should only bring indications about how diffusive transport is impaired 3 results 3 1 μct imaging of the barite precipitate the μct image of the chalk sample obtained after 140 days reported in fig 1a shows that barite precipitates form a thin reacted zone in the center of the sample for kaolinite the μct images reported in fig 1b obtained after 30 days and fig 1c obtained after 60 days show spherical barite precipitates evenly distributed in the reacted zone which is further slightly shifted towards barium inlet surface the shifting of the precipitated zone might be due combined effect of barium sorption on kaolinite pore surface barium distribution coefficient k d obtained from batch experiments is equal to 3 10 3 m3 kg 1 see supporting information and smaller self diffusion coefficient in water of ba2 compared to so4 2 ions d 0 ba 8 5 10 10 m2 s 1 vs d 0 so4 10 7 10 10 m2 s 1 li and gregory 1973 because the scan resolution 16 μm is much larger than the mean size of pores each of the spheres in reality represents a cluster of small barite precipitates distributed within the matrix see fig s4 in the supporting information for sem images acquired from a similar study 3 2 diffusion of hto and 36cl through intact materials the activity data for hto for intact chalk sample have been already reported in rajyaguru et al 2019 these authors estimated a value of d e hto chalk equal to 41 5 10 11 m2 s 1 the modeled experimental curve for hto at intact conditions is reported in fig 2 a for comparison with the reacted conditions we must recall that the chalk sample at intact conditions is composed of large pore volumes with pore throat of 660 nm at intact conditions it can be assumed that the effect of the chalk surface charge would be negligible on diffusivity of 36cl ion moreover the self diffusion coefficient of 36cl in water is slightly lower than hto li and gregory 1973 d 0 hto 2 10 10 m2 s 1 and d 0 36cl 1 7 10 10 m2 s 1 or d 0 hto d 0 36cl 1 17 using this relationship the diffusivity coefficient of 36cl at intact conditions in chalk can be assumed to be equal to d e 36cl chalk 35 3 10 11 m2 s 1 this value of effective diffusion coefficient was then used in i mode to calculate the modeled experimental curve of 36cl reported in fig 2 b for comparison for intact kaolinite the experimental cumulative activity data obtained for hto and 36cl are reported in fig 2 c d and they were numerically reproduced using i mode with d e hto kaolinite 29 10 11 m2 s 1 and d e 36cl kaolinite 24 10 11 m2 s 1 the values of effective diffusion coefficient for hto and 36cl are close to those determined by glaus et al 2010 for the kga 1b type of kaolinite at a dry density of 1900 kg m 3 the small difference in the effective diffusion coefficient values d e hto d e 36cl 1 20 for both species through intact kaolinite is within the expected limit thus diffusive tests show that both hto and 36cl tracers have a similar diffusion rate through kaolinite at a dry density of 1690 kg m 3 finally a complete overview of diffusive parameters obtained at intact conditions are summarized in table 1 3 3 diffusive property changes in chalk and kaolinite samples deduced from mass balance calculations and tracer tests fig 3a and fig 3b show the concentration evolution of reactants in the upstream and downstream reservoirs of cells cha a and kao a in both cases barium and sulfate ions were not detected in their counter reservoirs and were not reported in these figures since the solubility of barite is very low ksp barite 10 9 97 putnis et al 1995 the supersaturation to initiate precipitation around 10 4 to 10 5 mol l 1 of equal barium and sulfate concentrations is easily reached at this stage most of barium and sulfate ions would have participated in barite precipitation resulting in a porosity reduction in both samples after 140 days of experiment based on the barium concentration evolution in reservoirs the amount of barium contributing to barite precipitation in chalk and kaolinite was equal to 2 7 mmol and 0 04 mmol respectively using i a molar volume of 52 1 cm3 mol 1 for barite and ii the initial porosity the volume occupied by barite in chalk was 0 14 cm3 corresponding to overall 2 5 decrease in porosity at sample scale similarly for the kaolinite experiment barite precipitates occupied 0 0021 cm3 corresponding to an overall 0 5 decrease in porosity table s3 in supporting information to assess the impact of precipitation on diffusivity tracers tests were carried out for the kaolinite experiment once reservoir monitoring confirmed that quasi equilibrium state was reached i e after 85 days and for chalk experiment after 300 days fig 2 for chalk barite precipitation led to a significant decrease of hto and 36cl diffusivity values with d e hto chalk 13 5 10 11 m2 s 1 and d e 36cl chalk 1 1 10 11 m2 s 1 respectively values reported in table 1 similarly for kaolinite precipitation led to a hto diffusivity decrease with d e hto kaolinite 0 15 10 11 m2 s 1 and a total hindering of 36cl diffusion the modeled curves are reported in supporting information in fig s5 and the associated diffusivity coefficient values in supporting information in table s2 the calculated porosity values along with hto diffusivity data showed that barite precipitation led to a more significant change in kaolinite transport properties than for chalk 4 discussion 4 1 pore structure driven barite precipitation and changes in sample transport properties in section 3 1 post mortem characterization of chalk and kaolinite by μct imaging showed two distinct barite precipitate patterns in chalk sample evenly distributed barite precipitates formed a thin wall at the center of the sample whereas in kaolinite sample the barite precipitates formed evenly distributed isolated clusters over a broad zone in the center of the sample due to the sample geometry and adopted experimental approach it was not possible to quantify how these precipitates evolved over time at pore scale nevertheless observations from recent literature connected to present work can allow us to decipher key parameters governing distinct barite precipitation in chalk and kaolinite samples a study dealing with barite precipitation in compacted sand sample showed that barite would precipitate with two different growth rates in different pore volumes poonoosamy et al 2015 indeed these growth behaviors also controlled their final morphology and distribution in compacted sand samples poonoosamy et al 2016 this study showed micro crystalline barite precipitate growth in larger pore volumes 100 μm and nano crystalline barite precipitates growth on the small pore walls 10 μm the micro crystalline barite precipitated with a growth rate of 3 9 10 13 m2 s 1 whereas nano crystalline barite precipitated with a growth rate of 2 7 10 12 m2 s 1 indeed the supersaturation threshold to initiate micro crystalline barite precipitation was equal to 4 08 whereas nano crystalline barite precipitated at a lower supersaturation threshold value equal to 3 6 respectively prasianakis et al 2017 these calculations were based on classical nucleation theory that states that mineral forming from pore solution grows via homogeneous nucleation and mineral forming on a foreign substrate pore walls in this case grows via heterogeneous nucleation classical nucleation theory states that a mineral requires an interfacial energy to form stable precipitate as it grows on foreign substrate but mineral requires higher threshold energy to form from the pore solution kashchiev and van rosmalen 2003 nielsen and sohnel 1969 this interfacial energy is key to determine the cluster of nuclei required to form a stable precipitate and a given mineral could obtain different morphologies depending upon the nucleation path it undertakes to initiate precipitation henzler et al 2018 kawano et al 2009 loste et al 2004 prieto 2014 these observations present a direct link between pore volumes and mineral intrinsic property solubility growth rate controlling precipitation in a given pore size distribution in present study barite precipitation was initiated through a counter diffusion setup where ba2 ion from reservoir 1 and so4 2 ion from reservoir 2 would diffuse into the sample and progressively increase their concentration into the sample pore solutions interaction of both ions would supersaturate the pore solutions with respect to barite mineral in pores located in the first points of meeting over passage of time as more and more ba2 and so4 2 would diffuse and interact in these first points of meeting they would increase the barite supersaturation in pore volumes until a threshold is achieved from where barite precipitation could be initiated in these pore volumes as barite mineral starts to precipitate it consumes significant amount of ba2 and so4 2 ions from pore solution the chalk sample in our study is a natural material and it has larger heterogeneities in its pore structure these heterogeneities will control the local diffusion of ions from sample surface until the first points of meeting in the center of the sample generating a slight variation in local supersaturation in pores in the pores where threshold supersaturation is achieved depending upon their pore size precipitation is initiated and the transport experiment is no longer dependent upon pure diffusion these first precipitates would reduce barium and sulfate concentration in pore solutions and thus enhancing diffusion of these ions towards these pores from neighboring pore solution leading to evolution of reacted front around these first points of precipitation along with low solubility barite also possess slow kinetics of precipitation as mean pore size of chalk sample is 660 nm a longer time is required to fill such pores with barite mineral this means that a concentration gradient between these pores of first precipitation and neighboring pores continues for a longer time and ba2 and so4 2 diffusion is restricted around these pores it is for this reason most of the barite precipitation is restricted to the center of the sample in chalk case the mean pore throat of kaolinite sample is 35 nm that is 19 times smaller than for chalk sample this means that once precipitation is initiated in pore volumes it will take much shorter time to fill these pore volumes than the large pore volumes in chalk case these precipitates even in small volumes would strongly reduce the pore size and generate partially filled pores where surface charge effects between barite wall and kaolinite wall will start to become dominant for ionic diffusion due to such restriction there is no further concentration gradient possible between these pore volumes and neighboring pore volumes and resulting in pore connectivity loss thus ba2 and so4 2 ions will need to find another pathway to meet and supersaturate pore solution to initiate precipitation the low solubility of barite will ensure that supersaturation in such other places is easily achieved as more and more of such pores are filled all the possible pore connectivity allowing ba2 and so4 2 to meet and supersaturate pore solution is completely restricted finally the evolution of this system should stop connected pathways required for so4 2 to diffuse and meet ba2 to supersaturate the pore solutions such sharper pore filling also resulted in broader precipitation front where precipitates are evenly distributed it is noteworthy that the reliability of this hypothesis can only be fully assessed by performing a rather advanced modeling incorporating all these coupled mechanisms which is out of the scope of this study the diffusion tests conducted before and after precipitation experiments showed that generation of barite precipitated zone had distinct impact on transport properties of chalk and kaolinite samples in chalk this precipitation process led to hto diffusivity decrease by a factor of 2 and 36cl diffusivity decrease by a factor of 30 to further analyze the impact of pore connectivity loss on global transport properties of samples let us consider the chalk reacted zone thickness equal to 500 μm with maximum and minimum thicknesses of 1 mm and 300 μm respectively similarly the thickness of barite reacted zone in kaolinite sample is approximately equal to 2 mm with maximum and minimum thicknesses equal to 3 mm and 1 mm respectively these values were estimated from μct images and sem observations see fig s2 and fig s3 in the supporting information for each selected thickness mass balance calculations were performed to determine residual porosity in the reacted zones of chalk and kaolinite samples the minimum and maximum porosity reduction values for each case are also reported in table 1 considering the mean experimental thickness barite precipitation led to chalk porosity reduction from 45 to 12 and for kaolinite porosity decreases from 36 to 34 5 respectively these data apparently contradict the drastic drop of diffusivity in kaolinite considering the rather moderate decrease of porosity in the reacted zone compared to chalk table 1 to further discuss this point we calculated the corresponding values of geometric factor which takes into account the effect of tortuosity and constrictivity of the pore space table 1 the concept of geometric factor and associated diffusivity calculations are explained in supporting information in chalk barite precipitation decreased geometric factor of hto by a factor of 8 due to its limited diffusion through the remaining connected pore network in 12 of residual porosity in this pore network the partially filled pores with smaller diameter and strong edl effects between barite and chalk surface would further impose strong restricted 36cl diffusion it is for this reason barite precipitation led to decrease in geometric factor for 36cl by a factor of 115 for kaolinite mass balance calculations showed that barite precipitation resulted in 1 5 porosity decrease and 34 5 residual porosity in reacted zone however diffusivity tests for hto show its diffusivity decrease by a factor of 200 and geometric factor decrease by a factor of 1000 these results show that the residual porosity in the reacted zone contains very small connected network that would allow hto diffusion the partially filled pores in residual porosity have very small pore sizes 35 nm with strong charge effects between kaolinite and barite surface thus this connected network is not accessible for 36cl ion transport and resulting in its complete diffusion restriction 4 2 ionic transport alteration driven by local barite precipitation in previous section we noted that barite precipitation led to generation of two distinct connected network within the reacted zone each of this reacted zone contains 1 pore completely filled with barite 2a pore partially filled with small volume of barite 2b pore filled with significant volume of barite 3 empty pores with no presence of barite the pores fully occupied with barite would correspond to dead end pores through which no diffusion could occur the partially filled pores with small and significant barite volumes along with empty pores would account for pore connectivity in reacted zone and possible hto and 36cl diffusion since diffusion tests showed contradictory diffusive behavior of both tracers through reacted zones of chalk and kaolinite sample the simple 1d diffusion equation reported in section 2 5 is unable to explain underlying causes for contradictory diffusion behavior of hto and 36cl before and after precipitation process moreover the water layer adjacent to mineral surface generates electric double layer of either negative or positive charge depending on the charge of this surface and that of the ions the diffusion of the ions may be retarded appelo and wersin 2007 sposito 2008 stumm and morgan 2012 moreover natural chalk materials and kaolinite are also known to present surface charge at full water saturation conditions al mahrouqi et al 2017 andra 2005 in present study depending upon the size of newly formed residual pore volumes the thickness of free water layer would vary and it is sandwiched in between newly formed surfaces composed of either barite barite barite chalk or barite kaolinite respectively barite mineral surface charge can be controlled and even reversed by varying ph ionic strength and by increasing the presence of potential determining ions pdis such as ba2 and so4 2 bokern et al 2003 hang et al 2007 depending upon the local pore chemistry each pore volume could either possess positive surface charge where 36cl diffusion could be retarded or negative surface charge which could inhibit 36cl diffusion indeed the strength of these surface charges depend upon the pore size local ionic strength and presence of potential determining ions thus combination of these pore volumes generate a residual pore size distribution with varying electric double layer thickness and surface charge in each pore indeed the theoretical and experimental works carried by muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 soler et al 2019 tournassat and steefel 2015 show that such varying pore volumes clearly control the nature of cationicpr and anionic species transport to explore such surface charge effects on ion mobility electrophoretic mobility using zeta potential measurements was determined in the current study on chalk kaolinite and barite powder under the different pore chemistry found in our reactive experiments for that purpose barium or sulfate was added in chalk or kaolinite pore water solutions at a concentration varying from 10 to 5 mol l 1 to 10 2 mol l 1 these values were chosen assuming that when hto and 36cl diffusion tests are launched the reacted zone can be then divided into two main zones the first zone called zone ba would contain precipitates that are equilibrated with pore solution containing an excess of barium ions that cannot easily diffuse anymore through the reacted zone in this case one can assume that the barium concentration value would be close to the value measured in the upstream reservoir when the quasi equilibrium is reached i e ca 5 10 3 and ca 1 5 10 3 mol l 1 in chalk or kaolinite experiments respectively fig 3 similarly precipitates in second zone called zone so4 would be equilibrated with pore solution containing an excess of sulfate ions with concentrations close to ca 1 10 3 and ca 1 5 10 3 mol l 1 in chalk or kaolinite experiments respectively fig 3 conversely sulfate or barium concentrations in zone ba or zone so4 resp should be controlled by the barite solubility at a value close to 10 5 mol l 1 for each case three replicates of batch experiments were prepared consisting of 0 06 g of mineral powder suspended in 9 ml of pore water the suspended solution was equilibrated by shaking tube for 15 h finally 1 ml of solution was injected in zetameter setup labeled zetasizer nano from malvern panalytical and the evolution of zeta potential was measured with the mean acquisition time of 2 3 min for chalk or barite powder suspended in chalk pore water the ph was equal to 7 6 or 7 2 respectively for kaolinite or barite suspended in kaolinite pore water the ph was equal to 5 8 or 5 5 respectively zeta potential results reported in fig 4 indicate that barite powder showed positive zeta potential values under all the experimental conditions except in the case of sulfate concentration greater than 10 3 mol l 1 in chalk pore water chalk powder surface was always negatively charge independently of the reactant concentration while kaolinite was mainly under negative form except for barium concentration higher than 10 3 mol l 1 based on these data and on how barite precipitation mechanisms can occur in confined pores we propose a schematic representation of newly formed surfaces in the reacted zone and their possible impact of solute diffusion fig 5 case 1 concerns large pores completely filled with barite mineral in chalk sample these pores contribute as dead end pores and contribute to no diffusion of both hto and 36cl case 2 deals with smaller pores found both in chalk and kaolinite materials where barite precipitation has occurred on the kaolinite chalk pore surface in case 2a barite overgrowth partially masks covers the initial material for chalk case 2a cha shows two possible scenarios where one side of pore composed of chalk surface will always maintain negative surface charge the other side of pore surface is composed of barite of either negative or positive surface charge depending upon pdis concentration in contrast case 2a kao shows pores composed on one side with positively charged kaolinite surface and on other side with either negatively or positively charged barite surface both of these cases clearly show the distinct evolution of surface charge properties for barite precipitation in kaolinite and chalk samples finally barite overgrowth can also completely cover the pore surface and would remain in direct contact with the remaining pore water case2b thus in such pores for both chalk and kaolinite case the pdis would control barite surface charge that in turn governs the nature of ionic transport both of case 1 and case 2 a b could explain the selective restriction of anionic species transport through the reacted zones of chalk and kaolinite samples nevertheless as kaolinite pore volumes are much smaller compared to chalk barite precipitation would significantly reduce the diameter of these pores thus the newly formed surface charge properties in case2a kao and case2b kao would have a much more pronounced effect on ionic transport in the kaolinite case these considerations may satisfactorily explain the reduction of 36cl diffusivity in chalk and its complete restriction in kaolinite after the occurrence of clogging phenomenon in the future course of this project dedicated complementary post mortem analyses such as fib sem xrf xrd measurements are planned to be carried out to determine precipitates morphology in pores smaller than 50 nm with possibility of determining concentration of residual ionic species such investigation would further bring in new arguments to quantify the analysis presented in this work the experimental results presented in this work also highlight the limitation of simple diffusion equation reported in section 2 5 without taking into account edl effects to quantify such effects surface charge behavior of barite barite barite chalk barite kaolinite with varying free water thickness ph is and potential determining ion concentrations is being studied using a multi component diffusion theory the authors believe that such numerical task in future scope of work will further strengthen arguments presented in this article 5 conclusions the present study aimed at understanding pore scale clogging mechanism under diffusive controlled transport regime it is expected that such process would affect containment properties of natural rocks that are envisaged i to host deep geological facilities for radioactive waste storage or ii as cap rocks for global carbon sequestration the investigation of barite precipitation in chalk and compacted kaolinite samples showed that in a diffusion controlled transport pore size distribution is key in controlling the initiation points of precipitation these points of initiation would then determine the final pattern of reacted zone and generate a unique feedback on transport properties of the porous sample moreover the electrophoretic measurements also showed that ph and pdis can have a tremendous influence on transport of ionic species during clogging process the emerging local chemical complexities mineral distribution mineral surface charge could then potentially change the nature of ionic transport through the newly formed reacted zone the experiments performed with two different materials evidenced that clogging was mainly driven by local physicochemical process pore structure effects combined with mineral reactivity in this case averaged porosity loss alone in clogged zone is not sufficient to determine the alteration extent of rock transport properties the present work therefore shows that the applicability of relationships such as archie s law is limited in this context and that there is a need to quantify the nature of clogging in porous material of

1392,to support the environmental monitoring of nuclear sites reactive transport models used to predict the migration of contaminants such as strontium 90 90sr in soils sediments and aquifers are developed continuously tested and improved this study aims at assessing the adequacy of the multi site ion exchanger model msie based on a component additivity approach and coupled to the advection dispersion equation ade to simulate sr transport in a clayey sandstone and a bt soil horizon we have also compared the performance of the modelling approach with simulation results obtained by considering a kd approach constant kd transport experiments were performed in centimetre and decimetre scale columns in order to test the model sensitivities to the mineral abundance and the specificities of their reactive parameters non reactive transport experiments with conservative tracers allowed us to determine the transport parameters such as porosity and dispersivity in this paper we have compared the sr transport simulation results with sr experimental breakthrough curves acquired at various flow velocities the simulations results show that the kd approach can reproduce experimental data in the case of the clayey sandstone when a certain amount of uncertainty is accepted whereas the additivity approach better fits the sr reactive transport in both columns especially the maximum value without it being necessary to adjust the parameters these results advocate for more complex retention models than kd to better understand and improve the robustness of sr transport predictions the clay content the relative abundance of illite and smectite and the clay mineral specificity are all sensitive parameters when it comes to defining the reactive system involved in sr transport simulation the results highlight the influence of illite in the spreading of the sr breakthrough curve especially through its low capacity and high selectivity site this implies having access to a robust and extensive set of retention parameters acquired on reference minerals in this study the results obtained for the clayey sandstone confirm the robustness of our selected parameters when clay minerals have similar reactivity levels as the reference minerals this set of parameters appears more limited in the case of the bt soil containing weathered or evolved minerals the choice of modelling approach is therefore crucial for accurately modelling and predicting sr transport behaviour in porous media as is the representativeness of the minerals in the database keywords illite smectite strontium reactive transport ion exchange model 1 introduction 90sr is a product of uranium and plutonium fission generated in nuclear reactors and is one of the most abundant radioisotopes released into the environment because of weapons testing and nuclear accidents kashparov et al 2003 90sr 29 years half life is highly soluble and its sorption is strongly affected by competition with major cations in solution i e with ca and mg moreover it generally does not remain on the soil surface like cs berns et al 2018 which facilitates its migration to greater depths to support the environmental monitoring of nuclear sites reactive transport models are being developed to simulate the migration of contaminants such as 90sr in soils sediments and aquifers the key requirement being a robust predictive performance reactive transport processes i e advection dispersion and diffusion coupled with chemical reactions involving precipitation dissolution or adsorption desorption generally control contaminant migration in natural environments they result in retarded migration often expressed by a delay with respect to water tracers or by tails in the breakthrough curve liu et al 2017 the time dependence of reactive transport requires examining both transport processes and reactivity formalisms used in the modelling approaches the sorption of contaminants has been modelled using simple empirical retention models such as linear constant distribution coefficient kd langmuir or freundlich sorption isotherms bachhuber et al 1982 hölttä et al 1997 cui and eriksen 1998 fesch et al 1998 palagyi and stamberg 2010 however such models provide specific and contextual parameters determined in precise physicochemical conditions and therefore often fail to be predictive for instance szenknect et al 2008 simulated sr transport through a sandy soil column using a constant kd these authors highlighted the fact that sr reactive transport deviates from classical reactive transport including a retardation factor although sr sorption was described as instantaneous reversible and with a linear reaction at trace concentration szenknect et al 2005 wissocq et al 2018 moreover to simulate sr transport in field experiments through aeolian sand sampled from the chernobyl site bugai et al 2012 found kd values to be the most sensitive parameter in the model in this study the kd values obtained by laboratory batch tests szenknect et al 2005 had to be adjusted to match the simulation outcomes with the observed data the mismatch was attributed to geochemical disturbances involving changes in the competing cation i e ca concentration in solution bugai et al 2020 cautioned against the concomitance of the adsorption desorption reaction with other chemical processes in the natural environment modelling on an aquifer scale can then be distorted by taking into account kd values measured in the laboratory that are not representative of the processes involved another approach consists in coupling transport and thermodynamic retention models to account for varying physicochemical conditions in the media ion exchange models have often been retained for multi components materials valocchi et al 1981a 1981b schweich and sardin 1981 appelo 1994 vulava et al 2000 steefel et al 2003 lichtner et al 2004 missana et al 2008 tournassat et al 2013 despite better consideration of the chemical reactions by these retention models some authors were required to adjust the sorption parameters obtained in batch experiments for trace elements static conditions in order to reproduce reactive transport data steefel et al 2003 szenknect et al 2005 therefore diminishing the predictability of these reactive transport models to apply the retention parameters acquired in dispersed multicomponent media i e batch experiments to compacted media i e column or field experiment it must be assumed that the entire solid is in contact with solution so that all the sorption sites are called into play in the reactive process among the tested approaches the generalised composite approach consists in considering only one ion exchange site bearing component to reflect the material s reactivity however it was previously shown that the strongest affinity for trace elements i e sr zn tl cs on clay minerals is associated to specific sorption sites poinssot et al 1999 missana et al 2008 2014 altmann et al 2014 wissocq et al 2017 martin et al 2018 latrille et al 2019 tournassat et al 2013 which are usually not differentiated in such a retention approach by using a generalised composite approach voegelin et al 2000 and vulava et al 2002 were able to use the same dataset in static and dynamic conditions to reproduce the transport of major elements ca mg and na and sr in trace form szenknect et al 2008 however this approach is restricted to a specific context which constrains its extrapolation to other multi component materials and extended environmental conditions vulava et al 2002 compared various exchange models and evidenced a significant improvement was gained with a multi site cation exchange model to predict the transport behaviour of the major cations lu et al 2014 also made this assessment and used such a model to cover a large range of chemical conditions without any adjustable parameters another approach is to resort to a multi site ion exchanger model using a component additivity approach which takes into account the retention of contaminants on pure mineral phases peynet 2003 so as to predict the retention of a multi component assemblage wissocq et al 2018 demonstrated its efficiency by predicting sr retention on a clayey sandstone without adjusting any of the parameters coupled with a transport model this multi site ion exchanger model has proved efficient in predicting the reactive transport of key elements na and ca in a pure phase and a soil using the same dataset in static and dynamic conditions tertre et al 2013 lu et al 2014 this study aims at assessing the adequacy of the multi site ion exchanger model coupled with a transport model to simulate sr transport in natural materials in this framework the material retention properties were taken into account by the additivity approach based on their mineralogical compositions in reactive phases furthermore the performance of our modelling approach was also compared against simulation results obtained by considering a kd approach which is commonly used in environmental impact calculations the sensitivity of the additivity approach was tested by comparing sr transport simulations carried out using data acquired by latrille et al 2017 with data from new experiments in a column filled with a clayey sandstone on the scale of the centimetre and decimetre for this purpose the influence of i the mineral abundance and ii the reactive parameters of these minerals on the simulation results was evaluated to do this we used breakthrough curves established on the basis of two different length scales columns in order to explore the scope of this approach a bt soil horizon latrille et al 2017 lu et al 2014 was chosen with relative abundances of illite and smectite differing to those found in the clayey sandstone the simulations were performed by coupling the advection dispersion equation ade with the multi site ion exchanger model msie using both the sorption property database for illite and smectite recently established in batch experiments by wissocq et al 2018 and the specific experimental input parameters relative to each operating condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the first material was a clayey sandstone cs which has already been described in detail by wissocq et al 2018 this clayey material was sampled from a depth of 31 m in the miocene geological formation located at the cadarache nuclear research centre france the rock sample was manually crushed air dried and sieved at 300 μm and 200 μm the crushed bulk material was used to fill the decimetre scale column whereas a dried 300 200 μm fraction was selected for the centimetre scale column the 25 μm fraction was isolated from the raw cs by dispersion in water followed by sieving to 25 μm the mineralogical composition was determined by x ray diffraction xrd on air dried powder for the bulk material and on air dried deposits and deposits saturated with ethylene glycol for the 25 μm fraction identification of crystallised phases was performed using the clayxr software bouchet 1992 and newmod software reynolds 1985 was used for quantification the bulk material was mainly composed of quartz 75 wt clay minerals 20 wt carbonates 2 5 wt and iron oxides 2 5 wt the xrd mineralogical quantification of the 25 μm fraction extracted from the raw material revealed about 32 wt of kaolinite 20 wt illite 19 wt smectite 2 wt chlorite 17 wt quartz and 10 wt goethite and no carbonates cation exchange capacity cec measurements on raw material 300 200 μm and 25 μm fractions were performed by k cs cation exchange at ph 9 the resulting average value were respectively 0 112 0 006 0 064

considered as a non reactive phase weighted by their relative abundance chlorite and kaolinite contributed to the material exchange capacity at a level equivalent to the cec measurement uncertainty 0 020 eq kg 6 3 of material cec consequently smectite and illite were assumed to govern the sorption processes the reactive phases were therefore estimated equivalent to 27 7 of illite and 26 7 of smectite in the 25 μm fraction illite and smectite content in the raw soil and in the 300 200 μm fraction are calculated by weighting their amount in the 25 μm fraction to the cec of the corresponding material the second material investigated in this study was a bt horizon of a luvisol bt previously described and studied by lamy et al 2006 and lu et al 2014 the grain size distribution of this sandy clay horizon was 70 7 wt of sand 8 9 wt of silt and 20 4 wt of clay and it contained only 0 34 wt of organic matter the 2 mm air dried soil was sieved at 300 μm and 250 μm to extract the material used to fill the centimetre scale column the cec was measured at 0 13 0 01 eq kg lu et al 2014 and this fraction contained 18 wt of clay the clay minerals identified by xrd were kaolinite illite and illite smectite mixed layers clay minerals were quantified by modelling the x ray diffraction pattern in both air dried and ethylene glycol solvated states acquired on the clay size fraction with the sybilla software developed by chevron aplin et al 2006 the assemblage consisted of discrete illite 2 3 mixed layers illite smectite with 56 2 is 40 60 and 5 1 is 29 71 and discrete smectite 36 4 for the purpose of modelling the mineralogical composition of the clay size fraction was therefore assimilated to 26 2 of illite and 73 8 of smectite 2 1 1 solutions and analytical methods all chemicals used

solution 2h concentrations were analysed with a deuterium analyser los gatos research liquid water stable isotope analyser cl concentrations were measured by ionic chromatography cl and i concentrations were also directly measured using an on line electrical conductivity cell in the centimetre and decimetre column devices the ph was measured using a combined glass ph electrode mettler toledo equipped with an ag agcl reference electrode the electrode was calibrated with buffer solutions at ph 4 7 and 12 2 2 column transport experiments 2 2 1 experimental set ups column transport experiments were performed on a centimetre and a decimetre scale column both columns were placed in two adapted set ups designed according to the same configuration shown in fig 1 and si 1 latrille et al 2017 this configuration included an hplc pump hitachi lachrom elite l 2130 which regulated the flow rate through the column two conductivity cells and ph electrodes amersham biosciences were placed on line arranged on each side of the column finally a fraction collector omnicoll lamda was used to receive and sequentially redistribute the outflowing solution in aliquots outflow tracer concentrations were then analysed by ion chromatography cl electrical conductivity cai2 and icp ms sr for the column experiments performed on a centimetre scale si 1 two glass chromatography columns omnifit were filled by successively adding the material respectively cs material in column c1 and bt material in column c3 compacted using a uniaxial press to achieve a packed length of 7 1 cm and a diameter 1 cm table 1 summarises the details of the packed columns according to their geometric and physical features the columns were saturated from the bottom with the deaerated 10 2 m cacl2 background solution and conditioned until equilibrium with this solution by flowing ca 500 pore volumes vp through column c1 and 200 vp through column c3 at decimetre scale fig 1 the column experiments were performed by using the beeti experimental device latrille and cartalade 2010 it was composed of a vertical polycarbonate column filled with bulk cs compacted in a uniaxial press a controlled hydraulic circuit that enforced tracer migration and a dichromatic x ray spectrometer dxs based on x ray attenuation measurements porous material properties porosity bulk density water content and clay proportion and resident concentrations of attenuating tracers can be quantified down the entire column fig 1 these measurements were used to evaluate the solid homogeneity and the water content in the compacted column moreover depending on the calibration process the clay proportion distribution along the column can also be estimated resident concentration profiles of the inert tracer cai2 were measured at eight specific locations down the column in order to determine the variability of dispersivity x ray attenuation measurements were performed using a dichromatic x ray spectrometer dxs which combined an x ray generator and a nai detector latrille and cartalade 2010 latrille and néel 2013 the x ray beam was emitted in two energy ranges 20 40 kev and 50 75 kev after crossing the column filled with the porous material the nai detector measured the beam count rate the source and detector were simultaneously moved up and down the column by a controlled rack rail fig 1 and kept at specified locations 0 x 32 cm during a set counting time 80 s the x ray count rate measured by the detector depended on the thickness and the type of the phases encountered on the transmission path fluid bulk cs or clay and inert cai2 tracer as well as on the counting time at each longitudinal location x on the column the thickness of each phase was determined by solving the beer lambert s law eq 1 1 i i 0 exp i μ i ρ i z i where i 0 is the count rate emitted by the source i is the count rate detected per unit time for a given x ray energy range and transmitted throughout a column slice 5 mm 20 mm index i represents each phase contained in the medium clay or bulk cs background solution solute tracer μ i m2 kg is the mass attenuation coefficient which depends on the phase composition and on the x ray energy ρ i kg m3 is the density and z i m is the thickness of the phase the mass attenuation coefficients of clay bulk cs background solution 10 2 m cacl2 and tracer solution cai2 were therefore determined in this configuration using specific standards defined on the basis of the component chemical composition calibration sequences were performed prior to experiments as detailed in latrille and néel 2013 to acquire the bulk cs standard and the clay standard a specific calibration allowed us to then determine the clay mineral attenuation by accounting for its chemical composition acquired on the clay fraction extracted from bulk material the clay mineral attenuation is distinguished from that of sand in order to calculate the relative proportion of clay at each x position along the column the resident tracer concentration was calculable with the cai2 concentration determined by converting the corrected count rate of the low energy x ray range using eq 1 during the tracer experiment at each selected x measurements were repeated at a frequency of four to ten minutes to yield the profiles of the resident tracer concentrations the porosity and clay proportion scanned along the column c2 are given in fig 2 the porosity appears to be relatively regular from the bottom up to 30 cm with a value of 0 326 0 015 it then increases to 0 38 for the last two centimetres the clay fraction distribution followed the inverse trend of porosity distribution the material being less dense in the upper part of the column the average clay fraction was estimated at 0 208 0 018 despite a lower compaction state limited to the upper part of the column the standard deviation of the clay fraction and porosity remained small consequently the material filling this column can be considered as sufficiently well compacted to assume a homogeneous column for the modelling approach because ca is the major exchangeable cation in the natural material and in order to study competition between sr and ca only all columns were then saturated and ca conditioned by injection in the upward direction of around 800 vp of de aerated cacl2 10 2 m solution ph 6 5 at a constant flow rate 6 10 cm3 h 1 after saturation and conditioning sorption sites of the clayey sandstone were mainly occupied by ca2 and h 2 2 2 operating and experimental conditions after the conditioning step a de aerated 10 2 m cacl2 background solution was injected at a constant flow rate through the column in an upward direction as steady flow was achieved a tracer solution was also injected at the same steady flow rate through the column inlet this was done by either using an injection loop filled with a tracer solution columns c1 and c3 or by switching to a tracer bottle column c2 a loop volume of 20 8 cm3 containing tracer solutions was injected into column c1 and c3 whereas a volume of 2500 cm3 was injected into column c2 the outflowing solution was collected as aliquots every 10 or 15 min depending on the flow rate to be analysed the flow rate was controlled by weighing the collected aliquots moreover the flow rate in column c2 was also controlled by weighing the inflow bottle during the experimental time the non reactive tracers chosen for these experiments were 2h 2h 1h 2000 cl and i 10 1 m in the centimetre scale columns and i in the decimetre scale column in case of the inert cai2 tracer the ph and electrical conductivity were monitored at the column inlet and outlet and the tracer concentration was recorded the initial tracer solution contained a mixture of ca 10 4 m srcl2 and ca 10 2 m cacl2 the precise composition of the solutions used for each experiment was analytically controlled no soluble natural sr lixiviated from cs and bt soil has been previously significantly measured by icp ms consequently natural sr was neglected in cation exchange process the experimental parameters are summarised in table 2 3 reactive transport modelling as mentioned above the objectives of this study are to evaluate the additive approach so as to simulate sr transport in two component materials thus the experimental results were interpreted by coupling the multi site ion exchanger model with a transport model 3 1 sr sorption model a multi site ion exchanger model the multi site ion exchanger model msie used in this study has already been described in detail by motellier et al 2003 jacquier et al 2004 tertre et al 2009 savoye et al 2012 lu et al 2014 reinoso maset and ly 2014 siroux et al 2017 2018 and wissocq et al 2018 in this model the ion exchanger is composed of one or several negatively charged minerals the latter typically have their own negative sorption sites called xi able to sorb cations the ion exchange models initially designed only allow the interpretation of ion exchange in terms of equilibrium and not reaction mechanisms thus they consider that all sites behave indistinctly in the same way for clay minerals various adsorption sites result from isomorphic substitution of lattice cations and hydroxyl groups sensitive to ph the sorption sites are distinguished by their exchange capacities cei without any structural assignment then they are assumed as an intrinsic sorbent characteristic proton is the reference competing cation due to its small size and its occurrence in solution in this approach the equilibrium expression below can be used to express the ion exchange reaction related to the sorption site x i with cations mm including h selected as the reference eq 2 2 m x i h m m x i m m m m h with an associated apparent equilibrium constant eq 3 the selectivity coefficient ki which includes the unknown activity coefficient of the adsorbed species see wissocq et al 2018 as defined as below 3 k mh m m i x i m m m h m γ h m x i h m m m γ m m where i is the type of sorption site is the concentration of species in solution mol l 1 or sorbed species mol kg 1 of dry solid and γ is the activity coefficient of the species in solution in this study the selectivity coefficient of sr2 ca2 exchange is calculated for each site by combining ca2 2h and sr2 2h exchanges defined as follows 4 k ca 2 2 h i x i h 2 ca 2 γ ca 2 x i 2 ca 2 h 2 γ h 2 5 k sr 2 2 h i x i h 2 sr 2 γ sr 2 x i 2 sr 2 h 2 γ h 2 the site capacity cei is the sum of adsorbed species concentration per site eq 6 and the sum of site capacities has to be equal to the cec 6 ce i 2 x i 2 sr 2 2 x i 2 ca 2 x i h ca2 selectivity coefficients are estimated for illite and smectite from ca saturation curves as a function of ph saturation curves permit to quantify experimentally the exchange capacity of major sites depending on their saturation evidenced by ca2 2h exchange they express the adsorbed species concentration mol kg of solid versus ph similarly the minor site capacity is estimated on the sr2 adsorbed concentration versus sr concentration curve reversible sr adsorption reactions on ca illite and ca smectite have been verified experimentally by desorption experiments performed respecting the physico chemical conditions of each adsorption experiments this validates the adsorption desorption reaction by cation exchange then sr2 selectivity coefficients are estimated for illite and smectite from both ph and concentration sorption curves wissocq et al 2018 eqs 4 5 and 6 are adjusted to the experimental adsorption isotherms by non linear regression using excel solver uncertainties on estimated selectivity coefficient were calculated by using the solveraid macro de levie 2004 to apply this model on a natural soil or sediment by using a component additivity approach it is assumed that the site capacities of the mineralogical assemblage are the sum of the site capacities of each reactive mineral component weighted by their relative abundance in the assemblage in the two mineralogical systems selected for this study illite and smectite mainly govern the sorption properties by ion exchange processes consequently the cec of each material results on the contribution of illite and smectite and can be expressed by eq 7 7 cec material i x illite ce i illite x smectite ce i smectite where xillite and xsmectite are the illite and smectite abundance in the material and ceiillite and ceismectite represent the illite and smectite xi site capacity respectively the selectivity coefficients of the mineralogical assemblage restricted to a illite and smectite mixture combine those which were determined on each site of pure illite and smectite in the batch experiments by wissocq et al 2018 they are summarised in table 3 this multi site ion exchanger model was implemented in the phreeqc code using the exchange data block corrected selectivity coefficients obtained from the multi site ion exchanger formalism were converted into the gaines thomas formalism used by phreeqc the differences between k 2h ca 2 i and k 2h sr 2 i on the major illite sites are small given their uncertainties only a significant difference is noticeable on the xh site table 3 consequently the sr selectivity compared to this of ca is expressed by the negative value of logk sr 2 ca 2 i by neglecting this minor site xh the reactivity of sr is comparable to that of ca as it is classically done by considering one site wahlberg et al 1965 for smectite the differences are not very significant according to the uncertainties of the selectivity coefficients therefore the small difference in affinity between sr and ca is mainly due to the reactivity on xh site of illite this suggests that smectite plays a secondary role in the global reactivity of materials towards sr 3 2 reactive transport model transport processes are computed via the advection dispersion equation ade 8 r x θ x t c x t x q d x c x t θ x d x x c x t with qd representing the darcy flow velocity cm h 1 θ representing the porosity c the solute concentration mol l 1 r the retardation factor and d the apparent dispersion coefficient cm2 h the retardation factor can be calculated by the following equation 9 r 1 ρkd θ with ρ representing the mass density of solid and kd the distribution coefficient r may depend on location x in the column when ρ and θ are spatially variable however in this study we checked that the porous media were packed homogeneously and the transport parameters were considered uniform with x consequently chemical retention can be expressed by eq 9 with a constant kd the retardation factor of a conservative tracer is equal to 1 the apparent dispersion coefficient is therefore calculated as follows 10 d τ d 0 λ v x with d o being the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water cm2 h τ the tortuosity λ the dispersivity cm and v the pore velocity defined as v x q d θ x cm h the tortuosity was calculated following the millington and quirk 1961 equation the hydrus 1d code was used to simulate the conservative tracer experiments and the reactive transport experiment considering the constant kd approach reactive tracer experiments were also simulated using the hp1 multicomponent transport module of hydrus 1d jacques and šimůnek 2010 this module couples hydrus 1d with the phreeqc version 4 biogeochemical code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the column geometry was modelled using a 1d cartesian domain columns c1 and c3 were discretized with 100 cells and column c2 with 350 cells the columns were considered as physically and chemically uniform soil profiles the water flux was used for the flow boundary condition for conservative transport experiments and sr transport in c1 and c3 the flow conditions imposed a dispersive hydrodynamic regime for experiments in the c2 column the slow flow velocities required taking into account a diffusion process at the inlet a constant tracer flux was imposed during the injection time and a zero concentration gradient was selected as the outlet condition the input parameters measured experimentally were dispersivity porosity flow velocity solution compositions and clay minerals characteristics relative to each material site capacities corrected selectivity coefficients the molecular diffusion coefficients for sr ca and cl were 7 91 10 6 7 92 10 6 and 2 03 10 5 cm2 s 1 respectively mills and lobo 1989 dispersivity was estimated by using dedicated deuterated water 2h the cacl2 and cai2 transport experiment at centimetre scale table 2 and the cai2 transport experiment only at decimetre scale by using the inverse module of hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 the levenburg marquardt algorithm was used to fit the nonlinear equations to experimental data the illite and montmorillonite characteristic inputs for simulations performed with hp1 take into account the respective site densities and selectivity coefficients weighted by the amount of every phase in each column the solution compositions were 10 2 m cacl2 as the background solution and 10 4 m srcl2 and 10 2 m cacl2 for the tracer solution with a ph 7 c3 or 6 5 c1 and c2 the precise measured concentrations in each solution were implemented in the code for each experiment 4 results and discussion 4 1 conservative transport non reactive transport experiments were performed on the three columns before the sr transport experiment to estimate the effective porosity available for transport and to determine the dispersivity independently from chemical retention 4 1 1 conservative transport at centimetre scale the breakthrough curves btcs of conservative charged and neutral tracers were acquired at varying flow rates in order to verify the flow independence towards preferential paths in the centimetre scale columns c1 and c3 fig 3 shows the btcs as concentrations normalised to the injected concentration c0 versus volume of solution flowing through the column normalised to the column pore volume vp in this way it is possible to compare the results on a single plot in the case of column c1 the btcs resulting from the three conservative tracers overlap with one another fig 3a anion exclusion process and dual porosity can therefore be excluded and the accessible porosity can be assimilated to the total porosity similarly for column c3 fig 3b the 2h btcs are superimposed for both flow velocity this justifies considering the total porosity to describe transport in the centimetre scale bt soil column c3 and the cs column c1 the total porosity and experimental flow velocity were used in the inverse module of hydrus 1d to calculate the longitudinal dispersivity by way of adjustment with the experimental btcs the dispersivity values obtained were 0 24 0 01 and 0 33 0 02 cm for column c1 and c3 respectively r2 0 998 4 1 2 conservative transport at decimetre scale conservative transport experiments were performed with a cai2 tracer in column c2 four tracer injections were conducted at various flow velocities to acquire the cai2 concentration curves at eight locations along the column and the btcs at the column inlet and outlet fig 4 as in the centimetre scale columns the total porosity and measured flow velocities were chosen as input parameters for the inverse modelling on the complete set of resident concentration curves simultaneously the dispersivity was then estimated by inverse modelling finally the resulting simulations show good agreement with the resident concentration curves a slightly larger dispersion can be observed in the curve at the outlet which is attributable to extra column artefacts due to the presence of the filter with different transport properties the average dispersivity was estimated at 0 323 0 014 cm r2 0 975 in the decimetre scale column considering the four experiments by overlapping the simulations with data it becomes evident that a unique set of total porosity flow rate and dispersivity values are necessary to successfully simulate the resident concentration curves simultaneously at the eight locations along column c2 these results support the assumption of a continuous and homogeneously packed medium 4 2 sr reactive transport in a clayey sand in order to compare the additivity approach with the commonly used kd approach simulations were carried out to interpret the experimental btcs acquired on the cs material in the centimetre scale column 4 2 1 tentative interpretation using a constant kd a retardation factor based on a constant kd was tested to interpret sr reactivity specifically on the cs material it is generally admitted that sr is characterized by a linear isotherm wissocq et al 2018 rafferty et al 1981 wissocq et al 2018 evidenced constant kd values for sr concentrations in solution up to 10 3 m in the case of sr sorption on the cs material moreover szenknect et al 2005 pointed out that based on the flow through reactor study the kd value was constant for sr concentrations below 10 6 mol l 1 the isotherm described by the langmuir model shows that a nonlinear instantaneous and reversible sorption process controls sr chemical reactivity the sr adsorption kinetics studied by galambos et al 2013 on clay mixtures evidenced an adsorption equilibrium achieved in one minute the sr adsorption reaction can be considered faster than the contact time in our transport experiments four sr btcs were acquired on column c1 at varying flow velocities table 3 in fig 5 the four normalised btcs overlap with each other indicating that sr transport is independent from the flow rate in this context the symmetric btcs confirm the absence of a sorption kinetic effect on sr transport in these experimental conditions direct simulations were conducted using the kd based on batch sorption experiments wissocq et al 2018 and the kd estimated from inverse modelling both simulation curves reproduced the btcs experimental shapes well this indicates that sr and conservative tracers migrate through the material using the total porosity and the same transport pathways i e same dispersivity as for the tracers the kd fitted on the experimental data was 3 64 l kg 1 similar to the mean kd estimated by batch experiments 3 68 0 4 l kg 1 hence site availability in compacted media remains the same as in dispersed material the simulated curves overlap the data although the maximum intensity of the peak was not reached maximum and minimum batch kd values 3 28 and 4 09 l kg 1 respectively were also tested to estimate the kd variability on the simulation results the experimental data lie well between the two curves except for a few points at the maximum concentration when considering the minimum batch kd the simulated curve recorded an earlier arrival and higher intensity than the curve obtained by inverse modelling accordingly the simulated curve with the maximum batch kd revealed a lower intensity and a longer residence time in the column this confirms that kd is a highly sensitive parameter when it comes to simulating reactive transport in columns consequently kd determined in static conditions may be used to describe sr transport in the cs material if uncertainties can be tolerated safety criteria for instance 4 2 2 additivity approach using a multi site cation exchanger model in order to explain the role of the different clay minerals in sr transport simulations were conducted using the additivity of the illite and smectite sorption properties and considering their relative abundances in porous media wissocq et al 2018 successfully applied an additivity approach with a multi site ion exchanger model msie based on a mixture of pure mineral phases illite and smectite to simulate sr sorption on the cs material in batch experiments this approach was therefore adopted in our work to simulate sr transport through cs columns by coupling the msie model with the transport model ade transport parameters such as total porosity and dispersivity deduced from transport experiments using conservative tracers were once again used for the simulations the sorption properties of reactive phase type illite or smectite and their abundance in the material are hence two determining parameters in the centimetre scale column the clayey sandstone was assumed to behave like a homogeneous media therefore our approach first focuses on the mineral specificity for this purpose it is generally admitted that three major sorption sites are necessary to describe the illite and smectite exchange capacity nolin 1997 tertre et al 2009 wissocq et al 2017 the sorption properties of cs are assumed analogue to those of an illite and a smectite phases mixture however wissocq et al 2018 obtained a better interpretation of the sr sorption curves on pure illite in batch experiments by considering a fourth site a low capacity and high affinity site such low capacity sites are recognised to act principally at low concentration and represent less than 0 5 of the total exchange capacity of the clay mineral brouwer et al 1983 baeyens and bradbury 1997 poinssot et al 1999 missana et al 2004 2008 tertre et al 2009 martin et al 2018 latrille et al 2019 on another hand sr sorption isotherms on smectite did not reveal the contribution of this kind of site the significance of xh site on sr transport is therefore investigated by comparing simulation including or not the xh site following the literature the simulations were firstly carried out with the three major sites for illite xa xb xc and smectite xe xf xg their specific features are given in table 3 simulations results obtained on column c1 are shown in fig 6 compared with experimental btcs the simulated curve indicates a slightly earlier arrival time in column c1 conserving the btcs rather symmetrical shape and fit in the experimental data range to assess the influence of the minor site in sr transport sensitivity calculations were performed including the fourth site xh on illite fig 6 again the simulated curve was correctly superimposed on the sr breakthrough curve in the cs column and reproduced the btcs shape leading to a slightly better fit with respect to the maximal intensity and the short tail 4 2 3 sr reactive transport on a decimetre scale the effect of the mineral abundance on the sr transport results was tested on a larger column scale local stacking heterogeneities of small extent 2 of clay content were recorded during the decimetre column filling process fig 2 they express the clay fraction variability along the column the grain size fractionation uncertainty was around 2 this implies a cec variation in the filling material of 0 012 eq kq 1 which equates to a variability in sorption capacity i e in number of site only the cumulative effect of variations in the clay fraction could be tested given that sr btcs were only available at the column outlet simulations were therefore carried out at various averaged clay fraction contents and then compared with the experimental data in order to test the sensitivity of simulation outcomes to cec variability sr transport experiments were also performed on decimetre scale columns c2 filled with same material and applying three different flow rates fig 7 the resulting btcs are well superimposed as in the case of the centimetre scale column in the modelling we considered that the porous medium was homogeneous even though small scale heterogeneities were detected on the porosity and clay proportion distribution fig 2 the measured flow rate an averaged total porosity and dispersivity were used as input parameters for simulations with the hp1 and hydrus 1d codes as for column c1 direct simulations with hydrus 1d were conducted using the kd value based on batch sorption experiments kd 6 44 l kg in fig 7 the simulated curve with kd overlaps well with the data in terms of arrival time and tail but not so well with the maximal intensity of the peak then msie model was tested to improve the simulation outcomes the c2 column reactivity was simulated using the sorption parameters relative to illite and smectite weighted by their relative abundance in the material the average clay proportion estimated at ca 20 by dichromatic x ray spectrometry fig 2 was taken into account to calculate the sorption parameters of the cs material by considering three sites for smectite and four sites for illite with hp1 the simulation results in fig 7 are in good agreement with the experimental sr btcs as observed in the c1 column there was no visible broadening of the sr tracer curve theoretically upscaling the column size has no impact on the sr transport in the case of a homogeneous porous medium containing easily accessible sorption sites to assess the sensitivity of clay content variability two additional simulations were performed considering 18 and 22 clay fractions fig 7 with hp1 the results indicate an earlier arrival and retardation of the front respectively the whole curves being shifted in time this small uncertainty was also sensitive for the arrival time of the front overall the reactive transport model successfully predicts the sr reactive transport through the clayey sandstone on a decimetre scale with transport parameters and chemical retention based on clay mineral contributions that have been determined experimentally independently from the relative abundance of the clay minerals the clay fraction in each column appears to have a strong impact on the modelling outcome this may explain the difficulty of simulating transport on a field scale where the heterogeneity of porous media can be more marked 4 3 sr reactive transport in a bt soil horizon in order to explore the scope of this approach a similar study was replicated in another column filled with a different material two sr btcs were acquired on the bt soil horizon column c3 latrille et al 2017 under operating conditions comparable to those of column c1 expressed in normalised concentration vs normalised flowing volume over pore volume the data obtained with two different flow velocities once again overlapped each other fig 8 and show spreading curves with a larger tail than the sr btcs for cs material fig 6 the btcs indicate the same relative arrival time as that of column c1 corresponding to the injection of ten pore volumes vp but they differ in intensity and tail length the geometrical features of both columns are comparable and cannot be invoked to explain the difference in the intensity of the btcs nonetheless both materials have a distinct cec 0 064 eq kg in column c1 compared with 0 13 eq kg in column c3 these cec values represent the respective illite and smectite contributions in each porous medium as detailed in table 2 the illite and smectite contents are similar in the cs material whereas the illite to smectite ratio is 0 35 in the bt soil 4 3 1 kd and msie modelling results in fig 8 the simulated curve black solid line was obtained by inverse modelling using the experimental flow velocities total porosity and dispersivity the optimized kd was found to be 7 5 l kg 1 r2 0 949 this curve does not fit the experimental data satisfactorily showing a delayed maximum value and a shorter tail the presence of a tail in the btc could be attributable to transport mechanisms double porosity or intra particle diffusion or chemical mechanisms kinetic control of sorption desorption sorption site parameters we discarded transport based on the results obtained with conservative tracers single porosity which show no such tail in the btcs based on galambos et al 2013 and siroux et al 2017 kinetic effects may also be excluded indeed the results of these studies evidenced sr sorption achieved at shorter time about seconds to hours respectively than the experimental time scale of our study in order to reduce the mismatch between simulation and experimental data and to explain the dissymmetry of the btc additional simulations were therefore conducted to test the additivity approach with the msie model the simulation results fig 9 obtained with the parameters described above three or four sorption sites on ca illite do not improve the mismatch they show an early arrival time a larger intensity and a depleted tail small squares and crosses in fig 9 further sensitivity calculations on the variability of the clay fraction in the uncertainty range i e 17 to 19 4 of 2 μm indicate a significant shift in time towards an earlier breakthrough a higher maximal value and symmetrical curves without any tail si2 as a result the clay mineral amount does not explain the late arrival and length of the tail the relative abundance of illite and smectite was also tested in the range of uncertainties observed by the cec and xrd quantifications obviously the relative proportions of illite and smectite are so strongly constrained that the simulation results reveal no significant enhancement si3 the sensitivity calculations were therefore extended to the parameters of sorption sites focusing on the illite to investigate their influence on sr transport considering the lower uncertainty on site selectivity coefficients of montmorillonite table 3 the additional simulations involved the selectivity coefficient of the major site xa for ca illite which shows the largest uncertainty as well as both the selectivity coefficient and exchange capacity which are characteristics of the highest selective site xh fig 9 when the selectivity coefficient of xa is increased to the highest eligible value in the uncertainty range k xa 2h sr2 3 075 the curve shows a slight shift in time and the intensity decreases but not enough to match the experimental data circles in fig 9 a similar result was obtained when the cexh value was increased to 0 005 eq kg dotted line in fig 9 this shows that the major site selectivity coefficient and the cexh values are not solely responsible for the large tail when the simulation was conducted with an increased selectivity coefficient representing 0 5 σ k xh 2h sr2 2 73 table 3 a slight improvement could be observed with a breakthrough time closer to the observations but still not matching the tail dashed line in fig 9 it is only by increasing both the site capacity cexh to 0 005 eq kg and the selectivity coefficient from 0 5 σ that the simulated curve adequately superimposes with the experimental data solid line in fig 9 it appears that the low capacity and high affinity sites of illite are key to widespread dispersion and tailing during sr transport in this soil column 4 3 2 discussion on the bt soil results the overall results suggest that sr transport in these experiments occurs without limitation imposed by site accessibility as suggested by the superimposed btcs for the two flow velocities and the matching arrival time of the simulated curve with the kd approach in the case of the bt soil the btc curves show a marked tail that is more difficult to capture with the models as suggested by bugai et al bugai et al 2012 bugai et al 2020 a kd approach is unable to predict the impact of chemical disturbances in case of mixed cation competition in the same way vulava et al 2000 have already studied cation exchange equilibria between the two major cations in a natural soil material by assimilating its retention properties to one site they evidenced that classical one site cation exchange equations do not accurately describe cation exchange isotherms over a wide range of concentrations in the same line missana et al 2008 recommended the description of radionuclide retention by a mechanistic approach rather than distribution coefficient another hypothesis is that other minor reactive components in the soil may influence the sorption of sr the low soil organic matter content in this soil sample 0 34 and its small influence on sr adsorption samadfam et al 2000 lead us to disregard its contribution to sr transport in the bt soil column ferrihydrite is also frequently encountered in this type of soil hofmann et al 2005 noticed significant sr adsorption on ferrihydrite at ph 7 conditions close to our experiment ph 7 i e 4 5 10 6 mol of sr per gram of ferrihydrite considering the 2 27 of iron of the bt soil horizon lamy et al 2006 attributed to iron oxide it can be converted into 3 6 wt of ferrihydrite lu et al 2014 the ability of this oxide to capture sr in the column c3 i e 0 32 g of ferrihydrite yields 1 46 10 6 mol of sr compared with 5 2 10 2 mol of sr introduced which is equivalent to a capture rate of 0 03 for one thousand despite the negligible contribution of this minor mineral on sr sorption our modelling approach will gain from being refined with available data that can be interpreted using our formalism the simulation results obtained by coupling the msie model with ade therefore focused on the sorption on clay minerals these results reinforce the robustness of the additivity approach and the parameters for the sedimentary rock cs material but are limited in the predictive capacity of the modelling for the bt soil one of the sorption properties of the illite site needed to be adjusted in order to simulate sr transport behaviour in the soil this highlights the difficulty of assimilating the sorption properties of soil clay minerals illite from the bt soil with respect to those of sedimentary clay minerals illite from the puy region several explanations can be proposed for this behaviour firstly the exchange capacity of the low capacity and high affinity sites of illite denoted here cexh was previously estimated by other authors with various trace elements poinssot et al 1999 missana et al 2008 2014 altmann et al 2014 martin et al 2018 latrille et al 2019 this value was found only by adjusting the sr sorption curves to 0 005 eq kg in wissocq et al 2017 and 0 002 eq kg in altmann et al 2014 and 0 0027 eq kg in latrille et al 2019 to model zn sorption on na illite and ca illite respectively lower values were also found by poinssot et al 1999 i e 0 0005 eq kg for cs sorption on na illite which is close to that determined by missana et al 2014 for cs sorption on ca illite i e 0 0003 eq kg and martin et al 2018 for tl sorption on ca illite i e 0 00025 eq kg such differences evidence the difficulty of constraining this low capacity site with good accuracy secondly clay minerals in soil are commonly encountered in a wide range of particle sizes from 50 nm to 5 μm hubert et al 2012 i e a finer size than in sedimentary clay inherent to their high specific surface and cec reinholdt et al 2013 the finest particles have a larger ability to adsorb in this respect we know that illite can be weathered or micro divided due to pedogenic processes in soil environments illite may contain a larger amount of low capacity and high selectivity sites commonly referred to as frayed edge sites attributed to particle edges sawhney 1972 and fewer sites located on the basal surface and in the interlayer space as a result the reactivity of soil illites is enhanced compared with sedimentary clay mineral like illite du puy and illite contained in the cs material this assumption is consistent with the simulation results obtained by adjusting the capacity and affinity of the fourth site on illite in the bt soil 5 conclusion in this study we coupled the multi site ion exchanger model msie based on a component additive approach with the advection dispersion equation ade we did this to assess how well it would be able to simulate sr reactive transport in two materials a clayey sandstone and a bt soil non reactive transport experiments performed with conservative tracers were first used to determine the transport parameters such as porosity and dispersivity this reactive transport model was tested to simulate sr transport data acquired in a centimetre and a decimetre scale column although the kd approach is able to describe sr sorption in static conditions batch and remains applicable in dynamic conditions for the cs material given the kd value uncertainty it is less efficient at reproducing experimental data in the column for the bt soil using the additivity approach and considering components described by multi sorption sites the reactive transport of sr in the clayey material cs can be successfully predicted on a centimetre and decimetre scale without adjusting any of the parameters those measured in batch experiments sensitivity parameter tests revealed the noticeable impact of the clay content and mineralogical characteristics on sr transport simulations these results highlight the influence of illite on sr btc spreading especially through its low capacity and high selectivity site this implies having access to a robust and extensive database established with reference minerals the results of this study confirm the robustness of our database when clay minerals have reactivity properties similar to those of the reference minerals employed to build the database in the case of the bt soil containing weathered mineral or evolved minerals this database appears more limited and needs to be perfected the choice of modelling approach is therefore crucial when modelling and predicting the behaviour of sr transport in porous media to consolidate the robustness of this approach it would be relevant to test it on heterogeneous media and to acquire retention properties of weathered illite moreover a systematic sensitivity analysis would also be

1392,to support the environmental monitoring of nuclear sites reactive transport models used to predict the migration of contaminants such as strontium 90 90sr in soils sediments and aquifers are developed continuously tested and improved this study aims at assessing the adequacy of the multi site ion exchanger model msie based on a component additivity approach and coupled to the advection dispersion equation ade to simulate sr transport in a clayey sandstone and a bt soil horizon we have also compared the performance of the modelling approach with simulation results obtained by considering a kd approach constant kd transport experiments were performed in centimetre and decimetre scale columns in order to test the model sensitivities to the mineral abundance and the specificities of their reactive parameters non reactive transport experiments with conservative tracers allowed us to determine the transport parameters such as porosity and dispersivity in this paper we have compared the sr transport simulation results with sr experimental breakthrough curves acquired at various flow velocities the simulations results show that the kd approach can reproduce experimental data in the case of the clayey sandstone when a certain amount of uncertainty is accepted whereas the additivity approach better fits the sr reactive transport in both columns especially the maximum value without it being necessary to adjust the parameters these results advocate for more complex retention models than kd to better understand and improve the robustness of sr transport predictions the clay content the relative abundance of illite and smectite and the clay mineral specificity are all sensitive parameters when it comes to defining the reactive system involved in sr transport simulation the results highlight the influence of illite in the spreading of the sr breakthrough curve especially through its low capacity and high selectivity site this implies having access to a robust and extensive set of retention parameters acquired on reference minerals in this study the results obtained for the clayey sandstone confirm the robustness of our selected parameters when clay minerals have similar reactivity levels as the reference minerals this set of parameters appears more limited in the case of the bt soil containing weathered or evolved minerals the choice of modelling approach is therefore crucial for accurately modelling and predicting sr transport behaviour in porous media as is the representativeness of the minerals in the database keywords illite smectite strontium reactive transport ion exchange model 1 introduction 90sr is a product of uranium and plutonium fission generated in nuclear reactors and is one of the most abundant radioisotopes released into the environment because of weapons testing and nuclear accidents kashparov et al 2003 90sr 29 years half life is highly soluble and its sorption is strongly affected by competition with major cations in solution i e with ca and mg moreover it generally does not remain on the soil surface like cs berns et al 2018 which facilitates its migration to greater depths to support the environmental monitoring of nuclear sites reactive transport models are being developed to simulate the migration of contaminants such as 90sr in soils sediments and aquifers the key requirement being a robust predictive performance reactive transport processes i e advection dispersion and diffusion coupled with chemical reactions involving precipitation dissolution or adsorption desorption generally control contaminant migration in natural environments they result in retarded migration often expressed by a delay with respect to water tracers or by tails in the breakthrough curve liu et al 2017 the time dependence of reactive transport requires examining both transport processes and reactivity formalisms used in the modelling approaches the sorption of contaminants has been modelled using simple empirical retention models such as linear constant distribution coefficient kd langmuir or freundlich sorption isotherms bachhuber et al 1982 hölttä et al 1997 cui and eriksen 1998 fesch et al 1998 palagyi and stamberg 2010 however such models provide specific and contextual parameters determined in precise physicochemical conditions and therefore often fail to be predictive for instance szenknect et al 2008 simulated sr transport through a sandy soil column using a constant kd these authors highlighted the fact that sr reactive transport deviates from classical reactive transport including a retardation factor although sr sorption was described as instantaneous reversible and with a linear reaction at trace concentration szenknect et al 2005 wissocq et al 2018 moreover to simulate sr transport in field experiments through aeolian sand sampled from the chernobyl site bugai et al 2012 found kd values to be the most sensitive parameter in the model in this study the kd values obtained by laboratory batch tests szenknect et al 2005 had to be adjusted to match the simulation outcomes with the observed data the mismatch was attributed to geochemical disturbances involving changes in the competing cation i e ca concentration in solution bugai et al 2020 cautioned against the concomitance of the adsorption desorption reaction with other chemical processes in the natural environment modelling on an aquifer scale can then be distorted by taking into account kd values measured in the laboratory that are not representative of the processes involved another approach consists in coupling transport and thermodynamic retention models to account for varying physicochemical conditions in the media ion exchange models have often been retained for multi components materials valocchi et al 1981a 1981b schweich and sardin 1981 appelo 1994 vulava et al 2000 steefel et al 2003 lichtner et al 2004 missana et al 2008 tournassat et al 2013 despite better consideration of the chemical reactions by these retention models some authors were required to adjust the sorption parameters obtained in batch experiments for trace elements static conditions in order to reproduce reactive transport data steefel et al 2003 szenknect et al 2005 therefore diminishing the predictability of these reactive transport models to apply the retention parameters acquired in dispersed multicomponent media i e batch experiments to compacted media i e column or field experiment it must be assumed that the entire solid is in contact with solution so that all the sorption sites are called into play in the reactive process among the tested approaches the generalised composite approach consists in considering only one ion exchange site bearing component to reflect the material s reactivity however it was previously shown that the strongest affinity for trace elements i e sr zn tl cs on clay minerals is associated to specific sorption sites poinssot et al 1999 missana et al 2008 2014 altmann et al 2014 wissocq et al 2017 martin et al 2018 latrille et al 2019 tournassat et al 2013 which are usually not differentiated in such a retention approach by using a generalised composite approach voegelin et al 2000 and vulava et al 2002 were able to use the same dataset in static and dynamic conditions to reproduce the transport of major elements ca mg and na and sr in trace form szenknect et al 2008 however this approach is restricted to a specific context which constrains its extrapolation to other multi component materials and extended environmental conditions vulava et al 2002 compared various exchange models and evidenced a significant improvement was gained with a multi site cation exchange model to predict the transport behaviour of the major cations lu et al 2014 also made this assessment and used such a model to cover a large range of chemical conditions without any adjustable parameters another approach is to resort to a multi site ion exchanger model using a component additivity approach which takes into account the retention of contaminants on pure mineral phases peynet 2003 so as to predict the retention of a multi component assemblage wissocq et al 2018 demonstrated its efficiency by predicting sr retention on a clayey sandstone without adjusting any of the parameters coupled with a transport model this multi site ion exchanger model has proved efficient in predicting the reactive transport of key elements na and ca in a pure phase and a soil using the same dataset in static and dynamic conditions tertre et al 2013 lu et al 2014 this study aims at assessing the adequacy of the multi site ion exchanger model coupled with a transport model to simulate sr transport in natural materials in this framework the material retention properties were taken into account by the additivity approach based on their mineralogical compositions in reactive phases furthermore the performance of our modelling approach was also compared against simulation results obtained by considering a kd approach which is commonly used in environmental impact calculations the sensitivity of the additivity approach was tested by comparing sr transport simulations carried out using data acquired by latrille et al 2017 with data from new experiments in a column filled with a clayey sandstone on the scale of the centimetre and decimetre for this purpose the influence of i the mineral abundance and ii the reactive parameters of these minerals on the simulation results was evaluated to do this we used breakthrough curves established on the basis of two different length scales columns in order to explore the scope of this approach a bt soil horizon latrille et al 2017 lu et al 2014 was chosen with relative abundances of illite and smectite differing to those found in the clayey sandstone the simulations were performed by coupling the advection dispersion equation ade with the multi site ion exchanger model msie using both the sorption property database for illite and smectite recently established in batch experiments by wissocq et al 2018 and the specific experimental input parameters relative to each operating condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the first material was a clayey sandstone cs which has already been described in detail by wissocq et al 2018 this clayey material was sampled from a depth of 31 m in the miocene geological formation located at the cadarache nuclear research centre france the rock sample was manually crushed air dried and sieved at 300 μm and 200 μm the crushed bulk material was used to fill the decimetre scale column whereas a dried 300 200 μm fraction was selected for the centimetre scale column the 25 μm fraction was isolated from the raw cs by dispersion in water followed by sieving to 25 μm the mineralogical composition was determined by x ray diffraction xrd on air dried powder for the bulk material and on air dried deposits and deposits saturated with ethylene glycol for the 25 μm fraction identification of crystallised phases was performed using the clayxr software bouchet 1992 and newmod software reynolds 1985 was used for quantification the bulk material was mainly composed of quartz 75 wt clay minerals 20 wt carbonates 2 5 wt and iron oxides 2 5 wt the xrd mineralogical quantification of the 25 μm fraction extracted from the raw material revealed about 32 wt of kaolinite 20 wt illite 19 wt smectite 2 wt chlorite 17 wt quartz and 10 wt goethite and no carbonates cation exchange capacity cec measurements on raw material 300 200 μm and 25 μm fractions were performed by k cs cation exchange at ph 9 the resulting average value were respectively 0 112 0 006 0 064 0 020 0 326 0 020 eq kg wissocq et al 2017 in our experimental chemical conditions ph 6 5 goethite remained positively charged hayes and leckie 1987 villalobos and leckie 2000 and was therefore considered as a non reactive phase weighted by their relative abundance chlorite and kaolinite contributed to the material exchange capacity at a level equivalent to the cec measurement uncertainty 0 020 eq kg 6 3 of material cec consequently smectite and illite were assumed to govern the sorption processes the reactive phases were therefore estimated equivalent to 27 7 of illite and 26 7 of smectite in the 25 μm fraction illite and smectite content in the raw soil and in the 300 200 μm fraction are calculated by weighting their amount in the 25 μm fraction to the cec of the corresponding material the second material investigated in this study was a bt horizon of a luvisol bt previously described and studied by lamy et al 2006 and lu et al 2014 the grain size distribution of this sandy clay horizon was 70 7 wt of sand 8 9 wt of silt and 20 4 wt of clay and it contained only 0 34 wt of organic matter the 2 mm air dried soil was sieved at 300 μm and 250 μm to extract the material used to fill the centimetre scale column the cec was measured at 0 13 0 01 eq kg lu et al 2014 and this fraction contained 18 wt of clay the clay minerals identified by xrd were kaolinite illite and illite smectite mixed layers clay minerals were quantified by modelling the x ray diffraction pattern in both air dried and ethylene glycol solvated states acquired on the clay size fraction with the sybilla software developed by chevron aplin et al 2006 the assemblage consisted of discrete illite 2 3 mixed layers illite smectite with 56 2 is 40 60 and 5 1 is 29 71 and discrete smectite 36 4 for the purpose of modelling the mineralogical composition of the clay size fraction was therefore assimilated to 26 2 of illite and 73 8 of smectite 2 1 1 solutions and analytical methods all chemicals used were at least of analytical grade cacl2 vwr chemical salt solutions and the sr solutions were prepared with a srcl2 6h2o salt 99 995 trace metals basis sigma aldrich dissolved in milli q water millipore 18 2 mω cm2 chemical analyses were carried out by ionic chromatography standards chem lab for ca and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms plasma cal standards for sr the measurement uncertainties were estimated at 2 non reactive tracers chosen for these experiments were 2h 2h 1h 2000 cl in a cacl2 solution and i in a cai2 solution 10 1 m 2h was mixed in a 10 2 m cacl2 solution 2h concentrations were analysed with a deuterium analyser los gatos research liquid water stable isotope analyser cl concentrations were measured by ionic chromatography cl and i concentrations were also directly measured using an on line electrical conductivity cell in the centimetre and decimetre column devices the ph was measured using a combined glass ph electrode mettler toledo equipped with an ag agcl reference electrode the electrode was calibrated with buffer solutions at ph 4 7 and 12 2 2 column transport experiments 2 2 1 experimental set ups column transport experiments were performed on a centimetre and a decimetre scale column both columns were placed in two adapted set ups designed according to the same configuration shown in fig 1 and si 1 latrille et al 2017 this configuration included an hplc pump hitachi lachrom elite l 2130 which regulated the flow rate through the column two conductivity cells and ph electrodes amersham biosciences were placed on line arranged on each side of the column finally a fraction collector omnicoll lamda was used to receive and sequentially redistribute the outflowing solution in aliquots outflow tracer concentrations were then analysed by ion chromatography cl electrical conductivity cai2 and icp ms sr for the column experiments performed on a centimetre scale si 1 two glass chromatography columns omnifit were filled by successively adding the material respectively cs material in column c1 and bt material in column c3 compacted using a uniaxial press to achieve a packed length of 7 1 cm and a diameter 1 cm table 1 summarises the details of the packed columns according to their geometric and physical features the columns were saturated from the bottom with the deaerated 10 2 m cacl2 background solution and conditioned until equilibrium with this solution by flowing ca 500 pore volumes vp through column c1 and 200 vp through column c3 at decimetre scale fig 1 the column experiments were performed by using the beeti experimental device latrille and cartalade 2010 it was composed of a vertical polycarbonate column filled with bulk cs compacted in a uniaxial press a controlled hydraulic circuit that enforced tracer migration and a dichromatic x ray spectrometer dxs based on x ray attenuation measurements porous material properties porosity bulk density water content and clay proportion and resident concentrations of attenuating tracers can be quantified down the entire column fig 1 these measurements were used to evaluate the solid homogeneity and the water content in the compacted column moreover depending on the calibration process the clay proportion distribution along the column can also be estimated resident concentration profiles of the inert tracer cai2 were measured at eight specific locations down the column in order to determine the variability of dispersivity x ray attenuation measurements were performed using a dichromatic x ray spectrometer dxs which combined an x ray generator and a nai detector latrille and cartalade 2010 latrille and néel 2013 the x ray beam was emitted in two energy ranges 20 40 kev and 50 75 kev after crossing the column filled with the porous material the nai detector measured the beam count rate the source and detector were simultaneously moved up and down the column by a controlled rack rail fig 1 and kept at specified locations 0 x 32 cm during a set counting time 80 s the x ray count rate measured by the detector depended on the thickness and the type of the phases encountered on the transmission path fluid bulk cs or clay and inert cai2 tracer as well as on the counting time at each longitudinal location x on the column the thickness of each phase was determined by solving the beer lambert s law eq 1 1 i i 0 exp i μ i ρ i z i where i 0 is the count rate emitted by the source i is the count rate detected per unit time for a given x ray energy range and transmitted throughout a column slice 5 mm 20 mm index i represents each phase contained in the medium clay or bulk cs background solution solute tracer μ i m2 kg is the mass attenuation coefficient which depends on the phase composition and on the x ray energy ρ i kg m3 is the density and z i m is the thickness of the phase the mass attenuation coefficients of clay bulk cs background solution 10 2 m cacl2 and tracer solution cai2 were therefore determined in this configuration using specific standards defined on the basis of the component chemical composition calibration sequences were performed prior to experiments as detailed in latrille and néel 2013 to acquire the bulk cs standard and the clay standard a specific calibration allowed us to then determine the clay mineral attenuation by accounting for its chemical composition acquired on the clay fraction extracted from bulk material the clay mineral attenuation is distinguished from that of sand in order to calculate the relative proportion of clay at each x position along the column the resident tracer concentration was calculable with the cai2 concentration determined by converting the corrected count rate of the low energy x ray range using eq 1 during the tracer experiment at each selected x measurements were repeated at a frequency of four to ten minutes to yield the profiles of the resident tracer concentrations the porosity and clay proportion scanned along the column c2 are given in fig 2 the porosity appears to be relatively regular from the bottom up to 30 cm with a value of 0 326 0 015 it then increases to 0 38 for the last two centimetres the clay fraction distribution followed the inverse trend of porosity distribution the material being less dense in the upper part of the column the average clay fraction was estimated at 0 208 0 018 despite a lower compaction state limited to the upper part of the column the standard deviation of the clay fraction and porosity remained small consequently the material filling this column can be considered as sufficiently well compacted to assume a homogeneous column for the modelling approach because ca is the major exchangeable cation in the natural material and in order to study competition between sr and ca only all columns were then saturated and ca conditioned by injection in the upward direction of around 800 vp of de aerated cacl2 10 2 m solution ph 6 5 at a constant flow rate 6 10 cm3 h 1 after saturation and conditioning sorption sites of the clayey sandstone were mainly occupied by ca2 and h 2 2 2 operating and experimental conditions after the conditioning step a de aerated 10 2 m cacl2 background solution was injected at a constant flow rate through the column in an upward direction as steady flow was achieved a tracer solution was also injected at the same steady flow rate through the column inlet this was done by either using an injection loop filled with a tracer solution columns c1 and c3 or by switching to a tracer bottle column c2 a loop volume of 20 8 cm3 containing tracer solutions was injected into column c1 and c3 whereas a volume of 2500 cm3 was injected into column c2 the outflowing solution was collected as aliquots every 10 or 15 min depending on the flow rate to be analysed the flow rate was controlled by weighing the collected aliquots moreover the flow rate in column c2 was also controlled by weighing the inflow bottle during the experimental time the non reactive tracers chosen for these experiments were 2h 2h 1h 2000 cl and i 10 1 m in the centimetre scale columns and i in the decimetre scale column in case of the inert cai2 tracer the ph and electrical conductivity were monitored at the column inlet and outlet and the tracer concentration was recorded the initial tracer solution contained a mixture of ca 10 4 m srcl2 and ca 10 2 m cacl2 the precise composition of the solutions used for each experiment was analytically controlled no soluble natural sr lixiviated from cs and bt soil has been previously significantly measured by icp ms consequently natural sr was neglected in cation exchange process the experimental parameters are summarised in table 2 3 reactive transport modelling as mentioned above the objectives of this study are to evaluate the additive approach so as to simulate sr transport in two component materials thus the experimental results were interpreted by coupling the multi site ion exchanger model with a transport model 3 1 sr sorption model a multi site ion exchanger model the multi site ion exchanger model msie used in this study has already been described in detail by motellier et al 2003 jacquier et al 2004 tertre et al 2009 savoye et al 2012 lu et al 2014 reinoso maset and ly 2014 siroux et al 2017 2018 and wissocq et al 2018 in this model the ion exchanger is composed of one or several negatively charged minerals the latter typically have their own negative sorption sites called xi able to sorb cations the ion exchange models initially designed only allow the interpretation of ion exchange in terms of equilibrium and not reaction mechanisms thus they consider that all sites behave indistinctly in the same way for clay minerals various adsorption sites result from isomorphic substitution of lattice cations and hydroxyl groups sensitive to ph the sorption sites are distinguished by their exchange capacities cei without any structural assignment then they are assumed as an intrinsic sorbent characteristic proton is the reference competing cation due to its small size and its occurrence in solution in this approach the equilibrium expression below can be used to express the ion exchange reaction related to the sorption site x i with cations mm including h selected as the reference eq 2 2 m x i h m m x i m m m m h with an associated apparent equilibrium constant eq 3 the selectivity coefficient ki which includes the unknown activity coefficient of the adsorbed species see wissocq et al 2018 as defined as below 3 k mh m m i x i m m m h m γ h m x i h m m m γ m m where i is the type of sorption site is the concentration of species in solution mol l 1 or sorbed species mol kg 1 of dry solid and γ is the activity coefficient of the species in solution in this study the selectivity coefficient of sr2 ca2 exchange is calculated for each site by combining ca2 2h and sr2 2h exchanges defined as follows 4 k ca 2 2 h i x i h 2 ca 2 γ ca 2 x i 2 ca 2 h 2 γ h 2 5 k sr 2 2 h i x i h 2 sr 2 γ sr 2 x i 2 sr 2 h 2 γ h 2 the site capacity cei is the sum of adsorbed species concentration per site eq 6 and the sum of site capacities has to be equal to the cec 6 ce i 2 x i 2 sr 2 2 x i 2 ca 2 x i h ca2 selectivity coefficients are estimated for illite and smectite from ca saturation curves as a function of ph saturation curves permit to quantify experimentally the exchange capacity of major sites depending on their saturation evidenced by ca2 2h exchange they express the adsorbed species concentration mol kg of solid versus ph similarly the minor site capacity is estimated on the sr2 adsorbed concentration versus sr concentration curve reversible sr adsorption reactions on ca illite and ca smectite have been verified experimentally by desorption experiments performed respecting the physico chemical conditions of each adsorption experiments this validates the adsorption desorption reaction by cation exchange then sr2 selectivity coefficients are estimated for illite and smectite from both ph and concentration sorption curves wissocq et al 2018 eqs 4 5 and 6 are adjusted to the experimental adsorption isotherms by non linear regression using excel solver uncertainties on estimated selectivity coefficient were calculated by using the solveraid macro de levie 2004 to apply this model on a natural soil or sediment by using a component additivity approach it is assumed that the site capacities of the mineralogical assemblage are the sum of the site capacities of each reactive mineral component weighted by their relative abundance in the assemblage in the two mineralogical systems selected for this study illite and smectite mainly govern the sorption properties by ion exchange processes consequently the cec of each material results on the contribution of illite and smectite and can be expressed by eq 7 7 cec material i x illite ce i illite x smectite ce i smectite where xillite and xsmectite are the illite and smectite abundance in the material and ceiillite and ceismectite represent the illite and smectite xi site capacity respectively the selectivity coefficients of the mineralogical assemblage restricted to a illite and smectite mixture combine those which were determined on each site of pure illite and smectite in the batch experiments by wissocq et al 2018 they are summarised in table 3 this multi site ion exchanger model was implemented in the phreeqc code using the exchange data block corrected selectivity coefficients obtained from the multi site ion exchanger formalism were converted into the gaines thomas formalism used by phreeqc the differences between k 2h ca 2 i and k 2h sr 2 i on the major illite sites are small given their uncertainties only a significant difference is noticeable on the xh site table 3 consequently the sr selectivity compared to this of ca is expressed by the negative value of logk sr 2 ca 2 i by neglecting this minor site xh the reactivity of sr is comparable to that of ca as it is classically done by considering one site wahlberg et al 1965 for smectite the differences are not very significant according to the uncertainties of the selectivity coefficients therefore the small difference in affinity between sr and ca is mainly due to the reactivity on xh site of illite this suggests that smectite plays a secondary role in the global reactivity of materials towards sr 3 2 reactive transport model transport processes are computed via the advection dispersion equation ade 8 r x θ x t c x t x q d x c x t θ x d x x c x t with qd representing the darcy flow velocity cm h 1 θ representing the porosity c the solute concentration mol l 1 r the retardation factor and d the apparent dispersion coefficient cm2 h the retardation factor can be calculated by the following equation 9 r 1 ρkd θ with ρ representing the mass density of solid and kd the distribution coefficient r may depend on location x in the column when ρ and θ are spatially variable however in this study we checked that the porous media were packed homogeneously and the transport parameters were considered uniform with x consequently chemical retention can be expressed by eq 9 with a constant kd the retardation factor of a conservative tracer is equal to 1 the apparent dispersion coefficient is therefore calculated as follows 10 d τ d 0 λ v x with d o being the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water cm2 h τ the tortuosity λ the dispersivity cm and v the pore velocity defined as v x q d θ x cm h the tortuosity was calculated following the millington and quirk 1961 equation the hydrus 1d code was used to simulate the conservative tracer experiments and the reactive transport experiment considering the constant kd approach reactive tracer experiments were also simulated using the hp1 multicomponent transport module of hydrus 1d jacques and šimůnek 2010 this module couples hydrus 1d with the phreeqc version 4 biogeochemical code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the column geometry was modelled using a 1d cartesian domain columns c1 and c3 were discretized with 100 cells and column c2 with 350 cells the columns were considered as physically and chemically uniform soil profiles the water flux was used for the flow boundary condition for conservative transport experiments and sr transport in c1 and c3 the flow conditions imposed a dispersive hydrodynamic regime for experiments in the c2 column the slow flow velocities required taking into account a diffusion process at the inlet a constant tracer flux was imposed during the injection time and a zero concentration gradient was selected as the outlet condition the input parameters measured experimentally were dispersivity porosity flow velocity solution compositions and clay minerals characteristics relative to each material site capacities corrected selectivity coefficients the molecular diffusion coefficients for sr ca and cl were 7 91 10 6 7 92 10 6 and 2 03 10 5 cm2 s 1 respectively mills and lobo 1989 dispersivity was estimated by using dedicated deuterated water 2h the cacl2 and cai2 transport experiment at centimetre scale table 2 and the cai2 transport experiment only at decimetre scale by using the inverse module of hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 the levenburg marquardt algorithm was used to fit the nonlinear equations to experimental data the illite and montmorillonite characteristic inputs for simulations performed with hp1 take into account the respective site densities and selectivity coefficients weighted by the amount of every phase in each column the solution compositions were 10 2 m cacl2 as the background solution and 10 4 m srcl2 and 10 2 m cacl2 for the tracer solution with a ph 7 c3 or 6 5 c1 and c2 the precise measured concentrations in each solution were implemented in the code for each experiment 4 results and discussion 4 1 conservative transport non reactive transport experiments were performed on the three columns before the sr transport experiment to estimate the effective porosity available for transport and to determine the dispersivity independently from chemical retention 4 1 1 conservative transport at centimetre scale the breakthrough curves btcs of conservative charged and neutral tracers were acquired at varying flow rates in order to verify the flow independence towards preferential paths in the centimetre scale columns c1 and c3 fig 3 shows the btcs as concentrations normalised to the injected concentration c0 versus volume of solution flowing through the column normalised to the column pore volume vp in this way it is possible to compare the results on a single plot in the case of column c1 the btcs resulting from the three conservative tracers overlap with one another fig 3a anion exclusion process and dual porosity can therefore be excluded and the accessible porosity can be assimilated to the total porosity similarly for column c3 fig 3b the 2h btcs are superimposed for both flow velocity this justifies considering the total porosity to describe transport in the centimetre scale bt soil column c3 and the cs column c1 the total porosity and experimental flow velocity were used in the inverse module of hydrus 1d to calculate the longitudinal dispersivity by way of adjustment with the experimental btcs the dispersivity values obtained were 0 24 0 01 and 0 33 0 02 cm for column c1 and c3 respectively r2 0 998 4 1 2 conservative transport at decimetre scale conservative transport experiments were performed with a cai2 tracer in column c2 four tracer injections were conducted at various flow velocities to acquire the cai2 concentration curves at eight locations along the column and the btcs at the column inlet and outlet fig 4 as in the centimetre scale columns the total porosity and measured flow velocities were chosen as input parameters for the inverse modelling on the complete set of resident concentration curves simultaneously the dispersivity was then estimated by inverse modelling finally the resulting simulations show good agreement with the resident concentration curves a slightly larger dispersion can be observed in the curve at the outlet which is attributable to extra column artefacts due to the presence of the filter with different transport properties the average dispersivity was estimated at 0 323 0 014 cm r2 0 975 in the decimetre scale column considering the four experiments by overlapping the simulations with data it becomes evident that a unique set of total porosity flow rate and dispersivity values are necessary to successfully simulate the resident concentration curves simultaneously at the eight locations along column c2 these results support the assumption of a continuous and homogeneously packed medium 4 2 sr reactive transport in a clayey sand in order to compare the additivity approach with the commonly used kd approach simulations were carried out to interpret the experimental btcs acquired on the cs material in the centimetre scale column 4 2 1 tentative interpretation using a constant kd a retardation factor based on a constant kd was tested to interpret sr reactivity specifically on the cs material it is generally admitted that sr is characterized by a linear isotherm wissocq et al 2018 rafferty et al 1981 wissocq et al 2018 evidenced constant kd values for sr concentrations in solution up to 10 3 m in the case of sr sorption on the cs material moreover szenknect et al 2005 pointed out that based on the flow through reactor study the kd value was constant for sr concentrations below 10 6 mol l 1 the isotherm described by the langmuir model shows that a nonlinear instantaneous and reversible sorption process controls sr chemical reactivity the sr adsorption kinetics studied by galambos et al 2013 on clay mixtures evidenced an adsorption equilibrium achieved in one minute the sr adsorption reaction can be considered faster than the contact time in our transport experiments four sr btcs were acquired on column c1 at varying flow velocities table 3 in fig 5 the four normalised btcs overlap with each other indicating that sr transport is independent from the flow rate in this context the symmetric btcs confirm the absence of a sorption kinetic effect on sr transport in these experimental conditions direct simulations were conducted using the kd based on batch sorption experiments wissocq et al 2018 and the kd estimated from inverse modelling both simulation curves reproduced the btcs experimental shapes well this indicates that sr and conservative tracers migrate through the material using the total porosity and the same transport pathways i e same dispersivity as for the tracers the kd fitted on the experimental data was 3 64 l kg 1 similar to the mean kd estimated by batch experiments 3 68 0 4 l kg 1 hence site availability in compacted media remains the same as in dispersed material the simulated curves overlap the data although the maximum intensity of the peak was not reached maximum and minimum batch kd values 3 28 and 4 09 l kg 1 respectively were also tested to estimate the kd variability on the simulation results the experimental data lie well between the two curves except for a few points at the maximum concentration when considering the minimum batch kd the simulated curve recorded an earlier arrival and higher intensity than the curve obtained by inverse modelling accordingly the simulated curve with the maximum batch kd revealed a lower intensity and a longer residence time in the column this confirms that kd is a highly sensitive parameter when it comes to simulating reactive transport in columns consequently kd determined in static conditions may be used to describe sr transport in the cs material if uncertainties can be tolerated safety criteria for instance 4 2 2 additivity approach using a multi site cation exchanger model in order to explain the role of the different clay minerals in sr transport simulations were conducted using the additivity of the illite and smectite sorption properties and considering their relative abundances in porous media wissocq et al 2018 successfully applied an additivity approach with a multi site ion exchanger model msie based on a mixture of pure mineral phases illite and smectite to simulate sr sorption on the cs material in batch experiments this approach was therefore adopted in our work to simulate sr transport through cs columns by coupling the msie model with the transport model ade transport parameters such as total porosity and dispersivity deduced from transport experiments using conservative tracers were once again used for the simulations the sorption properties of reactive phase type illite or smectite and their abundance in the material are hence two determining parameters in the centimetre scale column the clayey sandstone was assumed to behave like a homogeneous media therefore our approach first focuses on the mineral specificity for this purpose it is generally admitted that three major sorption sites are necessary to describe the illite and smectite exchange capacity nolin 1997 tertre et al 2009 wissocq et al 2017 the sorption properties of cs are assumed analogue to those of an illite and a smectite phases mixture however wissocq et al 2018 obtained a better interpretation of the sr sorption curves on pure illite in batch experiments by considering a fourth site a low capacity and high affinity site such low capacity sites are recognised to act principally at low concentration and represent less than 0 5 of the total exchange capacity of the clay mineral brouwer et al 1983 baeyens and bradbury 1997 poinssot et al 1999 missana et al 2004 2008 tertre et al 2009 martin et al 2018 latrille et al 2019 on another hand sr sorption isotherms on smectite did not reveal the contribution of this kind of site the significance of xh site on sr transport is therefore investigated by comparing simulation including or not the xh site following the literature the simulations were firstly carried out with the three major sites for illite xa xb xc and smectite xe xf xg their specific features are given in table 3 simulations results obtained on column c1 are shown in fig 6 compared with experimental btcs the simulated curve indicates a slightly earlier arrival time in column c1 conserving the btcs rather symmetrical shape and fit in the experimental data range to assess the influence of the minor site in sr transport sensitivity calculations were performed including the fourth site xh on illite fig 6 again the simulated curve was correctly superimposed on the sr breakthrough curve in the cs column and reproduced the btcs shape leading to a slightly better fit with respect to the maximal intensity and the short tail 4 2 3 sr reactive transport on a decimetre scale the effect of the mineral abundance on the sr transport results was tested on a larger column scale local stacking heterogeneities of small extent 2 of clay content were recorded during the decimetre column filling process fig 2 they express the clay fraction variability along the column the grain size fractionation uncertainty was around 2 this implies a cec variation in the filling material of 0 012 eq kq 1 which equates to a variability in sorption capacity i e in number of site only the cumulative effect of variations in the clay fraction could be tested given that sr btcs were only available at the column outlet simulations were therefore carried out at various averaged clay fraction contents and then compared with the experimental data in order to test the sensitivity of simulation outcomes to cec variability sr transport experiments were also performed on decimetre scale columns c2 filled with same material and applying three different flow rates fig 7 the resulting btcs are well superimposed as in the case of the centimetre scale column in the modelling we considered that the porous medium was homogeneous even though small scale heterogeneities were detected on the porosity and clay proportion distribution fig 2 the measured flow rate an averaged total porosity and dispersivity were used as input parameters for simulations with the hp1 and hydrus 1d codes as for column c1 direct simulations with hydrus 1d were conducted using the kd value based on batch sorption experiments kd 6 44 l kg in fig 7 the simulated curve with kd overlaps well with the data in terms of arrival time and tail but not so well with the maximal intensity of the peak then msie model was tested to improve the simulation outcomes the c2 column reactivity was simulated using the sorption parameters relative to illite and smectite weighted by their relative abundance in the material the average clay proportion estimated at ca 20 by dichromatic x ray spectrometry fig 2 was taken into account to calculate the sorption parameters of the cs material by considering three sites for smectite and four sites for illite with hp1 the simulation results in fig 7 are in good agreement with the experimental sr btcs as observed in the c1 column there was no visible broadening of the sr tracer curve theoretically upscaling the column size has no impact on the sr transport in the case of a homogeneous porous medium containing easily accessible sorption sites to assess the sensitivity of clay content variability two additional simulations were performed considering 18 and 22 clay fractions fig 7 with hp1 the results indicate an earlier arrival and retardation of the front respectively the whole curves being shifted in time this small uncertainty was also sensitive for the arrival time of the front overall the reactive transport model successfully predicts the sr reactive transport through the clayey sandstone on a decimetre scale with transport parameters and chemical retention based on clay mineral contributions that have been determined experimentally independently from the relative abundance of the clay minerals the clay fraction in each column appears to have a strong impact on the modelling outcome this may explain the difficulty of simulating transport on a field scale where the heterogeneity of porous media can be more marked 4 3 sr reactive transport in a bt soil horizon in order to explore the scope of this approach a similar study was replicated in another column filled with a different material two sr btcs were acquired on the bt soil horizon column c3 latrille et al 2017 under operating conditions comparable to those of column c1 expressed in normalised concentration vs normalised flowing volume over pore volume the data obtained with two different flow velocities once again overlapped each other fig 8 and show spreading curves with a larger tail than the sr btcs for cs material fig 6 the btcs indicate the same relative arrival time as that of column c1 corresponding to the injection of ten pore volumes vp but they differ in intensity and tail length the geometrical features of both columns are comparable and cannot be invoked to explain the difference in the intensity of the btcs nonetheless both materials have a distinct cec 0 064 eq kg in column c1 compared with 0 13 eq kg in column c3 these cec values represent the respective illite and smectite contributions in each porous medium as detailed in table 2 the illite and smectite contents are similar in the cs material whereas the illite to smectite ratio is 0 35 in the bt soil 4 3 1 kd and msie modelling results in fig 8 the simulated curve black solid line was obtained by inverse modelling using the experimental flow velocities total porosity and dispersivity the optimized kd was found to be 7 5 l kg 1 r2 0 949 this curve does not fit the experimental data satisfactorily showing a delayed maximum value and a shorter tail the presence of a tail in the btc could be attributable to transport mechanisms double porosity or intra particle diffusion or chemical mechanisms kinetic control of sorption desorption sorption site parameters we discarded transport based on the results obtained with conservative tracers single porosity which show no such tail in the btcs based on galambos et al 2013 and siroux et al 2017 kinetic effects may also be excluded indeed the results of these studies evidenced sr sorption achieved at shorter time about seconds to hours respectively than the experimental time scale of our study in order to reduce the mismatch between simulation and experimental data and to explain the dissymmetry of the btc additional simulations were therefore conducted to test the additivity approach with the msie model the simulation results fig 9 obtained with the parameters described above three or four sorption sites on ca illite do not improve the mismatch they show an early arrival time a larger intensity and a depleted tail small squares and crosses in fig 9 further sensitivity calculations on the variability of the clay fraction in the uncertainty range i e 17 to 19 4 of 2 μm indicate a significant shift in time towards an earlier breakthrough a higher maximal value and symmetrical curves without any tail si2 as a result the clay mineral amount does not explain the late arrival and length of the tail the relative abundance of illite and smectite was also tested in the range of uncertainties observed by the cec and xrd quantifications obviously the relative proportions of illite and smectite are so strongly constrained that the simulation results reveal no significant enhancement si3 the sensitivity calculations were therefore extended to the parameters of sorption sites focusing on the illite to investigate their influence on sr transport considering the lower uncertainty on site selectivity coefficients of montmorillonite table 3 the additional simulations involved the selectivity coefficient of the major site xa for ca illite which shows the largest uncertainty as well as both the selectivity coefficient and exchange capacity which are characteristics of the highest selective site xh fig 9 when the selectivity coefficient of xa is increased to the highest eligible value in the uncertainty range k xa 2h sr2 3 075 the curve shows a slight shift in time and the intensity decreases but not enough to match the experimental data circles in fig 9 a similar result was obtained when the cexh value was increased to 0 005 eq kg dotted line in fig 9 this shows that the major site selectivity coefficient and the cexh values are not solely responsible for the large tail when the simulation was conducted with an increased selectivity coefficient representing 0 5 σ k xh 2h sr2 2 73 table 3 a slight improvement could be observed with a breakthrough time closer to the observations but still not matching the tail dashed line in fig 9 it is only by increasing both the site capacity cexh to 0 005 eq kg and the selectivity coefficient from 0 5 σ that the simulated curve adequately superimposes with the experimental data solid line in fig 9 it appears that the low capacity and high affinity sites of illite are key to widespread dispersion and tailing during sr transport in this soil column 4 3 2 discussion on the bt soil results the overall results suggest that sr transport in these experiments occurs without limitation imposed by site accessibility as suggested by the superimposed btcs for the two flow velocities and the matching arrival time of the simulated curve with the kd approach in the case of the bt soil the btc curves show a marked tail that is more difficult to capture with the models as suggested by bugai et al bugai et al 2012 bugai et al 2020 a kd approach is unable to predict the impact of chemical disturbances in case of mixed cation competition in the same way vulava et al 2000 have already studied cation exchange equilibria between the two major cations in a natural soil material by assimilating its retention properties to one site they evidenced that classical one site cation exchange equations do not accurately describe cation exchange isotherms over a wide range of concentrations in the same line missana et al 2008 recommended the description of radionuclide retention by a mechanistic approach rather than distribution coefficient another hypothesis is that other minor reactive components in the soil may influence the sorption of sr the low soil organic matter content in this soil sample 0 34 and its small influence on sr adsorption samadfam et al 2000 lead us to disregard its contribution to sr transport in the bt soil column ferrihydrite is also frequently encountered in this type of soil hofmann et al 2005 noticed significant sr adsorption on ferrihydrite at ph 7 conditions close to our experiment ph 7 i e 4 5 10 6 mol of sr per gram of ferrihydrite considering the 2 27 of iron of the bt soil horizon lamy et al 2006 attributed to iron oxide it can be converted into 3 6 wt of ferrihydrite lu et al 2014 the ability of this oxide to capture sr in the column c3 i e 0 32 g of ferrihydrite yields 1 46 10 6 mol of sr compared with 5 2 10 2 mol of sr introduced which is equivalent to a capture rate of 0 03 for one thousand despite the negligible contribution of this minor mineral on sr sorption our modelling approach will gain from being refined with available data that can be interpreted using our formalism the simulation results obtained by coupling the msie model with ade therefore focused on the sorption on clay minerals these results reinforce the robustness of the additivity approach and the parameters for the sedimentary rock cs material but are limited in the predictive capacity of the modelling for the bt soil one of the sorption properties of the illite site needed to be adjusted in order to simulate sr transport behaviour in the soil this highlights the difficulty of assimilating the sorption properties of soil clay minerals illite from the bt soil with respect to those of sedimentary clay minerals illite from the puy region several explanations can be proposed for this behaviour firstly the exchange capacity of the low capacity and high affinity sites of illite denoted here cexh was previously estimated by other authors with various trace elements poinssot et al 1999 missana et al 2008 2014 altmann et al 2014 martin et al 2018 latrille et al 2019 this value was found only by adjusting the sr sorption curves to 0 005 eq kg in wissocq et al 2017 and 0 002 eq kg in altmann et al 2014 and 0 0027 eq kg in latrille et al 2019 to model zn sorption on na illite and ca illite respectively lower values were also found by poinssot et al 1999 i e 0 0005 eq kg for cs sorption on na illite which is close to that determined by missana et al 2014 for cs sorption on ca illite i e 0 0003 eq kg and martin et al 2018 for tl sorption on ca illite i e 0 00025 eq kg such differences evidence the difficulty of constraining this low capacity site with good accuracy secondly clay minerals in soil are commonly encountered in a wide range of particle sizes from 50 nm to 5 μm hubert et al 2012 i e a finer size than in sedimentary clay inherent to their high specific surface and cec reinholdt et al 2013 the finest particles have a larger ability to adsorb in this respect we know that illite can be weathered or micro divided due to pedogenic processes in soil environments illite may contain a larger amount of low capacity and high selectivity sites commonly referred to as frayed edge sites attributed to particle edges sawhney 1972 and fewer sites located on the basal surface and in the interlayer space as a result the reactivity of soil illites is enhanced compared with sedimentary clay mineral like illite du puy and illite contained in the cs material this assumption is consistent with the simulation results obtained by adjusting the capacity and affinity of the fourth site on illite in the bt soil 5 conclusion in this study we coupled the multi site ion exchanger model msie based on a component additive approach with the advection dispersion equation ade we did this to assess how well it would be able to simulate sr reactive transport in two materials a clayey sandstone and a bt soil non reactive transport experiments performed with conservative tracers were first used to determine the transport parameters such as porosity and dispersivity this reactive transport model was tested to simulate sr transport data acquired in a centimetre and a decimetre scale column although the kd approach is able to describe sr sorption in static conditions batch and remains applicable in dynamic conditions for the cs material given the kd value uncertainty it is less efficient at reproducing experimental data in the column for the bt soil using the additivity approach and considering components described by multi sorption sites the reactive transport of sr in the clayey material cs can be successfully predicted on a centimetre and decimetre scale without adjusting any of the parameters those measured in batch experiments sensitivity parameter tests revealed the noticeable impact of the clay content and mineralogical characteristics on sr transport simulations these results highlight the influence of illite on sr btc spreading especially through its low capacity and high selectivity site this implies having access to a robust and extensive database established with reference minerals the results of this study confirm the robustness of our database when clay minerals have reactivity properties similar to those of the reference minerals employed to build the database in the case of the bt soil containing weathered mineral or evolved minerals this database appears more limited and needs to be perfected the choice of modelling approach is therefore crucial when modelling and predicting the behaviour of sr transport in porous media to consolidate the robustness of this approach it would be relevant to test it on heterogeneous media and to acquire retention properties of weathered illite moreover a systematic sensitivity analysis would also be interesting potentially unraveling a combined effect of different parameters funding this work was 100 financed by the mrisq project at the cea authors statement authors declare to contribute to

1393,alberta has over 70 of total irrigated land in canada and 13 irrigation districts are mainly located along the rivers in southern alberta the runoff and irrigation return flow can carry excess nutrients pesticides and sediments which adversely affect the river water quality in the present study the comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of land use pattern and stream water quality in southern alberta was conducted the water quality monitoring on the south saskatchewan river watershed within alberta showed that most water quality indicators did not significantly change between 2003 and 2017 land use maps demonstrated significant urban expansion and cropland decline in the study area from 2005 to 2015 while the irrigation area increased correlation analysis and redundancy analysis revealed that cropland built up land and native grassland were three land use types that were positively correlated with water quality indicators stronger correlations between nitrogen concentration and built up land were found in dry seasons compared with wet seasons according to the results of cluster analysis higher water quality indicator concentrations could be observed in groups with a higher proportion of cropland and built up land significant relationships between land use patterns and water quality were found in this study which demonstrated that further

monitoring stations according to the water quality and the land use patterns of the corresponding watersheds correlation analysis and redundancy analysis are used to determine the land use types that have the most significant impacts on each water quality indicator 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area consists of three sub basins of the south saskatchewan river in southern alberta canada including the bow river watershed the oldman river watershed and the south saskatchewan river watershed fig 1 the drainage area of the study area is 634 000 km2 the bow river and oldman river originate in the rocky mountains and the snowmelt in the mountains contributes to the majority of the annual discharge of these rivers the bow river is the main water source of the most populated area in alberta agriculture municipalities and industry use over 50 of the mean annual discharge the population in the oldman river watershed is lower than that of bow river however the water use is mainly due to irrigated agriculture in the drainage basin the bow river and oldman river meet in the north of grassy lake alberta and form the south saskatchewan river the south saskatchewan river and north saskatchewan river join in saskatchewan and the saskatchewan river finally drains into lake winnipeg in manitoba 2 2 data collection water quality data in the study area were obtained from the national long term water quality monitoring database of environment and climate change canada 2020 and long term river network data were obtained from alberta environment and parks 2020 the details of the stations are listed in table 1 water quality data from federal monitoring stations are available from 2000 onwards while provincial monitoring data are available starting in 1974 water samples are collected bi weekly or monthly to ensure the continuity and consistency of the water quality data the water quality data from may to october for each year between 2003 and 2017 were used for this study the selected water quality indicators included dissolved organic carbon doc total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp total nitrate and nitrite no3 no2 n total nitrogen tn total dissolved solid tds and total suspended solid tss the concentrations are assumed as concentrations of the detection limit for those values below the detection limit a 100 m resolution raster digital elevation model dem data derived from 1955 to 1996 air photography were obtained from alberta environment and parks 2017 land use maps in 2005 2010 and 2015 were obtained from the commission for environmental cooperation 2020 the land use types were categorized into 1 water 2 exposed land which is land that is predominantly non vegetated and non developed including bare soil snow rock sediments etc 3 urban and built up including roads railways buildings urban areas etc 4 wetlands 5 native grassland including unmanaged grassland for pasture 6 cropland including annual cropland fallow cultivated grasses and other perennial crops and 7 forest the drainage basin was delineated based on dem data using the arcgis 10 2 hydrology toolset esri california usa the locations of monitoring stations were used as pour points and thus the drainage basin for each monitoring station can be obtained thus the land use patterns and their impacts on water quality can be analyzed within the drainage basin of each monitoring station the delineated drainage basins are shown in fig 2 2 3 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to investigate the spatial variation of water quality indicators paired t tests were implemented by comparing the water quality indicators by monitoring sites for each period to identify the temporal variations wet may to july and dry august to october seasons in three periods 2003 2007 2008 2012 and 2013 2017 were analyzed separately to determine the seasonal and long term variations in water quality indicators the percentage of land use types for each drainage basin was used in the following statistical analysis to assess the effects of land use patterns on water quality indicators correlation analysis was performed to identify the significant land use types affecting water quality indications pearson correlation coefficients with p values of less than 0 05 were used to determine the relationship between land use types and water quality indicators cluster analysis is a method to group data based on similarity hong et al 2019 to interpret the data cluster analysis was implemented with minitab 18 minitab llc usa to classify the monitoring stations drainage basins according to their land use patterns and water quality indicators using euclidean distance all water quality indicators were used in the analysis the land use types were selected based on the results of correlation analysis to avoid the influence of non critical factors on the clustering results the mean of water chemistry parameters and selected land use types from 2003 to 2017 were standardized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviation rda analysis is a multivariate statistical method that is widely used to study the relationship between environmental variables and their potential impacts song et al 2020 the relationship of land use patterns and water quality indicators was examined by rda using canoco 5 the water quality indicators were standardized and centered using logarithmic transformation y log 10 y 1 before performing the analysis the monte carlo permutation test was applied to measure the significance of the effect of land use types jongman and jongman 1995 the ordination plots are provided to present the results of the rda analysis the arrows indicate the direction of the steepest increase of the corresponding parameter the correlation between land use types and water quality indicators can be approximately explained by the projection of water quality arrow onto the line overlaying the land use arrow the farther the projection point was from the coordinate origin the stronger the correlation between the two variables jongman and jongman 1995 lepš and šmilauer 2003 3 results 3 1 land use patterns and water quality the mean water quality indicators for each monitoring station for the three time periods are shown in fig 3 the results of one way anova demonstrated that all water quality indicators have significant spatial difference p 0 01 the long term water quality changes were determined by comparing the two periods 2003 2007 and 2008 2012 no significant differences in all water quality indicators were observed between the two periods in dry seasons but the significant decreasing trends of doc tp and tn p 0 05 were observed in the wet season the results of paired t tests showed that all water quality indicators had a significant variation p 0 01 between wet and dry seasons except tn p 0 092 all water quality indicators had a generally higher concentration in wet seasons except tn and no3 no2 n the relatively low concentrations of all variables can be observed at monitoring stations f1 f2 p1 and p4 because they are located in the upstream of the watershed which has low population density and agricultural land area the highest concentration of no3 no2 n was found at p5 after the bow river flows through the urban area of calgary however two high points of tn and tdp could be found at stations p5 and f3 generally increasing trends could be observed for doc tds and tss from station p5 to station f3 the land use patterns for each drainage basin in 2005 2010 and 2015 are presented in fig 4 in the upstream of bow river and oldman river over 40 of the land was coved by forest such as in zones f1 f2 p1 and p4 zones p2 p3 p5 p6 p7 and p8 are the main irrigated agricultural regions in alberta and cropland thus occupied the largest proportion there ranging from 38 9 to 76 7 in the downstream native grassland was a significant land use type 45 0 30 7 and 57 4 of the total land was covered by native grassland in p7 p8 and f3 zone p5 which included calgary was the basin with the largest urban area in the study area built up covered 9 2 of total land the land use type with the smallest percentage in the study area was wetland which was less than 0 3 for all 11 zones the land use change from 2005 to 2015 is summarized in table 2 which shows the decrease in cropland in most zones except p3 8 2 p4 2 0 p8 no change and f3 no change the urban and built up land expanded within the ten year period for all zones ranging from 0 4 to 3 5 the forest decline occurred in the upstream zones f1 f2 p3 and p4 had 7 8 2 6 4 8 and 6 4 decreases in forest respectively however there were 4 0 and 9 3 of increase in forest area for the downstream zones p8 and f3 respectively 3 2 correlation analysis a correlation analysis was performed to investigate the effects of land use patterns on water quality table 3 as a major land use type in the study area the cropland was highly positively correlated p 0 05 with doc tdp and tn in both wet and dry seasons tp was only correlated in dry seasons p 0 05 and tds was only correlated in wet seasons p 0 01 forest was negatively related to doc tp tds and tss in both seasons p 0 01 while tdp and tn were negatively related only in wet seasons p 0 05 most water quality indicators also showed a negative correlation p 0 01 or 0 05 with the exposed land except no3 no2 n this could be due to the uneven spatial distribution of these two land use types as shown in fig 2 most forest and exposed land which mainly consisted of snow cover were distributed in the areas with fewer sources of agricultural and urban pollution in the upper reaches of rivers although the percentage of built up area was no more than 10 in those zones in 2015 the pearson correlation coefficients revealed that it positively related to tn in dry seasons p 0 05 and tdp and no3 no2 n p 0 01 or 0 05 in both seasons the high population density in urban areas was one of main sources of the nutrients wetland was positively related to doc p 0 05 in wet seasons and p 0 01 in dry seasons though it occupied only a small proportion of land in all zones 3 3 cluster analysis cluster analysis was used to identify the zones with similar land use patterns and water chemistry in wet and dry seasons fig 5 shows the three clustering groups according to the land use patterns 60 0 similarity water quality indicators in wet seasons 74 8 similarity and dry seasons 62 9 similarity the first group consists of zones f1 f2 p1 and p4 these regions were located in the upper reaches of rivers where the forest dominates the second group was the zones dominated by agricultural land and native grassland including p2 p3 p6 p7 p8 and f3 only zone p5 was assigned to the third group due to its low similarity to other zones which was caused by the relatively high proportion of built up land calgary the largest city in alberta is located in this region the clustering groups assigned according to water quality indicators in two seasons had a similar classification the first group classified by the water quality indicators in wet seasons consists of the exact same zones as the first group which was assigned by land use types due to the relatively lower concentration of nutrients and other indicators compared with other zones in the downstream station p2 had much lower concentrations of tn tp and tss in dry seasons in comparison to wet seasons thus an additional p2 was classified in the first group for wet season water quality indicators the second water quality clustering group also has group members similar to those of the second group clustered by land use types this group had a high concentration of all water quality indicators because the zones in the group are located in the high density irrigated agricultural regions compared with the land use patterns station p6 was added to the third clustering group in both wet and dry seasons water indicator clustering the high nutrient tdp tn and no3 no2 n concentrations were observed in the groups and are characteristic of water chemistry caused by the runoff and discharges from the urban area nyenje et al 2010 zhou et al 2021 although the built up area in zone p6 was not as high as in zone p5 p6 is in the downstream of the zone p5 which results in the similar water quality characteristics 3 4 redundancy analysis the rda analysis was further implemented to study the relationship between seasonal water quality indicators and land use patterns and the resulting ordination plots are presented in fig 6 the permutation tests showed the significance of the analysis with p 0 01 the total water quality variations explained by land use patterns were 79 2 and 82 2 for the wet and dry seasons respectively the majority of variations in water quality can be explained by the first axis with 78 1 and 75 6 of total variations in the wet and dry seasons respectively similar results obtained from correlation analysis can also be found in the rda analysis in wet seasons native grassland wetland cropland and built up land showed a positive correlation with all water quality indicators in addition all indicators were negatively related to forest and exposed land the longer arrows of forest and exposed land in the opposite direction of the water quality arrows indicate their strong negative correlation in dry seasons built up land showed a stronger correlation with nutrients tdp tn and no3 no2 n compared with wet seasons which was similar to the results obtained from the correlation analysis low river flow resulted in the stronger impacts of urban areas on the surface water quality in dry seasons forest and exposed land were two land use types that were positively related to the water quality in the study previous studies have provided evidence that forested catchments have better water quality compared with those with a high percentage of agricultural and urban land brogna et al 2018 kändler et al 2017 the vegetation roots can stabilize the soil and reduce the bank erosion cai et al 2020 xie et al 2020 in addition forest zones along the streams can provide buffer effects on the nutrients and sediment discharges from runoffs an average 55 of nitrogen and 85 of sediments can be removed by 40 m wide forest buffers sweeney and newbold 2014 the majority of the exposed land in the study area was snow and rocks which were mainly distributed in the rocky mountains the percentage of exposed land was gradually decreased and the water quality decreased as the rivers flowed into the prairie which caused the negative correlation between exposed land and water quality the rda analysis showed that the cropland was positively correlated with all water quality variables as shown in fig 2 the agricultural lands were densely distributed along the bow river and oldman river including zones p2 p3 p5 p6 p7 and p8 the return canals in the irrigation districts could carry the high concentration of nutrients and sediment from the runoff to streams chaudhuri et al 2020 guo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 according to the report by charest et al 2015 the irrigation returns in the oldman river contributed 34 8 37 0 and 46 6 of tp tn and tdp loads in wet seasons as well as 68 5 82 0 80 3 of tp tn and tdp loads in dry seasons respectively in addition alberta is the largest cattle production province in canada chen et al 2020 as defined in this study cropland also included many managed pastures and some native grasslands were used as pasture as well the cattle density map in the study area derived from global cattle distribution data gilbert et al 2018 is shown in fig 7 similar to the correlation analysis the native grassland showed a positive correlation with tp and tss for both seasons according to the rda ordination plot fig 6 grazed pasture has been identified as a major nonpoint source of nutrients chaubey et al 2010 shrestha and wang 2020 in addition the high grazing pressure could also result in soil erosion in pastures causing the increase in the tss concentration pilon et al 2017 built up land was considered a significant predictor of the nutrient concentration including tn tdp and no3 no2 n urban areas are a major nitrogen source for stream water a large quantity of nitrogen was emitted to waterbodies from the urban wastewater treatment plant and stormwater drainage system li and davis 2014 van drecht et al 2009 another interesting fact that the rda analysis reveals is that the built up land had higher impacts on the nutrient concentration in dry seasons in comparison to wet seasons this could be due to the fact that cities are the major nitrogen sources in the watershed the low precipitation in dry seasons may not significantly affect urban nitrogen emission and low stream discharge could reduce the dilution effects ding et al 2015 3 5 water resource and quality management in the irrigation districts of southern alberta 97 of water use in alberta was from surface water government of alberta 2010 78 and 88 of water were allocated for irrigation in the bow river and oldman river sub basins respectively ssrb water supply study steering committee 2010 in addition since the south saskatchewan river is the major interprovincial stream the water quality and water resource allocation in the southern alberta irrigation districts are important for the water safety in all canadian prairie provinces the water resources are finite it is necessary to implement sustainable and effective water management in the regions with intensive irrigated agriculture yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b since 2007 the government of alberta has decided not to provide more new water licenses for irrigation alberta agriculture and rural development 2014 by using new irrigation technologies and converting the open canal into pipeline although the area of irrigated land has gradually increased the amount of diverted water from irrigation districts was significantly reduced over the past two decades alberta agriculture and rural development 2014 many efforts have been made in alberta to protect the water quality impacted by the excess nutrient discharge from croplands and grazed pastures for instance the nutrient beneficial management practices bmps evaluation project funded by the government of alberta has been implemented to evaluate the effects of different bmps for water quality management especially nutrient concentration through field studies and modeling in the context of alberta seitz vermeer et al 2019 in the evaluation project it was found that bmps should focus on particulate concentrations during the spring rains in natural grassland regions with extensive livestock and soil erosion paterson earth and water consulting ltd 2014 bmps can be taken to control dissolved inorganic nutrient from snowmelt in the watershed with intensive agriculture land and grassland paterson earth and water consulting ltd 2014 the results of this study prove the effectiveness of water quality management in alberta to some extent for example the decrease of both tn and tp concentrations p 0 05 was observed in wet seasons between 2003 and 2007 and 2008 2012 even though the population and irrigated cropland increased the results of this study have practical implications for water quality management in southern alberta the comprehensive statistical analysis reveals the relationships between land use patterns and water quality indicators the cropland and built up land were highly correlated with the nutrient concentration native grassland resulted in the increase in the total solid and tp concentrations this suggested that the regions with large cities intensive agriculture and confined farming such as zones p2 p3 p5 p6 p7 and p8 need to be given special attention to mitigate their impacts on water quality forest was considered the land use type that was negatively related to the water quality indicators previous studies have reported the effects of riparian buffer zones on nitrogen and phosphorus removal hefting et al 2006 jahra and kawahara 2019 weissteiner et al 2013 streambank fencing in the cattle farms has also been proven to improve the riparian health and could thus prevent the release of nutrients into rivers miller et al 2010 this study could be helpful to identify the main sources of different forms of pollution and assist with the application of the appropriate bmps in the corresponding regions 4 conclusions in the present study the comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of land use pattern and stream water quality in southern alberta was conducted the water quality monitoring on the south saskatchewan river watershed within alberta showed that most water quality indicators did not significantly change between 2003 and 2017 land use maps demonstrated significant urban expansion and cropland decline in the study area from 2005 to 2015 according to the report by the government of alberta however the irrigation area increased correlation analysis and rda analysis revealed that cropland built up land and native grassland were three land use types that were positively correlated with water quality indicators stronger correlations between nitrogen concentration and built up land were found in dry seasons compared with wet seasons according to the results of cluster analysis higher water quality indicator concentrations could be observed in groups with a higher proportion of cropland and built up land varying significant relationships between land use patterns and water quality were found in sub basins

1393,alberta has over 70 of total irrigated land in canada and 13 irrigation districts are mainly located along the rivers in southern alberta the runoff and irrigation return flow can carry excess nutrients pesticides and sediments which adversely affect the river water quality in the present study the comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of land use pattern and stream water quality in southern alberta was conducted the water quality monitoring on the south saskatchewan river watershed within alberta showed that most water quality indicators did not significantly change between 2003 and 2017 land use maps demonstrated significant urban expansion and cropland decline in the study area from 2005 to 2015 while the irrigation area increased correlation analysis and redundancy analysis revealed that cropland built up land and native grassland were three land use types that were positively correlated with water quality indicators stronger correlations between nitrogen concentration and built up land were found in dry seasons compared with wet seasons according to the results of cluster analysis higher water quality indicator concentrations could be observed in groups with a higher proportion of cropland and built up land significant relationships between land use patterns and water quality were found in this study which demonstrated that further investigation is needed to identify the sources of water pollutants at a smaller scale keywords land use water quality irrigation southern alberta statistical analysis 1 introduction in 2017 food and beverage manufacturing is the second largest manufacturing industry in alberta canada following petroleum and coal product manufacturing alberta agriculture and forestry 2018 of a total of 158 7 million acres of land in alberta 52 million acres are developed for agriculture more than 29 million acres of land are used for crop cultivation and 21 million acres are cultivated or natural pasture for grazing statistics canada 2021 over 1 6 million acres of agricultural land are irrigated in alberta representing around 70 of the total irrigated land in canada irrigated agriculture is an intensive and highly valued industry although only 4 7 of the total cultivated land has an irrigation system 19 of the total of alberta s primary agricultural sales are generated by irrigated agriculture alberta agriculture and forestry 2018 thirteen irrigation districts are mainly located along the rivers in southern alberta however irrigation activities could pose various impacts on water quality in receiving waters the runoff and irrigation return flow could carry excess nutrients pesticides and sediments which adversely affect the river water quality feng et al 2020 hu et al 2020 shen et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 the snowmelt runoff from the rocky mountains in alberta is the main water source for the prairie provinces in 1969 alberta saskatchewan manitoba and the federal government signed the master agreement on apportionment maa to fairly allocate the water resources among the prairie provinces and protect surface water quality it is necessary to protect the water quality and identify the significant pollutant sources thus implementing the efficient environment management strategies chen et al 2021 he et al 2018 vazifeh et al 2021 zhou et al 2019a various studies have investigated the impacts of land use patterns on water quality bu et al 2014 used stepwise multiple regression to analyze the impacts of land use and landscape metrics on surface water quality in the taizi river basin in china similar studies has also been done to assess the impact of land use in different scales sliva and williams 2001 evaluated the effects of 100 m buffer zones on water quality in ontario canada shi et al 2017 investigated influence of land use on water quality in three different scales including reach riparian and catchment scales in addition land use patterns had significant impacts on groundwater quality jia et al 2018 multivariate analysis has also been applied to study the relationships between the land use patterns and water quality in different regions clustering analysis can classify the regions by land use patterns and water quality indicators allowing researchers to investigate their relationships by groups kändler et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 redundancy analysis rda being adopted to study the relationship between two sets of variables has been proven effective in assessing impacts of land uses on water quality shi et al 2017 the objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between spatial temporal patterns of the land cover and water quality in southern alberta cluster analysis is conducted to classify the monitoring stations according to the water quality and the land use patterns of the corresponding watersheds correlation analysis and redundancy analysis are used to determine the land use types that have the most significant impacts on each water quality indicator 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area consists of three sub basins of the south saskatchewan river in southern alberta canada including the bow river watershed the oldman river watershed and the south saskatchewan river watershed fig 1 the drainage area of the study area is 634 000 km2 the bow river and oldman river originate in the rocky mountains and the snowmelt in the mountains contributes to the majority of the annual discharge of these rivers the bow river is the main water source of the most populated area in alberta agriculture municipalities and industry use over 50 of the mean annual discharge the population in the oldman river watershed is lower than that of bow river however the water use is mainly due to irrigated agriculture in the drainage basin the bow river and oldman river meet in the north of grassy lake alberta and form the south saskatchewan river the south saskatchewan river and north saskatchewan river join in saskatchewan and the saskatchewan river finally drains into lake winnipeg in manitoba 2 2 data collection water quality data in the study area were obtained from the national long term water quality monitoring database of environment and climate change canada 2020 and long term river network data were obtained from alberta environment and parks 2020 the details of the stations are listed in table 1 water quality data from federal monitoring stations are available from 2000 onwards while provincial monitoring data are available starting in 1974 water samples are collected bi weekly or monthly to ensure the continuity and consistency of the water quality data the water quality data from may to october for each year between 2003 and 2017 were used for this study the selected water quality indicators included dissolved organic carbon doc total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp total nitrate and nitrite no3 no2 n total nitrogen tn total dissolved solid tds and total suspended solid tss the concentrations are assumed as concentrations of the detection limit for those values below the detection limit a 100 m resolution raster digital elevation model dem data derived from 1955 to 1996 air photography were obtained from alberta environment and parks 2017 land use maps in 2005 2010 and 2015 were obtained from the commission for environmental cooperation 2020 the land use types were categorized into 1 water 2 exposed land which is land that is predominantly non vegetated and non developed including bare soil snow rock sediments etc 3 urban and built up including roads railways buildings urban areas etc 4 wetlands 5 native grassland including unmanaged grassland for pasture 6 cropland including annual cropland fallow cultivated grasses and other perennial crops and 7 forest the drainage basin was delineated based on dem data using the arcgis 10 2 hydrology toolset esri california usa the locations of monitoring stations were used as pour points and thus the drainage basin for each monitoring station can be obtained thus the land use patterns and their impacts on water quality can be analyzed within the drainage basin of each monitoring station the delineated drainage basins are shown in fig 2 2 3 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to investigate the spatial variation of water quality indicators paired t tests were implemented by comparing the water quality indicators by monitoring sites for each period to identify the temporal variations wet may to july and dry august to october seasons in three periods 2003 2007 2008 2012 and 2013 2017 were analyzed separately to determine the seasonal and long term variations in water quality indicators the percentage of land use types for each drainage basin was used in the following statistical analysis to assess the effects of land use patterns on water quality indicators correlation analysis was performed to identify the significant land use types affecting water quality indications pearson correlation coefficients with p values of less than 0 05 were used to determine the relationship between land use types and water quality indicators cluster analysis is a method to group data based on similarity hong et al 2019 to interpret the data cluster analysis was implemented with minitab 18 minitab llc usa to classify the monitoring stations drainage basins according to their land use patterns and water quality indicators using euclidean distance all water quality indicators were used in the analysis the land use types were selected based on the results of correlation analysis to avoid the influence of non critical factors on the clustering results the mean of water chemistry parameters and selected land use types from 2003 to 2017 were standardized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviation rda analysis is a multivariate statistical method that is widely used to study the relationship between environmental variables and their potential impacts song et al 2020 the relationship of land use patterns and water quality indicators was examined by rda using canoco 5 the water quality indicators were standardized and centered using logarithmic transformation y log 10 y 1 before performing the analysis the monte carlo permutation test was applied to measure the significance of the effect of land use types jongman and jongman 1995 the ordination plots are provided to present the results of the rda analysis the arrows indicate the direction of the steepest increase of the corresponding parameter the correlation between land use types and water quality indicators can be approximately explained by the projection of water quality arrow onto the line overlaying the land use arrow the farther the projection point was from the coordinate origin the stronger the correlation between the two variables jongman and jongman 1995 lepš and šmilauer 2003 3 results 3 1 land use patterns and water quality the mean water quality indicators for each monitoring station for the three time periods are shown in fig 3 the results of one way anova demonstrated that all water quality indicators have significant spatial difference p 0 01 the long term water quality changes were determined by comparing the two periods 2003 2007 and 2008 2012 no significant differences in all water quality indicators were observed between the two periods in dry seasons but the significant decreasing trends of doc tp and tn p 0 05 were observed in the wet season the results of paired t tests showed that all water quality indicators had a significant variation p 0 01 between wet and dry seasons except tn p 0 092 all water quality indicators had a generally higher concentration in wet seasons except tn and no3 no2 n the relatively low concentrations of all variables can be observed at monitoring stations f1 f2 p1 and p4 because they are located in the upstream of the watershed which has low population density and agricultural land area the highest concentration of no3 no2 n was found at p5 after the bow river flows through the urban area of calgary however two high points of tn and tdp could be found at stations p5 and f3 generally increasing trends could be observed for doc tds and tss from station p5 to station f3 the land use patterns for each drainage basin in 2005 2010 and 2015 are presented in fig 4 in the upstream of bow river and oldman river over 40 of the land was coved by forest such as in zones f1 f2 p1 and p4 zones p2 p3 p5 p6 p7 and p8 are the main irrigated agricultural regions in alberta and cropland thus occupied the largest proportion there ranging from 38 9 to 76 7 in the downstream native grassland was a significant land use type 45 0 30 7 and 57 4 of the total land was covered by native grassland in p7 p8 and f3 zone p5 which included calgary was the basin with the largest urban area in the study area built up covered 9 2 of total land the land use type with the smallest percentage in the study area was wetland which was less than 0 3 for all 11 zones the land use change from 2005 to 2015 is summarized in table 2 which shows the decrease in cropland in most zones except p3 8 2 p4 2 0 p8 no change and f3 no change the urban and built up land expanded within the ten year period for all zones ranging from 0 4 to 3 5 the forest decline occurred in the upstream zones f1 f2 p3 and p4 had 7 8 2 6 4 8 and 6 4 decreases in forest respectively however there were 4 0 and 9 3 of increase in forest area for the downstream zones p8 and f3 respectively 3 2 correlation analysis a correlation analysis was performed to investigate the effects of land use patterns on water quality table 3 as a major land use type in the study area the cropland was highly positively correlated p 0 05 with doc tdp and tn in both wet and dry seasons tp was only correlated in dry seasons p 0 05 and tds was only correlated in wet seasons p 0 01 forest was negatively related to doc tp tds and tss in both seasons p 0 01 while tdp and tn were negatively related only in wet seasons p 0 05 most water quality indicators also showed a negative correlation p 0 01 or 0 05 with the exposed land except no3 no2 n this could be due to the uneven spatial distribution of these two land use types as shown in fig 2 most forest and exposed land which mainly consisted of snow cover were distributed in the areas with fewer sources of agricultural and urban pollution in the upper reaches of rivers although the percentage of built up area was no more than 10 in those zones in 2015 the pearson correlation coefficients revealed that it positively related to tn in dry seasons p 0 05 and tdp and no3 no2 n p 0 01 or 0 05 in both seasons the high population density in urban areas was one of main sources of the nutrients wetland was positively related to doc p 0 05 in wet seasons and p 0 01 in dry seasons though it occupied only a small proportion of land in all zones 3 3 cluster analysis cluster analysis was used to identify the zones with similar land use patterns and water chemistry in wet and dry seasons fig 5 shows the three clustering groups according to the land use patterns 60 0 similarity water quality indicators in wet seasons 74 8 similarity and dry seasons 62 9 similarity the first group consists of zones f1 f2 p1 and p4 these regions were located in the upper reaches of rivers where the forest dominates the second group was the zones dominated by agricultural land and native grassland including p2 p3 p6 p7 p8 and f3 only zone p5 was assigned to the third group due to its low similarity to other zones which was caused by the relatively high proportion of built up land calgary the largest city in alberta is located in this region the clustering groups assigned according to water quality indicators in two seasons had a similar classification the first group classified by the water quality indicators in wet seasons consists of the exact same zones as the first group which was assigned by land use types due to the relatively lower concentration of nutrients and other indicators compared with other zones in the downstream station p2 had much lower concentrations of tn tp and tss in dry seasons in comparison to wet seasons thus an additional p2 was classified in the first group for wet season water quality indicators the second water quality clustering group also has group members similar to those of the second group clustered by land use types this group had a high concentration of all water quality indicators because the zones in the group are located in the high density irrigated agricultural regions compared with the land use patterns station p6 was added to the third clustering group in both wet and dry seasons water indicator clustering the high nutrient tdp tn and no3 no2 n concentrations were observed in the groups and are characteristic of water chemistry caused by the runoff and discharges from the urban area nyenje et al 2010 zhou et al 2021 although the built up area in zone p6 was not as high as in zone p5 p6 is in the downstream of the zone p5 which results in the similar water quality characteristics 3 4 redundancy analysis the rda analysis was further implemented to study the relationship between seasonal water quality indicators and land use patterns and the resulting ordination plots are presented in fig 6 the permutation tests showed the significance of the analysis with p 0 01 the total water quality variations explained by land use patterns were 79 2 and 82 2 for the wet and dry seasons respectively the majority of variations in water quality can be explained by the first axis with 78 1 and 75 6 of total variations in the wet and dry seasons respectively similar results obtained from correlation analysis can also be found in the rda analysis in wet seasons native grassland wetland cropland and built up land showed a positive correlation with all water quality indicators in addition all indicators were negatively related to forest and exposed land the longer arrows of forest and exposed land in the opposite direction of the water quality arrows indicate their strong negative correlation in dry seasons built up land showed a stronger correlation with nutrients tdp tn and no3 no2 n compared with wet seasons which was similar to the results obtained from the correlation analysis low river flow resulted in the stronger impacts of urban areas on the surface water quality in dry seasons forest and exposed land were two land use types that were positively related to the water quality in the study previous studies have provided evidence that forested catchments have better water quality compared with those with a high percentage of agricultural and urban land brogna et al 2018 kändler et al 2017 the vegetation roots can stabilize the soil and reduce the bank erosion cai et al 2020 xie et al 2020 in addition forest zones along the streams can provide buffer effects on the nutrients and sediment discharges from runoffs an average 55 of nitrogen and 85 of sediments can be removed by 40 m wide forest buffers sweeney and newbold 2014 the majority of the exposed land in the study area was snow and rocks which were mainly distributed in the rocky mountains the percentage of exposed land was gradually decreased and the water quality decreased as the rivers flowed into the prairie which caused the negative correlation between exposed land and water quality the rda analysis showed that the cropland was positively correlated with all water quality variables as shown in fig 2 the agricultural lands were densely distributed along the bow river and oldman river including zones p2 p3 p5 p6 p7 and p8 the return canals in the irrigation districts could carry the high concentration of nutrients and sediment from the runoff to streams chaudhuri et al 2020 guo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 according to the report by charest et al 2015 the irrigation returns in the oldman river contributed 34 8 37 0 and 46 6 of tp tn and tdp loads in wet seasons as well as 68 5 82 0 80 3 of tp tn and tdp loads in dry seasons respectively in addition alberta is the largest cattle production province in canada chen et al 2020 as defined in this study cropland also included many managed pastures and some native grasslands were used as pasture as well the cattle density map in the study area derived from global cattle distribution data gilbert et al 2018 is shown in fig 7 similar to the correlation analysis the native grassland showed a positive correlation with tp and tss for both seasons according to the rda ordination plot fig 6 grazed pasture has been identified as a major nonpoint source of nutrients chaubey et al 2010 shrestha and wang 2020 in addition the high grazing pressure could also result in soil erosion in pastures causing the increase in the tss concentration pilon et al 2017 built up land was considered a significant predictor of the nutrient concentration including tn tdp and no3 no2 n urban areas are a major nitrogen source for stream water a large quantity of nitrogen was emitted to waterbodies from the urban wastewater treatment plant and stormwater drainage system li and davis 2014 van drecht et al 2009 another interesting fact that the rda analysis reveals is that the built up land had higher impacts on the nutrient concentration in dry seasons in comparison to wet seasons this could be due to the fact that cities are the major nitrogen sources in the watershed the low precipitation in dry seasons may not significantly affect urban nitrogen emission and low stream discharge could reduce the dilution

alberta was conducted the water quality monitoring on the south saskatchewan river watershed within alberta showed that most water quality indicators did not significantly change between 2003 and 2017 land use maps demonstrated significant urban expansion and cropland decline in the study area from 2005 to 2015 according to the report by the government of alberta however the irrigation area increased correlation analysis and rda analysis revealed that cropland built up land and native grassland were three land use types that were positively correlated with water quality indicators stronger correlations between nitrogen concentration and built up land were found in dry seasons compared with wet seasons according to the results of cluster analysis higher water quality indicator concentrations could be observed in groups with a higher proportion of cropland and built up land varying significant relationships between land use patterns and water quality were found in sub basins which demonstrated that further investigation is needed to identify the sources of water pollutants at a smaller scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

co2 foams to displace napls from permeable media co2 foams generated only by surfactants are not stable enough for the efficient removal of napls contamination this shortcoming may be alleviated via the use of nanoparticles nps surfactant mixtures as a stabilizing agent this work focuses on the evaluation of the optimum concentration of fly ash nanoparticles for stabilizing co2 foam with the

longpre girard et al 2016 sun et al 2014 yekeen et al 2017 emrani and nasr el din 2017 np stabilized foams have been used in oil recovery and oil contaminated soil remediation karthick et al 2019 but there are few studies focusing on their use in aquifer remediation efforts also most of the studies on foam properties reported in the literature see table 1 for some examples do not address the question of optimum np and surfactant concentrations for remediation of napl contamination for example guo and aryana used sio2 and three surfactants alpha olefin sulfonate aos lauramidopropyl betaine

the oil that remained in the permeable medium at the conclusion of a waterflood phase foams stabilized with fly ash required approximately 35 pore volumes injected pvi in fluidic experiments to achieve this recovery rate guo et al 2017 sub optimal concentrations in the np surfactant mixtures and bypassing of the resident fluid due to the flow regime may have contributed to this displacement behavior guo and aryana 2019 given the economic benefits and the reduced environmental impact that fly ash nps offer compared to other common materials e g silica it is of interest to examine fly ash nps as a foam stabilizer using optimum concentrations of nps and surfactants to that end this work focuses on the use of fly ash nps to stabilize co2 foams and to study the efficacy of an optimized fly ash and surfactant mixture in removing fuel oil from aquifers and contaminated soil a mixture of aos and lapb surfactants is used in conjunction with the nps we examine various concentrations of these ingredients to identify their optimal values in the context of removal of fuel oils from a permeable medium the medium is a quasi 2 dimensional representation of a berea sandstone guo and aryana

generate foams the choice of the surfactants is based on results from previous work where nps lapb aos solutions have been shown to achieve recovery rates of over 90 guo et al 2017 2 2 microfludic device a microfluidic chip surrogate medium is fabricated and used in all experiments discussed in this paper the design of the medium is a quasi 2 dimensional representation of a berea sandstone guo and aryana 2016 which is printed on a transparent film the substrate used in the fabrication process is made of borosilicate glass and is initially covered with a photoresist layer supplied by telic company the pattern is transferred from the film onto the layer of photoresist using a photolithography process berkowski et al 2005 after coating the back side of the substrate with photoresist the substrate is dipped into a buffered dipped etchant bd etchant solution to etch channels with the desired pattern to a depth of 22 μm finally the substrate is thermally bonded to a blank borosilicate glass the chip has an overall dimension of 50 mm 50 mm and the pore network covers an area of 41 mm 36 mm and has an overall porosity of 42 2 3 experimental setup and procedure dynamic light scattering dls is used to investigate the dispersion aggregation of nps in surfactant solutions as a function of the concentration of the nps and the surfactants measurements are conducted using a brookhaven zeta pals instrument at room temperature prior to the dls based measurement of the hydrodynamic particle diameters the np surfactant mixtures are sonicated to de agglomerate the particles the setup for displacement experiments consists of two teledyne isco m5000 pumps one pump provides pressure to inject a fly ash solution while the other pump is used for gas injection a phase one iq3 digital black with a monochromatic 60mp sensor is used to capture images of the medium at a resolution of 8964 by 6716 pixels images are captured at 2 min intervals in the beginning of each flow experiment and every 10 to 30 min once the injection process is stabilized a schematic of the experiment setup is shown in fig 1 deionized di water is injected to simulate an aquifer or a soil system then a mixture of fuel oil and di water is injected into the chip successively at a flow rate of 4 μl min using a syringe pump to obtain the residual oil saturation in the medium the chip is then aged at room temperature for three days in preparation for displacement experiments using foams prior to foam injection the np surfactant solutions are well mixed using 6 mins of ultra sonication qsonic q700 and they are placed inside a transfer vessel that is part of the experimental setup the prepared np surfactant solutions and co2 are co injected to generate foams inside the chip using isco pumps each stream is injected at a flow rate of 15 μl min example images of different stages of injection are shown in fig 2 each experiment is repeated twice after each experiment toluene acetone ethanol and di water are successively injected in the chip successively to clean the medium displacement efficiency is calculated based on the images captured during displacements three steps are involved in processing each image guo et al 2019 wang and aryana 2019 first a perspective transformation szeliski 2010 is performed to extract the portion that is related to the porous medium and to correct minor misalignments second pixels that represent grains are excluded and the remaining pixels correspond to fluids in pores each fluid corresponds to a particular range of pixel values in the pores this range depends on the intensity of the reflected light for that particular fluid a local thresholding strategy is applied to delineate different phases based on these pixel values pal and pal 1993 each image is divided into a set of sub regions across which illumination is relatively uniform in each subregion the kernel density estimation method silverman 1986 is used to build the histogram based on pixel values representing fluids and the corresponding threshold is determined using otsu s method otsu 1979 using appropriate threshold values for each sub region of a given image the overall oil saturation in the chip is calculated as the ratio of the number of pixels that correspond to pore space occupied by oil to the number of pixels that correspond to the total pore space displacement efficiency indicates how much of the resident oil is displaced due to foam injection and it is calculated as the ratio of the change in oil saturation due to foam injection to the oil saturation prior to foam flooding finally bubble numbers are calculated by averaging the number of bubbles in the medium from multiple images 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization in general the hydrodynamic size of the particles is an important factor in their efficacy in stabilizing foams as such we examine the np dispersion aggregation and the hydrodynamic diameters of particles in surfactant solutions using a dls tool once the optimum surfactant concentration is determined the displacement experiments focus on the effect of np concentration as the sole variable in remediation experiments based on the data shown in table 2 a surfactant concentration of 1000 mg l is used in all the flow experiments the efficiency of four different concentrations 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l of fly ash nps in removing napl from the surrogate medium is investigated using a 1000 mg l aos lapb surfactant solution the impact of the concentration of fly ash nps is explored by observing sweep efficiency and the dynamics of displacement 3 2 water injection at the onset of each displacement experiment and prior to foam injection the chip is waterflooded to achieve a residual saturation of the contaminant in the medium during this waterflood stage water does not readily enter the medium and invasion of pore spaces by the injected water occurs after a short period of pressure build up during water injection dominant flow pathways are rapidly established oil globules that reside in these dominant pathways are in part displaced by the injected water oil that resides in other parts of the medium are hardly affected by the waterflood changes in the overall oil saturation due to waterflood are shown in fig 3 the performance of waterflood experiments appears to be in part due to deposits of napl forming on channel walls in parts of the domain based on previous wettability experiments on similar devices guo and aryana 2018 the medium used in this work is expected to be slightly oil wet which explains the appearance of these deposits as shown in fig 4 several small areas of the medium are bypassed in this stage these stranded areas are the target of the remediation effort using co2 foams 3 3 foam injection in the flow experiments two separate lines deliver the np surfactant solution and co2 to a single tube where they mix and generate foam prior to entering the medium prior to foam injection the pressure of the solution is initially maintained slightly above that of the gas at 42 psi versus 35 psi respectively to consistently produce sufficient amounts of foam if the gas injection pressure is too low the solution occupies the line entirely to address this issue gas pressure is increased slowly until foam is observed at the end of the line prior to being connected to the chip once the line is connected to the chip the solution and co2 streams are each injected at a flow rate of 15 μl min infrequent disruptions in foam generation may be observed during the displacement experiments these intermittent disruptions are short a few seconds and are followed by long periods of continuous foam generation foam solution and oil coexist in the interconnected pores however the amount of foam in individual channels varies significantly during the injection process this is attributed to the absence of backpressure in these experiments similar to unconfined soil layers and a build up in foam pressure prior to foam entering channels the process of local pressure build up and invasion is repeated until breakthrough occurs cohen et al 1997 as shown in fig 5 once foam enter the medium it spreads throughout with relative ease and displaces many of the oil pockets that are bypassed during water injection this leads to the recovery of a significant portion of the oil that remains in the medium after the initial waterflood as shown in fig 6 the resident oil appears in two forms 1 oil attached to the matrix and unable to be swept by water injection dashed rectangles in fig 6 and 2 oil that occupies entire channels which is enabled by the development of preferential flow pathways during water injection solid rectangles in fig 6 at the end of foam injection the medium is swept effectively and most of resident oil is displaced the results suggest that foam enters regions that are bypassed during water injection and mobilizes the resident oil by desorbing it from the channel walls in contrast to foam water remains in preferential pathways and does not enter low permeability regions this may be due capillary entry pressures and the apparent viscosity of foam that result in mobility control effects of foams in permeable media lenormand et al 1983 guo and aryana 2018 this observation is consistent with previous studies reported in the literature karthick et al 2019 yekeen et al 2017 3 4 the effect of np concentration on foam performance in fig 7 displacement efficiency is plotted against pore volumes injected pvi for different concentrations of fly ash nps fig 8 shows that an increase in the concentration of nps from 500 to 1000 mg l results in an increase in the ultimate incremental displacement efficiency but additional increases in the np concentrations have an opposite effect the foam with 1000 mg l fly ash has the best performance and is able to displace approximately 45 of the residual oil with respect to waterflood while the other three np concentrations sweep less than 20 of the residual oil after 423 pvi fig 8 shows that average bubble numbers for the foam injection process follow a similar trend as displacement efficiency in other words foam texture characterized by a larger number of bubbles corresponds to a more favorable sweep efficiency the np concentration of 1000 mg l results in the most stable foam with a bubble number that is significantly larger than the other three cases variations in displacement efficiency for each np concentration is attributed to the intermittent behavior of foam generation and variations in dominant flow pathways between experiments also deposition of the oil phase onto grains i e channel walls may partially block some of the pores and decrease connectivity and access to foam 3 5 effect of deposits on foam performance during foam injection the medium is affected by the deposition of dark colored matter on channel walls this effect is specially significant in the case of foams that are generated using 3000 mg l of nps the deposits are micrometers in size and are relatively stable during displacement experiments they appear to partially block some of the pores and affect transport characteristics of the system fig 9 the convergent nature of flow near the outlet port appears to promote the aggregation of these solid deposits in fig 10 the flow field is divided into three regions region 1 contains oil that is unable to be swept by foam and water region 2 is the region where oil may be swept by foam but not by water and in region 3 oil is swept by water during the initial water injection phase at the beginning of foam injection there is more deposition in regions 1 and 2 at the end of foam injection most of the oil is displaced in region 2 while little oil is swept in region 1 most of the oil in region 1 is unswept by the end of foam injection as shown in fig 11 oil saturation changes only slightly in region 3 indicating that most of the oil has been displaced in region 3 during the waterflooding phase this is due to the relatively low effective permeability of regions 1 and 2 which makes waterflood most effective in region 3 in region 2 oil saturation decreases 33 and the ultimate oil saturation is similar to region 3 oil saturation decreases only by 8 in region 1 where blockages caused by the deposits impede the remediation process as shown in fig 12 pores are partially blocked by the deposits and flow appears impaired once deposits form in a region the slowing velocities promote further deposition and flow becomes biased towards higher permeability regions foam flooding and higher injection rates tend to reverse this pattern and help dislodge deposits this effect is seen in region 2 where the ultimate oil saturation is similar to or lower than that in region 3 wettability plays an important role in interactions between napl and channel walls the wetting characteristic of the medium explains the deposition of some of the oil phase on the channel walls some of these deposits are dislodged during the co2 foam injection phase guo and aryana 2018 tetteh et al 2021 in some parts of the medium the deposits are not mobilized by the surfactant solution and foam unlike foams with smaller concentrations of nps foams with 3000 mg l of nps result in significant deposition in channels this deposition appears to partially block some of the pores which adversely affects the remediation process using foams the use of lower concentrations of nps appears to reduce the deposition and damage to the medium previous studies have shown that nps are able to stabilize emulsions referred to as pickering emulsions arab et al 2018 chevalier and bolzinger 2013 zhang et al 2010 nps may stabilize micrometer scale droplets chevalier and bolzinger 2013 and emulsions may be as small as micrometers in diameter which is similar to the deposits observed in this work the nps that may be part of the deposits in the pores may lead to adverse environmental and health effects khan et al 2016 nabhani et al 2010 nel et al 2006 yekeen et al 2018 even though there are diverging views on the broader effects of nps pavan and khabashesku 2015 there exists broad consensus that nps must be used and treated judiciously nel et al 2006 4 conclusion foam stability is strongly affected by both concentration of nps and concentration of surfactants co2 foams with varying concentrations of fly ash nps are used to sweep fuel oil in a microfluidic chip the concentration of nps affects the performance of co2 foam in remediation of napl from the chip for a surfactant mixture of 500 mg l aos and 500 mg l lapb the use of a foam with 1000 mg l of fly ash nps resulted in the largest sweep efficiency this foam swept approximately 45 of the residual oil from the medium unlike the waterflood processes foams are able to displace napl that is adsorbed onto the grains foams are also able to invade low permeability regions of heterogeneous media and remove napl that would be otherwise partially inaccessible in water floods foam generation inside chips under low pressure conditions without the use of back pressure is inconsistent as a result under low pressure conditions the removal of napl from the chip is also inconsistent formation of np deposits on channel walls seems to partially block some of the pores thereby reducing the medium s permeability and foam s effectiveness as part of the remediation of the medium these deposits appear to be more prevalent inside the medium when foams with relatively high concentrations of nps are used as the displacing agent considering both sweep efficiency and the potential blockage caused by these deposits fly ash nps at a concentration of 1000 mg l appear to be optimal in terms of foam performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

misalignments second pixels that represent grains are excluded and the remaining pixels correspond to fluids in pores each fluid corresponds to a particular range of pixel values in the pores this range depends on the intensity of the reflected light for that particular fluid a local thresholding strategy is applied to delineate different phases based on these pixel values pal and pal 1993 each image is divided into a set of sub regions across which illumination is relatively uniform in each subregion the kernel density estimation method silverman 1986 is used to build the histogram based on pixel values representing fluids and the corresponding threshold is determined using otsu s method otsu 1979 using appropriate threshold values for each sub region of a given image the overall oil saturation in the chip is calculated as the ratio of the number of pixels that correspond to pore space occupied by oil to the number of pixels that correspond to the total pore space displacement efficiency indicates how much of the resident oil is displaced due to foam injection and it is calculated as the ratio of the change in oil saturation due to foam injection to the oil saturation prior to foam flooding finally bubble numbers are calculated by averaging the number of bubbles in the medium from multiple images 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization in general the hydrodynamic size of the particles is an important factor in their efficacy in stabilizing foams as such we examine the np dispersion aggregation and the hydrodynamic diameters of particles in surfactant solutions using a dls tool once the optimum surfactant concentration is determined the displacement experiments focus on the effect of np concentration as the sole variable in remediation experiments based on the data shown in table 2 a surfactant concentration of 1000 mg l is used in all the flow experiments the efficiency of four different concentrations 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l of fly ash nps in removing napl from the surrogate medium is investigated using a 1000 mg l aos lapb surfactant solution the impact of the concentration of fly ash nps is explored by observing sweep efficiency and the dynamics of displacement 3 2 water injection at the onset of each displacement experiment and prior to foam injection the chip is waterflooded to achieve a residual saturation of the contaminant in the medium during this waterflood stage water does not readily enter the medium and invasion of pore spaces by the injected water occurs after a short period of pressure build up during water injection dominant flow pathways are rapidly established oil globules that reside in these dominant pathways are in part displaced by the injected water oil that resides in other parts of the medium are hardly affected by the waterflood changes in the overall oil saturation due to waterflood are shown in fig 3 the performance of waterflood experiments appears to be in part due to deposits of napl forming on channel walls in parts of the domain based on previous wettability experiments on similar devices guo and aryana 2018 the medium used in this work is expected to be slightly oil wet which explains the appearance of these deposits as shown in fig 4 several small areas of the medium are bypassed in this stage these stranded areas are the target of the remediation effort using co2 foams 3 3 foam injection in the flow experiments two separate lines deliver the np surfactant solution and co2 to a single tube where they mix and generate foam prior to entering the medium prior to foam injection the pressure of the solution is initially maintained slightly above that of the gas at 42 psi versus 35 psi respectively to consistently produce sufficient amounts of foam if the gas injection pressure is too low the solution occupies the line entirely to address this issue gas pressure is increased slowly until foam is observed at the end of the line prior to being connected to the chip once the line is connected to the chip the solution and co2 streams are each injected at a flow rate of 15 μl min infrequent disruptions in foam generation may be observed during the displacement experiments these intermittent disruptions are short a few seconds and are followed by long periods of continuous foam generation foam solution and oil coexist in the interconnected pores however the amount of foam in individual channels varies significantly during the injection process this is attributed to the absence of backpressure in these experiments similar to unconfined soil layers and a build up in foam pressure prior to foam entering channels the process of local pressure build up and invasion is repeated until breakthrough occurs cohen et al 1997 as shown in fig 5 once foam enter the medium it spreads throughout with relative ease and displaces many of the oil pockets that are bypassed during water injection this leads to the recovery of a significant portion of the oil that remains in the medium after the initial waterflood as shown in fig 6 the resident oil appears in two forms 1 oil attached to the matrix and unable to be swept by water injection dashed rectangles in fig 6 and 2 oil that occupies entire channels which is enabled by the development of preferential flow pathways during water injection solid rectangles in fig 6 at the end of foam injection the medium is swept effectively and most of resident oil is displaced the results suggest that foam enters regions that are bypassed during water injection and mobilizes the resident oil by desorbing it from the channel walls in contrast to foam water remains in preferential pathways and does not enter low permeability regions this may be due capillary entry pressures and the apparent viscosity of foam that result in mobility control effects of foams in permeable media lenormand et al 1983 guo and aryana 2018 this observation is consistent with previous studies reported in the literature karthick et al 2019 yekeen et al 2017 3 4 the effect of np concentration on foam performance in fig 7 displacement efficiency is plotted against pore volumes injected pvi for different concentrations of fly ash nps fig 8 shows that an increase in the concentration of nps from 500 to 1000 mg l results in an increase in the ultimate incremental displacement efficiency but additional increases in the np concentrations have an opposite effect the foam with 1000 mg l fly ash has the best performance and is able to displace approximately 45 of the residual oil with respect to waterflood while the other three np concentrations sweep less than 20 of the residual oil after 423 pvi fig 8 shows that average bubble numbers for the foam injection process follow a similar trend as displacement efficiency in other words foam texture characterized by a larger number of bubbles corresponds to a more favorable sweep efficiency the np concentration of 1000 mg l results in the most stable foam with a bubble number that is significantly larger than the other three cases variations in displacement efficiency for each np concentration is attributed to the intermittent behavior of foam generation and variations in dominant flow pathways between experiments also deposition of the oil phase onto grains i e channel walls may partially block some of the pores and decrease connectivity and access to foam 3 5 effect of deposits on foam performance during foam injection the medium is affected by the deposition of dark colored matter on channel walls this effect is specially significant in the case of foams that are generated using 3000 mg l of nps the deposits are micrometers in size and are relatively stable during displacement experiments they appear to partially block some of the pores and affect transport characteristics of the system fig 9 the convergent nature of flow near the outlet port appears to promote the aggregation of these solid deposits in fig 10 the flow field is divided into three regions region 1 contains oil that is unable to be swept by foam and water region 2 is the region where oil may be swept by foam but not by water and in region 3 oil is swept by water during the initial water injection phase at the beginning of foam injection there is more deposition in regions 1 and 2 at the end of foam injection most of the oil is displaced in region 2 while little oil is swept in region 1 most of the oil in region 1 is unswept by the end of foam injection as shown in fig 11 oil saturation changes only slightly in region 3 indicating that most of the oil has been displaced in region 3 during the waterflooding phase this is due to the relatively low effective permeability of regions 1 and 2 which makes waterflood most effective in region 3 in region 2 oil saturation decreases 33 and the ultimate oil saturation is similar to region 3 oil saturation decreases only by 8 in region 1 where blockages caused by the deposits impede the remediation process as shown in fig 12 pores are partially blocked by the deposits and flow appears impaired once deposits form in a region the slowing velocities promote further deposition and flow becomes biased towards higher permeability regions foam flooding and higher injection rates tend to reverse this pattern and help dislodge deposits this effect is seen in region 2 where the ultimate oil saturation is similar to or lower than that in region 3 wettability plays an important role in interactions between napl and channel walls the wetting characteristic of the medium explains the deposition of some of the oil phase on the channel walls some of these deposits are dislodged during the co2 foam injection phase guo and aryana 2018 tetteh et al 2021 in some parts of the medium the deposits are not mobilized by the surfactant solution and foam unlike foams with smaller concentrations of nps foams with 3000 mg l of nps result in significant deposition in channels this deposition appears to partially block some of the pores which adversely affects the remediation process using foams the use of lower concentrations of nps appears to reduce the deposition and damage to the medium previous studies have shown that nps are able to stabilize emulsions referred to as pickering emulsions arab et al 2018 chevalier and bolzinger 2013 zhang et al 2010 nps may stabilize micrometer scale droplets chevalier and bolzinger 2013 and emulsions may be as small as micrometers in diameter which is similar to the deposits observed in this work the nps that may be part of the deposits in the pores may lead to adverse environmental and health effects khan et al 2016 nabhani et al 2010 nel et al 2006 yekeen et al 2018 even though there are diverging views on the broader effects of nps pavan and khabashesku 2015 there exists broad consensus that nps must be used and treated judiciously nel et al 2006 4 conclusion foam stability is strongly affected by both concentration of nps and concentration of surfactants co2 foams with varying concentrations of fly ash nps are used to sweep fuel oil in a microfluidic chip the concentration of nps affects the performance of co2 foam in remediation of napl from the chip for a surfactant mixture of 500 mg l aos and 500 mg l lapb the use of a foam with 1000 mg l of fly ash nps resulted in the largest sweep efficiency this foam swept approximately 45 of the residual oil from the medium unlike the waterflood processes foams are able to displace napl that is adsorbed onto the grains foams are also able to invade low permeability regions of heterogeneous media and remove napl that would be otherwise partially inaccessible in water floods foam generation inside chips under low pressure conditions without the use of back pressure is inconsistent as a result under low pressure conditions the removal of napl from the chip is also inconsistent formation of np deposits on channel walls seems to partially block some of the pores thereby reducing the medium s permeability and foam s effectiveness as part of the remediation of the medium these deposits appear to be more prevalent inside the medium when foams with relatively high concentrations of nps are used as the displacing agent considering both sweep efficiency and the potential blockage caused by these deposits fly ash nps at a concentration of 1000 mg l appear to be optimal in terms of foam performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
