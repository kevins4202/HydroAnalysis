9520,the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum might provide valuable information for assessing plant water status nevertheless the plant s physiology and the scale of measurement e g sensor viewing geometry and the canopy aggregation are critical for quantifiying and monitoring water stress this study compares the crop water stress index cwsi of a peach orchard obtained using on the ground and airborne based canopy temperature tc the temporal evolution of cwsi under mild water stress conditions was assessed for three different irrigation strategies over irrigation oi farmer irrigation fi and non irrigation ni two aerial campaigns per irrigation season 2017 2018 were performed with an airborne thermal sensor a first flight under well watered conditions and a second flight once mild water stress was developed at the time of the flights tc and net photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and stem water potential ψs were measured on the ground with a hand held thermal camera a portable gas exchange system and a pressure chamber respectively the canopy temperature obtained from the hand held thermal camera averaging the sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy agreed with that derived from the airborne measurements y 1 00x rmse 1 97 k the cwsi values calculated from both approaches detected peach water status under different irrigation strategies in general ψs was better predicted from the aircraft r² up to 0 72 for cwsi obtained from the aircraft versus r2 0 51 for tc ground measurements whereas the use of ground measurements was preferred for estimating gs and pn r² up to 0 73 and 0 74 for tc ground measurements versus r2 45 and 0 56 for tc and cwsi derived from the aircraft regardless the approach used for deriving tc and due to the consideration of different meteorological conditions i e different dates cwsi provided a better relationship with ψs than tc whereas the latter was more closely related with gs and pn keywords physiological parameters remote sensing thermography canopy temperature 1 introduction understanding the main effects of water stress on plant water status is required in order to define adequate scheduling irrigation for reducing the negative impacts of drought on tree growth and production steduto et al 2012 thus in recent years there has been a great interest in searching for plant based water status indicators alternative to the stem water potential which is considered the standard for plant based irrigation management and for water stress assessment garcía tejera et al 2021 shackel et al 2021 in this sense canopy temperature has been generally accepted as a reliable and non invasive indicator of crop water stress by capturing the limitation of the dissipation of the latent heat flux by plant transpiration tanner 1963 gates 1964 however the possibility of determining plant water status from canopy determinations depends on the plant s physiological responses to soil water deficit i e isohydric versus anisohydric behaviors leaf anatomy large versus lanceolate leaves and the environmental conditions particularly the wind speed jones 2004a 2004b leaf temperature measurement has been usually performed on the ground with infrared radiometers hand held thermal guns and camera thermography however one of the main problems of the use of on ground indicators is that due to its punctual nature a large number of measurements covering the entire study area are needed to properly characterize the spatial variability of the crop water status among trees within an orchard due to variability in both soil volume explored and tree foliar surface and within a single tree canopy cohen et al 2005 ngao et al 2017 this variability depends on many factors including physical chemical properties of soils texture depth nutrients organic matter etc plant morphology canopy size and architecture field topography existence of microclimates or the presence of pathogens among others starr 2005 the limitations indicated above can be overcome with the development of recent technological advances in remote sensing in the thermal domain new compact thermal cameras allow capturing spatial surface temperature data thus facilitating the mapping of canopy temperature variability over the entire plot non invasively cohen et al 2005 ortega farías et al 2016 however contrary to ground measured tc measurements collected below the clouds the use of remote sensing for determining tc specifically from satellites is limited only to clear sky conditions additionally requiring the absence of wind in the case of airborne thermal imaging agam et al 2013 the accuracy of surface temperature retrievals from remote sensing is quite dependent on sensor calibration atmospheric attenuation and sourcing surface emissivity view angle and shadowing norman et al 1995 moreover its accuracy also depends on the platform used for acquiring the image ranging from 1 to 2 k when using satellite data wan 2014 sobrino et al 2020 and reaching accuracies lower than 1 k when manned aircraft or drones are used sepulcre cantó et al 2006 berni et al 2009 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 the use of tc as a water status indicator requires normalization to account for the varying environmental conditions idso et al 1981 to deal with it tc can be used in combination to air temperature ta as an indicator of water status this has been explored since the pioneering work by idso et al 1981 which described the crop water stress index cwsi this index was specifically developed for fully covering crops but the improvements in the spatial resolution of thermal sensors during the last decades have allowed its application to row crops the computation of cwsi requires the use of two anchor thresholds to normalize for the effects of atmospheric conditions on transpiration and canopy temperature king et al 2021 these thresholds correspond to fully transpiring lower limit ll and non transpiring upper limit ul conditions respectively initially ll and ul were determined using natural references i e crop regions maintained under fully transpiring and non transpiring conditions clawson et al 1989 jones 1999b jones et al 2002 however determining the natural references still remains a challenge in practical conditions due to the lack of uniformity and reproducibility and to the difficulty in achieving and maintaining such anchor canopy conditions cohen et al 2005 möller et al 2007 king et al 2021 alternative methods of estimating ll and ul have been proposed in the literature thus an example is the use of artificial reference surfaces alchanatis et al 2010 o shaughnessy et al 2011 pou et al 2014 in such approach ul is set to ta 5 ºc value found as the maximum leaf temperature under several conditions according to cohen et al 2005 irmak et al 2000 and möller et al 2007 whereas the lower limit is determined based on reference measurements of a wet artificial reference surface captured by the thermal image however the high sensitivity of cwsi to the value assigned to ul and the need for capturing a wet reference in every analysed image have been highlighted as the main limitations of this empirical approach ben gal et al 2009 even if these drawbacks limit the usefulness of empirical cwsi for routine measurements agam et al 2013 the use of natural and artificial references has allowed researchers to successfully capture water status in soybean o shaughnessy et al 2011 cotton cohen et al 2005 o shaughnessy et al 2011 grapevines möller et al 2007 and olives ben gal et al 2009 among other crops another alternative to the empirical determination of cwsi thresholds is their analytical calculation based on the canopy energy balance jackson et al 1981 1988 jones 1999a nonetheless contrary to empirical approaches theoretical formulation requires meteorological data e g incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed for the estimation of net radiation and aerodynamic resistance which can result in high uncertainties in the cwsi calculation ben gal et al 2009 moreover several authors have indicated that a theoretical ll and ul formulation is limited by the complexity of the canopy architecture particularly in woody crops and the influence of environmental conditions in the soil plant atmosphere continuum idso et al 1981 jones 1999a 2004 king et al 2021 the determination of these thresholds is also subjected to the uncertainty caused by the tree crown subcomponent selection to carry out the measurements for instance when obtaining thermal imagery from remote sensing e g uavs or aircrafts the thermal sensor measures the temperature of the upper part of the tree which has warmer and more sun exposed leaves than the tree as a whole ngao et al 2017 gonzález dugo et al 2012 on the contrary when performing the measurements on the ground tc varies depending on the side of the tree where the measurements are taken thus the validity of ul and ll obtained from remote sensing measurement needs to be carefully checked when combined to ground tc measurements one of the main limitations of ground and airborne thermography refers to the instantaneous nature of thermal sensors which provide measurements at a certain moment the quick temporal variability of tc could make that the instantaneous tc acquired by the sensor differs considerably from one moment to another which would severely affect the intercomparison between measurements taken at different times i e in different thermal images specifically peters and evett 2004 and reddy et al 2015 found tc variations of up to 2 4 ºc respectively in a 30 min period several studies have shown accurate relationships of crop water stress indicators with physiological parameters in heterogeneous crops including vineyards möller et al 2007 baluja et al 2012 king and shellie 2016 sepúlveda reyes et al 2016 santesteban et al 2017 poblete et al 2018 citrus gonzalez dugo et al 2014 almond camino et al 2018 pistachio gonzalez dugo et al 2015 olive ben gal et al 2009 and peach bellvert et al 2016 among others to the best of our knowledge no studies have been conducted on the direct evaluation of on the ground versus airborne level cwsi calculations for assessing crop water stress in an orchard jamshidi et al 2021 ben gal et al 2009 this is critical for identifying the main strengths and limitations of each approach and for helping to select the most appropriate method depending on the crop site specificities the relationships between canopy temperature taken from different sources and several physiological indicators of plant water status need to be explored to assess the implications of different tc quantifications the main objective of this research is to check the suitability of two methodologies on ground and remote based thermal imaging for identifying mild water stresses in a peach orchard in particular this objective was addressed by i assessing the correlation between cwsi and midday stem water potential and leaf gas exchange parameters and ii evaluating whether the ll and ul appropriate for one of the methodologies are also appropriate for the other or whether they need to be modified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and irrigation strategies the experiment was performed in 2017 2018 in a peach orchard prunus persica var amandine of 3 4 ha located in murcia south eastern spain 38 06 n 1 12 w trees were planted in 2013 with a nw se row orientation and a planting framework of 5 3 5 m mean standard deviation canopy diameter and tree height were 3 3 m 0 4 m and 2 4 m 0 1 m respectively trees were drip irrigated with one irrigation line resulting in a density of 6 drippers with a flow rate of 3 2 l h 1 per tree the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was 2 2 ds m 1 and the soil in the area was clay loam the climate in the study area is semi arid mediterranean with an average air temperature and relative humidity of 18 0 c minimum of 2 4 ºc and maximum of 30 9 ºc and 55 8 minimum of 22 7 and maximum of 86 8 respectively and a cumulative yearly precipitation and reference evapotranspiration of 306 and 1411 mm yr 1 respectively for the period 2017 2018 weather station code mo22 http siam imida es the suitability of on ground and remote thermal sensing based methods for identifying mild water stress in the study area was tested the effect of three irrigation strategies applied prior to the development of stress was evaluated i farmer irrigation fi where the trees were irrigated for replacing 100 etc until harvest adopting a late mild deficit irrigation strategy in order to save water and cope with the chronic water scarcity in the area ii over irrigating 7 days before the initial flight of each season to ensure non water stress initial conditions oi by duplicating the number of drippers and iii non irrigation ni where the trees were not irrigated on the 7 days prior to the initial flight of each season fig s1 each irrigation treatment was applied to a tree line keeping one border line between the different irrigation treatments for each irrigation strategy three trees were selected as sample trees fig 1 2 2 airborne campaigns two airborne remote sensing campaigns at the post harvest period were performed per year 2017 and 2018 table 1 employing a cessna c172s aircraft operated by the laboratory for research methods in quantitative remote sensing quantalab ias csic spain flights were carried out at solar midday time at 200 m above ground level agl the first flight was carried out under overall well watered conditions except for the ni treatment which was not irrigated in the previous 7 days t0 fig s1 whereas the second flight was performed once mild water stress developed t1 fig s1 soil water deficit was imposed by withholding irrigation for 3 4 days before the second thermal image acquisition for fi and oi and no irrigation conditions were maintained for ni table 1 fig s1 canopy temperature was acquired from a thermal sensor on board the aircraft the thermal sensor was a flir sc655 thermal camera flir systems wilsonville or usa which acquires images in the 7 5 13 µm range with a resolution of 640 480 pixels and an optics focal length of 13 1 mm that yields an angular fov of 45 and a spatial resolution of 25 cm fig 1 this sensor has a thermal sensitivity and an absolute accuracy of 0 05 k at 303 15 k and 2 k respectively thermal images were radiometrically atmospherically and geometrically corrected for further information about sensor setting and calibration see zarco tejada et al 2012 and ramírez cuesta et al 2019 thermal images were mosaicked using pix4d software pix4d lausanne switzerland additionally in order to extract the canopy temperature from the crowns segmentation of pure vegetation and bare soil surfaces was performed by delineating isotherms at 0 1 k intervals with arcgis v 10 5 esri redlands ca usa thus a temperature threshold was visually selected in the transition area between both surface types i e where the isotherms were closer to each other the identification of the 9 individual trees 3 per treatment was performed using a fishnet methodology that created a mesh that was applied in all flights in order to obtain the same identifier for each tree 2 2 1 crop water stress index calculation the crop water stress index calculated from the airborne thermal imagery cwsia was calculated as follows idso et al 1981 1 cws i a t c a t a t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l where tc a is the canopy temperature calculated as the average of the pure vegetation pixels within a tree ta is the air temperature recorded at the time of the measurements obtained from the nearest weather station tc ta l is the lower baseline representing a canopy transpiring at the potential rate and tc ta u is the upper baseline referring to a canopy where transpiration is completely stopped since cwsi considers canopy to air temperature differences temperatures can be expressed in k or ºc but must be consistent for all terms this index ranges from values close to 0 when the crop is fully watered to 1 when the crop is under severe water stress conditions in this study the lower baseline utilised was the one proposed by berni et al 2012 i e tc ta l 1 57 vpd 3 25 whereas the upper baseline was set as ta 5 k or ºc depending on ta units as suggested by irmak et al 2000 2 3 ground measurements 2 3 1 canopy temperature and cwsi a hand held thermal camera thermacam flir e50 system inc danderyd sweden was used to collect thermal images of the sunlit part of the tree canopy in three trees per irrigation treatment at the time of the airborne campaigns figs 2 and 3 this camera operates in the 7 5 13 µm electromagnetic region with a 240 180 pixel line scan imager providing a thermal sensitivity and an absolute accuracy of 0 05 k at 303 15 k and 2 k respectively two thermal images per tree and irrigation treatment n 6 per treatment were taken from the sunlit side of the canopy at a constant distance of 1 5 m from the plant canopy and at a constant height of 1 6 m see tc boxes in fig 4 each thermal image approximately covered an area of 0 70 0 70 m the background temperature was established to discard the effect of the radiation originating from other objects that reflects off the target being measured costa et al 2013 it was determined as the temperature of a crumpled aluminium sheet placed in a similar position to the area of interest and setting the emissivity at 1 0 jones et al 2002 emissivity for leaf measurements was assumed as 0 96 jones 2004a 2004b grant et al 2006 the thermacam explorer software flir quick report flir systems danderyd sweden was used for processing thermal images for each thermal image five sunlit areas 30 per treatment were manualy identified fig 4 which were averaged to obtain a global tc value these tc images obtained from the sunny side were used to establish the correlation with the physiological parameters measured in the same trees see 2 3 2 physiological determinations in addition to the tc images acquired on the sunny side another two tc images per tree were taken on the shaded side similarly to tc boxes in fig 4 in order to evaluate the tc pattern within the plant for the comparison between the tc obtained from the hand held thermal camera tc g both in the sunlit and shaded sides of the trees and the tc a the percent bias pbias statistical indicator was used this indicator provides insights into the aircraft derived data to be larger or smaller than their corresponding on ground data calculated as 2 pbia s 100 i 1 n t c g t c a i 1 n t c g where n is the number of sampled trees positive values of pbias imply that the determinations at the airborne level underestimates the on ground values and vice versa fandiño et al 2015 additionally tc g was used in conjunction with the temperature of dry td and wet tw reference leaves in order to compute cwsi cwsig according to jones et al 2002 3 c ws i g t c g t w t d t w wet reference temperature tw corresponds to a fully open stomata leaf whereas a non transpiring one with completely closed stomata was taken as the dry reference temperature td such conditions were achieved in each sampled tree by spraying two leaves with soapy water on both sides for tw and covering another two leaves in petroleum jelly vaseline on both sides for td jones et al 2002 these leaves were captured in two images per tree containing a wet and a dry reference each one acquired at a distance of about 1 m from the plant canopy and an height of 1 6 m thus a general tw and td for each irrigation treatment was calculated as the average of the 6 individual reference tw and td values additionally a hybrid cwsi cwsih was computed using tc g and ta in order to consider an upper baseline higher than the maximum values of tc actually measured thus the lower baseline was the same one used for cwsia computation berni et al 2012 however the upper baseline was re calculated by using the relationship between the tc a from each sampled tree and date n 36 and its corresponding tc g measured on the sunlit part resulting in a tc ta u value of 8 71 k 4 cws i h t c g t a t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l 2 3 2 physiological determinations net photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and midday stem water potential ψs were monitored at the time of the image acquisition leaf gas exchange was measured on four mature sunlit leaves per sampled tree using a portable gas exchange system li cor li 6400 lincoln ne usa with mean values of ambient photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd around 1800 µmol m 2 s 1 the air flow was set to 300 ml min 1 and a near constant ambient co2 concentration of 400 µmol mol 1 regarding ψs it was monitored on one leaf per sampled tree using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp model3000 santa barbara ca usa the selected leaves were placed in plastic bags covered with aluminium foil for at least 1 h prior to the measurements thus leaf water potential equalled ψs begg and turner 1976 3 results 3 1 canopy temperature comparison fig 5 shows the comparison for all dates and trees between the tc obtained from the hand held thermal camera at the sunlit and shaded sides of the trees tc g and the near nadir temperature determined from the aircraft tc a when comparing tc a and tc g in the sunlit and shaded sides pbias values of 0 91 and 1 61 were obtained respectively fig 5 however when canopy temperature measured on the ground was calculated as the average of the sunlit and shaded sides a regression closer to the 1 1 in comparison with that derived from the aircraft was obtained with pbias equals to 0 34 fig 5 still these comparisons showed intercept terms far from zero 53 194 k as well as presenting some scatter in the data with rmse values ranging from 1 67 to 5 01 k 3 2 assessment of the airborne versus handheld based cwsi as an indicator of tree water status fig 6 shows the airborne cwsi cwsia and ψs for both non water stress day 1 and water stress conditions day 2 in 2017 and 2018 in day 1 oi plants had higher ψs values than fi 0 98 vs 1 27 mpa in 2017 and 1 02 vs 1 40 mpa in 2018 with ni being the treatment with the lowest ψs values 2 33 and 1 95 mpa for 2017 and 2018 respectively however after imposing the mild water stress day 2 no significant differences were observed in ψs between the irrigation treatments with all of them obtaining average ψs values lower than 1 60 mpa and reaching a minimum under these conditions of 2 20 mpa for the ni treatment in 2017 for both years the oi treatment showed very low cwsia values 0 09 on day 1 indicating non stressed water status conditions of the plants under this irrigation strategy a higher cwsia value was obtained for the fi treatment on day 1 with values ranging from 0 17 to 0 24 in 2018 and 2017 respectively fig 6 on the contrary cwsia values obtained for the ni treatment on day 1 cwsia from 0 39 to 0 46 in 2017 and 2018 respectively were significatively higher than the cwsia from oi and fi indicating that ni trees suffered from water stress conditions from the beginning as expected however when analysing cwsia values on day 2 after withholding irrigation for 3 or 4 days the average cwsia for all treatments was higher than those obtained on day 1 which indicates higher water stress levels fig 6 when comparing the different irrigation strategies on day 2 all the treatments reached similar values in 2017 cwsia varying from 0 49 to 0 54 whereas in 2018 the oi treatment still showed lower cwsia values than fi and ni with values of 0 23 and 0 46 0 50 respectively fig 6 when analysing the ground based cwsi cwsig and the hybrid cwsi cwsih patterns figs 7 and 8 a similar pattern to that observed from the airborne measurements was obtained on day 1 with the oi treatment yielding lower values than fi or ni respectively nevertheless no significant differences were found in cwsig on day 1 from 2017 in addition after applying the mild water stress day 2 figs 7 and 8 non significant differences between the fi and ni treatments were obtained in terms of cwsig 0 72 0 84 day 2 in fig 7 and cwsih 0 66 0 87 day 2 in fig 8 values whereas cwsig and cwsih values from the oi treatment cwsig of 0 52 0 57 and cwsih of 0 34 were maintained below fi and ni which is in accordance to the pattern observed in the cwsia values from 2018 fig 6 on the other hand contrary to what was observed in the cwsia the cwsig and cwsih had greater values for all the treatments and water stress conditions assessed figs 7 and 8 when analysing the tc ta versus vapour pressure deficit vpd data plot fig 9 it can be observed that for each date the oi treatment was the closest to the lower baseline from both the airborne and the hand held camera results the oi trees farthest from the lower baseline corresponded with oi trees under mild water stress conditions day 2 of 2017 and 2018 the fi and ni treatments presented higher tc ta values but their behaviour depended on the approach used for deriving tc when tc was obtained from the aircraft tc a all the fi and ni trees showed tc a ta values always lower than the upper baseline used in this approach 5º c contrarily when the hand held camera was used for deriving tc tc g most of the tc g ta values of the fi and ni treatments were greater than the upper baseline proposed by irmak et al 2000 tc g ta 5 00 ºc or k but lower than the upper baseline derived for the hybrid approach tc g ta 8 71 k when comparing the cwsia with cwsig and cwsih values fig 10 it was observed that the relationship obtained for both indices had an r2 of 0 37 and 0 36 for cwsig and cwsih respectively in addition the cwsi computed from airborne data cwsia was always lower than the cwsi computed from ground tc measurements cwsig and cwsih 3 3 relationships between physiological and thermal parameters 3 3 1 stem water potential fig 11 shows the relationship between ψs and tc or cwsi cwsia cwsig and cwsih with an inversely proportional pattern found for both of them however when analysing which variable tc or cwsi and source ground or airborne was more appropriate for deriving ψs fig 11 it was observed that the most accurate ψs estimates were obtained using cwsia r2 of 0 72 tc measured on the ground and cwsih provided ψs estimates with r2 values of 0 51 and 0 58 respectively whereas the use of tc from the airborne measurements and cwsig resulted in poorer accuracies r2 of 0 27 and 0 31 respectively 3 3 2 stomatal conductance fig 12 shows gs values obtained for the different irrigation strategies for both non water stress day 1 and water stress conditions day 2 in 2017 and 2018 for day 1 in both years the oi treatment obtained the highest gs values 229 244 mmol m 2 s 1 followed by fi 95 158 mmol m 2 s 1 and ni 35 52 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively after the imposition of a mild water stress in 2017 and 2018 day 2 it was observed that gs decreased from day 1 to day 2 in the oi from 244 to 168 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2017 and from 229 to 199 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2018 and fi treatments from 95 to 58 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2017 and from 158 to 98 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2018 whereas ni remained the same or even increased specifically the fi treatment reached similar values to those of the ni treatment 23 58 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2017 and 83 98 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2018 whereas oi still had significantly higher values than the other treatments 168 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2017 and 199 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2018 fig 13 shows the relationship of gs with tc and cwsi stomatal conductance correlates negatively with tc and cwsi as expected however in this case both for tc and cwsi the use of ground measurements provided more accurate results than using data from airborne imagery especially in the case of tc g and cwsih with r2 of 0 74 and 0 79 respectively however when data acquired from the airborne measurements was used cwsia r2 of 0 56 was preferred over the use of tc r2 of 0 41 for estimating gs 3 3 3 net photosynthesis the pattern observed in pn fig 14 was the same as that for ψs and gs in both years for non water stress conditions day 1 pn was greater for the oi and fi than for ni treatment with average values ranging from 16 2 to 16 7 µmol m 2 s 1 for oi from 8 9 to 12 5 µmol m 2 s 1 for fi and from 3 2 to 3 3 µmol m 2 s 1 for ni when comparing the different irrigation strategies in water stress conditions day 2 no significant differences were observed between the fi and ni treatments with values ranging from 2 4 to 5 4 µmol m 2 s 1 for 2017 and from 8 7 to 9 7 µmol m 2 s 1 for 2018 however pn values obtained for the oi treatment were significantly greater than those of fi and ni with values close to 14 5 µmol m 2 s 1 for both years the relationship of pn with tc and cwsi followed a similar pattern than those obtained for gs with pn being higher as tc or cwsi were lower fig 15 in general tc provided better results than using cwsia and cwsig for pn estimation r2 of 0 73 vs 0 58 when using ground measurements and r2 of 0 45 vs 0 44 when using data derived from airborne measurements nevertheless the use of cwsih for pn estimation provided similar accuracies than using ground tc r2 of 0 73 in addition the use of ground measurements both tc and cwsi resulted in more accurate pn estimates than using tc and cwsi values obtained from the airborne ones r2 of 0 73 vs 0 45 for tc and r2 of 0 58 0 73 vs 0 44 for cwsi therefore the use of ground tc measurements and cwsih for estimating pn provided the most accurate estimates r2 of 0 73 4 discussion the complexity and heterogeneity of canopy architecture including leaf angle distribution and leaf area density create a spatial and temporal tc heterogeneity within plant canopies leinonen and jones 2004 such canopy heterogeneity induces certain degree of variability in crop water status determination depending on the canopy region considered for extracting tc in this sense ngao et al 2017 assessed the interactions between climate tree architecture and plant physiology in young apple trees specifically these authors evidenced that in the absence of drought the leaf temperature gradient was smaller in the upper part of the tree than for the whole crown with the upper portion of the canopies having warmer leaves temperatures and a more random distribution in addition ngao et al 2017 observed that drought influenced the within crown microclimate increasing leaf spatial variability regardless of the tree position considered moreover camino et al 2018 observed that when using the tc from the top of the tree derived from an uav out of range cwsi values were obtained as a consequence of the within crown shadows and the soil background effects for overcoming the influence of soil background camino et al 2018 proposed considering uniquely thermal pixels contained in crown areas below the 50th percentile in addition there might be large variations in canopy temperature within a tree crown possibly influencing the ability to detect plant water status using thermography gonzález dugo et al 2012 this is an important issue when determining the portions of the tree crowns that should be preferentially measured and the type of instruments to be used for determining tc in this study the tc derived from the airborne platform allowed the measurement of a high number of trees integrating the entire tree crown including both sun exposed and shaded areas within the canopy ballester et al 2013a b such tc airborne measurements collect a more representative tree thermal status than the on ground thermal measurements taken in specific portions of a tree crown in fact airborne tc was higher than the tc obtained from the ground data in the shaded parts of the tree fig 5 and lower than that measured in the sunlit part most exposed to the solar radiation when averaging the ground measurements of tc in both the sunlit and shaded parts of the tree a relationship close to 1 1 between the two approaches was obtained therefore due to the nadir view zenith angle of the sensor on board the airborne platform a remote sensing based approach is able to reveal the spatial within crown tc heterogeneity gonzález dugo et al 2012 such intra crown heterogeneity is also partially feasible using handheld thermal cameras with the inconvenience that these sensors are not able to capture both the shaded and sun exposed parts of the crown in a single image due to its lateral view another disadvantage of using handheld thermal cameras is that they usually capture a single tree per image which coupled with the variability of tc due to external factors such as instantaneous wind or radiation variability ramírez cuesta et al 2022 hinder the inter tree tc comparison on the contrary the use of handheld thermal cameras allows an easy tc image acquisition without requiring much prior logistics when the cwsi values obtained from the different proposed approaches were compared it was observed that they followed the same relative behaviour nevertheless large differences were found when the absolute values were considered more specifically at initial conditions the oi treatment was less stressed than fi and ni respectively and these differences were minimized after the mild water stress was imposed this resulted in fi reaching similar cwsi values to the ni treatment but the oi trees still showed less water stress than the other two treatments probably due to the high soil moisture during the days previous to the stress one exception was observed in 2017 where cwsi from oi in day 2 reached similar values than ni and fi this was probably because in that year there was one more day for developing the mild water stress than in 2018 4 days in 2017 versus 3 days in 2018 table 1 additionally 2017 was drier than 2018 mean daily eto and cumulative p of 5 2 and 88 mm for 2017 respectively and 5 1 and 145 mm for 2018 respectively for the period march august so a lower soil water availability could be expected which could help explaining these similar cwsi values in day 2 from 2017 however higher cwsi values were obtained from on ground tc measurements even under well watered conditions suggesting that this approach might overestimate the crop water stress using on site references particularly for obtaining tw is a procedure influenced by experimental errors because there might be large variations in tw within a tree canopy and the leaf wetness level is very dynamic particularly under warm and dry conditions aparecido et al 2017 in addition the cwsi estimation procedure using on site wet and dry reference leaves was obtained considering the sun exposed side of the tree crown which is the portion of tree canopy with higher absolute tc levels similar responses to the water stress development than those obtained for cwsi were observed when analysing pn gs and ψs parameters indicating that at initial conditions the oi treatment was less stressed than fi and ni respectively whereas the differences between treatments were minimized when a short water restriction was applied in this sense it is important to note that even for the fi treatment a pre existing stress was observed at the initial conditions as reflected by the relatively high cwsi values and the low pn gs and ψs values obtained at day 1 t0 from both years this was probably due to the high evaporative demand at the time of image acquisition being more evident in 2018 when daily et0 was greater 8 6 mm d 1 table 1 and also to the adoption of mild deficit irrigation after harvest in fi as a standard practice for early maturing stone fruit trees cultivated in the area this fact highlights that cwsi is closely related with pn gs and ψs in a manner that high tc and cwsi values reflect the stomatal closure induced by the water stress values which reduces pn gs and ψs values jackson et al 1981 jones 1999a b gonzalez dugo et al 2014 egea et al 2017 the relationships reported here between pn and cwsi are however empirical and associated to the fact that both cwsi and pn are affected by stomatal closure more direct estimates of canopy photosynthesis could be made from remote sensing data using vegetation indices calculated from narrowband reflectance measurements such as those derived from hyperspectral sensors stagakis et al 2012 including fluorescence quantification zarco tejada et al 2013a 2013b 2016 however the results derived from our study suggest that the strength of these relationships was dependent on the approach used to determine tc and cwsi i e ground vs airborne in general more accurate relationships between tc and cwsi with pn and gs were obtained when using data measured on ground which could be explained because these physiological parameters were measured on the same side of the tree sunlit side than tc and cwsi from the ground additionally the leaf age seems to have an influence on the results obtained as the zenithal field of view of the thermal sensor on board the airborne mainly collects the new shoots located on the upper part of the tree crowns whereas the ground measurements where performed on the older leaves located on the lower parts of the tree syvertsen 1982 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 other authors have also pointed out the importance of shadows on thermal studies bellvert et al 2014 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 which can explain the differences between the relationships obtained from ground measurements and airborne ones on the other hand ψs was better determined from airborne data since this physiological parameter was less sensitive to the location of the measurement within the tree than pn and gs due to the homogenization performed when placing the sampled leaves in plastic bags covered with aluminium foil for at least 1 h prior to the measurements the relatively accurate relationship found between tc with pn gs and ψs when ground measurements were used confirms the use of canopy temperature as a good indicator of crop water status similar findings have been obtained in the literature garcía tejero et al 2018 romero trigueros et al 2019 conesa et al 2019 under similar environmental conditions than in the present study when the climatic conditions do not differ much among the days of tc measurement it is possible to find good agreements between tc itself and other indicators of plant water status however it is still important to normalize the absolute tc measurements by using references to take into account the environmental conditions ballester et al 2013a b zarco tejada et al 2012 gonzalez dugo et al 2020 the present study showed how the approach followed for normalizing tc values was a determinant factor for a quantitative assement of crop water status over the course of given period of time in fact when comparing airborne acquired cwsi and tc as water status indicators it was observed that cwsi was more accurately related to the crop water status defined by ψs similar results were reported by gonzalez dugo et al 2014 and romero trigueros et al 2019 more specifically gonzalez dugo et al 2014 noted that the better performance of the cwsi was because it considers the evaporative demand as well as the species specific response of water relations to vpd in this sense it is remarkable that the performance of cwsi when predicting plant water status using airborne images was even better than when cwsi was obtained from on the ground measurements this is despite the lower spatial resolution obtained with the airborne imagery as compared with the on the ground camera to the best of our knowledge this is the first study comparing the ability of thermal imagery to detect water stress using on the ground and aerial platforms the main advantage of aerial imagery is based on its ability to measure a large surface area which is important particularly in the case of water status assessment plant water status is in fact highly variable and strongly affected by environmental conditions this implies that a few number of replicates can be measured on the ground this is even more important when large tree to tree variability is observed as in the present study the standard error se for tc between trees from the same treatment ranged from 0 03 to 0 78 k when airborne data was used whereas it ranged from 0 15 to 1 46 k when the on ground approach was used the same pattern was observed for cwsi with se values up to 0 03 and 0 08 for airborne and on ground approaches respectively this lower variability observed between trees from the same treatment when using the aircraft imagery is due to the wider canopy proportion captured when the airborne platform was used as compared to the narrower canopy area recorded with the hand held thermal camera the use of a remote sensing platforms is in fact nowadays widely employed and the present research indeed confirms its robustness when compared with simultaneous measurements on the ground when using only data acquired from the ground tc g provided better ψs estimations than when using cwsig this can be explained because the equation used for determining cwsig from tc g is quite dependent on the leaves used for calculating the index especially those selected as wet and dry references and those on which the ψs measurement was performed in this sense cwsih with the incorporation of ta the lower baseline used in the airborne approach and the re calculation of the upper baseline i e the hybrid approach provided a closer relationship with ψs than using tc g specifically the hybrid approach uses the existing relationship between the temperature of the top and the lateral region of the trees for establishing the link between different methodologies i e uav versus handheld thermal cameras it broadens the applicability of the thresholds used for cwsi calculation to sensors acquiring thermal images at different scales of measurement however special attention should be paid when directly using tc g for calculating cwsi using eq 1 since cwsi overestimations can be obtained if the baselines especially the upper one are not adjusted these overestimates are caused by higher tc values when measured on the ground considering only the sunny side of the tree as opposed to those obtained from airborne measured tc this suggests more stressful conditions than they actually are 5 conclusions this study evaluates the feasibility of on the ground and airborne based thermal indicators for identifying and quantifying the water status of a peach orchard under different irrigation regimes cwsi values obtained from both ground and airborne platforms were able to detect peach water status under different irrigation strategies however whereas cwsi calculated from the aircraft integrated the entire tree crown cwsi derived from sunlit ground tc measurements tended to overestimate crop water stress special attention should be paid when combining on the ground and airborne based thermal data hybrid approach due to the large effects caused by the baselines when computing cwsi using each method in general ψs was better estimated from the aircraft than from ground measurement confirming the robustness of airborne thermal imaging for large scale monitoring despite its generally lower spatial resolution however the use of ground measurements yielded better results than airborne thermal data when comparing against gs and pn suggesting that local effects on leaf gas exchange were better captured perhaps due to the higher spatial resolution of the proximal ground thermal sensors regardless the approach used for deriving tc cwsi provided a better relationship with ψs than using tc allowing for the quantitative assement of water status during the course of time period and the integration of the effect of the climatic conditions on plant water status declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9520,the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum might provide valuable information for assessing plant water status nevertheless the plant s physiology and the scale of measurement e g sensor viewing geometry and the canopy aggregation are critical for quantifiying and monitoring water stress this study compares the crop water stress index cwsi of a peach orchard obtained using on the ground and airborne based canopy temperature tc the temporal evolution of cwsi under mild water stress conditions was assessed for three different irrigation strategies over irrigation oi farmer irrigation fi and non irrigation ni two aerial campaigns per irrigation season 2017 2018 were performed with an airborne thermal sensor a first flight under well watered conditions and a second flight once mild water stress was developed at the time of the flights tc and net photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and stem water potential ψs were measured on the ground with a hand held thermal camera a portable gas exchange system and a pressure chamber respectively the canopy temperature obtained from the hand held thermal camera averaging the sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy agreed with that derived from the airborne measurements y 1 00x rmse 1 97 k the cwsi values calculated from both approaches detected peach water status under different irrigation strategies in general ψs was better predicted from the aircraft r² up to 0 72 for cwsi obtained from the aircraft versus r2 0 51 for tc ground measurements whereas the use of ground measurements was preferred for estimating gs and pn r² up to 0 73 and 0 74 for tc ground measurements versus r2 45 and 0 56 for tc and cwsi derived from the aircraft regardless the approach used for deriving tc and due to the consideration of different meteorological conditions i e different dates cwsi provided a better relationship with ψs than tc whereas the latter was more closely related with gs and pn keywords physiological parameters remote sensing thermography canopy temperature 1 introduction understanding the main effects of water stress on plant water status is required in order to define adequate scheduling irrigation for reducing the negative impacts of drought on tree growth and production steduto et al 2012 thus in recent years there has been a great interest in searching for plant based water status indicators alternative to the stem water potential which is considered the standard for plant based irrigation management and for water stress assessment garcía tejera et al 2021 shackel et al 2021 in this sense canopy temperature has been generally accepted as a reliable and non invasive indicator of crop water stress by capturing the limitation of the dissipation of the latent heat flux by plant transpiration tanner 1963 gates 1964 however the possibility of determining plant water status from canopy determinations depends on the plant s physiological responses to soil water deficit i e isohydric versus anisohydric behaviors leaf anatomy large versus lanceolate leaves and the environmental conditions particularly the wind speed jones 2004a 2004b leaf temperature measurement has been usually performed on the ground with infrared radiometers hand held thermal guns and camera thermography however one of the main problems of the use of on ground indicators is that due to its punctual nature a large number of measurements covering the entire study area are needed to properly characterize the spatial variability of the crop water status among trees within an orchard due to variability in both soil volume explored and tree foliar surface and within a single tree canopy cohen et al 2005 ngao et al 2017 this variability depends on many factors including physical chemical properties of soils texture depth nutrients organic matter etc plant morphology canopy size and architecture field topography existence of microclimates or the presence of pathogens among others starr 2005 the limitations indicated above can be overcome with the development of recent technological advances in remote sensing in the thermal domain new compact thermal cameras allow capturing spatial surface temperature data thus facilitating the mapping of canopy temperature variability over the entire plot non invasively cohen et al 2005 ortega farías et al 2016 however contrary to ground measured tc measurements collected below the clouds the use of remote sensing for determining tc specifically from satellites is limited only to clear sky conditions additionally requiring the absence of wind in the case of airborne thermal imaging agam et al 2013 the accuracy of surface temperature retrievals from remote sensing is quite dependent on sensor calibration atmospheric attenuation and sourcing surface emissivity view angle and shadowing norman et al 1995 moreover its accuracy also depends on the platform used for acquiring the image ranging from 1 to 2 k when using satellite data wan 2014 sobrino et al 2020 and reaching accuracies lower than 1 k when manned aircraft or drones are used sepulcre cantó et al 2006 berni et al 2009 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 the use of tc as a water status indicator requires normalization to account for the varying environmental conditions idso et al 1981 to deal with it tc can be used in combination to air temperature ta as an indicator of water status this has been explored since the pioneering work by idso et al 1981 which described the crop water stress index cwsi this index was specifically developed for fully covering crops but the improvements in the spatial resolution of thermal sensors during the last decades have allowed its application to row crops the computation of cwsi requires the use of two anchor thresholds to normalize for the effects of atmospheric conditions on transpiration and canopy temperature king et al 2021 these thresholds correspond to fully transpiring lower limit ll and non transpiring upper limit ul conditions respectively initially ll and ul were determined using natural references i e crop regions maintained under fully transpiring and non transpiring conditions clawson et al 1989 jones 1999b jones et al 2002 however determining the natural references still remains a challenge in practical conditions due to the lack of uniformity and reproducibility and to the difficulty in achieving and maintaining such anchor canopy conditions cohen et al 2005 möller et al 2007 king et al 2021 alternative methods of estimating ll and ul have been proposed in the literature thus an example is the use of artificial reference surfaces alchanatis et al 2010 o shaughnessy et al 2011 pou et al 2014 in such approach ul is set to ta 5 ºc value found as the maximum leaf temperature under several conditions according to cohen et al 2005 irmak et al 2000 and möller et al 2007 whereas the lower limit is determined based on reference measurements of a wet artificial reference surface captured by the thermal image however the high sensitivity of cwsi to the value assigned to ul and the need for capturing a wet reference in every analysed image have been highlighted as the main limitations of this empirical approach ben gal et al 2009 even if these drawbacks limit the usefulness of empirical cwsi for routine measurements agam et al 2013 the use of natural and artificial references has allowed researchers to successfully capture water status in soybean o shaughnessy et al 2011 cotton cohen et al 2005 o shaughnessy et al 2011 grapevines möller et al 2007 and olives ben gal et al 2009 among other crops another alternative to the empirical determination of cwsi thresholds is their analytical calculation based on the canopy energy balance jackson et al 1981 1988 jones 1999a nonetheless contrary to empirical approaches theoretical formulation requires meteorological data e g incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed for the estimation of net radiation and aerodynamic resistance which can result in high uncertainties in the cwsi calculation ben gal et al 2009 moreover several authors have indicated that a theoretical ll and ul formulation is limited by the complexity of the canopy architecture particularly in woody crops and the influence of environmental conditions in the soil plant atmosphere continuum idso et al 1981 jones 1999a 2004 king et al 2021 the determination of these thresholds is also subjected to the uncertainty caused by the tree crown subcomponent selection to carry out the measurements for instance when obtaining thermal imagery from remote sensing e g uavs or aircrafts the thermal sensor measures the temperature of the upper part of the tree which has warmer and more sun exposed leaves than the tree as a whole ngao et al 2017 gonzález dugo et al 2012 on the contrary when performing the measurements on the ground tc varies depending on the side of the tree where the measurements are taken thus the validity of ul and ll obtained from remote sensing measurement needs to be carefully checked when combined to ground tc measurements one of the main limitations of ground and airborne thermography refers to the instantaneous nature of thermal sensors which provide measurements at a certain moment the quick temporal variability of tc could make that the instantaneous tc acquired by the sensor differs considerably from one moment to another which would severely affect the intercomparison between measurements taken at different times i e in different thermal images specifically peters and evett 2004 and reddy et al 2015 found tc variations of up to 2 4 ºc respectively in a 30 min period several studies have shown accurate relationships of crop water stress indicators with physiological parameters in heterogeneous crops including vineyards möller et al 2007 baluja et al 2012 king and shellie 2016 sepúlveda reyes et al 2016 santesteban et al 2017 poblete et al 2018 citrus gonzalez dugo et al 2014 almond camino et al 2018 pistachio gonzalez dugo et al 2015 olive ben gal et al 2009 and peach bellvert et al 2016 among others to the best of our knowledge no studies have been conducted on the direct evaluation of on the ground versus airborne level cwsi calculations for assessing crop water stress in an orchard jamshidi et al 2021 ben gal et al 2009 this is critical for identifying the main strengths and limitations of each approach and for helping to select the most appropriate method depending on the crop site specificities the relationships between canopy temperature taken from different sources and several physiological indicators of plant water status need to be explored to assess the implications of different tc quantifications the main objective of this research is to check the suitability of two methodologies on ground and remote based thermal imaging for identifying mild water stresses in a peach orchard in particular this objective was addressed by i assessing the correlation between cwsi and midday stem water potential and leaf gas exchange parameters and ii evaluating whether the ll and ul appropriate for one of the methodologies are also appropriate for the other or whether they need to be modified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and irrigation strategies the experiment was performed in 2017 2018 in a peach orchard prunus persica var amandine of 3 4 ha located in murcia south eastern spain 38 06 n 1 12 w trees were planted in 2013 with a nw se row orientation and a planting framework of 5 3 5 m mean standard deviation canopy diameter and tree height were 3 3 m 0 4 m and 2 4 m 0 1 m respectively trees were drip irrigated with one irrigation line resulting in a density of 6 drippers with a flow rate of 3 2 l h 1 per tree the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was 2 2 ds m 1 and the soil in the area was clay loam the climate in the study area is semi arid mediterranean with an average air temperature and relative humidity of 18 0 c minimum of 2 4 ºc and maximum of 30 9 ºc and 55 8 minimum of 22 7 and maximum of 86 8 respectively and a cumulative yearly precipitation and reference evapotranspiration of 306 and 1411 mm yr 1 respectively for the period 2017 2018 weather station code mo22 http siam imida es the suitability of on ground and remote thermal sensing based methods for identifying mild water stress in the study area was tested the effect of three irrigation strategies applied prior to the development of stress was evaluated i farmer irrigation fi where the trees were irrigated for replacing 100 etc until harvest adopting a late mild deficit irrigation strategy in order to save water and cope with the chronic water scarcity in the area ii over irrigating 7 days before the initial flight of each season to ensure non water stress initial conditions oi by duplicating the number of drippers and iii non irrigation ni where the trees were not irrigated on the 7 days prior to the initial flight of each season fig s1 each irrigation treatment was applied to a tree line keeping one border line between the different irrigation treatments for each irrigation strategy three trees were selected as sample trees fig 1 2 2 airborne campaigns two airborne remote sensing campaigns at the post harvest period were performed per year 2017 and 2018 table 1 employing a cessna c172s aircraft operated by the laboratory for research methods in quantitative remote sensing quantalab ias csic spain flights were carried out at solar midday time at 200 m above ground level agl the first flight was carried out under overall well watered conditions except for the ni treatment which was not irrigated in the previous 7 days t0 fig s1 whereas the second flight was performed once mild water stress developed t1 fig s1 soil water deficit was imposed by withholding irrigation for 3 4 days before the second thermal image acquisition for fi and oi and no irrigation conditions were maintained for ni table 1 fig s1 canopy temperature was acquired from a thermal sensor on board the aircraft the thermal sensor was a flir sc655 thermal camera flir systems wilsonville or usa which acquires images in the 7 5 13 µm range with a resolution of 640 480 pixels and an optics focal length of 13 1 mm that yields an angular fov of 45 and a spatial resolution of 25 cm fig 1 this sensor has a thermal sensitivity and an absolute accuracy of 0 05 k at 303 15 k and 2 k respectively thermal images were radiometrically atmospherically and geometrically corrected for further information about sensor setting and calibration see zarco tejada et al 2012 and ramírez cuesta et al 2019 thermal images were mosaicked using pix4d software pix4d lausanne switzerland additionally in order to extract the canopy temperature from the crowns segmentation of pure vegetation and bare soil surfaces was performed by delineating isotherms at 0 1 k intervals with arcgis v 10 5 esri redlands ca usa thus a temperature threshold was visually selected in the transition area between both surface types i e where the isotherms were closer to each other the identification of the 9 individual trees 3 per treatment was performed using a fishnet methodology that created a mesh that was applied in all flights in order to obtain the same identifier for each tree 2 2 1 crop water stress index calculation the crop water stress index calculated from the airborne thermal imagery cwsia was calculated as follows idso et al 1981 1 cws i a t c a t a t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l where tc a is the canopy temperature calculated as the average of the pure vegetation pixels within a tree ta is the air temperature recorded at the time of the measurements obtained from the nearest weather station tc ta l is the lower baseline representing a canopy transpiring at the potential rate and tc ta u is the upper baseline referring to a canopy where transpiration is completely stopped since cwsi considers canopy to air temperature differences temperatures can be expressed in k or ºc but must be consistent for all terms this index ranges from values close to 0 when the crop is fully watered to 1 when the crop is under severe water stress conditions in this study the lower baseline utilised was the one proposed by berni et al 2012 i e tc ta l 1 57 vpd 3 25 whereas the upper baseline was set as ta 5 k or ºc depending on ta units as suggested by irmak et al 2000 2 3 ground measurements 2 3 1 canopy temperature and cwsi a hand held thermal camera thermacam flir e50 system inc danderyd sweden was used to collect thermal images of the sunlit part of the tree canopy in three trees per irrigation treatment at the time of the airborne campaigns figs 2 and 3 this camera operates in the 7 5 13 µm electromagnetic region with a 240 180 pixel line scan imager providing a thermal sensitivity and an absolute accuracy of 0 05 k at 303 15 k and 2 k respectively two thermal images per tree and irrigation treatment n 6 per treatment were taken from the sunlit side of the canopy at a constant distance of 1 5 m from the plant canopy and at a constant height of 1 6 m see tc boxes in fig 4 each thermal image approximately covered an area of 0 70 0 70 m the background temperature was established to discard the effect of the radiation originating from other objects that reflects off the target being measured costa et al 2013 it was determined as the temperature of a crumpled aluminium sheet placed in a similar position to the area of interest and setting the emissivity at 1 0 jones et al 2002 emissivity for leaf measurements was assumed as 0 96 jones 2004a 2004b grant et al 2006 the thermacam explorer software flir quick report flir systems danderyd sweden was used for processing thermal images for each thermal image five sunlit areas 30 per treatment were manualy identified fig 4 which were averaged to obtain a global tc value these tc images obtained from the sunny side were used to establish the correlation with the physiological parameters measured in the same trees see 2 3 2 physiological determinations in addition to the tc images acquired on the sunny side another two tc images per tree were taken on the shaded side similarly to tc boxes in fig 4 in order to evaluate the tc pattern within the plant for the comparison between the tc obtained from the hand held thermal camera tc g both in the sunlit and shaded sides of the trees and the tc a the percent bias pbias statistical indicator was used this indicator provides insights into the aircraft derived data to be larger or smaller than their corresponding on ground data calculated as 2 pbia s 100 i 1 n t c g t c a i 1 n t c g where n is the number of sampled trees positive values of pbias imply that the determinations at the airborne level underestimates the on ground values and vice versa fandiño et al 2015 additionally tc g was used in conjunction with the temperature of dry td and wet tw reference leaves in order to compute cwsi cwsig according to jones et al 2002 3 c ws i g t c g t w t d t w wet reference temperature tw corresponds to a fully open stomata leaf whereas a non transpiring one with completely closed stomata was taken as the dry reference temperature td such conditions were achieved in each sampled tree by spraying two leaves with soapy water on both sides for tw and covering another two leaves in petroleum jelly vaseline on both sides for td jones et al 2002 these leaves were captured in two images per tree containing a wet and a dry reference each one acquired at a distance of about 1 m from the plant canopy and an height of 1 6 m thus a general tw and td for each irrigation treatment was calculated as the average of the 6 individual reference tw and td values additionally a hybrid cwsi cwsih was computed using tc g and ta in order to consider an upper baseline higher than the maximum values of tc actually measured thus the lower baseline was the same one used for cwsia computation berni et al 2012 however the upper baseline was re calculated by using the relationship between the tc a from each sampled tree and date n 36 and its corresponding tc g measured on the sunlit part resulting in a tc ta u value of 8 71 k 4 cws i h t c g t a t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l 2 3 2 physiological determinations net photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and midday stem water potential ψs were monitored at the time of the image acquisition leaf gas exchange was measured on four mature sunlit leaves per sampled tree using a portable gas exchange system li cor li 6400 lincoln ne usa with mean values of ambient photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd around 1800 µmol m 2 s 1 the air flow was set to 300 ml min 1 and a near constant ambient co2 concentration of 400 µmol mol 1 regarding ψs it was monitored on one leaf per sampled tree using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp model3000 santa barbara ca usa the selected leaves were placed in plastic bags covered with aluminium foil for at least 1 h prior to the measurements thus leaf water potential equalled ψs begg and turner 1976 3 results 3 1 canopy temperature comparison fig 5 shows the comparison for all dates and trees between the tc obtained from the hand held thermal camera at the sunlit and shaded sides of the trees tc g and the near nadir temperature determined from the aircraft tc a when comparing tc a and tc g in the sunlit and shaded sides pbias values of 0 91 and 1 61 were obtained respectively fig 5 however when canopy temperature measured on the ground was calculated as the average of the sunlit and shaded sides a regression closer to the 1 1 in comparison with that derived from the aircraft was obtained with pbias equals to 0 34 fig 5 still these comparisons showed intercept terms far from zero 53 194 k as well as presenting some scatter in the data with rmse values ranging from 1 67 to 5 01 k 3 2 assessment of the airborne versus handheld based cwsi as an indicator of tree water status fig 6 shows the airborne cwsi cwsia and ψs for both non water stress day 1 and water stress conditions day 2 in 2017 and 2018 in day 1 oi plants had higher ψs values than fi 0 98 vs 1 27 mpa in 2017 and 1 02 vs 1 40 mpa in 2018 with ni being the treatment with the lowest ψs values 2 33 and 1 95 mpa for 2017 and 2018 respectively however after imposing the mild water stress day 2 no significant differences were observed in ψs between the irrigation treatments with all of them obtaining average ψs values lower than 1 60 mpa and reaching a minimum under these conditions of 2 20 mpa for the ni treatment in 2017 for both years the oi treatment showed very low cwsia values 0 09 on day 1 indicating non stressed water status conditions of the plants under this irrigation strategy a higher cwsia value was obtained for the fi treatment on day 1 with values ranging from 0 17 to 0 24 in 2018 and 2017 respectively fig 6 on the contrary cwsia values obtained for the ni treatment on day 1 cwsia from 0 39 to 0 46 in 2017 and 2018 respectively were significatively higher than the cwsia from oi and fi indicating that ni trees suffered from water stress conditions from the beginning as expected however when analysing cwsia values on day 2 after withholding irrigation for 3 or 4 days the average cwsia for all treatments was higher than those obtained on day 1 which indicates higher water stress levels fig 6 when comparing the different irrigation strategies on day 2 all the treatments reached similar values in 2017 cwsia varying from 0 49 to 0 54 whereas in 2018 the oi treatment still showed lower cwsia values than fi and ni with values of 0 23 and 0 46 0 50 respectively fig 6 when analysing the ground based cwsi cwsig and the hybrid cwsi cwsih patterns figs 7 and 8 a similar pattern to that observed from the airborne measurements was obtained on day 1 with the oi treatment yielding lower values than fi or ni respectively nevertheless no significant differences were found in cwsig on day 1 from 2017 in addition after applying the mild water stress day 2 figs 7 and 8 non significant differences between the fi and ni treatments were obtained in terms of cwsig 0 72 0 84 day 2 in fig 7 and cwsih 0 66 0 87 day 2 in fig 8 values whereas cwsig and cwsih values from the oi treatment cwsig of 0 52 0 57 and cwsih of 0 34 were maintained below fi and ni which is in accordance to the pattern observed in the cwsia values from 2018 fig 6 on the other hand contrary to what was observed in the cwsia the cwsig and cwsih had greater values for all the treatments and water stress conditions assessed figs 7 and 8 when analysing the tc ta versus vapour pressure deficit vpd data plot fig 9 it can be observed that for each date the oi treatment was the closest to the lower baseline from both the airborne and the hand held camera results the oi trees farthest from the lower baseline corresponded with oi trees under mild water stress conditions day 2 of 2017 and 2018 the fi and ni treatments presented higher tc ta values but their behaviour depended on the approach used for deriving tc when tc was obtained from the aircraft tc a all the fi and ni trees showed tc a ta values always lower than the upper baseline used in this approach 5º c contrarily when the hand held camera was used for deriving tc tc g most of the tc g ta values of the fi and ni treatments were greater than the upper baseline proposed by irmak et al 2000 tc g ta 5 00 ºc or k but lower than the upper baseline derived for the hybrid approach tc g ta 8 71 k when comparing the cwsia with cwsig and cwsih values fig 10 it was observed that the relationship obtained for both indices had an r2 of 0 37 and 0 36 for cwsig and cwsih respectively in addition the cwsi computed from airborne data cwsia was always lower than the cwsi computed from ground tc measurements cwsig and cwsih 3 3 relationships between physiological and thermal parameters 3 3 1 stem water potential fig 11 shows the relationship between ψs and tc or cwsi cwsia cwsig and cwsih with an inversely proportional pattern found for both of them however when analysing which variable tc or cwsi and source ground or airborne was more appropriate for deriving ψs fig 11 it was observed that the most accurate ψs estimates were obtained using cwsia r2 of 0 72 tc measured on the ground and cwsih provided ψs estimates with r2 values of 0 51 and 0 58 respectively whereas the use of tc from the airborne measurements and cwsig resulted in poorer accuracies r2 of 0 27 and 0 31 respectively 3 3 2 stomatal conductance fig 12 shows gs values obtained for the different irrigation strategies for both non water stress day 1 and water stress conditions day 2 in 2017 and 2018 for day 1 in both years the oi treatment obtained the highest gs values 229 244 mmol m 2 s 1 followed by fi 95 158 mmol m 2 s 1 and ni 35 52 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively after the imposition of a mild water stress in 2017 and 2018 day 2 it was observed that gs decreased from day 1 to day 2 in the oi from 244 to 168 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2017 and from 229 to 199 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2018 and fi treatments from 95 to 58 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2017 and from 158 to 98 mmol m 2 s 1 in 2018 whereas ni remained the same or even increased specifically the fi treatment reached similar values to those of the ni treatment 23 58 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2017 and 83 98 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2018 whereas oi still had significantly higher values than the other treatments 168 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2017 and 199 mmol m 2 s 1 for 2018 fig 13 shows the relationship of gs with tc and cwsi stomatal conductance correlates negatively with tc and cwsi as expected however in this case both for tc and cwsi the use of ground measurements provided more accurate results than using data from airborne imagery especially in the case of tc g and cwsih with r2 of 0 74 and 0 79 respectively however when data acquired from the airborne measurements was used cwsia r2 of 0 56 was preferred over the use of tc r2 of 0 41 for estimating gs 3 3 3 net photosynthesis the pattern observed in pn fig 14 was the same as that for ψs and gs in both years for non water stress conditions day 1 pn was greater for the oi and fi than for ni treatment with average values ranging from 16 2 to 16 7 µmol m 2 s 1 for oi from 8 9 to 12 5 µmol m 2 s 1 for fi and from 3 2 to 3 3 µmol m 2 s 1 for ni when comparing the different irrigation strategies in water stress conditions day 2 no significant differences were observed between the fi and ni treatments with values ranging from 2 4 to 5 4 µmol m 2 s 1 for 2017 and from 8 7 to 9 7 µmol m 2 s 1 for 2018 however pn values obtained for the oi treatment were significantly greater than those of fi and ni with values close to 14 5 µmol m 2 s 1 for both years the relationship of pn with tc and cwsi followed a similar pattern than those obtained for gs with pn being higher as tc or cwsi were lower fig 15 in general tc provided better results than using cwsia and cwsig for pn estimation r2 of 0 73 vs 0 58 when using ground measurements and r2 of 0 45 vs 0 44 when using data derived from airborne measurements nevertheless the use of cwsih for pn estimation provided similar accuracies than using ground tc r2 of 0 73 in addition the use of ground measurements both tc and cwsi resulted in more accurate pn estimates than using tc and cwsi values obtained from the airborne ones r2 of 0 73 vs 0 45 for tc and r2 of 0 58 0 73 vs 0 44 for cwsi therefore the use of ground tc measurements and cwsih for estimating pn provided the most accurate estimates r2 of 0 73 4 discussion the complexity and heterogeneity of canopy architecture including leaf angle distribution and leaf area density create a spatial and temporal tc heterogeneity within plant canopies leinonen and jones 2004 such canopy heterogeneity induces certain degree of variability in crop water status determination depending on the canopy region considered for extracting tc in this sense ngao et al 2017 assessed the interactions between climate tree architecture and plant physiology in young apple trees specifically these authors evidenced that in the absence of drought the leaf temperature gradient was smaller in the upper part of the tree than for the whole crown with the upper portion of the canopies having warmer leaves temperatures and a more random distribution in addition ngao et al 2017 observed that drought influenced the within crown microclimate increasing leaf spatial variability regardless of the tree position considered moreover camino et al 2018 observed that when using the tc from the top of the tree derived from an uav out of range cwsi values were obtained as a consequence of the within crown shadows and the soil background effects for overcoming the influence of soil background camino et al 2018 proposed considering uniquely thermal pixels contained in crown areas below the 50th percentile in addition there might be large variations in canopy temperature within a tree crown possibly influencing the ability to detect plant water status using thermography gonzález dugo et al 2012 this is an important issue when determining the portions of the tree crowns that should be preferentially measured and the type of instruments to be used for determining tc in this study the tc derived from the airborne platform allowed the measurement of a high number of trees integrating the entire tree crown including both sun exposed and shaded areas within the canopy ballester et al 2013a b such tc airborne measurements collect a more representative tree thermal status than the on ground thermal measurements taken in specific portions of a tree crown in fact airborne tc was higher than the tc obtained from the ground data in the shaded parts of the tree fig 5 and lower than that measured in the sunlit part most exposed to the solar radiation when averaging the ground measurements of tc in both the sunlit and shaded parts of the tree a relationship close to 1 1 between the two approaches was obtained therefore due to the nadir view zenith angle of the sensor on board the airborne platform a remote sensing based approach is able to reveal the spatial within crown tc heterogeneity gonzález dugo et al 2012 such intra crown heterogeneity is also partially feasible using handheld thermal cameras with the inconvenience that these sensors are not able to capture both the shaded and sun exposed parts of the crown in a single image due to its lateral view another disadvantage of using handheld thermal cameras is that they usually capture a single tree per image which coupled with the variability of tc due to external factors such as instantaneous wind or radiation variability ramírez cuesta et al 2022 hinder the inter tree tc comparison on the contrary the use of handheld thermal cameras allows an easy tc image acquisition without requiring much prior logistics when the cwsi values obtained from the different proposed approaches were compared it was observed that they followed the same relative behaviour nevertheless large differences were found when the absolute values were considered more specifically at initial conditions the oi treatment was less stressed than fi and ni respectively and these differences were minimized after the mild water stress was imposed this resulted in fi reaching similar cwsi values to the ni treatment but the oi trees still showed less water stress than the other two treatments probably due to the high soil moisture during the days previous to the stress one exception was observed in 2017 where cwsi from oi in day 2 reached similar values than ni and fi this was probably because in that year there was one more day for developing the mild water stress than in 2018 4 days in 2017 versus 3 days in 2018 table 1 additionally 2017 was drier than 2018 mean daily eto and cumulative p of 5 2 and 88 mm for 2017 respectively and 5 1 and 145 mm for 2018 respectively for the period march august so a lower soil water availability could be expected which could help explaining these similar cwsi values in day 2 from 2017 however higher cwsi values were obtained from on ground tc measurements even under well watered conditions suggesting that this approach might overestimate the crop water stress using on site references particularly for obtaining tw is a procedure influenced by experimental errors because there might be large variations in tw within a tree canopy and the leaf wetness level is very dynamic particularly under warm and dry conditions aparecido et al 2017 in addition the cwsi estimation procedure using on site wet and dry reference leaves was obtained considering the sun exposed side of the tree crown which is the portion of tree canopy with higher absolute tc levels similar responses to the water stress development than those obtained for cwsi were observed when analysing pn gs and ψs parameters indicating that at initial conditions the oi treatment was less stressed than fi and ni respectively whereas the differences between treatments were minimized when a short water restriction was applied in this sense it is important to note that even for the fi treatment a pre existing stress was observed at the initial conditions as reflected by the relatively high cwsi values and the low pn gs and ψs values obtained at day 1 t0 from both years this was probably due to the high evaporative demand at the time of image acquisition being more evident in 2018 when daily et0 was greater 8 6 mm d 1 table 1 and also to the adoption of mild deficit irrigation after harvest in fi as a standard practice for early maturing stone fruit trees cultivated in the area this fact highlights that cwsi is closely related with pn gs and ψs in a manner that high tc and cwsi values reflect the stomatal closure induced by the water stress values which reduces pn gs and ψs values jackson et al 1981 jones 1999a b gonzalez dugo et al 2014 egea et al 2017 the relationships reported here between pn and cwsi are however empirical and associated to the fact that both cwsi and pn are affected by stomatal closure more direct estimates of canopy photosynthesis could be made from remote sensing data using vegetation indices calculated from narrowband reflectance measurements such as those derived from hyperspectral sensors stagakis et al 2012 including fluorescence quantification zarco tejada et al 2013a 2013b 2016 however the results derived from our study suggest that the strength of these relationships was dependent on the approach used to determine tc and cwsi i e ground vs airborne in general more accurate relationships between tc and cwsi with pn and gs were obtained when using data measured on ground which could be explained because these physiological parameters were measured on the same side of the tree sunlit side than tc and cwsi from the ground additionally the leaf age seems to have an influence on the results obtained as the zenithal field of view of the thermal sensor on board the airborne mainly collects the new shoots located on the upper part of the tree crowns whereas the ground measurements where performed on the older leaves located on the lower parts of the tree syvertsen 1982 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 other authors have also pointed out the importance of shadows on thermal studies bellvert et al 2014 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 which can explain the differences between the relationships obtained from ground measurements and airborne ones on the other hand ψs was better determined from airborne data since this physiological parameter was less sensitive to the location of the measurement within the tree than pn and gs due to the homogenization performed when placing the sampled leaves in plastic bags covered with aluminium foil for at least 1 h prior to the measurements the relatively accurate relationship found between tc with pn gs and ψs when ground measurements were used confirms the use of canopy temperature as a good indicator of crop water status similar findings have been obtained in the literature garcía tejero et al 2018 romero trigueros et al 2019 conesa et al 2019 under similar environmental conditions than in the present study when the climatic conditions do not differ much among the days of tc measurement it is possible to find good agreements between tc itself and other indicators of plant water status however it is still important to normalize the absolute tc measurements by using references to take into account the environmental conditions ballester et al 2013a b zarco tejada et al 2012 gonzalez dugo et al 2020 the present study showed how the approach followed for normalizing tc values was a determinant factor for a quantitative assement of crop water status over the course of given period of time in fact when comparing airborne acquired cwsi and tc as water status indicators it was observed that cwsi was more accurately related to the crop water status defined by ψs similar results were reported by gonzalez dugo et al 2014 and romero trigueros et al 2019 more specifically gonzalez dugo et al 2014 noted that the better performance of the cwsi was because it considers the evaporative demand as well as the species specific response of water relations to vpd in this sense it is remarkable that the performance of cwsi when predicting plant water status using airborne images was even better than when cwsi was obtained from on the ground measurements this is despite the lower spatial resolution obtained with the airborne imagery as compared with the on the ground camera to the best of our knowledge this is the first study comparing the ability of thermal imagery to detect water stress using on the ground and aerial platforms the main advantage of aerial imagery is based on its ability to measure a large surface area which is important particularly in the case of water status assessment plant water status is in fact highly variable and strongly affected by environmental conditions this implies that a few number of replicates can be measured on the ground this is even more important when large tree to tree variability is observed as in the present study the standard error se for tc between trees from the same treatment ranged from 0 03 to 0 78 k when airborne data was used whereas it ranged from 0 15 to 1 46 k when the on ground approach was used the same pattern was observed for cwsi with se values up to 0 03 and 0 08 for airborne and on ground approaches respectively this lower variability observed between trees from the same treatment when using the aircraft imagery is due to the wider canopy proportion captured when the airborne platform was used as compared to the narrower canopy area recorded with the hand held thermal camera the use of a remote sensing platforms is in fact nowadays widely employed and the present research indeed confirms its robustness when compared with simultaneous measurements on the ground when using only data acquired from the ground tc g provided better ψs estimations than when using cwsig this can be explained because the equation used for determining cwsig from tc g is quite dependent on the leaves used for calculating the index especially those selected as wet and dry references and those on which the ψs measurement was performed in this sense cwsih with the incorporation of ta the lower baseline used in the airborne approach and the re calculation of the upper baseline i e the hybrid approach provided a closer relationship with ψs than using tc g specifically the hybrid approach uses the existing relationship between the temperature of the top and the lateral region of the trees for establishing the link between different methodologies i e uav versus handheld thermal cameras it broadens the applicability of the thresholds used for cwsi calculation to sensors acquiring thermal images at different scales of measurement however special attention should be paid when directly using tc g for calculating cwsi using eq 1 since cwsi overestimations can be obtained if the baselines especially the upper one are not adjusted these overestimates are caused by higher tc values when measured on the ground considering only the sunny side of the tree as opposed to those obtained from airborne measured tc this suggests more stressful conditions than they actually are 5 conclusions this study evaluates the feasibility of on the ground and airborne based thermal indicators for identifying and quantifying the water status of a peach orchard under different irrigation regimes cwsi values obtained from both ground and airborne platforms were able to detect peach water status under different irrigation strategies however whereas cwsi calculated from the aircraft integrated the entire tree crown cwsi derived from sunlit ground tc measurements tended to overestimate crop water stress special attention should be paid when combining on the ground and airborne based thermal data hybrid approach due to the large effects caused by the baselines when computing cwsi using each method in general ψs was better estimated from the aircraft than from ground measurement confirming the robustness of airborne thermal imaging for large scale monitoring despite its generally lower spatial resolution however the use of ground measurements yielded better results than airborne thermal data when comparing against gs and pn suggesting that local effects on leaf gas exchange were better captured perhaps due to the higher spatial resolution of the proximal ground thermal sensors regardless the approach used for deriving tc cwsi provided a better relationship with ψs than using tc allowing for the quantitative assement of water status during the course of time period and the integration of the effect of the climatic conditions on plant water status declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9521,globally the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of fresh water despite the increased efficiency in irrigation remote sensing is a valuable tool to monitor agricultural water use in this study we demonstrate a novel algorithm that computes high resolution 10 m remote sensing based evapotranspiration et data linked exclusively to irrigation i e the incremental evapotranspiration et incr the methodology compares the et of irrigated agricultural pixels to the weighted average et of a subset of natural hydrological similar pixels hsp the hydrological similarity is based upon a set of features derived from dem soil texture reference evapotranspiration and precipitation datasets the difference in et between the subset of hydrological similar natural pixels and the corresponding irrigated agricultural pixel is explanatory for the amount of et related to irrigation et incr these results are then converted to the water use m3 per agricultural field the method is validated for three study areas in south africa spain and australia comparing the monthly and seasonal water use estimates to water meter observations in the hex valley south africa yielded an r2 of 0 751 and 0 780 respectively for the ebro spain and namoi australia study areas the accuracy of the monthly estimates decreased in australia this was a result of the water meters being linked to local reservoirs instead of the direct use of the irrigation systems in total 8 out of the 27 validation fields with monthly data showed a kling gupta efficiency kge larger than 0 5 which highlights that the temporal variability can be captured well by the model generally seasonal estimates showed to be most accurate which makes the product suitable for comparison with seasonal water allocations and could help to monitor overconsumption in water scarce environments keywords irrigation evapotranspiration water use remote sensing hydrological similar pixels etlook 1 introduction water is a scarce resource and its limited availability is recognized as one of the major threats in the coming decades world economic forum 2021 due to climate change agricultural droughts have increased significantly over the last decades ipcc 2021 with agriculture being by far the largest consumer of fresh water the presence and reinforcement of regulations that prevent individual farmers from overconsuming in water scarce environments should be a priority for any water management agency fao 2011 however there is limited control on ground and surface water abstractions worldwide foster et al 2020 and most of the irrigation practices are far from efficient jägermeyr et al 2015 although advances have been made to improve irrigation efficiency koech and langat 2018 some argue that this does not necessarily reduce the consumptive water use in the agricultural sector linstead 2018 perry 2017 having a tool that remotely monitors the water use of irrigated cropland could help enforce local regulations increase environmental water availability gain insight on agricultural water use and prevent conflicts over resources the potential of using satellite data for the agricultural sector is widely acknowledged sishodia et al 2020 although estimating the water use of irrigated cropland based on satellite data is challenging multiple studies have been conducted on this topic some are primarily based on soil moisture brocca et al 2018 dari et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 zappa et al 2021 zaussinger et al 2019 and others focus on evapotranspiration estimates bretreger et al 2020 koch et al 2020 romaguera et al 2012 tazekrit et al 2018 van eekelen et al 2015 for these two approaches different satellite observations are needed surface soil moisture is best monitored with low resolution 10 50 km microwave sensors such as smap smos and ascat peng et al 2021 however zappa et al 2021 demonstrated that an upscaled 500 m sentinel 1 based soil moisture product could be used to estimate irrigation amounts accurately remote sensing based evapotranspiration models often combine thermal infrared and or optical multispectral satellite data with meteorological datasets evapotranspiration models which require thermal infrared data often have a lower spatial resolution 1 10 km koch et al 2020 van eekelen et al 2015 than models that base their estimates on crop coefficients kc and the reference evapotranspiration 10 30 m bretreger et al 2020 tazekrit et al 2018 the mentioned remote sensing based irrigation quantification studies show the potential of using satellite data for water use monitoring nevertheless for modeling the water use of individual fields they generally lack spatial resolution lesiv et al 2019 only the studies of bretreger et al 2020 and tazekrit et al 2018 used evapotranspiration models of sufficient resolution however the accuracy of such crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration based models is often region dependent and the product is therefore less scalable than most other energy balance models blatchford et al 2020 also the estimated kc based evapotranspiration mimics the evapotranspiration under well watered conditions which rarely occur in semi arid climates resulting in an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration jovanovic and israel 2012 thoreson et al 2009 therefore more sophisticated energy balance models would be preferred as input for water use estimated models several remote sensing based energy balance models have been developed in the last decades zhang et al 2016 when estimating the evapotranspiration using energy balance models acquiring land surface temperature lst data is often a limiting factor with only a few platforms providing lst observations with a moderate temporal 16 days and spatial resolution 0 1 1 km zhu et al 2018 etlook the successor of sebal is one of the models that use the penman monteith equation to estimate the actual evapotranspiration the model partitions the energy available for evaporation e and transpiration t based on the leaf area index lai and is easily scalable from field to continental extents in addition the e and t can be calculated separately in data scare environments such as areas with persistent cloud cover because the model uses upscaled lst data in combination with high resolution optical satellite data the resolution of the outputs can be as high as 10 m bastiaanssen et al 2012 this in combination with the daily temporal resolution makes the model suitable as an input for generating water use estimates at field level et data alone however does not differentiate between irrigated and rainfed et this partition was the subject of the research of van eekelen et al 2015 in their study sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 was used to calculate actual evapotranspiration which was then compared to the ratio between the accumulated evapotranspiration e and precipitation p for land classes with similar natural conditions from the e p ratio the evapotranspiration originating from precipitation e p was calculated and subtracted from the actual evapotranspiration to calculate the incremental et the incremental et was then used to estimate the water use although the potential of et based irrigation quantification was presented the researchers also experienced some limitations acquiring high resolution precipitation data for example is challenging in most regions of the world in their study the highest resolution precipitation data had a spatial resolution of 0 1 which compromised the spatial accuracy of the water use estimates another limitation was that the similarity between pixels was purely based on a land use classification which generally had an overall accuracy of 85 finally they concluded that et p is also impacted by differences in soil type temporal rainfall distributions and surface runoff among others which were not taken into account at the time in this study we aim to bypass many of the limitations that van eekelen et al 2015 have experienced so we can estimate the water use at field level using remote sensing data the proposed method uses etlook to calculate high resolution 10 m evapotranspiration estimates and the novel hydrological similar pixels hsp algorithm to partition between irrigated and natural evapotranspiration the latter is done by comparing the evapotranspiration of irrigated areas to that of natural pixels that are most similar in hydrogeomorphological conditions and requires satellite based evapotranspiration data weather observations and static environmental datasets the outcomes are validated for three study areas in south africa spain and australia using in situ water meter observations 2 materials and methods 2 1 water balance the objective of hydrological dilemmas is often the same to close the water balance the water balance is described in eq 1 where p represents the precipitation r the streamflow et the evapotranspiration and s the change in storage either in the soil bedrock or groundwater 1 p r et s in stable systems s is considered 0 so the equation solely relies on the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow however in many regions the streamflow is unknown precipitation data unreliable and the change in storage is not neglectable resulting in difficulties when trying to close this equation the approach of this research is to use et data to quantify irrigation water use and mimic conditions where all the other terms of the water balance can be neglected this is done by comparing the et of irrigated crops to the et of non irrigated natural vegetation the assumption here is that for areas with similar hydrogeomorphological conditions the difference in et is solely a result of irrigation efforts eq 2 this difference in et between natural e t nat and irrigated vegetation e t irr is called incremental evapotranspiration e t incr 2 e t incr e t irr e t nat 2 2 irrigation quantification method the proposed irrigation quantification method is divided into three parts i e data collection and pre processing algorithm processing and irrigation quantification which are described in fig 1 the inputs are either of periodic or static nature periodic inputs originate from weather stations and satellites while static inputs come from digital elevation model dem soil texture and land cover classification datasets based on these inputs two core algorithms are used etlook developed by bastiaanssen et al 2012 is responsible for producing actual et act and reference evapotranspiration et ref data which together with precipitation data and the static datasets are fed into the hydrological similar pixels hsp algorithm the etlook model estimates the key hydro meteorological parameters of the penman monteith equation empirically based on minimal field and remote sensing data without the need for numerical simulation methods this approach leads to adequate quantification of the evapotranspiration blatchford et al 2020 analogous to the study of van eekelen et al 2015 the base of the hsp algorithm is a high resolution land cover map that distinguished irrigated agriculture from natural vegetation the hsp algorithm aims to identify for each irrigated agricultural pixel a subset of natural pixels that are similar to the irrigated agricultural pixel in terms of precipitation reference evapotranspiration topography and soil texture the addition of these static and periodic datasets is an improvement upon the approach of van eekelen et al 2015 where only evapotranspiration data precipitation data and a land cover map were used to calculate the irrigated water use the output of the hsp algorithm is the incremental evapotranspiration et incr which describes the amount of water that is evaporated purely due to irrigation this value is finally converted to the water use m3 based on the surface area of a specific field or cluster of fields 2 2 1 data collection and processing the multispectral data used for this research is captured by the multispectral imager msi and oli operational land imager sensors carried by the satellites sentinel 2a and 2b esa 2012 and landsat 8 u s geological survey 2015 respectively the first sensor provides 10 m spatial resolution data every 5 days while the latter has a 30 m resolution and 16 days overpass

reflectances were employed to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the albedo which are inputs for the etlook model as thermal data the brightness temperature from visible infrared imager and radiometer suite viirs onboard of suomi npp roger et al 2017 was employed for this wavelength the images have a 375 m resolution and are provided daily to estimate the weekly land surface temperature lst the least clouded image per week was used to better capture the variability within the images a lookup table between high and low resolution albedo and ndvi was built and extrapolated to upscale the lst data the meteorological information required for the processing comes from the most recent validated atmospheric general circulation model from the earth model and data assimilation system goddard earth observing system geos of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa rienecker et al 2008 when available data from local meteorological stations was also collected that was the case for some meteorological variables in australia which were available via the bureau of meteorology www bom gov au and the weather services of hortec www hortec co za for the western cape south africa the transmissivity was computed from the incoming shortwave radiation products distributed by the geostationary satellites msg esa 1999 and himawari japan meteorological agency 2015 temperature and humidity variables from geos were disaggregated according to rouf et al 2020 while station data was spatially interpolated following the work of hengl 2007 the static inputs dictate most of the similarity between natural and irrigated pixels to be able to exploit the algorithm on a global level only globally available datasets were considered an overview of them is given in fig 2 the first set of static features used in the hsp algorithm are features derived from a digital elevation model dem since it is acknowledged that topography in general can be an excellent indicator for hydrogeomorphological differences noh et al 2015 the dem used for this research is provided by the shuttle radar topography mission strm dataset which covers 80 of the world s landmass at 30 m resolution hennig et al 2007 the dem based static features are the slope aspect and topographic wetness index twi the aspect is converted from a 360 to a north south 180 orientation since the east and west orientation does not usually explain the difference in available solar radiation the twi is often used as an index to account for differences in hydrological processes due to topography sørensen et al 2006 and was first derived by beven and kirkby 1979 the twi is calculated using the saga gis flow accumulation module conrad et al 2015 the twi typically ranges between 3 and 30 with low values indicating dry and high values indicating wet conditions the second set of static features is related to the soil type the soil type is chosen due to its effect on the storage of nutrients infiltration capacity rooting depth capillary rise field capacity and wilting point to name a few moene and dam 2014 the isric soilgrids database provides global ph bulk density coarse fragments content sand content silt content clay content cation exchange capacity cec total nitrogen as well as soil organic carbon density content and stock at 250 m resolution hengl et al 2017 for this research the clay silt and sand content were considered the choice of the land cover map depends on the study area but generally the highest resolution and the most up to date public datasets are chosen the minimum requirements for a land cover map are the spatial resolution 30 m and the presence of the classes i rain fed and ii irrigated agriculture iii built up areas iv open water bodies v natural and vi forest areas for the hsp algorithm the forest areas should not be included as comparable natural areas trees are generally more resilient to drought and have better access to water than crops as a result they tend to show higher evapotranspiration rates than crops during water stressed conditions causing underestimated or even negative et incr values for south africa we used the south african national land cover sanlc 2018 dataset thompson 2019 for spain the sistema de información sobre ocupación del suelo de españa siose dataset siose 2018 and for australia the new south wales landuse 2017 v1 2 dataset dpie 2020 2 2 2 algorithm processing the etlook algorithm requires besides meteorological data satellite data on ndvi surface albedo and soil moisture the soil moisture is derived using land surface temperature lst and ndvi data according to the methodology described by yang et al 2015 which uses a trapezoid approach on a pixel by pixel basis a thorough validation of the etlook algorithm for multiple use cases field level regional level and continental level is done by blatchford et al 2020 the hsp model aims to find for each irrigated agricultural pixel a subset of hydrological similar natural pixels this similarity is expressed as the difference per static input between the natural and agricultural pixels compared to its standard deviation over the entire study area eq 3 for example in a mountainous area the standard deviation of the slope is high so pixels are considered to be similar earlier compared to pixels in a flat area this choice is made to enable flexibility in the definition of similar pixels but also to make sure that in every environment similar pixels can be found the similarity score of every static input is then averaged to compute the general similarity eq 4 3 s feat 1 a b s i r r f e a t n a t f e a t σ feat 4 s s slope s aspect s twi s clay s silt s sand n feat here s feat represents the score per static feature namely slope aspect twi clay silt and sand contents ir r feat is the feature value of the irrigated pixel na t feat the value of the natural pixel σ feat the standard deviation calculated for the entire scene s the overall score of all static inputs a natural pixel is considered similar if the score is larger than the threshold thr parameter which is expressed as 5 thr t h r std 1 in which th r std expresses the number of standard deviations the score is allowed to deviate from to be considered similar if this similarity is above a predefined threshold the natural pixel will be added to the subset of similar pixels eq 6 6 similar s t h r f a l s e s t h r t r u e not all static inputs are prepared in the same manner before calculating the similarity the aspect is only an important feature when there is a significant slope as in relatively flat regions the difference in solar radiation caused by the aspect is negligible therefore for irrigated agricultural pixels with a slope smaller than 2 the aspect is considered not of interest this is reflected by indicating the allowed aspect error to be 180 meaning that even if the aspect difference between the natural and irrigated pixels is 180 the aspect of those pixels is still considered similar for irrigated agricultural pixels with a slope larger than 2 an exponential function is used to decrease the allowed aspect error when the slope increases both scenarios are described by eqs 7 and 8 7 e aspect ir r slope 2 180 i r r s l o p e 2 180 e 0 115 i r r s l o p e 2 8 s aspect 1 a b s i r r a s p e c t n a t a s p e c t

on the water holding capacity of the soil which depends on the field capacity permanent wilting point and rooting depth mohamed and ali 2006 since the rooting depth is unknown this parameter has a constant value and is expressed as a ratio of the rooting depth of natural vegetation compared to that of crops generally for irrigated crops this value is set to 1 and for natural crops this value is set to 1 5 meaning that natural vegetation root 1 5 times deeper than crops mainly due to natural vegetation being better suited for dry conditions these values are chosen after calibration of the hsp algorithm using in situ water meter observations effectively the taw scales the et act of natural vegetation to be more comparable to the et act of irrigated agricultural vegetation for the calculation of the taw pedotransfer functions derived by mohamed and ali 2006 are used which calculate the field capacity q fc and permanent wilting point q pwp using sand silt and clay fractions coupled with the rooting depth z root the taw is calculated according to eq 9 9 taw 1000 q fc q pwp z root the taw is calculated for both the irrigated agricultural and the natural pixels that meet the similarity criteria by dividing the taw of the natural pixel ta w nat with the taw of the irrigated agricultural pixel ta w irr the ta w ratio is calculated this ratio is used to scale the et act of the natural pixels to match the et act of the irrigated agricultural pixel as shown in eqs 10 and 11 10 ta w ratio t a w n a t t a w i r r 11 e t ac t nat adj e t ac t nat ta w ratio as an additional criterion for natural pixels to be considered similar to the irrigated agricultural pixel the scores of the reference evapotranspiration et ref and precipitation p are calculated these are calculated in the same way as expressed in eq 3 the score of the et ref and p are then combined to a single feature by calculating the mean score of the two this step is done separately from the static input because pixels might be completely similar in a geomorphological manner but experience different conditions due to local rainfall events or increased evapotranspiration due to differences in solar radiation once the combined score of et ref and p is above 0 meaning that the difference between the et ref and p of the natural pixel is smaller than the averaged standard deviation of the two a natural pixel is finally considered hydrologically similar to its irrigated agricultural counterpart for each irrigated agricultural pixel the algorithm loops over all the natural pixels in a spiral manner starting close to the irrigated pixel the thr nsimpix max parameter tells the algorithm how many similar natural pixels have to be found per irrigated pixel once this number is met or all the natural pixels are handled the algorithm stops looking for natural pixels and continues to the next irrigated pixel because this process is computationally expensive the raster data is processed per block and the numba library lam et al 2015 is used to drastically increase the processing speed to decrease the runtime even further before running the hsp algorithm per irrigated agricultural pixel the distance to the closest natural pixels is calculated and stored in a raster this enables the hsp algorithm to start searching for similar natural pixels at the minimum known distance to a natural pixel for each irrigated agricultural pixel once the hsp algorithm is done looping over all the natural pixels the stored scores and distances are normalized so they range between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating perfect similarity and 0 indicating the lowest allowed similarity this normalization is for the static scores based on the thr parameter and for the distances based on the maximum distance the non et ref and p scores are normalized based on the minimum and maximum scores found for those inputs per study period normalizing these scores enables one to generate a total score for each natural pixel which is used as a weight to calculate a weighted et act for all the natural pixels this weighted et act favors natural pixels with high total scores over natural pixels with lower scores the weighted natural et act is then subtracted from the et act of the irrigated agricultural pixel which yields the incremental evapotranspiration et incr these steps are explained in eqs 12 15 12 s per norm s per s per min s per max s per min s stat norm s stat thr 1 thr s dist norm s dist s dist min s dist max s dist min 13 w s per norm s stat norm s dist norm 3 14 e

static inputs slope aspect twi and sand silt and clay content and s dist the score of the distance which are all expressed as an array based on the subset of most similar natural pixels the weight w is calculated for the normalized s per s stat and s dist and used to calculate the weighted et act for all the natural pixels in the subset the incremental evapotranspiration e t incr is then calculated by subtracting e t ac t nat weighted from the et act of the irrigated pixel e t act irr at this point the algorithm is ready to loop over the next irrigated agricultural pixel 2 2 3 irrigation quantification the et incr is expressed in mm similar to the et act to convert this unit to volumes the et incr is multiplied by the area of the agricultural field a prerequisite for calculating the water use is that per operational unit either being fields a cluster of fields or catchments the perimeter of these operational units is known however at field level those shapes are often not only showing agricultural fields but instead are linked cadastral units including roads houses reservoirs and other non agricultural areas to increase the accuracy of the water use estimates the same land cover map that is used to distinguish natural and irrigated agricultural pixels is used to calculate the area of irrigated agriculture a irr within each operational unit this area m2 is then used to convert the e t incr mm to the water use q in m3 this process is explained by eq 16 16 q e t incr a irr 1000 2 3 statistical analysis to assess the accuracy of the estimated water use multiple statistical metrics were obtained to assess the goodness of fit between the observed and estimated water use the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean squared error rmse were calculated the rmse is chosen as an additional metric since it is expressed in the same unit as the modeled outputs and has a strong foundation in model evaluation studies chai and draxler 2014 the r2 and rmse were calculated using the scikit learn sklearn package pedregosa et al 2011 additionally a significance analysis for all the calculated coefficients of determination was performed using the statsmodels package seabold and perktold 2010 to prove the significance of the calculated r2 values the corresponding p values should be larger than α which was set to 0 05 finally the deviation between the seasonal observations and estimates d i was calculated this metric which is expressed in percentages shows per individual field the accuracy of the product except for the deviation all the statistical metrics were calculated both on a monthly and seasonal timestep we also introduce a different metric to show the temporal accuracy of the monthly estimates i e the kling gupta efficiency kge the kge combines the correlation coefficient r the variability error a and the bias error b which makes it an ideal metric for time series accuracy assessment gupta et al 2009 the kge ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit for the well established nash sutcliffe efficiency nse a hydrological model is considered to have a reasonable performance when the nse is higher than 0 with nse 0 indicating that the mean of the predictions is similar to the mean of the observations for the kge when using the same criteria the threshold between a poorly performing and reasonable model lies at a kge of 0 4 knoben et al 2019 2 4 study areas currently the proposed irrigation quantification method is implemented in the operational water auditing application and used in south africa by several catchment management authorities cma s esa 2021 however this operational product delivers medium resolution 250 m data and is mostly used for monitoring large scale systems the first study area where a high resolution 10 m version of the product was applied is the hex valley a highly productive region in the western cape south africa to test the accuracy of the application outside south africa two additional validation sites were chosen i e the ebro basin in catalonia spain and the namoi river catchment in new south wales australia fig 3 2 4 1 hex valley western cape south africa the hex river valley is located in the breede river catchment in the western cape province the valley is a relatively narrow valley with a length of 25 km and a maximum width of 4 km bounded by high mountain ranges

the warmest month is february at 23 9 c and the coldest month is july at 9 9 c the annual precipitation is 240 mm with february being the driest 10 mm and june the wettest 30 mm muñoz sabater 2019 the agricultural activities in the hex river valley are centered around the commercial cultivation of table grapes which are grown on 5 200 ha of land the source of irrigation is either originating from surface water 40 or groundwater 60 ncube 2018 in total for 15 fields seasonal water meter observations were provided by the hex valley water users association covering september 2018 until may 2019 for 12 out of the 15 fields weekly data was also made available and converted to a monthly interval 2 4 2 ebro basin catalonia spain the ebro river basin is the largest mediterranean basin of the iberian peninsula the river has the highest natural mean discharge in spain the catchment is enclosed by the cantabrian range and the pyrenees on the north and by the iberian mountains on the south an extensive irrigation network was built to store and transport pyrenean water to the plains to sustain the irrigated area that covers around 45 of the basin milano et al 2013 the study area is located in the eastern part of the ebro catchment surrounding the town lleida focusing around the urgell and algerri balaguer canals and is roughly 9 000 km2 in size fig 3 the climate is a humid subtropical climate cfa the mean maximum summer and winter temperatures are 23 0 c and 3 5 c respectively the average annual precipitation is 680 mm with the lowest monthly precipitation in february 30 mm and the highest in september 80 mm muñoz sabater 2019 dominant crop types in the area are wheat corn and alfalfa perennial crops are mainly fruit trees olive trees and vineyards irrigation is applied either using inundation drip or sprinkler systems gao et al 2018 daily water meter data was made available by the institute of agrifood research and technology irta from april until september 2020 for an apple orchard and two vineyards 2 4 3 namoi river new south wales australia the namoi catchment is part of the murray darling basin and is completely situated in new south wales australia the catchment is 43 000 km2 and the average discharge of the river at the outlet is 25 m3 s arshad et al 2014 barma water resources et al 2012 the study area of this research as shown in fig 3 is located between the towns of narrabri in the northwest and boggabri in the southeast agriculture is mainly practiced next to the river the area also includes some nature reserves in the southeast of the study area the boggabri coal mine is situated it abstracts approximately 270 000 m3 of groundwater per year herron et al 2018 farmers are mostly reliant on groundwater but surface water is also extracted through permits in times of high discharges surface water can also be accessed without registration which is called supplementary water arshad et al 2014 barma water resources et al 2012 the climate in the area is a humid subtropical climate cfa the mean maximum summer and winter temperatures are 33 8 c and 18 0 c respectively the average annual precipitation sum is 650 mm with precipitation amounts peaking in summer 80 mm month and being lowest in winter 40 mm month bureau of meteorology 2021 furrow irrigation is the main type of irrigation in the area and the furrows are fed with water that is stored in local reservoirs the water meter observation data was provided by water technology www watertech com au and was based on cadastral data lots from the nsw land registry service lrs and spreadsheets provided by the department of planning and environment dpe the dataset consists of 69 clusters and each cluster consists of multiple agricultural fields however from the 69 available clusters not all clusters contained areas that were classified as irrigated agriculture and thus for those clusters no water use estimates were generated effectively 12 of the 69 clusters contained both water meter observations and water use estimations and these clusters were the focus of the validation study the study period started in july 2017 and ended in june 2018 3 results to validate the results of the water auditing application we compared our water use estimates to the water meter observations of the three study areas for all the study areas both the monthly and the seasonal accumulated water use estimates were included in the comparison to anonymise the water meter data the field identifiers are altered to a generic format that starts with the area code i e hex ebr or nam followed by a number 3 1 hex valley western cape south africa fig 4 shows the accumulated water use estimations for the 2018 2019 season the et incr ranged from 200 to 1000 mm although the main crop type in the area is table grapes there were quite some local differences in the estimated water use even within each field unit the estimated water use ranges significantly indicating the importance of having a high resolution product when dealing with relatively small fields fig 5 shows the correlation between the monthly and seasonal water use estimates compared to the observed water use for both the monthly and seasonal products there was a strong correlation between the observed and estimated water use with an r2 of 0 751 and 0 780 respectively both coefficients of determination showed to be significant p 0 05 moreover the trendline was close to the 1 1 line indicating that there is no general over or underestimation the correlation for the monthly estimates was lower compared to the seasonal product which could indicate that the timing of the water use estimates is not always correct for the seasonal product 6 of the 15 fields showed a deviation lower than 20 the error was generally larger for fields with lower observed water use compared to the one for large consumers 3 2 ebro basin catalonia spain for the ebro region the seasonal accumulated et incr estimates ranged between 0 and 800 mm fig 6 while the maximum averaged monthly assessment was about 130 mm month the monthly value is analogous to the one of the hex valley 110 mm month this illustrates that for equivalent regions in terms of climate comparable evapotranspiration amounts linked to irrigation can be expected despite the size of the study area only three water meter observations were available for this research fig 7 shows that for these three plots the monthly water use estimates were inaccurate the corresponding r2 and p value were 0 051 and 3 68e 05 respectively because of the limited amount of validation data the seasonal results were not statistically significant p 0 084 the seasonal product showed that the water use of ebr 3 was accurately estimated 0 5 deviation the water use of ebr 2 was moderately overestimated 23 3 deviation and the water use of ebr 1 was highly underestimated 53 9 deviation both ebr 2 and ebr 3 are vineyards and their errors are in the same range as the vineyards of the hex valley fig 6 ebr 1 on the other hand is an apple orchard which might be explanatory for the large deviation for this study area the timing issues for the monthly water use estimates were also visible similar to the results for the hex valley 3 3 namoi river new south wales australia for the namoi area the maximum estimated incremental evapotranspiration was 600 mm over the entire season which translated to an average maximum of 50 mm month fig 8 this amount is significantly lower compared to the ebro and hex valley regions this disparity could be linked to the differences in crop types with perennial crops being abundant in the ebro and hex valley regions while in namoi annual crops are dominant in fig 9 similar to the other validation areas the large spatial variability between fields was also visible for these 12 clusters resembling the findings in the ebro basin the monthly estimates did generally not correspond accurately with the water meter observations fig 9 with an r2 of 0 151 the quality of the estimates was higher compared to the ebro basin but much lower compared to the hex valley also the trend line shows that generally the water use is underestimated for this region especially for low water use observations the deviations are large however the seasonal product shows that despite the low monthly accuracy the accumulated water use corresponds better with the observations r2 of 0 406 both coefficients of determination were statistically significant p 0 05 3 4 study area comparisons tables 1 2 and 3 show the general statistics of the monthly and seasonal water use estimates per field cluster of the hex valley ebro and namoi study areas respectively within each table the last row shows the mean of the estimated and observed water use per study area for the hex valley the mean difference between the estimated and observed water use was 4 5 indicating that on a spatiotemporal scale the model is performing well for the ebro and namoi study areas this difference was 13 8 and 21 9 respectively indicating a lower agreement with regional seasonal water use observations for both study areas the water use is generally underestimated the mean deviation d i for the hex valley and ebro study areas was comparable with 26 4 and 26 9 respectively for the namoi study area the mean deviation was larger with 47 8 when combining the water use estimates and observations of all the three study areas the water use was underestimated by 18 8 for 2 out of the 30 fields the kge is below 0 4 the kge value for nam 5 is 0 585 while the one for nam 12 is 0 560 in total there are 6 fields with a negative kge and 8 with a kge above 0 5 for the hex valley and the ebro study areas the mean kge is 0 385 and 0 405 respectively indicating that the temporal water use patterns were reasonably well modeled in contrast the mean kge of the namoi area was only 0 092 furthermore 5 of the 6 negative kge values originate from this study area this shows that the temporal water use pattern in namoi is not captured as well as for the other two study areas 3 5 temporal water use patterns our results show that based on the kge the temporal water use patterns were not always accurately modeled this is especially so for the namoi area table 3 fig 10 demonstrates three different behaviors when comparing the estimated to the observed water uses in the namoi area it can be observed in the figure that for clusters that behave like nam 7 the volumes are not correctly modeled d i 76 0 for the ones that act similarly as nam 3 the cumulative water use is accurately estimated d i 8 7 but the timing is off lastly the results of a few clusters like nam 11 show that the model is accurate in both the timing and cumulative amounts kge 0 829 d i 2 6 although the main irrigation type in the area is furrow irrigation which is assumed to be modeled less accurately the temporal pattern should not have been affected only the absolute estimated volumes applied to the field the most likely cause for the general low kge values is the location of the water meter itself in arid climates often reservoirs are constructed to store water for drier seasons biemans et al 2011 which is also the case for the namoi catchment pittock 2016 in this area the aim of installing the water meters is to control if a farmer withdraws the legal amount of ground or surface water not to inform how much water is directly applied to the crops barma water resources et al 2012 therefore there is a delay between the filling of the reservoir and the actual crop water consumption water is mostly pumped into the reservoirs during the winter while irrigation is mostly applied during summer fuentes et al 2021 this effect can be illustrated when comparing nam 7 and nam 11 the fields with the largest and smallest deviation in estimated and observed water use respectively fig 11 shows the change in water surface area of the reservoirs connected to nam 7 and nam 11 which is derived from sentinel 2 level 1 c observations using the normalised difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 ndwi pixels with a value larger than 0 are classified as water there is a clear distinction between both clusters with nam 11 showing a relatively constant surface water area from winter till summer while for nam 7 the surface water area drops from 18 ha to less than 5 ha at the start of the season in november the reservoir of nam 7 was rapidly filled and finally emptied with only 3 ha remaining at the beginning of july 2018 the reservoir of nam 11 starts depleting in march 2018 and finally has a water surface area of 9 ha due to the analysis being done on sentinel 2 level 1 c images atmospheric interference could have some effects on the surface water area observations but the main differences between the two clusters are clear based on figs 10 and 11 one could argue that more water is displaced throughout the season for nam 7 compared to nam 11 it is also evident that the reservoir of nam 7 has been emptied and filled during the growing season while the reservoir of nam 11 remained more constant for nam 7 water is mostly displaced to fill the reservoir not to directly irrigate the crops for nam 11 the pattern of the water surface area does not correlate well with the water meter observations meaning that the water that is pumped into the reservoir is more directly used for irrigation excluding nam 7 from the analysis shown in fig 9 would yield a seasonal r2 of 0 793 instead of 0 406 4 discussion in this research we demonstrate the potential of the hsp algorithm to distinguish between the et of natural and irrigated crops in addition we illustrate the capability of this model to calculate water use on a field level using high resolution 10 m satellite data however the results also show limitations on the estimation of irrigation water use for some fields the estimates on monthly and on seasonal scales are not accurate in this section we provide a discussion on the used methods and their impact on the accuracy of the water use estimates we also present a critical note on comparing in situ observations with satellite based models 4 1 model limitations as with all types of modeling compromises need to be made between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy since etlook and the hsp algorithm are computationally expensive multiple simplifications that might affect the quality of the final product have been applied 4 1 1 evapotranspiration modeling for all the study areas the etlook algorithm was run to produce daily evapotranspiration estimates these were converted to monthly and seasonal values to compare with equivalent water use estimates since etlook calculates e and t based on a modified penman monteith equation it shares the same limitations the main one is the fact that the stomatal resistance and soil resistance are hard to quantify regarding the stomatal resistance there is a dependence on land use each class is assigned a defined value for the canopy resistance so the quality of the transpiration estimate is dependent on the quality of the land use classification in its turn the soil resistance is a function of the topsoil moisture content so any uncertainty in the topsoil moisture estimations is propagated to the calculation of the evaporation subedi and chávez 2015 while some input data for etlook is available daily meteorological inputs others are less frequent ndvi albedo and land surface temperature and subject to cloud cover in cloudless conditions we can predict that every pixel would be seen by either sentinel 2 or landsat 8 about 90 times per year however that is hardly the case the impact of this on the hsp results is hard to predict for the irrigated pixels on the one hand it is expected that the variation of optical inputs is well captured as farmers would irrigate more during drier cloudless conditions for the natural rain fed vegetation on the other hand important phenological information might be missed during the cloudy periods in addition the source of the daily meteorological data interferes with the accuracy of both etlook and hsp algorithms for one study area the ebro basin the data came exclusively from climate models in the other two regions modeled data was only employed when locally measured data was not available 4 1 2 definition of hydrological similarity currently the similarity is based on the slope aspect twi clay content silt content and sand content however these inputs are all considered of equal importance when calculating the similarity one could argue that some of these inputs are more important than others for explaining the hydrogeomorphological differences between pixels future studies should include decisions on the weight of each static input when calculating the similarity score furthermore additional soil characteristics from the soilgrids database could be included hengl et al 2017 however due to the limited search radius of the algorithm a few kilometers it is not expected that these characteristics will show a significant difference without showing a significant change in sand silt and clay content besides the current static inputs additional periodic datasets could be obtained to assess the hydrological similarity examples of such datasets could be soil moisture estimates massari et al 2021 and rooting depth models de wit et al 2019 soil moisture datasets give insight into the spatiotemporal variability of the water availability where the currently used twi only shows the spatial distribution based on topography rooting depth models can be implemented to more accurately calculate the total available water taw parameter 4 1 3 availability of natural pixels the hsp algorithm depends on the availability of natural pixels however some agricultural schemes might be so extensive that it is difficult to find a suitable subset of natural pixels this is evident for the ebro study area as shown in fig 12 the study area in the ebro basin is effectively one entire irrigation scheme with limited natural areas while the hex valley is fully surrounded by natural pixels for the hex valley the maximum average distance to the subset of natural pixels is about 1 km while for the ebro study area this value can go up to 3 km for some pixels this increase in distance induces uncertainties when comparing the et of native vegetation and irrigated agriculture as it might violate the concept that all the other terms in the water balance eq 1 must be similar thus for areas like the ebro basin alternative approaches should be considered in addition as mentioned by van eekelen et al 2015 all land cover classification maps have their inaccuracies which will affect the water use estimates if for example a built up area is classified as natural vegetation the incremental et and the water use will be overestimated to decrease the impact of falsely classified natural areas the size of the subset of similar pixels can be increased however this impacts the computational efficiency and increases the mean distance of the subset affecting its hydrological similarity a second option is to exclude natural pixels which do not show any vegetation development throughout the season for example by excluding pixels with a maximum seasonal ndvi of 0 3 another solution could be to compare non irrigated agricultural pixels to irrigated ones that would solve the issue of having limited access to natural pixels on the other hand current land cover maps are not reliable enough to assume that non irrigated plots are indeed not irrigated such maps are usually not updated every year furthermore annual crops often rotate every season resulting in changing irrigation practices it raises the need for an annually or seasonally updated irrigated area map which will be the focus of future studies having an up to date and accurate irrigated area map would also improve the accuracy of the water use estimates because the et incr is only calculated for areas that are classified as irrigated agriculture if the current land cover maps underestimate the irrigated area the water use is also underestimated 4 2 validity of comparison with water meters besides the known limitations of the models directly comparing satellite observations with in situ measurements is always challenging loew et al 2017 a water meter is not a standardized instrument and each system has its inaccuracies boman and shukla 2009 dobriyal et al 2017 su et al 2021 hightech agricultural systems might be equipped with fully automated and efficient irrigation equipment which accurately measure the water use nevertheless most schemes are inefficient and depend on manual labor furrow irrigation is among the least efficient irrigation types with an overall efficiency of 45 whereas for drip irrigation considered the most efficient type the overall efficiency rises to 90 savva and frenken 2002 an added challenge is that while water meters account for all the water applied to the field only the irrigated water consumed by the crop is observed in our satellite based measurements intermediate losses such as open water evaporation percolation runoff and leakages are not monitored thus in its current form satellite based water use estimates should be more comparable to drip irrigation systems and less related to poorly performing irrigation types such as furrow or sprinkler irrigation it is also known that water meters are not always installed to monitor the water that is directly applied to the field but rather to observe how much water is taken from the environment and stored in reservoirs fuentes et al 2021 fig 11 illustrates that this is presumably the reason for the mismatch in the temporal patterns of the estimated and observed water use table 3 it also shows that for a reservoir that fluctuates a lot in the amount of water stored nam 7 the seasonal accuracy of the satellite based water use estimates decreased significantly it is therefore crucial that when comparing water meter data to remote sensing based water use estimates the water meter is directly coupled to the irrigation system instead of being connected to an intermediate reservoir 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that depending on the study area it is possible to accurately estimate the monthly and seasonal water use of irrigated agriculture using high resolution 10 m remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimates and the newly introduced hsp algorithm the hex valley south africa study area yielded the best results with a seasonal r2 of 0 780 for the ebro spain study area limited validation data was available but in general the results were less accurate than for the hex valley the limited amount of natural pixels in the ebro study area fig 12 also made the execution of the hsp algorithm more challenging the results of the namoi australia study area were accurate at seasonal scale r2 0 793 excluding nam 7 but showed timing issues on a monthly basis due to the water meters being connected to large reservoirs instead of being directly connected to the irrigation systems a use case of the proposed method which we already implemented in some south african catchment management agencies is to compare our water use estimates with predefined water allocations this enables local water authorities to identify big water consumers and to enforce local withdrawal laws in times of drought further research will implement an annual irrigated area map to improve the accuracy of the model and the hsp algorithm will subsequently be tested while comparing irrigated to non irrigated crops for areas that have limited availability of natural pixels funding this work was supported by the european commission s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme

9521,globally the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of fresh water despite the increased efficiency in irrigation remote sensing is a valuable tool to monitor agricultural water use in this study we demonstrate a novel algorithm that computes high resolution 10 m remote sensing based evapotranspiration et data linked exclusively to irrigation i e the incremental evapotranspiration et incr the methodology compares the et of irrigated agricultural pixels to the weighted average et of a subset of natural hydrological similar pixels hsp the hydrological similarity is based upon a set

three study areas in south africa spain and australia comparing the monthly and seasonal water use estimates to water meter observations in the hex valley south africa yielded an r2 of 0 751 and 0 780 respectively for the ebro spain and namoi australia study areas the accuracy of the monthly estimates decreased in australia this was a result of the water meters being linked to local reservoirs instead of the direct use of the irrigation systems in total 8 out of the 27 validation fields with monthly data showed a kling gupta efficiency kge larger than 0 5 which highlights that the temporal variability can be captured well by the model generally seasonal estimates showed to be most accurate which makes the product suitable for comparison with seasonal water allocations and could help to monitor overconsumption in water scarce environments keywords irrigation evapotranspiration water use remote sensing hydrological similar pixels etlook 1 introduction water is a scarce resource and its limited availability is recognized as one of the major threats in the coming decades world economic forum 2021 due to climate change agricultural droughts have increased significantly over the last decades ipcc 2021 with agriculture being by far the largest consumer of fresh water the presence and reinforcement of regulations that prevent individual farmers from overconsuming in water scarce environments should be a priority for any water management agency fao 2011 however there is limited control on ground and surface water abstractions worldwide foster et al 2020 and most of the irrigation practices are far from efficient jägermeyr et al 2015 although advances have been made to improve irrigation efficiency koech and langat 2018 some argue that this does not necessarily reduce the consumptive water use in the agricultural sector linstead 2018 perry 2017 having a tool that remotely monitors the water use of irrigated cropland could help enforce local regulations increase environmental water availability gain insight on agricultural water use and prevent conflicts over resources the potential of using satellite data for the agricultural sector is widely

used evapotranspiration models of sufficient resolution however the accuracy of such crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration based models is often region dependent and the product is therefore less scalable than most other energy balance models blatchford et al 2020 also the estimated kc based evapotranspiration mimics the evapotranspiration under well watered conditions which rarely occur in semi arid climates resulting in an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration jovanovic and israel 2012 thoreson et al 2009 therefore more sophisticated energy balance models would be preferred as input for water use estimated models several remote sensing based energy balance models have been developed in the last decades zhang et al 2016 when estimating the evapotranspiration using energy balance models acquiring land surface temperature lst data is often a limiting factor with only a few platforms providing lst observations with a moderate temporal 16 days and spatial resolution 0 1 1 km zhu et al 2018 etlook the successor of sebal is one of the models that use the penman monteith equation to estimate the actual evapotranspiration the model partitions the energy available for evaporation e and transpiration t based on the leaf area index lai and is easily scalable from field to continental extents in addition the e and t can be calculated separately in data scare environments such as areas with persistent cloud cover because the model uses upscaled lst data in combination with high resolution optical satellite data the resolution of the outputs can be as high as 10 m bastiaanssen et al 2012 this in combination with the daily temporal resolution makes the model suitable as an input for generating water use estimates at field level et data alone however does not differentiate between irrigated and rainfed et this partition was the subject of the research of van eekelen et al 2015 in their study sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 was used to calculate actual evapotranspiration which was then compared to the ratio between the accumulated evapotranspiration e and precipitation p for land classes with similar natural conditions from the e p ratio the evapotranspiration originating from precipitation e p was calculated and subtracted from the actual evapotranspiration to calculate the incremental et the incremental et was then used to estimate the water use although the potential of et based irrigation quantification was presented the researchers also experienced some limitations acquiring high resolution precipitation data for example is challenging in most regions of the world in their study the highest resolution precipitation data had a spatial resolution of 0 1 which compromised the spatial accuracy of the water use estimates another limitation was that the similarity between pixels was purely based on a land use classification which generally had an overall accuracy of 85 finally they concluded that et p is also impacted by differences in soil type temporal rainfall distributions and surface runoff among others which were not taken into account at the time in this study we aim to bypass many of the limitations that van eekelen et al 2015 have experienced so we can estimate the water use at field level using remote sensing data the proposed method uses etlook to calculate high resolution 10 m evapotranspiration estimates and the novel hydrological similar pixels hsp algorithm to partition between irrigated and natural evapotranspiration the latter is done by comparing the evapotranspiration of irrigated areas to that of natural pixels that are most similar in hydrogeomorphological conditions and requires satellite based evapotranspiration data weather observations and static environmental datasets the outcomes are validated for three study areas in south africa spain and australia using in situ water meter observations 2 materials and methods 2 1 water balance the objective of hydrological dilemmas is often the same to close the water balance the water balance is described in eq 1 where p represents the precipitation r the streamflow et the evapotranspiration and s the change in storage either in the soil bedrock or groundwater 1 p r et s in stable systems s is considered 0 so the equation solely relies on the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow however in many regions the streamflow is unknown precipitation data unreliable and the change in storage is not neglectable resulting in difficulties when trying to close this equation the approach of this research is to use et data to quantify irrigation water use and mimic conditions where all the other terms of the water balance can be neglected this is done by comparing the et of irrigated crops to the et of non irrigated natural vegetation the assumption here is that for areas with similar hydrogeomorphological conditions the difference in et is solely a result of irrigation efforts eq 2 this difference in et between natural e t nat and irrigated vegetation e t irr is called incremental evapotranspiration e t incr 2 e t incr e t irr e t nat 2 2 irrigation quantification method the proposed irrigation quantification method is divided into three parts i e data collection and pre processing algorithm processing and irrigation quantification which are described in fig 1 the inputs are either of periodic or static nature periodic inputs originate from weather stations and satellites while static inputs come from digital elevation model dem soil texture and land cover classification datasets based on these inputs two core algorithms are used etlook developed by bastiaanssen et al 2012 is responsible for producing actual et act and reference evapotranspiration et ref data which together with precipitation data and the static datasets are fed into the hydrological similar pixels hsp algorithm the etlook model estimates the key hydro meteorological parameters of the penman monteith equation empirically based on minimal field and remote sensing data without the need for numerical simulation methods this approach leads to adequate quantification of the evapotranspiration blatchford et al 2020 analogous to the study of van eekelen et al 2015 the base of the hsp algorithm is a high resolution land cover map that distinguished irrigated agriculture from natural vegetation the hsp algorithm aims to identify for each irrigated agricultural pixel a subset of natural pixels that are similar to the irrigated agricultural pixel in terms of precipitation reference evapotranspiration topography and soil texture the addition of these static and periodic datasets is an improvement upon the approach of van eekelen et al 2015 where only evapotranspiration data precipitation data and a land cover map were used to calculate the irrigated water use the output of the hsp algorithm is the incremental evapotranspiration et incr which describes the amount of water that is evaporated purely due to irrigation this value is finally converted to the water use m3 based on the surface area of a specific field or cluster of fields 2 2 1 data collection and processing the multispectral data used for this research is captured by the multispectral imager msi and oli operational land imager sensors carried by the satellites sentinel 2a and 2b esa 2012 and landsat 8 u s geological survey 2015 respectively the first sensor provides 10 m spatial resolution data every 5 days while the latter has a 30 m resolution and 16 days overpass frequency level 1 c reflectance products were i downloaded ii atmospherically corrected rahman and dedieu 1994 iii adjusted according to a surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf roy et al 2006 iv topographically normalized richter et al 2009 and v cloud masked by an external company using a deep learning model and manual accuracy check www cloudisnoise com the corrected reflectances were employed to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the albedo which are inputs for the etlook model as thermal data the brightness temperature from visible infrared imager and radiometer suite viirs onboard of suomi npp roger et al 2017 was employed for this wavelength the images have a 375 m resolution and are provided daily to estimate the weekly land surface temperature lst the least clouded image per week was used to better capture the variability within the images a lookup table between high and low resolution albedo and ndvi was built and extrapolated to upscale the lst data the meteorological information required for the processing comes from the most recent validated atmospheric general circulation model from the earth model and data assimilation system goddard earth observing system geos of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa rienecker et al 2008 when available data from local meteorological stations was also collected that was the case for some meteorological variables in australia which were available via the bureau of meteorology www bom gov au and the weather services of hortec www hortec co za for the western cape south africa the transmissivity was computed from the incoming shortwave radiation products distributed by the geostationary satellites msg esa 1999 and himawari japan meteorological agency 2015 temperature and humidity variables from geos were disaggregated according to rouf et al 2020 while station data was spatially interpolated following the work of hengl 2007 the static inputs dictate most of the similarity between natural and irrigated pixels to be able to exploit the algorithm on a global level only globally available datasets were considered an overview of them is given in fig 2 the first set of static features used in the hsp algorithm are features derived from a digital elevation model dem since it is acknowledged that topography in general can be an excellent indicator for hydrogeomorphological differences noh et al 2015 the dem used for this research is provided by the shuttle radar topography mission strm dataset which covers 80 of the world s landmass at 30 m resolution hennig et al 2007 the dem based static features are the slope aspect and topographic wetness index twi the aspect is converted from a 360 to a north south 180 orientation since the east and west orientation does not usually explain the difference in available solar radiation the twi is often used as an index to account for differences in hydrological processes due to topography sørensen et al 2006 and was first derived by beven and kirkby 1979 the twi is calculated using the saga gis flow accumulation module conrad et al 2015 the twi typically ranges between 3 and 30 with low values indicating dry and high values indicating wet conditions the second set of static features is related to the soil type the soil type is chosen due to its effect on the storage of nutrients infiltration capacity rooting depth capillary rise field capacity and wilting point to name a few moene and dam 2014 the isric soilgrids database provides global ph bulk density coarse fragments content sand content silt content clay content cation exchange capacity cec total nitrogen as well as soil organic carbon density content and stock at 250 m resolution hengl et al 2017 for this research the clay silt and sand content were considered the choice of the land cover map depends on the study area but generally the highest resolution and the most up to date public datasets are chosen the minimum requirements for a land cover map are the spatial resolution 30 m and the presence of the classes i rain fed and ii irrigated agriculture iii built up areas iv open water bodies v natural and vi forest areas for the hsp algorithm the forest areas should not be included as comparable natural areas trees are generally more resilient to drought and have better access to water than crops as a result they tend to show higher evapotranspiration rates than crops during water stressed conditions causing underestimated or even negative et incr values for south africa we used the south african national land cover sanlc 2018 dataset thompson 2019 for spain the sistema de información sobre ocupación del suelo de españa siose dataset siose 2018 and for australia the new south wales landuse 2017 v1 2 dataset dpie 2020 2 2 2 algorithm processing the etlook algorithm requires besides meteorological data satellite data on ndvi surface albedo and soil moisture the soil moisture is derived using land surface temperature lst and ndvi data according to the methodology described by yang et al 2015 which uses a trapezoid approach on a pixel by pixel basis a thorough validation of the etlook algorithm for multiple use cases field level regional level and continental level is done by blatchford et al 2020 the hsp model aims to find for each irrigated agricultural pixel a subset of hydrological similar natural pixels this similarity is expressed as the difference per static input between the natural and agricultural pixels compared to its standard deviation over the entire study area eq 3 for example in a mountainous area the standard deviation of the slope is high so pixels are considered to be similar earlier compared to pixels in a flat area this choice is made to enable flexibility in the definition of similar pixels but also to make sure that in every environment similar pixels can be found the similarity score of every static input is then averaged to compute the general similarity eq 4 3 s feat 1 a b s i r r f e a t n a t f e a t σ feat 4 s s slope s aspect s twi s clay s silt s sand n feat here s feat represents the score per static feature namely slope aspect twi clay silt and sand contents ir r feat is the feature value of the irrigated pixel na t feat the value of the natural pixel σ feat the standard deviation calculated for the entire scene s the overall score of all static inputs a natural pixel is considered similar if the score is larger than the threshold thr parameter which is expressed as 5 thr t h r std 1 in which th r std expresses the number of standard deviations the score is allowed to deviate from to be considered similar if this similarity is above a predefined threshold the natural pixel will be added to the subset of similar pixels eq 6 6 similar s t h r f a l s e s t h r t r u e not all static inputs are prepared in the same manner before calculating the similarity the aspect is only an important feature when there is a significant slope as in relatively flat regions the difference in solar radiation caused by the aspect is negligible therefore for irrigated agricultural pixels with a slope smaller than 2 the aspect is considered not of interest this is reflected by indicating the allowed aspect error to be 180 meaning that even if the aspect difference between the natural and irrigated pixels is 180 the aspect of those pixels is still considered similar for irrigated agricultural pixels with a slope larger than 2 an exponential function is used to decrease the allowed aspect error when the slope increases both scenarios are described by eqs 7 and 8 7 e aspect ir r slope 2 180 i r r s l o p e 2 180 e 0 115 i r r s l o p e 2 8 s aspect 1 a b s i r r a s p e c t n a t a s p e c t e aspect in addition to the scores of each static input for each natural pixel that passes the similarity criteria the total available water taw is calculated taw reflects the impact of the soil type on the water holding capacity of the soil which depends on the field capacity permanent wilting point and rooting depth mohamed and ali 2006 since the rooting depth is unknown this parameter has a constant value and is expressed as a ratio of the rooting depth of natural vegetation compared to that of crops generally for irrigated crops this value is set to 1 and for natural crops this value is set to 1 5 meaning that natural vegetation root 1 5 times deeper than crops mainly due to natural vegetation being better suited for dry conditions these values are chosen after calibration of the hsp algorithm using in situ water meter observations effectively the taw scales the et act of natural vegetation to be more comparable to the et act of irrigated agricultural vegetation for the calculation of the taw pedotransfer functions derived by mohamed and ali 2006 are used which calculate the field capacity q fc and permanent wilting point q pwp using sand silt and clay fractions coupled with the rooting depth z root the taw is calculated according to eq 9 9 taw 1000 q fc q pwp z root the taw is calculated for both the irrigated agricultural and the natural pixels that meet the similarity criteria by dividing the taw of the natural pixel ta w nat with the taw of the irrigated agricultural pixel ta w irr the ta w ratio is calculated this ratio is used to scale the et act of the natural pixels to match the et act of the irrigated agricultural pixel as shown in eqs 10 and 11 10 ta w ratio t a w n a t t a w i r r 11 e t ac t nat adj e t ac t nat ta w ratio as an additional criterion for natural pixels to be considered similar to the irrigated agricultural pixel the scores of the reference evapotranspiration et ref and precipitation p are calculated these are calculated in the same way as expressed in eq 3 the score of the et ref and p are then combined to a single feature by calculating the mean score of the two this step is done separately from the static input because pixels might be completely similar in a geomorphological manner but experience different conditions due to local rainfall events or increased evapotranspiration due to differences in solar radiation once the combined score of et ref and p is above 0 meaning that the difference between the et ref and p of the natural pixel is smaller than the averaged standard deviation of the two a natural pixel is finally considered hydrologically similar to its irrigated agricultural counterpart for each irrigated agricultural pixel the algorithm loops over all the natural pixels in a spiral manner starting close to the irrigated pixel the thr nsimpix max parameter tells the algorithm how many similar natural pixels have to be found per irrigated pixel once this number is met or all the natural pixels are handled the algorithm stops looking for natural pixels and continues to the next irrigated pixel because this process is computationally expensive the raster data is processed per block and the numba library lam et al 2015 is used to drastically increase the processing speed to decrease the runtime even further before running the hsp algorithm per irrigated agricultural pixel the distance to the closest natural pixels is calculated and stored in a raster this enables the hsp algorithm to start searching for similar natural pixels at the minimum known distance to a natural pixel for each irrigated agricultural pixel once the hsp algorithm is done looping over all the natural pixels the stored scores and distances are normalized so they range between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating perfect similarity and 0 indicating the lowest allowed similarity this normalization is for the static scores based on the thr parameter and for the distances based on the maximum distance the non et ref and p scores are normalized based on the minimum and maximum scores found for those inputs per study period normalizing these scores enables one to generate a total score for each natural pixel which is used as a weight to calculate a weighted et act for all the natural pixels this weighted et act favors natural pixels with high total scores over natural pixels with lower scores the weighted natural et act is then subtracted from the et act of the irrigated agricultural pixel which yields the incremental evapotranspiration et incr these steps are explained in eqs 12 15 12 s per norm s per s per min s per max s per min s stat norm s stat thr 1 thr s dist norm s dist s dist min s dist max s dist min 13 w s per norm s stat norm s dist norm 3 14 e t ac t nat weighted i 1 n s i m i l a r e t ac t nat i w i w 15 e t incr e t ac t irr e t ac t nat weighted here s per represents the score of the periodic et ref and p inputs s stat the score of the static inputs slope aspect twi and sand silt and clay content and s dist the score of the distance which are all expressed as an array based on the subset of most similar natural pixels the weight w is calculated for the normalized s per s stat and s dist and used to calculate the weighted et act for all the natural pixels in the subset the incremental evapotranspiration e t incr is then calculated by subtracting e t ac t nat weighted from the et act of the irrigated pixel e t act irr at this point the algorithm is ready to loop over the next irrigated agricultural pixel 2 2 3 irrigation quantification the et incr is expressed in mm similar to the et act to convert this unit to volumes the et incr is multiplied by the area of the agricultural field a prerequisite for calculating the water use is that per operational unit either being fields a cluster of fields or catchments the perimeter of these operational units is known however at field level those shapes are often not only showing agricultural fields but instead are linked cadastral units including roads houses reservoirs and other non agricultural areas to increase the accuracy of the water use estimates the same land cover map that is used to distinguish natural and irrigated agricultural pixels is used to calculate the area of irrigated agriculture a irr within each operational unit this area m2 is then used to convert the e t incr mm to the water use q in m3 this process is explained by eq 16 16 q e t incr a irr 1000 2 3 statistical analysis to assess the accuracy of the estimated water use multiple statistical metrics were obtained to assess the goodness of fit between the observed and estimated water use the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean squared error rmse were calculated the rmse is chosen as an additional metric since it is expressed in the same unit as the modeled outputs and has a strong foundation in model evaluation studies chai and draxler 2014 the r2 and rmse were calculated using the scikit learn sklearn package pedregosa et al 2011 additionally a significance analysis for all the calculated coefficients of determination was performed using the statsmodels package seabold and perktold 2010 to prove the significance of the calculated r2 values the corresponding p values should be larger than α which was set to 0 05 finally the deviation between the seasonal observations and estimates d i was calculated this metric which is expressed in percentages shows per individual field the accuracy of the product except for the deviation all the statistical metrics were calculated both on a monthly and seasonal timestep we also introduce a different metric to show the temporal accuracy of the monthly estimates i e the kling gupta efficiency kge the kge combines the correlation coefficient r the variability error a and the bias error b which makes it an ideal metric for time series accuracy assessment gupta et al 2009 the kge ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit for the well established nash sutcliffe efficiency nse a hydrological model is considered to have a reasonable performance when the nse is higher than 0 with nse 0 indicating that the mean of the predictions is similar to the mean of the observations for the kge when using the same criteria the threshold between a poorly performing and reasonable model lies at a kge of 0 4 knoben et al 2019 2 4 study areas currently the proposed irrigation quantification method is implemented in the operational water auditing application and used in south africa by several catchment management authorities cma s esa 2021 however this operational product delivers medium resolution 250 m data and is mostly used for monitoring large scale systems the first study area where a high resolution 10 m version of the product was applied is the hex valley a highly productive region in the western cape south africa to test the accuracy of the application outside south africa two additional validation sites were chosen i e the ebro basin in catalonia spain and the namoi river catchment in new south wales australia fig 3 2 4 1 hex valley western cape south africa the hex river valley is located in the breede river catchment in the western cape province the valley is a relatively narrow valley with a length of 25 km and a maximum width of 4 km bounded by high mountain ranges on either side fig 3 the area is classified as a cold semi arid climate bsk by the köppen geiger system in de doorns a town located in the center of the valley the average annual temperature is 17 2 c the warmest month is february at 23 9 c and the coldest month is july at 9 9 c the annual precipitation is 240 mm with february being the driest 10 mm and june the wettest 30 mm muñoz sabater 2019 the agricultural activities in the hex river valley are centered around the commercial cultivation of table grapes which are grown on 5 200 ha of land the source of irrigation is either originating from surface water 40 or groundwater 60 ncube 2018 in total for 15 fields seasonal water meter observations were provided by the hex valley water users association covering september 2018 until may 2019 for 12 out of the 15 fields weekly data was also made available and converted to a monthly interval 2 4 2 ebro basin catalonia spain the ebro river basin is the largest mediterranean basin of the iberian peninsula the river has the highest natural mean discharge in spain the catchment is enclosed by the cantabrian range and the pyrenees on the north and by the iberian mountains on the south an extensive irrigation network was built to store and transport pyrenean water to the plains to sustain the irrigated area that covers around 45 of the basin milano et al 2013 the study area is located in the eastern part of the ebro catchment surrounding the town lleida focusing around the urgell and algerri balaguer canals and is roughly 9 000 km2 in size fig 3 the climate is a humid subtropical climate cfa the mean maximum summer and winter temperatures are 23 0 c and 3 5 c respectively the average annual precipitation is 680 mm with the lowest monthly precipitation in february 30 mm and the highest in september 80 mm muñoz sabater 2019 dominant crop types in the area are wheat corn and alfalfa perennial crops are mainly fruit trees olive trees and vineyards irrigation is applied either using inundation drip or sprinkler systems gao et al 2018 daily water meter data was made available by the institute of agrifood research and technology irta from april until september 2020 for an apple orchard and two vineyards 2 4 3 namoi river new south wales australia the namoi catchment is part of the murray darling basin and is completely situated in new south wales australia the catchment is 43 000 km2 and the average discharge of the river at the outlet is 25 m3 s arshad et al 2014 barma water resources et al 2012 the study area of this research as shown in fig 3 is located between the towns of narrabri in the northwest and boggabri in the southeast agriculture is mainly practiced next to the river the area also includes some nature reserves in the southeast of the study area the boggabri coal mine is situated it abstracts approximately 270 000 m3 of groundwater per year herron et al 2018 farmers are mostly reliant on groundwater but surface water is also extracted through permits in times of high discharges surface water can also be accessed without registration which is called supplementary water arshad et al 2014 barma water resources et al 2012 the climate in the area is a humid subtropical climate cfa the mean maximum summer and winter temperatures are 33 8 c and 18 0 c respectively the average annual precipitation sum is 650 mm with precipitation amounts peaking in summer 80 mm month and being lowest in winter 40 mm month bureau of meteorology 2021 furrow irrigation is the main type of irrigation in the area and the furrows are fed with water that is stored in local reservoirs the water meter observation data was provided by water technology www watertech com au and was based on cadastral data lots from the nsw land registry service lrs and spreadsheets provided by the department of planning and environment dpe the dataset consists of 69 clusters and each cluster consists of multiple agricultural fields however from the 69 available clusters not all clusters contained areas that were classified as irrigated agriculture and thus for those clusters no water use estimates were generated effectively 12 of the 69 clusters contained both water meter observations and water use estimations and these clusters were the focus of the validation study the study period started in july 2017 and ended in june 2018 3 results to validate the results of the water auditing application we compared our water use estimates to the water meter observations of the three study areas for all the study areas both the monthly and the seasonal accumulated water use estimates were included in the comparison to anonymise the water meter data the field identifiers are altered to a generic format that starts with the area code i e hex ebr or nam followed by a number 3 1 hex valley western cape south africa fig 4 shows the accumulated water use estimations for the 2018 2019 season the et incr ranged from 200 to 1000 mm although the main crop type in the area is table grapes there were quite some local differences in the estimated water use even within each field unit the estimated water use ranges significantly indicating the importance of having a high resolution product when dealing with relatively small fields fig 5 shows the correlation between the monthly and seasonal water use estimates compared to the observed water use for both the monthly and seasonal products there was a strong correlation between the observed and estimated water use with an r2 of 0 751 and 0 780 respectively both coefficients of determination showed to be significant p 0 05 moreover the trendline was close to the 1 1 line indicating that there is no general over or underestimation the correlation for the monthly estimates was lower compared to the seasonal product which could indicate that the timing of the water use estimates is not always correct for the seasonal product 6 of the 15 fields showed a deviation lower than 20 the error was generally larger for fields with lower observed water use compared to the one for large consumers 3 2 ebro basin catalonia spain for the ebro region the seasonal accumulated et incr estimates ranged between 0 and 800 mm fig 6 while the maximum averaged monthly assessment was about 130 mm month the monthly value is analogous to the one of the hex valley 110 mm month this illustrates that for equivalent regions in terms of climate comparable evapotranspiration amounts linked to irrigation can be expected despite the size of the study area only three water meter observations were available for this research fig 7 shows that for these three plots the monthly water use estimates were inaccurate the corresponding r2 and p value were 0 051 and 3 68e 05 respectively because of the limited amount of validation data the seasonal results were not statistically significant p 0 084 the seasonal product showed that the water use of ebr 3 was accurately estimated 0 5 deviation the water use of ebr 2 was moderately overestimated 23 3 deviation and the water use of ebr 1 was highly underestimated 53 9 deviation both ebr 2 and ebr 3 are vineyards and their errors are in the same range as the vineyards of the hex valley fig 6 ebr 1 on the other hand is an apple orchard which might be explanatory for the large deviation for this study area the timing issues for the monthly water use estimates were also visible similar to the results for the hex valley 3 3 namoi river new south wales australia for the namoi area the maximum estimated incremental evapotranspiration was 600 mm over the entire season which translated to an average maximum of 50 mm month fig 8 this amount is significantly lower compared to the ebro and hex valley regions this disparity could be linked to the differences in crop types with perennial crops being abundant in the ebro and hex valley regions while in namoi annual crops are dominant in fig 9 similar to the other validation areas the large spatial variability between fields was also visible for these 12 clusters resembling the findings in the ebro basin the monthly estimates did generally not correspond accurately with the water meter observations fig 9 with an r2 of 0 151 the quality of the estimates was higher compared to the ebro basin but much lower compared to the hex valley also the trend line shows that generally the water use is underestimated for this region especially for low water use observations the deviations are large however the seasonal product shows that despite the low monthly accuracy the accumulated water use corresponds better with the observations r2 of 0 406 both coefficients of determination were statistically significant p 0 05 3 4 study area comparisons tables 1 2 and 3 show the general statistics of the monthly and seasonal water use estimates per field cluster of the hex valley ebro and namoi study areas respectively within each table the last row shows the mean of the estimated and observed water use per study area for the hex valley the mean difference between the estimated and observed water use was 4 5 indicating that on a spatiotemporal scale the model is performing well for the ebro and namoi study areas this difference was 13 8 and 21 9 respectively indicating a lower agreement with regional seasonal water use observations for both study areas the water use is generally underestimated the mean deviation d i for the hex valley and ebro study areas was comparable with 26 4 and 26 9 respectively for the namoi study area the mean deviation was larger with 47 8 when combining the water use estimates and observations of all the three study areas the water use was underestimated by 18 8 for 2 out of the 30 fields the kge is below 0 4 the kge value for nam 5 is 0 585 while the one for nam 12 is 0 560 in total there are 6 fields with a negative kge and 8 with a kge above 0 5 for the hex valley and the ebro study areas the mean kge is 0 385 and 0 405 respectively indicating that the temporal water use patterns were reasonably well modeled in contrast the mean kge of the namoi area was only 0 092 furthermore 5 of the 6 negative kge values originate from this study area this shows that the temporal water use pattern in namoi is not captured as well as for the other two study areas 3 5 temporal water use patterns our results show that based on the kge the temporal water use patterns were not always accurately modeled this is especially so for the namoi area table 3 fig 10 demonstrates three different behaviors when comparing the estimated to the observed water uses in the namoi area it can be observed in the figure that for clusters that behave like nam 7 the volumes are not correctly modeled d i 76 0 for the ones that act similarly as nam 3 the cumulative water use is accurately estimated d i 8 7 but the timing is off lastly the results of a few clusters like nam 11 show that the model is accurate in both the timing and cumulative amounts kge 0 829 d i 2 6 although the main irrigation type in the area is furrow irrigation which is assumed to be modeled less accurately the temporal pattern should not have been affected only the absolute estimated volumes applied to the field the most likely cause for the general low kge values is the location of the water meter itself in arid climates often reservoirs are constructed to store water for drier seasons biemans et al 2011 which is also the case for the namoi catchment pittock 2016 in this area the aim of installing the water meters is to control if a farmer withdraws the legal amount of ground or surface water not to inform how much water is directly applied to the crops barma water resources et al 2012 therefore there is a delay between the filling of the reservoir and the actual crop water consumption water is mostly pumped into the reservoirs during the winter while irrigation is mostly applied during summer fuentes et al 2021 this effect can be illustrated when comparing nam 7 and nam 11 the fields with the largest and smallest deviation in estimated and observed water use respectively fig 11 shows the change in water surface area of the reservoirs connected to nam 7 and nam 11 which is derived from sentinel 2 level 1 c observations using the normalised difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 ndwi pixels with a value larger than 0 are classified as water there is a clear distinction between both clusters with nam 11 showing a relatively constant surface water area from winter till summer while for nam 7 the surface water area drops from 18 ha to less than 5 ha at the start of the season in november the reservoir of nam 7 was rapidly filled and finally emptied with only 3 ha remaining at the beginning of july 2018 the reservoir of nam 11 starts depleting in march 2018 and finally has a water surface area of 9 ha due to the analysis being done on sentinel 2 level 1 c images atmospheric interference could have some effects on the surface water area observations but the main differences between the two clusters are clear based on figs 10 and 11 one could argue that more water is displaced throughout the season for nam 7 compared to nam 11 it is also evident that the reservoir of nam 7 has been emptied and filled during the growing season while the reservoir of nam 11 remained more constant for nam 7 water is mostly displaced to fill the reservoir not to directly irrigate the crops for nam 11 the pattern of the water surface area does not correlate well with the water meter observations meaning that the water that is pumped into the reservoir is more directly used for irrigation excluding nam 7 from the analysis shown in fig 9 would yield a seasonal r2 of 0 793 instead of 0 406 4 discussion in this research we demonstrate the potential of the hsp algorithm to distinguish between the et of natural and irrigated crops in addition we illustrate the capability of this model to calculate water use on a field level using high resolution 10 m satellite data however the results also show limitations on the estimation of irrigation water use for some fields the estimates on monthly and on seasonal scales are not accurate in this section we provide a discussion on the used methods and their impact on the accuracy of the water use estimates we also present a critical note on comparing in situ observations with satellite based models 4 1 model limitations as with all types of modeling compromises need to be made between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy since etlook and the hsp algorithm are computationally expensive multiple simplifications that might affect the quality of the final product have been applied 4 1 1 evapotranspiration modeling for all the study areas the etlook algorithm was run to produce daily evapotranspiration estimates these were converted to monthly and seasonal values to compare with equivalent water use estimates since etlook calculates e and t based on a modified penman monteith equation it shares the same limitations the main one is the fact that the stomatal resistance and soil resistance are hard to quantify regarding the stomatal resistance there is a dependence on land use each class is assigned a defined value for the canopy resistance so the quality of the transpiration estimate is dependent on the quality of the land use classification in its turn the soil resistance is a function of the topsoil moisture content so any uncertainty in the topsoil moisture estimations is propagated to the calculation of the evaporation subedi and chávez 2015 while some input data for etlook is available daily meteorological inputs others are less frequent ndvi albedo and land surface temperature and subject to cloud cover in cloudless conditions we can predict that every pixel would be seen by either sentinel 2 or landsat 8 about 90 times per year however that is hardly the case the impact of this on the hsp results is hard to predict for the irrigated pixels on the one hand it is expected that the variation of optical inputs is well captured as farmers would irrigate more during drier cloudless conditions for the natural rain fed vegetation on the other hand important phenological information might be missed during the cloudy periods in addition the source of the daily meteorological data interferes with the accuracy of both etlook and hsp algorithms for one study area the ebro basin the data came exclusively from climate models in the other two regions modeled data was only employed when locally measured data was not available 4 1 2 definition of hydrological similarity currently the similarity is based on the slope aspect twi clay content silt content and sand content however these inputs are all considered of equal importance when calculating the similarity one could argue that some of these inputs are more important than others for explaining the hydrogeomorphological differences between pixels future studies should include decisions on the weight of each static input when calculating the similarity score furthermore additional soil characteristics from the soilgrids database could be included hengl et al 2017 however due to the limited search radius of the algorithm a few kilometers it is not expected that these characteristics will show a significant difference without showing a significant change in sand silt and clay content besides the current static inputs additional periodic datasets could be obtained to assess the hydrological similarity examples of such datasets could be soil moisture estimates massari et al 2021 and rooting depth models de wit et al 2019 soil moisture datasets give insight into the spatiotemporal variability of the water availability where the currently used twi only shows the spatial distribution based on topography rooting depth models can be implemented to more accurately calculate the total available water taw parameter 4 1 3 availability of natural pixels the hsp algorithm depends on the availability of natural pixels however some agricultural schemes might be so extensive that it is difficult to find a suitable subset of natural pixels this is evident for the ebro study area as shown in fig 12 the study area in the ebro basin is effectively one entire irrigation scheme with limited natural areas while the hex valley is fully surrounded by natural pixels for the hex valley the maximum average distance to the subset of natural pixels is about 1 km while for the ebro study area this value can go up to 3 km for some pixels this increase in distance induces uncertainties when comparing the et of native vegetation and irrigated agriculture as it might violate the concept that all the other terms in the water balance eq 1 must be similar thus for areas like the ebro basin alternative approaches should be considered in addition as mentioned by van eekelen et al 2015 all land cover classification maps have their inaccuracies which will affect the water use estimates if for example a built up area is classified as natural vegetation the incremental et and the water use will be overestimated to decrease the impact of falsely classified natural areas the size of the subset of similar pixels can be increased however this impacts the computational efficiency and increases the mean distance of the subset affecting its hydrological similarity a second option is to exclude natural pixels which do not show any vegetation development throughout the season for example by excluding pixels with a maximum seasonal ndvi of 0 3 another solution could be to compare non irrigated agricultural pixels to irrigated ones that would solve the issue of having limited access to natural pixels on the other hand current land cover maps are not reliable enough to assume that non irrigated plots are indeed not irrigated such maps are usually not updated every year furthermore annual crops often rotate every season resulting in changing irrigation practices it raises the need for an annually or seasonally updated irrigated area map which will be the focus of future studies having an up to date and accurate irrigated area map would also improve the accuracy of the water use estimates because the et incr is only calculated for areas that are classified as irrigated agriculture if the current land cover maps underestimate the irrigated area the water use is also underestimated 4 2 validity of comparison with water meters besides the known limitations of the models directly comparing satellite observations with in situ measurements is always challenging loew et al 2017 a water meter is not a standardized instrument and each system has its inaccuracies boman and shukla 2009 dobriyal et al 2017 su et al 2021 hightech agricultural systems might be equipped with fully automated and efficient irrigation equipment which accurately measure the water use nevertheless most schemes are inefficient and depend on manual labor furrow irrigation is among the least efficient irrigation types with an overall efficiency of 45 whereas for drip irrigation considered the most efficient type the overall efficiency rises to 90 savva and frenken 2002 an added challenge is that while water meters account for all the water applied to the field only the irrigated water consumed by the crop is observed in our satellite based measurements intermediate losses such as open water evaporation percolation runoff and leakages are not monitored thus in its current form satellite based water use estimates should be more comparable to drip irrigation systems and less related to poorly performing irrigation types such as furrow or sprinkler irrigation it is also known that water meters are not always installed to monitor the water that is directly applied to the field but rather to observe how much water is taken from the environment and stored in reservoirs fuentes et al 2021 fig 11 illustrates that this is presumably the reason for the mismatch in the temporal patterns of the estimated and observed water use table 3 it also shows that for a reservoir that fluctuates a lot in the amount of water stored nam 7 the seasonal accuracy of the satellite based water use estimates decreased significantly it is therefore crucial that when comparing water meter data to remote sensing based water use estimates the water meter is directly coupled to the irrigation system instead of being connected to an intermediate reservoir 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that depending on the study area it is possible to accurately estimate the monthly and seasonal water use of irrigated agriculture using high resolution 10 m remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimates and the newly introduced hsp algorithm the hex valley south africa study area yielded the best results with a seasonal r2 of 0 780 for the ebro spain study area limited validation data was available but in general the results were less accurate than for the hex valley the limited amount of natural pixels in the ebro study area fig 12 also made the execution of the hsp algorithm more challenging the results of the namoi australia study area were accurate at seasonal scale r2 0 793 excluding nam 7 but showed timing issues on a monthly basis due to the water meters being connected to large reservoirs instead of being directly connected to the irrigation systems a use case of the proposed method which we already implemented in some south african catchment management agencies is to compare our water use estimates with predefined water allocations this enables local water authorities to identify big water consumers and to enforce local withdrawal laws in times of drought further research will implement an annual irrigated area map to improve the accuracy of the model and the hsp algorithm will subsequently be tested while comparing irrigated to non irrigated crops for areas that have limited availability of natural pixels funding this work was supported by the european commission s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme

9522,ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and nitrogen fertilization has been shown to improve soil conditions and plant growth but it is still unclear how the above mentioned agronomic practices regulate carbon assimilating source and carbon reservoir sink to increase winter wheat yield and water use a field trial was conducted with planting patterns flat planting with non mulching fp and ridge furrow with plastic film mulch rp as main plots and n rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 marked as n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively as sub plots the results showed that rp significantly increased soil

595 7 respectively but significantly decreased evapotranspiration during the growth stages et i total et et total of 2019 2020 and wue by 9 90 7 28 and 11 52 respectively compared with fp nitrogen application significantly decreased sws and soil temperature by 9 3 22 9 and 5 1 21 1 but increased net content of soil mineral n consumption of soil mineral n et i et total and wue by 45 9 512 4 15 0 22 0 6 0 50 3 8 98 25 32 and 38 50 145 75 respectively compared with n0 soil water storage at the anthesis milk and dough stages and soil temperature at the milk stage mainly increased the source and establishment of the initial reservoir while the soil mineral n mainly optimized the source sink balance in the middle and late period however leaf area and dry matter at anthesis chlorophyll content at 18 days post anthesis and grain number especially spike number played decisive roles in increasing yield while leaf area and dry matter at the milk stage grain volume at 30 days post anthesis and especially the post anthesis contribution rate for dry matter accumulation in grains were the main limiting factors therefore ridge furrow with plastic film mulching combined with 180 kg n ha 1 could balance the source sink but it is necessary to study the ratio of ridge furrow and sowing rate to achieve a high yield and wue graphical abstract ga1 keywords dry matter translocation grain filling ridge furrow cultivation soil properties water use efficiency 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the major cereal crops around the world and about 21 of all food comes from wheat fao 2019 winter wheat is widely planted in china and the planting area and yield account for 93 and 95 of all wheat respectively http www moa gov cn however the winter wheat planting area is stable at about 2 3 107 ha http www agri cn which can not meet the demand for wheat under the rapid population growth and strong economic development therefore winter wheat yield needs to be improved to ensure food security rempelos et al 2020 the photosynthesis capacity of leaves such as formation translocation remobilization and partitioning of assimilates is defined as the source capacity while the growing capacity of organs such as grain number and grain volume to dry matter accumulation is defined as the sink capacity asseng et al 2017 the grain yield of winter wheat is determined by the synergistic interaction between source activity and sink capacity lv et al 2020 however winter wheat yield is commonly considered to be sink limited under a suitable environment and grains development is regulated by the assimilating capacity but unlimited by the source foulkes et al 2010 however the cultivars and growing environment of winter wheat varied in different regions therefore the relative importance of the source and sink in contributing to the wheat yield remains a controversial matter studies have shown that the grain filling stage is the critical period for the formation of winter wheat yield and can be influenced by soil conditions yan et al 2019 this is because soil properties regulate the assimilate supply and carbohydrate demand of the grains which affects the establishment of yield components grain number grain dry weight and spike number asseng et al 2017 therefore this study will explore the impact of source and sink on yield from soil conditions such as water temperature and nutrients northwest china with 19 2 of the cultivated land of the country is the major rainfed region for winter wheat production luo et al 2018 water is one of the key factors affecting agricultural production and in this regard different kinds of abiotic stresses such salinity which can reduce water uptake by plants drought and moisture stresses can decrease the yield of wheat nazari et al 2019 2020 jamshidi goharrizi et al 2020 momeni et al 2021 this is because water shortage limits plant growth by reducing nutrient absorption wang et al 2010 increasing leaf senescence yang et al 2000 and reducing the photosynthetic rate liu et al 2016 the annual rainfall in northwest china is 400 600 mm and about 30 of rainfall occurs in the winter wheat season october june while pan evaporation can reach 1500 mm fang et al 2021b water use efficiency wue is determined by the grain yield per unit of water consumption and is linearly correlated with yield wang et al 2019 that means much water consumption but low grain yield will lead to a low wue thus insufficient and unevenly distributed rainfall in this area means that water scarcity and low wue is a topic of great concern to limit agricultural development it is meaningful to find out a water saving measure for achieving the sustainable development of agriculture in northwest china like water nitrogen n is another essential factor that greatly affects winter wheat production studies have shown that n application increased evapotranspiration campbell et al 1977 root growth chen et al 2018 and grain filling parameters yan et al 2019 especially shoot biomass and yield liu et al 2020 nitrogen deficiency in northwest china is also widespread and leads to excessive n fertilization fang et al 2020 studies have indicated that excessive n application resulted in the inefficient consumption of water increased input costs reduced n use efficiency and polluted the environment such as soil acidification and greenhouse gas emissions ju et al 2009 miao et al 2015 so it is particularly important to determine an optimal amount of n fertilizer during the winter wheat season for resource conservation and soil health reasons to address water shortage and over use n fertilizer some water saving agronomic measures such as ridge furrow with film mulching have been adopted in northwest china wang et al 2019 reported that mulching the soil with plastic film can not only maintain high soil moisture and soil temperature but also reduce weeds so as to promote crop growth and yields ridge furrow with plastic film mulch not only has advantages of plastic film but also diverts rainfall into the furrows and reduces n loss gan et al 2013 fang et al 2021a it is well known that agronomic practices directly affect soil properties then regulate crop growth and increase yield previous studies mainly concentrated on the effect of agronomic practices on soil water crop growth and yield of winter wheat ali et al 2018 liu et al 2020 although ali et al 2018 reported a positive relationship between photosynthetic parameters and soil water content dry matter translocation and yield and liu et al 2020 reported that chlorophyll content in the upper leaves was highly positively correlated with yield how ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and n application regulate source sink relationship through the soil properties to increase winter wheat yield is still unknown therefore a field trial with ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and n fertilization was conducted on winter wheat to explore 1 the effect of the above practices on winter wheat production and 2 how the above practices regulate the source sink relationship through the soil properties to increase yield

at 60 kg ha 1 were applied by broadcasting as a basal dressing to each plot and raked into the soil manually the wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 with a sowing rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 was sown on october 10 2018 and october 19 2019 and harvested on june 3 2019 and june 1 2020 for each season respectively there was no supplementary irrigation and topdressing weeds and diseases were controlled as the normal field 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 process of grain filling during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons 70 representative single stems with the same anthesis date about april 19 were tagged in each plot beginning 6 days post anthesis ten spikes per plot were collected from tagged stems every 6 days seven times in total between anthesis and harvest after each collection the spikes were immediately brought back to the laboratory and their grains were manually and carefully stripped from the chaff the fresh grains were thoroughly mixed and then 100 grains were counted from the three replicates to measure the grain size volume per 100 grain using 95 ethanol density 0 81 g cm 3 and the drainage method martinez carrasco and thorne 1979 the ethanol on the 100 grains was washed off using water the grains were firstly dried for 0 5 h at 105 c then dried at 75 c to a stable weight the dry grains were weighed on an electronic scale 1 10 000 g and then converted into 1000 grain weights the flag leaves on the same stems were selected to determine the chlorophyll a and b content the chlorophyll content was quantified by spectrophotometry after extracting fresh and chopped leaf samples with 95 ethanol roca et al 2018 the leaves were sampled five times in the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons before the leaves turned yellow 2 3 2 model description the richards model was used to

post harvest were measured three repeated soil samples between the two rows in the furrow of rp were taken at 10 cm intervals by an auger the swc in the ith soil layer s w c i was calculated by the oven drying method jia et al 2018 then soil water storage sws mm was calculated by 13 s w s γ i h i s w c i where the γ i and h i is the soil bulk density g cm 3 and soil thickness cm of the ith soil

n3 levels in the 0 60 cm soil layer except for 10 20 cm layer during the 2018 2019 season however it only significantly increased the net content of soil mineral n by 9 1 21 6 at the n2 and n3 rates in the 0 20 cm layer during the 2019 2020 season the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption in each soil layer increased as the n rate rose fig 4 the low n level n1 significantly increased the net content of soil mineral n at anthesis and harvest and soil mineral n consumption by 171 3 64 5 and 15 0 on average in the rp 0 40 cm soil layer and by 206 1 45 9 and 16 8 in the fp 0 20 cm soil layer respectively compared with n0 however the high n application rates n2 and n3 significantly increased the net content of soil mineral n at anthesis and harvest stages and soil mineral n consumption across the whole 0 60 cm layer by 419 7 418 9 and 22 0 in the rp and by 512 4 450 8 and 17 7 in the fp respectively compared with n0 3 4 chlorophyll content leaf area and dry matter translocation and assimilation the chlorophyll content showed an up and down trend in the 2018 2019 season while chlorophyll content decreased with post anthesis days in the 2019 2020 season especially at the n0 and n1 levels fig 5 in general the rp significantly increased chlorophyll content by an average of 17 2 19 8 10 6 and 9 5 at the n0 n1 n2 and n3 levels during the two seasons respectively compared with the fp nitrogen application also significantly increased chlorophyll content by 4 4 153 8 and 5 7 110 0 at the n1 level by 12 7 465 3 and 22 2 475 5 at the n2 level and by 19 0 475 2 and 24 6 488 6 at the n3 level in the rp and fp respectively compared with n0 the leaf area at the anthesis and milk stages was on an average of 139 5 and 80 7 at the n0 level 20 0 and 14 0 at the n1 level 33 2 and 16 0 at the n2 level and by 9 3 and 3 8 at the n3 level significantly greater in rp than in fp during the two seasons respectively table 4 nitrogen application also significantly increased leaf area during the two seasons by 31 4 116 5 in the rp and 108 8 262 3 in fp in general rp significantly increased the tro cro and cr by 6 7 29 0 7 0 46 4 and 2 8 32 7 respectively compared with fp table 4 however the rp significantly decreased the cra by 22 8 47 9 compared with fp nitrogen application significantly decreased the cro and cr by 13 0 30 6 and 6 8 29 2 in the rp and by 12 1 49 3 and 11 1 43 2 in the fp respectively compared with n0 however n application significantly increased cra by 74 1 443 3 in the rp and by 91 0 321 1 in the fp compared with n0 during the two growing seasons furthermore n application significantly increased tro by 5 7 at the n2 level and by 5 4 at the n3 level in the rp whereas it significantly decreased tro by 9 7 at the n1 level in the rp and by 5 5 12 7 in the fp during the 2019 2020 season 3 5 grain filling parameters the grain filling process for winter wheat fitted by the richards model showed that the grain filling dynamic for winter wheat was a trend of gradual growing fast growing and slow growing under the different treatments fig 6 the coefficients of determination for the fitting model were all above 0 98 indicating that the richards model could successfully fit the grain filling dynamics table 5 the fitting value of a increased as the n rate rose and was higher in rp than in fp at the same n level in general the rp increased the r o by 0 6 8 2 at most n application rates compared with the fp the only exception was the n3 level where the rp decreased r o by an average of 4 3 table 6 in contrast to r o the rp decreased the t max by 0 2 3 3 compared to the fp at the n0 n1 and n2 levels whereas it increased t max by 0 7 on average at the n3 level furthermore the rp increased the v max v w max and d by 0 8 10 7 1 3 11 6 2 4 11 2 and 1 7 3 0 respectively compared with fp n application decreased r o on average by 7 5 and 1 0 at the n1 level by 8 3 and 2 2 at the n2 level and by 12 1 and 1 3 at the n3 level in the rp and fp respectively compared with n0 table 6 nitrogen application to the rp increased v max and v by 4 1 7 2 and 4 0 6 4 in the 2018 2019 season but which was decreased by 2 9 4 7 and 3 0 4 1 in the 2019 2020 season respectively compared with n0 furthermore n application to the fp generally increased v max and v by 0 9 11 7 and 2 3 12 7 during the two seasons respectively compared with n0 the only exception was the n3 level in the 2019 2020 season nitrogen application also increased t max w max and d compared with n0 by an average of 9 9 8 3 and 7 5 rp and 11 2 10 7 and 5 6 fp at the n1 level 13 8 11 9 and 13 9 rp and 15 4 14 8 and 11 3 fp at the n2 level and by 15 0 14 3 and 11 9 rp and 13 6 11 9 and 9 5 fp at the n3 level respectively planting pattern and n application also significantly affected the grain volume after 30 days post anthesis fig 7 the rp significantly increased grain volume from 30 to 42 days post anthesis by an average of 5 2 at the n0 level 5 4 at the n1 level 9 5 at the n2 level and 10 1 at the n3 level compared to the fp furthermore n application significantly increased grain volume from 30 to 42 days post anthesis by an average of 11 8 and 11 5 at the n1 level 29 7 and 24 5 at the n2 level and 36 5 and 30 4 at the n3 level in the rp and fp respectively 3 6 path analysis of yield in this study wue was linearly correlated with yield s1 therefore we just analyzed the ways of yield increasing the pca of soil properties and plant growth was first conducted due to plastic film mulching and n application directly affected soil properties the results showed that the cumulative variance of contributions reached 81 47 pc1 explained 50 73 and pc2 explained 30 74 fig 8 the farther away the indicators are from the center the greater their role is and the closer the indicators are the greater the correlation is therefore soil water storage at the anthesis milk and dough stages and soil temperature at the milk stage mainly affected grain volume at 6 days post anthesis gv1 and r o nevertheless the net soil mineral n contents at anthesis and harvest mainly affected leaf area and leaf dry matter at the anthesis stage la1 and dml1 respectively and the milk stage la2 dml2 chlorophyll content at 18 days chl2 cra grain volume at 30 days gv2 and 42 days gv3 post anthesis t max and d chlorophyll content at 30 days post anthesis chl3 was excluded because chlorophyll content was decreased from 24 days chl2 to 30 days chl3 post anthesis fig 5 and 1000 grain weight fig 6 and grain volume fig 7 increased slowly after 30 days post anthesis the pca results were used to analyze the relationships between the grain yield and indexes of plant growth s2 the gv3 results were excluded because the correlations between yield and gv3 and gv2 were very close in addition the gv3 value was close to the final grain volume and was no longer affected by the soil properties then a path analysis was conducted to explore how plant growth affected yield the path analysis results showed that la1 decision coefficient 32 71 dml1 33 85 chl2 33 28 t max 23 5 grain number 26 32 and spike number 50 25 were positive factors while la2 41 44 dml2 42 02 gv2 47 02 and cra 133 36 were negative factors for yield decision table 7 the indexes with a negative decision coefficient were the limiting factors for yield furthermore both la1 and la2 positively affected yield through dml1 indirect path coefficient 0 30 and 0 34 respectively and spike number 0 31 and 0 48 respectively but negatively affected yield through cra 0 38 and 0 45 the dml1 and spike number mainly directly and positively affected yield direct path coefficients were 0 67 and 0 93 respectively while dml2 chl2 and gv2 mainly positively affected yield through dml1 indirect path coefficients were 0 67 0 56 and 0 50 respectively the t max indirect path coefficient 0 47 and grain number 0 37 also mainly negatively affected yield through the cra indirect path coefficients were 0 47 and 0 37 4 discussion 4 1 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on soil properties mulching the soil with the film hindered the water exchange between the air and soil gan et al 2013 and ridge furrow planting helps collect rainwater therefore ridge furrow combined with film mulching over the ridges should further improve soil moisture zhou et al 2015 in our study when the amount of n fertilization was lower than n3 sws was significantly higher and et was lower in rp than in fp especially in the drought season 2019 2020 indicating that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching increased and maintained soil moisture this agreed with the findings reported by fang et al 2021b however compared with no n application n application significantly decreased sws but increased et indicating that n application increased soil water consumption wang et al 2019 furthermore whether et was higher or not in rp than in fp wue was lower in rp than in fp we also found that the wue was linearly correlated with yield fig 9 which agreed with the result reported by hu et al 2020 so the result may be caused by a lower grain yield in rp than in fp table 2 mulching the soil with the plastic film also reduced the exchange of heat between the air and soil gan et al 2013 studies have shown that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching improved soil temperature in the early growing season because of a small canopy zhou et al 2009 fang et al 2021a in the study the soil temperature was also significantly higher in rp than in fp except at n3 at anthesis milk and dough stages of the 2018 2019 season while the soil temperature was only significantly higher in the rp at the n1 level in the 2019 2020 season the reasons for this may be that 1 the larger canopy reduced the surface area of the soil that received solar energy and 2 a rainfall event 59 2 mm that occurred during the grain filling period in 2019 2020 fig 2 caused higher soil moisture than the same period in 2018 2019 table 3 in contrast to ridge furrow with film mulching n application generally significantly decreased soil temperature compared with no n application and this was probably due to the larger canopy table 4 the urea applied to the soil was decomposed into mineral n by urease and soil mineral n is directly absorbed by crop roots herrera et al 2013 studies reported that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching could maintain a higher content of soil mineral n he et al 2018 and promote crops to absorb soil mineral n gan et al 2013 our study produced a similar result however during the 2019 2020 season the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption at the n2 and n3 levels in the 40 60 cm soil layer were significantly lower in the rp than in the fp at anthesis but the reverse was true in the 0 20 cm soil layer at harvest this may be because that less rainfall before anthesis fig 2 made soil mineral n mainly concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer but relatively heavy rainfall at the grain filling stage caused soil mineral n to migrate to the deep soil chen et al 2020 nitrogen application increased the net soil mineral n content and soil mineral n consumption compared with no n which was consistent with wang et al 2019 furthermore the low n application rate n1 increased the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption within the 40 cm and 20 cm soil layers in the rp and fp respectively while high n applications n2 and n3 increased the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption within the whole 0 60 cm layer in both treatments this is because ridge furrow with film mulching collected rainfall and moved water upward due to the increase of soil temperature fig 3 compared with flat planting with non mulching 4 2 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on plant growth and dry matter translocation the source a strong source with sufficient reserves formation translocation remobilization and partitioning of assimilate is necessary for grain filling and high yield formation camargo et al 2016 chlorophyll is the most important pigment for light harvesting and photosynthesis in plants leaf area and chlorophyll content directly affect the synthesis of leaf assimilate and transportation during the stage of grain filling xu et al 2019 this study showed that both leaf area and chlorophyll content significantly increased by ridge furrow with film mulching and n application this agreed with previous studies gan et al 2013 however the chlorophyll content showed a different trend in the two seasons fig 5 this was due to less rainfall fig 2 and higher soil temperature fig 3 later in the grain filling stage of the 2019 2020 season the accumulation and transport of dry matter during the grain filling stage have important effects on grain yield ercoli et al 2008 studies have shown that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching increase the accumulation of dry matter fang et al 2021a and that combined with 350 mm irrigation rate greatly improved dry matter translocation translocation efficiency and pre flowering assimilate translocation to grain compared with flat planting with non mulching ali et al 2018 in the study the rp significantly increased tro cro and cr but significantly decreased cra compared with fp indicating that the ridge furrow with film mulching pattern promoted dry matter synthesis and transfer from vegetative organs to reproductive organs it has been shown that n application increased dry matter accumulation masoni et al 2007 but decreased the transport of dry matter sieling et al 2016 in this study n application significantly decreased cro and cr but increased cra in the rp and fp compared with n0 this is because the n application promoted plant growth and lengthened the growth period tables 4 and 6 4 3 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on grain filling the sink sink strength is determined by the number and potential size of grains per stem depending on the capacity of plants to actively obtain reserve and accumulate photosynthetic assimilates lv et al 2020 therefore this study explored the grain development under plastic film mulching and n application the richards model has been well applied to crop growth yang et al 2006 fang et al 2020 and the model parameter n reflects the shape of the fitting curve and limitation to grain storage capacity in our study the richards model strongly fitted the grain filling dynamic and parameter n was always greater than 1 0 which meant that the fitting curves for grain filling were all right biased and less limited by grain storage capacity this may be because the n fertilizer in this study was all applied as a basal application which increased n losses and limited the later growth of winter wheat zhu and chen 2002 in our study ridge furrow with film mulching and n application did not change the grain filling trend of slow fast slow but did change the grain filling parameters which was consistent with previous studies meng et al 2010 yan et al 2019 the r o represents the growth potential of the pollinated ovary and the larger the value the earlier the initial development of the pollinated ovary yao et al 2011 however it is not clear how the ridge furrow with film mulching pattern affects grain filling by winter wheat our study showed that the rp increased r o except for the n3 level v max v w max and d but decreased t max furthermore n application increased w max d and t max but decreased r o in the rp and fp compared with n0 this was agreed with yan et al 2019 nitrogen application also increased the v max and v of the fp in both seasons but only increased v max and v in the rp during the 2018 2019 season compared with n0 this may be due to the lower rainfall during the early stage of grain filling the results showed that ridge furrow with film mulching and n application promoted grain development and filling in winter wheat gan et al 2013 yan et al 2019 therefore grain volume after 30 days post anthesis significantly increased the difference was that under the condition of less rainfall the ridge furrow with film mulching pattern could shorten the growth period ali et al 2019 whereas n application had the opposite effect demotes mainard and jeuffroy 2001 4 4 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on grain yield and its components the sink regarding the increase in population and limited land available it is very important to improve the yield of winter wheat studies showed that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching over ridges increased the yield components of winter wheat hu et al 2020 but whether it can always increase grain yield is controversial he et al 2018 fang et al 2021a fu et al 2021 in our study the grain number and 1000 grain weight at the same n level were significantly higher in rp than in fp this agreed with the previous studies fang et al 2021a gu et al 2021 however the yield and spike number under n application were significantly lower in rp than in fp this is because the ridge furrow planting pattern reduced the planting area compared with flat planting under the same sowing rate fig 1 thus increasing the plant density which led to a decrease in effective tillers and yield luo et al 2020 it indicated that the ridge furrow ratio and sowing rate effects on yield need further study furthermore n application both significantly increased yield and yield components for rp and fp but excessive n application weakened this effect this is consistent with luo et al 2019 4 5 potential pathway of source sink affecting yield the grain yield was considered as the balance between the source activity and sink strength zhang et al 2010a and this balance was influenced by environmental stresses brestic et al 2018 especially n availability ning et al 2018 studies showed that ridge furrow with film mulching and n application could improve winter wheat yield wang et al 2019 in addition n application provides nitrogen the nutrient most needed by winter wheat to promote growth li et al 2009 however the path by which the above mentioned agronomic practices regulate crop growth through the soil to increase winter wheat yield is unknown in this study a principal component analysis correlation analysis and path analysis were carried out to explore the influence mechanism underlying the ridge furrow film mulching and n application effects from soil to plant and then to yield the results of pca showed that high soil water storage at the anthesis milk and dough stages and soil temperature at the milk stage mainly increased the source and establishment of the initial reservoir in line with previous studies fan et al 2015 cui et al 2015 while the soil mineral n mainly optimized the source sink balance in the middle and late period supported by zhang et al 2010b the results of path analysis showed that leaf area and leaf dry matter at anthesis chlorophyll content at 18 days post anthesis grain number and especially spike number played decisive roles in increasing yield this was consistent with previous studies sieling et al 2016 kitonyo et al 2018 rivera amado et al 2019 xu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however the leaf area and leaf dry matter at the milk stage grain volume at 30 days post anthesis and especially cra were the main limiting factors this was supported by previous studies muñoz and calderini 2015 nehe et al 2020 controlling limiting factors such as delaying leaf senescence promoting the synthesis and transport of assimilates to grains and increasing grain volume will help to further improve yield therefore ridge furrow with plastic film mulching combined with 180 kg n ha 1 could balance the relationship between source and sink to achieve a high yield and wue 5 conclusions the rp significantly increased sws soil temperature except for milk and dough stages during the 2019 2020 season and net content and consumption of soil mineral n but reduced et during the growth stages total et in 2019 2020 and wue in 2018 2019 except for n0 compared with the fp nitrogen application significantly decreased sws and soil temperature but increased net content and consumption of soil mineral n et and wue compared with n0 soil water storage and soil temperature mainly affected cr cro grain volume at 6 days post anthesis et from the milk to dough stage chlorophyll content at 6 days post anthesis and r o the net soil mineral n content mainly affected leaf area and leaf dry matter at the anthesis and milk stages et from the anthesis to milk stage chlorophyll content at 18 and 30 days post anthesis tro cra grain volume at 30 and 42 days post anthesis and all the grain filling parameters except r o leaf area and leaf dry matter at anthesis chlorophyll content at 18 days post anthesis grain number and especially spike number played a decisive role in increasing yield while leaf area and leaf dry matter at the milk stage grain volume at 30 days post anthesis and especially cra were the main limiting factors finally n application significantly increased yield but the yield was lower in rp than in fp this study

9522,ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and nitrogen fertilization has been shown to improve soil conditions and plant growth but it is still unclear how the above mentioned agronomic practices regulate carbon assimilating source and carbon reservoir sink to increase winter wheat yield and water use a field trial was conducted with planting patterns flat planting with non mulching fp and ridge furrow with plastic film mulch rp as main plots and n rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 marked as n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively as sub plots the results showed that rp significantly increased soil water storage sws soil temperature except that at the milk and dough stages of the 2019 2020 season net content of soil mineral n and consumption of soil mineral n by 3 8 13 5 1 4 5 7 2 197 9 and 15 1 595 7 respectively but significantly decreased evapotranspiration during the growth stages et i total et et total of 2019 2020 and wue by 9 90 7 28 and 11 52 respectively compared with fp nitrogen application significantly decreased sws and soil temperature by 9 3 22 9 and 5 1 21 1 but increased net content of soil mineral n consumption of soil mineral n et i et total and wue by 45 9 512 4 15 0 22 0 6 0 50 3 8 98 25 32 and 38 50 145 75 respectively compared with n0 soil water storage at the anthesis milk and dough stages and soil temperature at the milk stage mainly increased the source and establishment of the initial reservoir while the soil mineral n mainly optimized the source sink balance in the middle and late period however leaf area and dry matter at anthesis chlorophyll content at 18 days post anthesis and grain number especially spike number played decisive roles in increasing yield while leaf area and dry matter at the milk stage grain volume at 30 days post anthesis and especially the post anthesis contribution rate for dry matter accumulation in grains were the main limiting factors therefore ridge furrow with plastic film mulching combined with 180 kg n ha 1 could balance the source sink but it is necessary to study the ratio of ridge furrow and sowing rate to achieve a high yield and wue graphical abstract ga1 keywords dry matter translocation grain filling ridge furrow cultivation soil properties water use efficiency 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the major cereal crops around the world and about 21 of all food comes from wheat fao 2019 winter wheat is widely planted in china and the planting area and yield account for 93 and 95 of all wheat respectively http www moa gov cn however the winter wheat planting area is stable at about 2 3 107 ha http www agri cn which can not meet the demand for wheat under the rapid population growth and strong economic development therefore winter wheat yield needs to be improved to ensure food security rempelos et al 2020 the photosynthesis capacity of leaves such as formation translocation remobilization and partitioning of assimilates is defined as the source capacity while the growing capacity of organs such as grain number and grain volume to dry matter accumulation is defined as the sink capacity asseng et al 2017 the grain yield of winter wheat is determined by the synergistic interaction between source activity and sink capacity lv et al 2020 however winter wheat yield is commonly considered to be sink limited under a suitable environment and grains development is regulated by the assimilating capacity but unlimited by the source foulkes et al 2010 however the cultivars and growing environment of winter wheat varied in different regions therefore the relative importance of the source and sink in contributing to the wheat yield remains a controversial matter studies have shown that the grain filling stage is the critical period for the formation of winter wheat yield and can be influenced by soil conditions yan et al 2019 this is because soil properties regulate the assimilate supply and carbohydrate demand of the grains which affects the establishment of yield components grain number grain dry weight and spike number asseng et al 2017 therefore this study will explore the impact of source and sink on yield from soil conditions such as water temperature and nutrients northwest china with 19 2 of the cultivated land of the country is the major rainfed region for winter wheat production luo et al 2018 water is one of the key factors affecting agricultural production and in this regard different kinds of abiotic stresses such salinity which can reduce water uptake by plants drought and moisture stresses can decrease the yield of wheat nazari et al 2019 2020 jamshidi goharrizi et al 2020 momeni et al 2021 this is because water shortage limits plant growth by reducing nutrient absorption wang et al 2010 increasing leaf senescence yang et al 2000 and reducing the photosynthetic rate liu et al 2016 the annual rainfall in northwest china is 400 600 mm and about 30 of rainfall occurs in the winter wheat season october june while pan evaporation can reach 1500 mm fang et al 2021b water use efficiency wue is determined by the grain yield per unit of water consumption and is linearly correlated with yield wang et al 2019 that means much water consumption but low grain yield will lead to a low wue thus insufficient and unevenly distributed rainfall in this area means that water scarcity and low wue is a topic of great concern to limit agricultural development it is meaningful to find out a water saving measure for achieving the sustainable development of agriculture in northwest china like water nitrogen n is another essential factor that greatly affects winter wheat production studies have shown that n application increased evapotranspiration campbell et al 1977 root growth chen et al 2018 and grain filling parameters yan et al 2019 especially shoot biomass and yield liu et al 2020 nitrogen deficiency in northwest china is also widespread and leads to excessive n fertilization fang et al 2020 studies have indicated that excessive n application resulted in the inefficient consumption of water increased input costs reduced n use efficiency and polluted the environment such as soil acidification and greenhouse gas emissions ju et al 2009 miao et al 2015 so it is particularly important to determine an optimal amount of n fertilizer during the winter wheat season for resource conservation and soil health reasons to address water shortage and over use n fertilizer some water saving agronomic measures such as ridge furrow with film mulching have been adopted in northwest china wang et al 2019 reported that mulching the soil with plastic film can not only maintain high soil moisture and soil temperature but also reduce weeds so as to promote crop growth and yields ridge furrow with plastic film mulch not only has advantages of plastic film but also diverts rainfall into the furrows and reduces n loss gan et al 2013 fang et al 2021a it is well known that agronomic practices directly affect soil properties then regulate crop growth and increase yield previous studies mainly concentrated on the effect of agronomic practices on soil water crop growth and yield of winter wheat ali et al 2018 liu et al 2020 although ali et al 2018 reported a positive relationship between photosynthetic parameters and soil water content dry matter translocation and yield and liu et al 2020 reported that chlorophyll content in the upper leaves was highly positively correlated with yield how ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and n application regulate source sink relationship through the soil properties to increase winter wheat yield is still unknown therefore a field trial with ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and n fertilization was conducted on winter wheat to explore 1 the effect of the above practices on winter wheat production and 2 how the above practices regulate the source sink relationship through the soil properties to increase yield and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field trials were carried out over two growing seasons of winter wheat 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 at the shaanxi experimental center of water saving irrigation 34 18 n 108 24 e and 521 m a s l china this site with a subhumid drought prone climate is classified as a typical dryland farming area in northwest china table 1 shows the weather data and topsoil properties at the trial site the daily weather data during the winter wheat season was measured by a weather station yangling national meteorological observing station near the experimental field 2 2 experimental design the field trial was designed with two planting patterns flat planting without mulching fp and ridge furrow with plastic film mulch over the ridge rp as the main plots and four n rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 denoted as n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively as sub plots each treatment was three replicates and each plot was 7 2 m 4 0 m 28 8 m2 details about the planting were displayed in fig 1 the plastic film which was colorless wide of 1 0 m and thick of 0 008 mm was manufactured by yangling ruifeng environmental protection technology co ltd yangling shaanxi china after farming the ridges were formed and covered with the plastic film then nitrogen fertilizer urea total n 46 4 phosphate fertilizer p2o5 16 at 120 kg ha 1 and potash fertilizer k2o 51 at 60 kg ha 1 were applied by broadcasting as a basal dressing to each plot and raked into the soil manually the wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 with a sowing rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 was sown on october 10 2018 and october 19 2019 and harvested on june 3 2019 and june 1 2020 for each season respectively there was no supplementary irrigation and topdressing weeds and diseases were controlled as the normal field 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 process of grain filling during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons 70 representative single stems with the same anthesis date about april 19 were tagged in each plot beginning 6 days post anthesis ten spikes per plot were collected from tagged stems every 6 days seven times in total between anthesis and harvest after each collection the spikes were immediately brought back to the laboratory and their grains were manually and carefully stripped from the chaff the fresh grains were thoroughly mixed and then 100 grains were counted from the three replicates to measure the grain size volume per 100 grain using 95 ethanol density 0 81 g cm 3 and the drainage method martinez carrasco and thorne 1979 the ethanol on the 100 grains was washed off using water the grains were firstly dried for 0 5 h at 105 c then dried at 75 c to a stable weight the dry grains were weighed on an electronic scale 1 10 000 g and then converted into 1000 grain weights the flag leaves on the same stems were selected to determine the chlorophyll a and b content the chlorophyll content was quantified by spectrophotometry after extracting fresh and chopped leaf

in the 0 20 cm layer during the 2019 2020 season the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption in each soil layer increased as the n rate rose fig 4 the low n level n1 significantly increased the net content of soil mineral n at anthesis and harvest and soil mineral n consumption by 171 3 64 5 and 15 0 on average in the rp 0 40 cm soil layer and by 206 1 45 9 and 16 8 in the fp 0

translocation and assimilation the chlorophyll content showed an up and down trend in the 2018 2019 season while chlorophyll content decreased with post anthesis days in the 2019 2020 season especially at the n0 and n1 levels fig 5 in general the rp significantly increased chlorophyll content by an average of 17 2 19 8 10 6 and 9 5 at the n0 n1 n2 and n3 levels during the two seasons respectively compared with the fp nitrogen application also significantly increased chlorophyll content by 4 4 153 8 and 5 7 110 0 at the n1 level by 12 7 465 3 and 22 2 475 5 at the n2 level and by

respectively compared with fp table 4 however the rp significantly decreased the cra by 22 8 47 9 compared with fp nitrogen application significantly decreased the cro and cr by 13 0 30 6 and 6 8 29 2 in the rp and by 12 1 49 3 and 11 1 43 2 in the fp respectively compared with n0 however n application significantly increased cra by 74 1 443 3 in the rp and by 91 0 321 1 in the fp compared with n0 during the two growing seasons furthermore n application significantly increased tro by 5 7 at the n2 level and by 5 4 at the n3 level in the rp whereas it significantly decreased tro by 9 7 at the n1 level in the rp and by 5 5 12 7 in the fp during the 2019 2020 season 3 5 grain filling parameters the grain filling process for winter wheat fitted by the richards model showed that the grain filling dynamic for winter wheat was a trend of gradual growing fast growing and slow growing under the different treatments fig 6 the coefficients of determination for the fitting model were all above 0 98 indicating that the richards model could successfully fit the grain filling dynamics table 5 the fitting value of a increased as the n rate rose and was higher in rp than in fp at the same n level in general the rp increased the r o by 0 6 8 2 at most n application rates compared with the fp the only exception was the n3 level where the rp decreased r o by an average of 4 3 table 6 in contrast to r o the rp decreased the t max by 0 2 3 3 compared to the fp at the n0 n1 and n2 levels whereas it increased t max by 0 7 on average at the n3 level furthermore the rp increased the v max v w max and d by 0 8 10 7 1 3 11 6 2 4 11 2 and 1 7 3 0 respectively compared with fp n application decreased r o on average by 7 5 and 1 0 at the n1 level by 8 3 and 2 2 at the n2 level and by 12 1 and 1 3 at the n3 level in the rp and fp respectively compared with n0 table 6 nitrogen application to the rp increased v max and v by 4 1 7 2 and 4 0 6 4 in the 2018 2019 season but which was decreased by 2 9 4 7 and 3 0 4 1 in the 2019 2020 season respectively compared with n0 furthermore n application to the fp generally increased v max and v by 0 9 11 7 and 2 3 12 7 during the two seasons respectively compared with n0 the only exception was the n3 level in the 2019 2020 season nitrogen application also increased t max w max and d compared with n0 by an average of 9 9 8 3 and 7 5 rp and 11 2 10 7 and 5 6 fp at the n1 level 13 8 11 9 and 13 9 rp and 15 4 14 8 and 11 3 fp at the n2 level and by 15 0 14 3 and 11 9 rp and 13 6 11 9 and 9 5 fp at the n3 level respectively planting pattern and n application also significantly affected the grain volume after 30 days post anthesis fig 7 the rp significantly increased grain volume from 30 to 42 days post anthesis by an average of 5 2 at the n0 level 5 4 at the n1 level 9 5 at the n2 level and 10 1 at the n3 level compared to the fp furthermore n application significantly increased grain volume from 30 to 42 days post anthesis by an average of 11 8 and 11 5 at the n1 level 29 7 and 24 5 at the n2 level and 36 5 and 30 4 at the n3 level in the rp and fp respectively 3 6 path analysis of yield in this study wue was linearly correlated with yield s1 therefore we just analyzed the ways of yield increasing the pca of soil properties and plant growth was first conducted due to plastic film mulching and n application directly affected soil properties the results showed that the cumulative variance of contributions reached 81 47 pc1 explained 50 73 and pc2 explained 30 74 fig 8 the farther away the indicators are from the center the greater their role is and the closer the indicators are the greater the correlation is therefore soil water storage at the anthesis milk and dough stages and soil temperature at the milk stage mainly affected grain volume at 6 days post anthesis gv1 and r o nevertheless the net soil mineral n contents at anthesis and harvest mainly affected leaf area and leaf dry matter at the anthesis stage la1 and dml1 respectively and the milk stage la2 dml2 chlorophyll content at 18 days chl2 cra grain volume at 30 days gv2 and 42 days gv3 post anthesis t max and d chlorophyll content at 30 days post anthesis chl3 was excluded because chlorophyll content was decreased from 24 days chl2 to 30 days chl3 post anthesis fig 5 and 1000 grain weight fig 6 and grain volume fig 7 increased slowly after 30 days post anthesis the pca results were used to analyze the relationships between the grain yield and indexes of plant growth s2 the gv3 results were excluded because the correlations between yield and gv3 and gv2 were very close in addition the gv3 value was close to the final grain volume and was no longer affected by the soil properties then a path analysis was conducted to explore how plant growth affected yield the path analysis results showed that la1 decision coefficient 32 71 dml1 33 85 chl2 33 28 t max 23 5 grain number 26 32 and spike number 50 25 were positive factors while la2 41 44 dml2 42 02 gv2 47 02 and cra 133 36 were negative factors for yield decision table 7 the indexes with a negative decision coefficient were the limiting factors for yield furthermore both la1 and la2 positively affected yield through dml1 indirect path coefficient 0 30 and 0 34 respectively and spike number 0 31 and 0 48 respectively but negatively affected yield through cra 0 38 and 0 45 the dml1 and spike number mainly directly and positively affected yield direct path coefficients were 0 67 and 0 93 respectively while dml2 chl2 and gv2 mainly positively affected yield through dml1 indirect path coefficients were 0 67 0 56 and 0 50 respectively the t max indirect path coefficient 0 47 and grain number 0 37 also mainly negatively affected yield through the cra indirect path coefficients were 0 47 and 0 37 4 discussion 4 1 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on soil properties mulching the soil with the film hindered the water exchange between the air and soil gan et al 2013 and ridge furrow planting helps collect rainwater therefore ridge furrow combined with film mulching over the ridges should further improve soil moisture zhou et al 2015 in our study when the amount of n fertilization was lower than n3 sws was significantly higher and et was lower in rp than in fp especially in the drought season 2019 2020 indicating that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching increased and maintained soil moisture this agreed with the findings reported by fang et al 2021b however compared with no n application n application significantly decreased sws but increased et indicating that n application increased soil water consumption wang et al 2019 furthermore whether et was higher or not in rp than in fp wue was lower in rp than in fp we also found that the wue was linearly correlated with yield fig 9 which agreed with the result reported by hu et al 2020 so the result may be caused by a lower grain yield in rp than in fp table 2 mulching the soil with the plastic film also reduced the exchange of heat between the air and soil gan et al 2013 studies have shown that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching improved soil temperature in the early growing season because of a small canopy zhou et al 2009 fang et al 2021a in the study the soil temperature was also significantly higher in rp than in fp except at n3 at anthesis milk and dough stages of the 2018 2019 season while the soil temperature was only significantly higher in the rp at the n1 level in the 2019 2020 season the reasons for this may be that 1 the larger canopy reduced the surface area of the soil that received solar energy and 2 a rainfall event 59 2 mm that occurred during the grain filling period in 2019 2020 fig 2 caused higher soil moisture than the same period in 2018 2019 table 3 in contrast to ridge furrow with film mulching n application generally significantly decreased soil temperature compared with no n application and this was probably due to the larger canopy table 4 the urea applied to the soil was decomposed into mineral n by urease and soil mineral n is directly absorbed by crop roots herrera et al 2013 studies reported that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching could maintain a higher content of soil mineral n he et al 2018 and promote crops to absorb soil mineral n gan et al 2013 our study produced a similar result however during the 2019 2020 season the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption at the n2 and n3 levels in the 40 60 cm soil layer were significantly lower in the rp than in the fp at anthesis but the reverse was true in the 0 20 cm soil layer at harvest this may be because that less rainfall before anthesis fig 2 made soil mineral n mainly concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer but relatively heavy rainfall at the grain filling stage caused soil mineral n to migrate to the deep soil chen et al 2020 nitrogen application increased the net soil mineral n content and soil mineral n consumption compared with no n which was consistent with wang et al 2019 furthermore the low n application rate n1 increased the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption within the 40 cm and 20 cm soil layers in the rp and fp respectively while high n applications n2 and n3 increased the net content of soil mineral n and soil mineral n consumption within the whole 0 60 cm layer in both treatments this is because ridge furrow with film mulching collected rainfall and moved water upward due to the increase of soil temperature fig 3 compared with flat planting with non mulching 4 2 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on plant growth and dry matter translocation the source a strong source with sufficient reserves formation translocation remobilization and partitioning of assimilate is necessary for grain filling and high yield formation camargo et al 2016 chlorophyll is the most important pigment for light harvesting and photosynthesis in plants leaf area and chlorophyll content directly affect the synthesis of leaf assimilate and transportation during the stage of grain filling xu et al 2019 this study showed that both leaf area and chlorophyll content significantly increased by ridge furrow with film mulching and n application this agreed with previous studies gan et al 2013 however the chlorophyll content showed a different trend in the two seasons fig 5 this was due to less rainfall fig 2 and higher soil temperature fig 3 later in the grain filling stage of the 2019 2020 season the accumulation and transport of dry matter during the grain filling stage have important effects on grain yield ercoli et al 2008 studies have shown that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching increase the accumulation of dry matter fang et al 2021a and that combined with 350 mm irrigation rate greatly improved dry matter translocation translocation efficiency and pre flowering assimilate translocation to grain compared with flat planting with non mulching ali et al 2018 in the study the rp significantly increased tro cro and cr but significantly decreased cra compared with fp indicating that the ridge furrow with film mulching pattern promoted dry matter synthesis and transfer from vegetative organs to reproductive organs it has been shown that n application increased dry matter accumulation masoni et al 2007 but decreased the transport of dry matter sieling et al 2016 in this study n application significantly decreased cro and cr but increased cra in the rp and fp compared with n0 this is because the n application promoted plant growth and lengthened the growth period tables 4 and 6 4 3 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on grain filling the sink sink strength is determined by the number and potential size of grains per stem depending on the capacity of plants to actively obtain reserve and accumulate photosynthetic assimilates lv et al 2020 therefore this study explored the grain development under plastic film mulching and n application the richards model has been well applied to crop growth yang et al 2006 fang et al 2020 and the model parameter n reflects the shape of the fitting curve and limitation to grain storage capacity in our study the richards model strongly fitted the grain filling dynamic and parameter n was always greater than 1 0 which meant that the fitting curves for grain filling were all right biased and less limited by grain storage capacity this may be because the n fertilizer in this study was all applied as a basal application which increased n losses and limited the later growth of winter wheat zhu and chen 2002 in our study ridge furrow with film mulching and n application did not change the grain filling trend of slow fast slow but did change the grain filling parameters which was consistent with previous studies meng et al 2010 yan et al 2019 the r o represents the growth potential of the pollinated ovary and the larger the value the earlier the initial development of the pollinated ovary yao et al 2011 however it is not clear how the ridge furrow with film mulching pattern affects grain filling by winter wheat our study showed that the rp increased r o except for the n3 level v max v w max and d but decreased t max furthermore n application increased w max d and t max but decreased r o in the rp and fp compared with n0 this was agreed with yan et al 2019 nitrogen application also increased the v max and v of the fp in both seasons but only increased v max and v in the rp during the 2018 2019 season compared with n0 this may be due to the lower rainfall during the early stage of grain filling the results showed that ridge furrow with film mulching and n application promoted grain development and filling in winter wheat gan et al 2013 yan et al 2019 therefore grain volume after 30 days post anthesis significantly increased the difference was that under the condition of less rainfall the ridge furrow with film mulching pattern could shorten the growth period ali et al 2019 whereas n application had the opposite effect demotes mainard and jeuffroy 2001 4 4 effect of plastic film mulching and n application on grain yield and its components the sink regarding the increase in population and limited land available it is very important to improve the yield of winter wheat studies showed that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching over ridges increased the yield components of winter wheat hu et al 2020 but whether it can always increase grain yield is controversial he et al 2018 fang et al 2021a fu et al 2021 in our study the grain number and 1000 grain weight at the same n level were significantly higher in rp than in fp this agreed with the previous studies fang et al 2021a gu et al 2021 however the yield and spike number under n application were significantly lower in rp than in fp this is because the ridge furrow planting pattern reduced the planting area compared with flat planting under the same sowing rate fig 1 thus increasing the plant density which led to a decrease in effective tillers and yield luo et al 2020 it indicated that the ridge furrow ratio and sowing rate effects on yield need further study furthermore n application both significantly increased yield and yield components for rp and fp but excessive n application weakened this effect this is consistent with luo et al 2019 4 5 potential pathway of source sink affecting yield the grain yield was considered as the balance between the source activity and sink strength zhang et al 2010a and this balance was influenced by environmental stresses brestic et al 2018 especially n availability ning et al 2018 studies showed that ridge furrow with film mulching and n application could improve winter wheat yield wang et al 2019 in addition n application provides nitrogen the nutrient most needed by winter wheat to promote growth li et al 2009 however the path by which the above mentioned agronomic practices regulate crop growth through the soil to increase winter wheat yield is unknown in this study a principal component analysis correlation analysis and path analysis were carried out to explore the influence mechanism underlying the ridge furrow film mulching and n application effects from soil to plant and then to yield the results of pca showed that high soil water storage at the anthesis milk and dough stages and soil temperature at the milk stage mainly increased the source and establishment of the initial reservoir in line with previous studies fan et al 2015 cui et al 2015 while the soil mineral n mainly optimized the source sink balance in the middle and late period supported by zhang et al 2010b the results of path analysis showed that leaf area and leaf dry matter at anthesis chlorophyll content at 18 days post anthesis grain number and especially spike number played decisive roles in increasing yield this was consistent with previous studies sieling et al 2016 kitonyo et al 2018 rivera amado et al 2019 xu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however the leaf area and leaf dry matter at the milk stage grain volume at 30 days post anthesis and especially cra were the main limiting factors this was supported by previous studies muñoz and calderini 2015 nehe et al 2020 controlling limiting factors such as delaying leaf senescence promoting the synthesis and transport of assimilates to grains and increasing grain volume will help to further improve yield therefore ridge furrow with plastic film mulching combined with 180 kg n ha 1 could balance the relationship between source and sink to achieve a high yield and wue 5 conclusions the rp significantly increased sws soil temperature except for milk and dough stages during the 2019 2020 season and net content and consumption of soil mineral n but reduced et during the growth stages total et in 2019 2020 and wue in 2018 2019 except for n0 compared with the fp nitrogen application significantly decreased sws and soil temperature but increased net content and consumption of soil mineral n et and wue compared with n0 soil water storage and soil temperature mainly affected cr cro grain volume at 6 days post anthesis et from the milk to dough stage chlorophyll content at 6 days post anthesis and r o the net soil mineral n content mainly affected leaf area and leaf dry matter at the anthesis and milk stages et from the anthesis to milk stage chlorophyll content at 18 and 30 days post anthesis tro cra grain volume at 30 and 42 days post anthesis and all the grain filling parameters except r o leaf area and leaf dry matter at anthesis chlorophyll content at 18 days post anthesis grain number and especially spike number played a decisive role in increasing yield while leaf area and leaf dry matter at the milk stage grain volume at 30 days post anthesis and especially cra were the main limiting factors finally n application significantly increased yield but the yield was lower in rp than in fp this study

9523,soil moisture of maize has an extremely important impact on the growth and development of maize failure to accurately estimate soil moisture will lead to severe reductions in maize yields and thus intensify the global food crisis so it is extremely important to accurately estimate soil moisture of maize this study proposes a new hybrid machine learning model svm swoa that incorporates the whale optimization algorithm woa into sinusoidal chaotic graphs and couples it with a support vector machine svm the model is with both high convergence speed and high accuracy after using the data from two maize agricultural districts in iowa usa for model creation taylor plots and significance tests were used to enable the model for identifying input variables to verify the performance of the

sm regulates the interaction processes between land surface and atmosphere influences climate and weather processes jung et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2010 mittelbach et al 2012 massari et al 2013 and significantly impacts water and energy exchange along the soil plant atmosphere continuum bogena et al 2013 changes in temperature precipitation and other climatic factors led directly to sm changes on the other hand sm is the basis of vegetation growth it impacts soil carbon uptake by reducing the gross primary product through ecosystem water deficits farmer et al 2010 humphrey et al 2018 sm is also critical in agricultural production crop growth and development are dependent on moisture and soil moisture content in the root zone directly affects crop quality and yield maize is an important food crop in the world in 2021 the u s produced more than 410 million tons of maize which is the most in the world however maize irrigation is interfered with by various growth stages weather conditions soil moisture content and other factors that limit maize s access to adequate water at each stage of growth narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 which has seriously caused the decline in maize yield moraru and rusu 2012 therefore an accurate estimation of soil moisture has become particularly important 1 2 machine learning models machine learning has been widely used to estimate various aspects of water usage and decision making in agriculture table 1 zaman and mckee 2014 constructed a model to estimate sm status based on current sm and soil temperature conditions using multivariate correlation vector machines khedri et al 2017 concluded that the costly and challenging nature of calculating sm over vast lands and the spatial and local variability was not feasible for simple moisture calculation approaches thus they proposed a support vector regression svr model for estimating sm nie et al 2018 studied the estimation of sm in winter wheat using three models support vector machine svm random forest rf and backpropagation neural network bpnn their results showed that svm was the best one among the three methods prakash et al 2018 estimated sm for one two and seven days using three machine learning methods it shows that machine learning models are effective for time series forecasting pekel 2020 improved estimation by adding multiple parameters to a decision tree model carranza et al 2021 used a machine learning model i e random forest for estimating root zone soil moisture rzsm demonstrating that machine learning models are feasible and effective for sm estimation zhu et al 2021 combined an svm with a dual integrated kalman filter i e enkf technique svm enkf and they compared it with the potential capability of svm to improve the efficiency of sm estimation many researches have been done to optimize models to obtain more accurate results in recent years it has been found that the estimation accuracy of model can be improved to a great extent by applying metaheuristic algorithms hopper and turton 2001 meta heuristic optimization algorithms were also combined with machine learning models to improve the accuracy of the models niu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 le thi et al 2019 fan et al 2020 and it has been demonstrated in several areas of agricultural water management such as estimating reference evapotranspiration mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 chia et al 2021 yan et al 2021a zheng et al 2021 although the heuristic approach can better obtain a global solution it still has many limitations for example wolpert and macready 1997 proposed the no free lunch nfl theorem which establish that for any algorithm any improved performance on one class of problems is offset by the performance on another type of problem a further research has focused on adding chaotic theory to metaheuristic algorithms to improve performance and accuracy yang et al 2007 chaotic mappings have been widely recognized in optimization helping optimization algorithms to search more powerfully over a comprehensive range yang et al 2007 in these metaheuristic algorithms with a stochastic component the performance of randomness is almost always reflected by probability khedri et al 2017 therefore substituting randomness using chaotic graphs is feasible and meaningful jiang et al 2019 please see appendix table s3 for commonly used chaotic graphs 1 3 research objectives this study is to develop a more accurate and tunable hybrid data intelligence model svm swoa that can simultaneously develop smooth estimates of upper and lower soil moisture few studies have applied hybrid machine learning models in agricultural water monitoring and assessment and their performance has never been discussed especially in sm estimation therefore the aims of the study are to 1 to develop a hybrid svm swoa model to investigate the performance in sm estimation 2 to investigate the influence of meteorological parameters on sm and to investigate the main input variables of sm estimation models 3 to explore the variation in estimation accuracy of sm at different depths and 4 to investigate the estimation capability of sm by time series estimation and to investigate the variability of sm multi day estimation accuracy 2 methods and materials 2 1 methods 2 1 1 svm model support vector machine svm is a supervised machine learning algorithm developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 to solve both classification and regression challenges svm maps a nonlinear functional relationship into a high dimensional linear space convert it into a linear problem in the space and then seek the optimal regression hyperplane in this space all samples are at the minimum distance from this optimal hyperplane the hyperplane is 1 f x w t φ x i b where w and x are both n dimensional column vectors b is the offset top and φ x i is the nonlinear mapping function zhou et al 2012 kaytez et al 2015 the optimization equation of the support vector regression model is determined by introducing the objective function 2 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i where c is a constant ξ i is the relaxation factor for more information on the svm algorithm please see cortes and vapnik 1995 2 1 2 svm swoa hybrid model mirjalili introduced the whale optimization algorithm woa in 2016 mirjalili and lewis 2016 whales are carnivores and their favorite foods are krill and small fish this is where the woa algorithm observes their unique feeding style an unusual foraging behavior known as bubble net foraging three mathematical models were created by incorporating three components encirclement of prey bubble net attack and prey search yan et al 2021b humpback whales encircle preys and update their position towards the best search agent with increasing iterations this behavior is mathematically formulated as mirjalili and lewis 2016 3 d c x l t x t x t 1 x l t a d where a and c are the coefficient vectors t indicates the current iteration x l is the position vector of the best solution obtained so far x is the position vector is the absolute value and is an element wise multiplication a and c are calculated as 4 a 2 a r a c 2 r where a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations in both exploration and exploitation phases and r is a random vector in 0 1 the first method uses a shrink wrapping mechanism to set random values that define a new position between the original and optimal position of the search zhang and wen 2021 it is described as 5 x t 1 d e bl cos 2 π l x l t where b is a constant coefficient and l is a random vector between 0 1 shrinkage bracketing and spiral position updating are performed simultaneously we assumed a 50 probability of choosing between the shrinking envelope method or the spiral model to update the whale s position the simulated whale swims around its prey in a gradually shrinking circle with a spiral pattern which is described as 6 x t 1 x l t a d if p 0 5 d e bl cos 2 π l x l t if p 0 5 the contraction envelope and spiral position update are performed simultaneously with contraction according to p and spiral wandering according to 1 p where p 0 1 during the prey search phase the whale moves toward the optimal local individual with its position and the movement enhances global searchability this process can be described as 7 d c x rand x t x t 1 x rand a d where x rand is a vector of random locations found from the current population by selecting the best whale among the populations from which the whales swim away for more information on the svm algorithm please see mirjalili and lewis 2016 research in recent years has shown that the quality of the initial population affects the solution accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm and the initial population with better diversity is very helpful to improving the performance of the algorithm however the woa algorithm usually uses a random method to generate the initial population when solving the optimization problem which may distribute the initial population unevenly resulting in poor initial population diversity in addition as there is no prior knowledge of the global optimal solution of the optimization problem the population should be distributed as evenly as possible in the search space in order to enhance the diversity of the population and improve the efficiency of solving and to diversify the global search of the algorithm the proposed swoa algorithm in this study adopts the chaotic learning initialization strategy firstly the randomness ergodicity and regularity of chaotic variables are used to generate a chaotic initial population with good diversity secondly by sorting and selecting both the initial chaotic population and its reverse population the solution with better fitted value is used as the initial population to improve the solution efficiency which can greatly improve the woa algorithm commonly used chaotic maps are shown in the appendix table s3 the mathematical model of swoa is 8 p k 1 a p k 2 sin π p k p 0 0 1 0 a 4 where k is number of iterations and a is the description parameter within 0 a 4 the swoa based on eq 8 decides whether to choose spiral travel or contraction loop travel if p k 1 0 5 then spiral travel is performed otherwise the wrap around travel is performed this development has improved the ability to manage the choice of the whale position update spiral swim approach the algorithm is further enhanced for iterative optimization to find global variables the flow chart of the improved optimization method is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 experimental parameter setting based on the principle of experimental fairness the comparison of experiments should be performed under the same parameters in table 3 are shown the initial parameter settings for svm and woa model among them the penalty parameter c of the svm and the coefficient gamma of the kernel function will be optimized by the woa algorithm 2 1 4 performance evaluation metrics a comprehensive and robust assessment is necessary so five evaluation metrics were selected they are mae rmse mape and mbe mae 1 m i 1 m y i y ˆ i rmse 1 m i 1 m y i y ˆ i 2 mape 100 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i y i mbe 1 n i 1 n y i y i r 2 1 i y i ˆ y i 2 i y i y i 2 where y i is the true value and y ˆ i is the estimated value 2 2 study area the station data in this study were collected from iowa usa the state of iowa is located in the midwest region of the united states geographically situated at latitude of 40 36 n to 43 30 n and longitude of 89 5 w to 96 31 w with a width of 320 km and a length of 500 km the state covers an area of 145 743 km2 consisting of 144 701 km2 land and 1042 km2 water its highest elevation is 509 m and the lowest one is 146 m iowa is known as the breadbasket of america because of its fertile soil and rich agricultural products its climate is temperate continental with cold winters and hot summers its average annual precipitation is 711 mm in the northwest and 864 mm in the south iowa is a large agricultural region with 96 of the state s arable land its main agricultural products are maize and soybeans with maize production ranking among the 50 states and the state ranking first in terms of sm concern see appendix fig s1 in fig 2 are shown the site distribution locations that a indicate the location in iowa b indicate the location of sites nashua northeast isu rdf and newell allee isu rdf and c indicate the instrument for data acquisition to study sm at different depths in the maize root zone the data from both stations were collected from the maize growing area 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 data collection station data for this study were collected daily from 2013 to 2020 data from two stations i e the nashua northeast isu rdf station and the newell allee isu rdf station were used see appendix table s1 including basic station information and information on the 22 parameters table 2 it was found that combining station data with remotely sensed climate data would improve model performance thus this study used the modis dataset extracted at daily temporal resolution gldas 2 0 the data were extracted and analyzed by google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 the integration of both data can increase the model s estimation accuracy in this study 2 3 2 data processing this study carried out data processing and analysis on both the collected station data and remote sensing data see appendix table s2 there are four cases of the data m the data is missing e an instrument may be flagged until repaired r estimated based on weighted linear regression from surrounding stations and e we are not confident of the estimate divya and babu 2016 hu et al 2017 m and e can lead to missing values in continuous data and r and e can lead to outliers therefore the missing values and outliers were treated in this study an r package named missforest is used to handle missing values stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 missforest is a machine learning based data interpolation algorithm based on the random forest algorithm it was found that missforest outperforms other algorithms by more than 50 in some cases stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 missforest interpolates missing values by looking at each variable and then introducing iterations of the random forest until a stop condition is satisfied the method to calculate for continuous variables is 9 δ n j n x new imp x old imp 2 j n x new imp 2 where x true is the complete data matrix and x imp the imputed data matrix the data from both sites were used for model training evaluation and testing randomly selected 70 of the data were used for model training and the rest 30 are for testing in addition the normalization of the data can improve the estimation accuracy and fitting speed of the model ogasawara et al 2010 all models were compared by using their best values through ten fold cross validation accordingly the min max normalization method was used for each feature variable i e 10 x norm x 0 x min x max x min where x norm is normalized x 0 is a real number x min is the minimum value and x max is the maximum value 3 results 3 1 feature selection the study integrates the correlation between the characteristic variables in the dataset and soil moisture and results are shown in fig 3 the three indicators of correlation coefficient central root mean square error and standard deviation between the variables were analyzed unitedly through taylor diagrams taylor 2001 moreover significance test results were added into the taylor diagram the results show that among the 19 variables the central root mean square error and standard deviation remain low with the central root mean square error ranging between 0 2 and 0 4 and the standard deviation between 0 and 10 in terms of correlation coefficients climatic temperatures showed the lowest correlations high and low were between 10 and 20 the correlations for the soil temperature at different depths overlapped only three of nine variables soil30t soil60t soil120t were selected for model training showing 120 cm greater than 60 cm greater than 30 cm with correlation coefficients between 20 and 30 the correlations for relative humidity showed variable performance exhibiting jumps in distribution four variables i e gdd50 solar gust sped had high correlation with sm significant 30 so these variables were with better characteristics in modeling the precip variable showed the most robust correlation characteristics with correlations above 0 95 in the significance test rh and gust were not significant for sm thus these two variables should be discarded in the modeling the remaining variables were all less than 0 001 implying highly significant at the end 11 variables were selected to construct the machine learning model 3 2 model estimations in fig 4 are shown the fits between the estimated and actual values of the three models of svm svm woa and svm cwoa a shows the estimations of the three models at 30 cm soil depth b shows the estimations of the three models at 60 cm soil depth and c shows the estimations of the three models at 120 cm soil depth it was found that there were significant differences in the estimations of sm at different depths using the same method svm model performs well in estimating sm at 30 cm and 60 cm while at 120 cm svm shows an increased deviation meanwhile the fitting effects of svm woa and svm swoa for deeper soil layers did not decrease significantly this indicates that the heuristic algorithm is able to find the optimal solution in complex relationships thus significantly improving the fitting accuracy 3 3 model evaluation to further evaluate the performance of models in fig 5 are shown the scatter plots of the three models i e svm swoa svm swoa and svm when evaluating sm a indicates the fit of the three model models at 30 cm b indicates the fit of the three model models at 60 cm c represents the fit of the three model models at 120 cm results show that the r2 of svm swoa at different depths is higher than that of svm woa and svm in general the fitting performance of the models does not increase with the deeper soil layer but it shows the best results at 60 cm and the worst results at 120 cm four indicators i e mae rmse mape mbe were selected for a comprehensive evaluation of the model their results are presented in table 4 showing the comparison of the model s effectiveness at different soil layers at two stations at 60 cm sm has the smallest error followed by 30 cm and then 120 cm which coincides with the results in fig 5 at 30 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 12 rmse by 14 mape by 69 and mbe by 7 5 over svm woa model at 60 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 14 rmse by 13 mape by 41 5 and mbe by 14 over svm woa model at 120 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 37 rmse by 28 5 mape by 21 5 and mbe by 7 5 over svm woa model at 30 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 20 5 rmse by 25 5 mape by 79 5 and mbe by 19 5 over svm model at 60 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 20 rmse by 29 5 mape by 44 5 and mbe by 38 over svm model at 120 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 44 5 rmse by 31 5 mape by 32 and mbe by 14 5 over svm model it can be seen that the use of the heuristic algorithm swoa leads to the best performance of svm swoa in the comparisons with all metrics higher than svm woa and svm model a comprehensive diagnosis of the model prediction was performed see appendix fig s3 in particular in fig 6 are shown the results of residual analysis for the three models of svm swoa svm woa and svm a indicates the residual analysis of the model at 30 cm b indicates the residual analysis of the model at 60 cm and c indicates the residual analysis of the model at 120 cm the residuals of the three models are distributed around zero at different depths and most of them fluctuate in the range of 2 2 in contrast the residuals of svm swoa model are more concentrated around zero than those of svm woa and svm models indicating a smaller error it was also found that the residuals of svm swoa had fewer outliers implying a stronger the stability of the model as the depth increases their residuals show similar results to the fitted values with 60 cm being the best and 120 cm being the worst 3 4 time series forecasting time series forecasting of sm is critical to achieve precise agriculture and the effect of sm on maize growth and development is different at different depths therefore this leads to farmers inability to achieve precise irrigation based on sm variation in the maize root zone which inhibits high maize yields based on the time series analysis of sm variables see fig s4 in the appendix this study can estimate the time series of sm at different depths separately when finding the most suitable model for the study in table 5 the sm at different depths were forecasted for the next 1 2 and 7 days and the three models were evaluated by mae rmse mape mbe r2 it was found that the sm at 60 cm produced the best r2 svm swoa 0 9999 svm woa 0 9955 svm 0 9949 the proposed hybrid model svm swoa evaluated significantly better metrics than both svm woa and svm models for one day two day and seven day forecasts at different soil depths it suggests that the estimation accuracy of the models will decrease as forecast time increases different models have different rates of decline with longer forecast time and the same model will have different rates of decline with longer time at different depths 30 cm 60 cm 120 cm for example svm swoa model estimates a 0 021 and 1 16 change in r2 for sm at 30 cm over 1 2 days and 2 7 days respectively those varying results show that the forecast accuracy decreases slowly in 1 2 days and rapidly in 2 7 days it can be concluded that the decline in forecast accuracy is not fixed but accelerated as the forecast time increases 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of sm accuracy in different soil layers in this experiment the three sm layers of 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm were modelled separately and the accuracy of the results was ranked as 60 cm was higher than both 30 cm and 120 cm previous studies concluded that the deeper is the sm layer the easier it is to estimate than the shallower sm layer carranza et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 there are two reasons 1 60 cm is more excellent than 30 cm and 60 cm is in weaker soil hydrodynamics thus it is relatively easy to learn the pattern and machine learning models can find a more straightforward learning pattern to obtain the best results so the accuracy of estimating sm at 60 cm is higher 2 120 cm is the lowest reason 1 shows that the deeper is the soil the weaker the hydrodynamics is the smaller the fluctuations is and the higher the accuracy is however it is not the case in deeper soils and machine learning is severely limited with too much stability firstly the search for feature patterns becomes complicated it is more challenging to find the optimal solution for the data secondly the deeper is the soil the greater the error is for the data itself and the more difficult it is for the hardware facilities at the station to collect data as a result this ultimately leads to the highest accuracy at 60 cm and the lowest accuracy at 120 cm when estimating soil moisture 4 2 water requirements of maize at different periods of growth and development estimating and regulating water requirements at different periods of maize growth and development can better regulate the growth of maize denmead and shaw 1960 maize s lifetime water requirements follow the pattern of less in the early stages more in the middle stages and more in the late stages anderson and kemper 1964 garcia y garcia et al 2009 as the length of each fertility stage is influenced by plant growth ground cover and climate change water consumption varies from stage to stage and there is no precise date for the division of the fertility period of maize the total length of the nodes reaches 2 3 cm and the leafage index is around 30 g kllng 1991 grant and hesketh 1992 for this water demand characteristic of maize the model should be able to accurately identify the different growth periods of maize and thus adjust the parameters for estimation this is especially important to better achieve precise irrigation subsequent studies will focus on the estimation of water requirements during different periods of maize growth and development 4 3 integrated evaluation of svm swoa hybrid model soil moisture plays an essential role in the growth of maize and different depths of soil moisture play different roles in the growth and development of maize mackay and barber 1985 in today s society by applying modern precise irrigation techniques agricultural production can significantly reduce surface water loss and wastage alleviating agricultural water scarcity which is essential to promote sustainable development of irrigated agriculture kamienski et al 2019 from scientific research to applications in engineering practice data sets are often unusable when their dimensionality multiplies exponentially especially in high dimensions the searching space expands exponentially creating a curse of dimensionality köppen 2000 although woa algorithm has a good search accuracy and convergence speed but it inevitably has a lack of global exploration ability and easily falls into local optimals resulting in stagnation in the presence of a large data set the global capability of woa algorithm is limited in order to improve the algorithm this study incorporates chaotic mapping to comprehensively enhance the problems existing in woa algorithm in table 6 is shown that the algorithm performance is tested by selecting four standard test functions jamil and yang 2013 most of which have multiple local optima thus making it difficult to find the global optimal value thus they can fully tests the algorithm s ability to find the optimal value among the test functions f1 and f2 are single peaked functions which are mainly used to test the algorithm s optimization seeking accuracy and convergence f3 and f4 are multi peaked functions which are mainly used to test the algorithm s ability to jump out of local extremes and global exploration hussain et al 2017 ezugwu et al 2020 in table 7 are shown the comparisons of algorithm performance when solving a 1000 dimensional test function results show that swoa algorithm has the best optimization seeking effect and convergence speed in the high dimensional experiments and can converge to the global optimum stably see fig s5 in the appendix in the algorithm comparison between swoa and woa although swoa clearly outperforms woa it still has shortcomings in both finding optimal solutions and convergence speed for example in the high dimensional space swoa could still stop at local optima which greatly prolongs the computing time of the model in the process of global search although it is faster than woa s step by step dimensionality reduction search but it still lacks the ability to jump out of the cycle of exploration which is limited by the basic principles of woa algorithm when it is set up in addition multiple climate data are used in modeling process but deep soil 100 cm moisture is usually insensitive to the events such as daily evapotranspiration rainfall and wind speed li et al 2021 this also causes that the estimation of deep soil moisture by swoa is subject to large errors future research will 1 enhance the global exploration capability and convergence speed by improving the model algorithm 2 add more comprehensive feature variables to make the model with better generalization ability 3 enrich the amount of data to improve the stability of the algorithm in high dimensions 5 conclusion this study proposes a hybrid machine learning model that combines traditional svm algorithm with woa containing chaotic sinusoidal maps to generate a new hybrid machine learning model svm swoa the modeling was developed based on soil moisture data from a maize growing area in iowa usa in this study soil moisture was estimated at three soil layers i e 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm using multivariate climate data by comparing three models i e svm swoa svm woa and svm it was found that svm swoa achieved the best results in the estimation at all three different soil layers the estimation accuracy and convergence speed of the hybrid svm swoa model were better than those of both svm woa and svm in addition it was found that the estimation accuracy of sm did not keep improving with increasing soil depth this finding is a step of development and progress for the subsequent researches of sm estimation models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9523,soil moisture of maize has an extremely important impact on the growth and development of maize failure to accurately estimate soil moisture will lead to severe reductions in maize yields and thus intensify the global food crisis so it is extremely important to accurately estimate soil moisture of maize this study proposes a new hybrid machine learning model svm swoa that incorporates the whale optimization algorithm woa into sinusoidal chaotic graphs and couples it with a support vector machine svm the model is with both high convergence speed and high accuracy after using the data from two maize agricultural districts in iowa usa for model creation taylor plots and significance tests were used to enable the model for identifying input variables to verify the performance of the

sm regulates the interaction processes between land surface and atmosphere influences climate and weather processes jung et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2010 mittelbach et al 2012 massari et al 2013 and significantly impacts water and energy exchange along the soil plant atmosphere continuum bogena et al 2013 changes in temperature precipitation and other climatic factors led directly to sm changes on the other hand sm is the basis of vegetation growth it impacts soil carbon uptake by reducing the gross primary product through ecosystem water deficits farmer et al 2010 humphrey et al 2018 sm is also critical in agricultural production crop growth and development are dependent on moisture and soil moisture content in the root zone directly affects crop quality and yield maize is an important food crop in the world in 2021 the u s produced more than 410 million tons of maize which is the most in the world however maize irrigation is interfered with by various growth stages weather conditions soil moisture content and other factors that limit maize s access to adequate water at each stage of growth narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 which has seriously caused the decline in maize yield moraru and rusu 2012 therefore an accurate estimation of soil moisture has become particularly important 1 2 machine learning models machine learning has been widely used to estimate various aspects of water usage and decision making in agriculture table 1 zaman and mckee 2014 constructed a model to estimate sm status based on current sm and soil temperature conditions using multivariate correlation vector machines khedri et al 2017 concluded that the costly and challenging nature of calculating sm over vast lands and the spatial and local variability was not feasible for simple moisture calculation approaches thus they proposed a support vector regression svr model for estimating sm nie et al 2018 studied the estimation of sm in winter wheat using three models support vector machine svm random forest rf and backpropagation neural network bpnn their results showed that svm was the best one among the three methods prakash et al 2018 estimated sm for one two and seven days using three machine learning methods it shows that machine learning models are effective for time series forecasting pekel 2020 improved estimation by adding multiple parameters to a decision tree model carranza et al 2021 used a machine learning model i e random forest for estimating root zone soil moisture rzsm demonstrating that machine learning models are feasible and effective for sm estimation zhu et al 2021 combined an svm with a dual integrated kalman filter i e enkf technique svm enkf and they compared it with the potential capability of svm to improve the efficiency of sm estimation many researches have been done to optimize models to obtain more accurate results in recent years it has been found that the estimation accuracy of model can be improved to a great extent by applying metaheuristic algorithms hopper and turton 2001 meta heuristic optimization algorithms were also combined with machine learning models to improve the accuracy of the models niu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 le thi et al 2019 fan et al 2020 and it has been demonstrated in several areas of agricultural water management such as estimating reference evapotranspiration mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 chia et al 2021 yan et al 2021a zheng et al 2021 although the heuristic approach can better obtain a global solution it still has many limitations for example wolpert and macready 1997 proposed the no free lunch nfl theorem which establish that for any algorithm any improved performance on one class of problems is offset by the performance on another type of problem a further research has focused on adding chaotic theory to metaheuristic algorithms to improve performance and accuracy yang et al 2007 chaotic mappings have been widely recognized in optimization helping optimization algorithms to search more powerfully over a comprehensive range yang et al 2007 in these metaheuristic algorithms with a stochastic component the performance of randomness is almost always reflected by probability khedri et al 2017 therefore substituting randomness using chaotic graphs is feasible and meaningful jiang et al 2019 please see appendix table s3 for commonly used chaotic graphs 1 3 research objectives this study is to develop a more accurate and tunable hybrid data intelligence model svm swoa that can simultaneously develop smooth estimates of upper and lower soil moisture few studies have applied hybrid machine learning models in agricultural water monitoring and assessment and their performance has never been discussed especially in sm estimation therefore the aims of the study are to 1 to develop a hybrid svm swoa model to investigate the performance in sm estimation 2 to investigate the influence of meteorological parameters on sm and to investigate the main input variables of sm estimation models 3 to explore the variation in estimation accuracy of sm at different depths and 4 to investigate the estimation capability of sm by time series estimation and to investigate the variability of sm multi day estimation accuracy 2 methods and materials 2 1 methods 2 1 1 svm model support vector machine svm is a supervised machine learning algorithm developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 to solve both classification and regression challenges svm maps a nonlinear functional relationship into a high dimensional linear space convert it into a linear problem in the space and then seek the optimal regression hyperplane in this space all samples are at the minimum distance from this optimal hyperplane the hyperplane is 1 f x w t φ x i b where w and x are both n dimensional column vectors b is the offset top and φ x i is the nonlinear mapping function zhou et al 2012 kaytez et al 2015 the optimization equation of the support vector regression model is determined by introducing the objective function 2 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i where c is a constant ξ i is the relaxation factor for more information on the svm algorithm please see cortes and vapnik 1995 2 1 2 svm swoa hybrid model mirjalili introduced the whale optimization algorithm woa in 2016 mirjalili and lewis 2016 whales are carnivores and their favorite foods are krill and small fish this is where the woa algorithm observes their unique feeding style an unusual foraging behavior known as bubble net foraging three mathematical models were created by incorporating three components encirclement of prey bubble net attack and prey search yan et al 2021b humpback whales encircle preys and update their position towards the best search agent with increasing iterations this behavior is mathematically formulated as mirjalili and lewis 2016 3 d c x l t x t x t 1 x l t a d where a and c are the coefficient vectors t indicates the current iteration x l is the position vector of the best solution obtained so far x is the position vector is the absolute value and is an element wise multiplication a and c are calculated as 4 a 2 a r a c 2 r where a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations in both exploration and exploitation phases and r is a random vector in 0 1 the first method uses a shrink wrapping mechanism to set random values that define a new position between the original and optimal position of the search zhang and wen 2021 it is described as 5 x t 1 d e bl cos 2 π l x l t where b is a constant coefficient and l is a random vector between 0 1 shrinkage bracketing and spiral position updating are performed simultaneously we assumed a 50 probability of choosing between the shrinking envelope method or the spiral model to update the whale s position the simulated whale swims around its prey in a gradually shrinking circle with a spiral pattern which is described as 6 x t 1 x l t a d if p 0 5 d e bl cos 2 π l x l t if p 0 5 the contraction envelope and spiral position update are performed simultaneously with contraction according to p and spiral wandering according to 1 p where p 0 1 during the prey search phase the whale moves toward the optimal local individual with its position and the movement enhances global searchability this process can be described as 7 d c x rand x t x t 1 x rand a d where x rand is a vector of random locations found from the current population by selecting the best whale among the populations from which the whales swim away for more information on the svm algorithm please see mirjalili and lewis 2016 research in recent years has shown that the quality of the initial population affects the solution accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm and the initial population with better diversity is very helpful to improving the performance of the algorithm however the woa algorithm usually uses a random method to generate the initial population when solving the optimization problem which may distribute the initial population unevenly resulting in poor initial population diversity in addition as there is no prior knowledge of the global optimal solution of the optimization problem the population should be distributed as evenly as possible in the search space in order to enhance the diversity of the population and improve the efficiency of solving and to diversify the global search of the algorithm the proposed swoa algorithm in this study adopts the chaotic learning initialization strategy firstly the randomness ergodicity and regularity of chaotic variables are used to generate a chaotic initial population with good diversity secondly by sorting and selecting both the initial chaotic population and its reverse population the solution with better fitted value is used as the initial population to improve the solution efficiency which can greatly improve the woa algorithm commonly used chaotic maps are shown in the appendix table s3 the mathematical model of swoa is 8 p k 1 a p k 2 sin π p k p 0 0 1 0 a 4 where k is number of iterations and a is the description parameter within 0 a 4 the swoa based on eq 8 decides whether to choose spiral travel or contraction loop travel if p k 1 0 5 then spiral travel is performed otherwise the wrap around travel is performed this development has improved the ability to manage the choice of the whale position update spiral swim approach the algorithm is further enhanced for iterative optimization to find global variables the flow chart of the improved optimization method is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 experimental parameter setting based on the principle of experimental fairness the comparison of experiments should be performed under the same parameters in table 3 are shown the initial parameter settings for svm and woa model among them the penalty parameter c of the svm and the coefficient gamma of the kernel function will be optimized by the woa algorithm 2 1 4 performance evaluation metrics a comprehensive and robust assessment is necessary so five evaluation metrics were selected they are mae rmse mape and mbe mae 1 m i 1 m y i y ˆ i rmse 1 m i 1 m y i y ˆ i 2 mape 100 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i y i mbe 1 n i 1 n y i y i r 2 1 i y i ˆ y i 2 i y i y i 2 where y i is the true value and y ˆ i is the estimated value 2 2 study area the station data in this study were collected from iowa usa the state of iowa is located in the midwest region of the united states geographically situated at latitude of 40 36 n to 43 30 n and longitude of 89 5 w to 96 31 w with a width of 320 km and a length of 500 km the state covers an area of 145 743 km2 consisting of 144 701 km2 land and 1042 km2 water its highest elevation is 509 m and the lowest one is 146 m iowa is known as the breadbasket of america because of its fertile soil and rich agricultural products its climate is temperate continental with cold winters and hot summers its average annual precipitation is 711 mm in the northwest and 864 mm in the south iowa is a large agricultural region with 96 of the state s arable land its main agricultural products are maize and soybeans with maize production ranking among the 50 states and the state ranking first in terms of sm concern see appendix fig s1 in fig 2 are shown the site distribution locations that a indicate the location in iowa b indicate the location of sites nashua northeast isu rdf and newell allee isu rdf and c indicate the instrument for data acquisition to study sm at different depths in the maize root zone the data from both stations were collected from the maize growing area 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 data collection station data for this study were collected daily from 2013 to 2020 data from two stations i e the nashua northeast isu rdf station and the newell allee isu rdf station were used see appendix table s1 including basic station information and information on the 22 parameters table 2 it was found that combining station data with remotely sensed climate data would improve model performance thus this study used the modis dataset extracted at daily temporal resolution gldas 2 0 the data were extracted and analyzed by google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 the integration of both data can increase the model s estimation accuracy in this study 2 3 2 data processing this study carried out data processing and analysis on both the collected station data and remote sensing data see appendix table s2 there are four cases of the data m the data is missing e an instrument may be flagged until repaired r estimated based on weighted linear regression from surrounding stations and e we are not confident of the estimate divya and babu 2016 hu et al 2017 m and e can lead to missing values in continuous data and r and e can lead to outliers therefore the missing values and outliers were treated in this study an r package named missforest is used to handle missing values stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 missforest is a machine learning based data interpolation algorithm based on the random forest algorithm it was found that missforest outperforms other algorithms by more than 50 in some cases stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 missforest interpolates missing values by looking at each variable and then introducing iterations of the random forest until a stop condition is satisfied the method to calculate for continuous variables is 9 δ n j n x new imp x old imp 2 j n x new imp 2 where x true is the complete data matrix and x imp the imputed data matrix the data from both sites were used for model training evaluation and testing randomly selected 70 of the data were used for model training and the rest 30 are for testing in addition the normalization of the data can improve the estimation accuracy and fitting speed of the model ogasawara et al 2010 all models were compared by using their best values through ten fold cross validation accordingly the min max normalization method was used for each feature variable i e 10 x norm x 0 x min x max x min where x norm is normalized x 0 is a real number x min is the minimum value and x max is the maximum value 3 results 3 1 feature selection the study integrates the correlation between the characteristic variables in the dataset and soil moisture and results are shown in fig 3 the three indicators of correlation coefficient central root mean square error and standard deviation between the variables were analyzed unitedly through taylor diagrams taylor 2001 moreover significance test results were added into the taylor diagram the results show that among the 19 variables the central root mean square error and standard deviation remain low with the central root mean square error ranging between 0 2 and 0 4 and the standard deviation between 0 and 10 in terms of correlation coefficients climatic temperatures showed the lowest correlations high and low were between 10 and 20 the correlations for the soil temperature at different depths overlapped only three of nine variables soil30t soil60t soil120t were selected for model training showing 120 cm greater than 60 cm greater than 30 cm with correlation coefficients between 20 and 30 the correlations for relative humidity showed variable performance exhibiting jumps in distribution four variables i e gdd50 solar gust sped had high correlation with sm significant 30 so these variables were with better characteristics in modeling the precip variable showed the most robust correlation characteristics with correlations above 0 95 in the significance test rh and gust were not significant for sm thus these two variables should be discarded in the modeling the remaining variables were all less than 0 001 implying highly significant at the end 11 variables were selected to construct the machine learning model 3 2 model estimations in fig 4 are shown the fits between the estimated and actual values of the three models of svm svm woa and svm cwoa a shows the estimations of the three models at 30 cm soil depth b shows the estimations of the three models at 60 cm soil depth and c shows the estimations of the three models at 120 cm soil depth it was found that there were significant differences in the estimations of sm at different depths using the same method svm model performs well in estimating sm at 30 cm and 60 cm while at 120 cm svm shows an increased deviation meanwhile the fitting effects of svm woa and svm swoa for deeper soil layers did not decrease significantly this indicates that the heuristic algorithm is able to find the optimal solution in complex relationships thus significantly improving the fitting accuracy 3 3 model evaluation to further evaluate the performance of models in fig 5 are shown the scatter plots of the three models i e svm swoa svm swoa and svm when evaluating sm a indicates the fit of the three model models at 30 cm b indicates the fit of the three model models at 60 cm c represents the fit of the three model models at 120 cm results show that the r2 of svm swoa at different depths is higher than that of svm woa and svm in general the fitting performance of the models does not increase with the deeper soil layer but it shows the best results at 60 cm and the worst results at 120 cm four indicators i e mae rmse mape mbe were selected for a comprehensive evaluation of the model their results are presented in table 4 showing the comparison of the model s effectiveness at different soil layers at two stations at 60 cm sm has the smallest error followed by 30 cm and then 120 cm which coincides with the results in fig 5 at 30 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 12 rmse by 14 mape by 69 and mbe by 7 5 over svm woa model at 60 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 14 rmse by 13 mape by 41 5 and mbe by 14 over svm woa model at 120 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 37 rmse by 28 5 mape by 21 5 and mbe by 7 5 over svm woa model at 30 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 20 5 rmse by 25 5 mape by 79 5 and mbe by 19 5 over svm model at 60 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 20 rmse by 29 5 mape by 44 5 and mbe by 38 over svm model at 120 cm svm swoa model improved mae by 44 5 rmse by 31 5 mape by 32 and mbe by 14 5 over svm model it can be seen that the use of the heuristic algorithm swoa leads to the best performance of svm swoa in the comparisons with all metrics higher than svm woa and svm model a comprehensive diagnosis of the model prediction was performed see appendix fig s3 in particular in fig 6 are shown the results of residual analysis for the three models of svm swoa svm woa and svm a indicates the residual analysis of the model at 30 cm b indicates the residual analysis of the model at 60 cm and c indicates the residual analysis of the model at 120 cm the residuals of the three models are distributed around zero at different depths and most of them fluctuate in the range of 2 2 in contrast the residuals of svm swoa model are more concentrated around zero than those of svm woa and svm models indicating a smaller error it was also found that the residuals of svm swoa had fewer outliers implying a stronger the stability of the model as the depth increases their residuals show similar results to the fitted values with 60 cm being the best and 120 cm being the worst 3 4 time series forecasting time series forecasting of sm is critical to achieve precise agriculture and the effect of sm on maize growth and development is different at different depths therefore this leads to farmers inability to achieve precise irrigation based on sm variation in the maize root zone which inhibits high maize yields based on the time series analysis of sm variables see fig s4 in the appendix this study can estimate the time series of sm at different depths separately when finding the most suitable model for the study in table 5 the sm at different depths were forecasted for the next 1 2 and 7 days and the three models were evaluated by mae rmse mape mbe r2 it was found that the sm at 60 cm produced the best r2 svm swoa 0 9999 svm woa 0 9955 svm 0 9949 the proposed hybrid model svm swoa evaluated significantly better metrics than both svm woa and svm models for one day two day and seven day forecasts at different soil depths it suggests that the estimation accuracy of the models will decrease as forecast time increases different models have different rates of decline with longer forecast time and the same model will have different rates of decline with longer time at different depths 30 cm 60 cm 120 cm for example svm swoa model estimates a 0 021 and 1 16 change in r2 for sm at 30 cm over 1 2 days and 2 7 days respectively those varying results show that the forecast accuracy decreases slowly in 1 2 days and rapidly in 2 7 days it can be concluded that the decline in forecast accuracy is not fixed but accelerated as the forecast time increases 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of sm accuracy in different soil layers in this experiment the three sm layers of 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm were modelled separately and the accuracy of the results was ranked as 60 cm was higher than both 30 cm and 120 cm previous studies concluded that the deeper is the sm layer the easier it is to estimate than the shallower sm layer carranza et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 there are two reasons 1 60 cm is more excellent than 30 cm and 60 cm is in weaker soil hydrodynamics thus it is relatively easy to learn the pattern and machine learning models can find a more straightforward learning pattern to obtain the best results so the accuracy of estimating sm at 60 cm is higher 2 120 cm is the lowest reason 1 shows that the deeper is the soil the weaker the hydrodynamics is the smaller the fluctuations is and the higher the accuracy is however it is not the case in deeper soils and machine learning is severely limited with too much stability firstly the search for feature patterns becomes complicated it is more challenging to find the optimal solution for the data secondly the deeper is the soil the greater the error is for the data itself and the more difficult it is for the hardware facilities at the station to collect data as a result this ultimately leads to the highest accuracy at 60 cm and the lowest accuracy at 120 cm when estimating soil moisture 4 2 water requirements of maize at different periods of growth and development estimating and regulating water requirements at different periods of maize growth and development can better regulate the growth of maize denmead and shaw 1960 maize s lifetime water requirements follow the pattern of less in the early stages more in the middle stages and more in the late stages anderson and kemper 1964 garcia y garcia et al 2009 as the length of each fertility stage is influenced by plant growth ground cover and climate change water consumption varies from stage to stage and there is no precise date for the division of the fertility period of maize the total length of the nodes reaches 2 3 cm and the leafage index is around 30 g kllng 1991 grant and hesketh 1992 for this water demand characteristic of maize the model should be able to accurately identify the different growth periods of maize and thus adjust the parameters for estimation this is especially important to better achieve precise irrigation subsequent studies will focus on the estimation of water requirements during different periods of maize growth and development 4 3 integrated evaluation of svm swoa hybrid model soil moisture plays an essential role in the growth of maize and different depths of soil moisture play different roles in the growth and development of maize mackay and barber 1985 in today s society by applying modern precise irrigation techniques agricultural production can significantly reduce surface water loss and wastage alleviating agricultural water scarcity which is essential to promote sustainable development of irrigated agriculture kamienski et al 2019 from scientific research to applications in engineering practice data sets are often unusable when their dimensionality multiplies exponentially especially in high dimensions the searching space expands exponentially creating a curse of dimensionality köppen 2000 although woa algorithm has a good search accuracy and convergence speed but it inevitably has a lack of global exploration ability and easily falls into local optimals resulting in stagnation in the presence of a large data set the global capability of woa algorithm is limited in order to improve the algorithm this study incorporates chaotic mapping to comprehensively enhance the problems existing in woa algorithm in table 6 is shown that the algorithm performance is tested by selecting four standard test functions jamil and yang 2013 most of which have multiple local optima thus making it difficult to find the global optimal value thus they can fully tests the algorithm s ability to find the optimal value among the test functions f1 and f2 are single peaked functions which are mainly used to test the algorithm s optimization seeking accuracy and convergence f3 and f4 are multi peaked functions which are mainly used to test the algorithm s ability to jump out of local extremes and global exploration hussain et al 2017 ezugwu et al 2020 in table 7 are shown the comparisons of algorithm performance when solving a 1000 dimensional test function results show that swoa algorithm has the best optimization seeking effect and convergence speed in the high dimensional experiments and can converge to the global optimum stably see fig s5 in the appendix in the algorithm comparison between swoa and woa although swoa clearly outperforms woa it still has shortcomings in both finding optimal solutions and convergence speed for example in the high dimensional space swoa could still stop at local optima which greatly prolongs the computing time of the model in the process of global search although it is faster than woa s step by step dimensionality reduction search but it still lacks the ability to jump out of the cycle of exploration which is limited by the basic principles of woa algorithm when it is set up in addition multiple climate data are used in modeling process but deep soil 100 cm moisture is usually insensitive to the events such as daily evapotranspiration rainfall and wind speed li et al 2021 this also causes that the estimation of deep soil moisture by swoa is subject to large errors future research will 1 enhance the global exploration capability and convergence speed by improving the model algorithm 2 add more comprehensive feature variables to make the model with better generalization ability 3 enrich the amount of data to improve the stability of the algorithm in high dimensions 5 conclusion this study proposes a hybrid machine learning model that combines traditional svm algorithm with woa containing chaotic sinusoidal maps to generate a new hybrid machine learning model svm swoa the modeling was developed based on soil moisture data from a maize growing area in iowa usa in this study soil moisture was estimated at three soil layers i e 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm using multivariate climate data by comparing three models i e svm swoa svm woa and svm it was found that svm swoa achieved the best results in the estimation at all three different soil layers the estimation accuracy and convergence speed of the hybrid svm swoa model were better than those of both svm woa and svm in addition it was found that the estimation accuracy of sm did not keep improving with increasing soil depth this finding is a step of development and progress for the subsequent researches of sm estimation models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9524,increasing the saffron quantity and quality is essential and should be considered to achieve the desired performance in this regard to study the effect of nutrient and irrigation management on the quality and yield of saffron an experiment was carried out at the research station the ferdowsi university of mashhad iran in 2013 2015 the study was performed as a split split plot based on a randomized complete block design with 18 treatments experimental factors were 1 superabsorbent s a application and non application non s a 2 irrigation intervals every two three and four weeks and 3 nutrient management humic acid mycorrhiza glomus intraradices and control among all treatments the application of s a increased on average 61 fresh saffron flower and dry stigma yields in both growing seasons s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid were increased number of flower dry stigma yields 175 33 per m2 and 7 472 kg ha 1 respectively and water productivity of irrigation of saffron

intervals can significantly increase the quality and yield of saffron keywords crocin humic acid irrigation interval mycorrhiza superabsorbent 1 introduction saffron has economic social environmental and political roles in the agriculture of iran saffron has special importance among different plant species because of its particular ecological nests compared to other plants and their unique economic characteristics behdani and fallahi 2015 hasanzadeh aval 2015 studies have shown that iran is the largest saffron producer globally but the average stigma yield is relatively low compared with other producer countries the reasons for improving yields in many countries such as italy and spain can be proper nutrition bigger corms proper planting storing and harvesting hasanzadeh aval 2015 aghhavani shajari 2017 furthermore any factor that reduces the effects of environmental stresses and provides adequate nutritional needs of saffron can be considered a positive factor in reducing the yield gap for this plant behdani and fallahi 2015 therefore it is necessary to increase the saffron yield by improving agricultural management and conducting relevant research rezvani moghaddam et al 2014 since the most crucial factor determining the corm to start flowering is the corm s size therefore creating suitable environmental conditions is very important for obtaining a large sized corm and high stigma yield behdani and fallahi 2015 in this regard proper nutrition and irrigation management are essential to achieve bigger corm and improve saffron flowers quantitative and qualitative yield these days agricultural intensification due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides decreased the soil organic matter microbial activities and saffron crop yield aghhavani shajari 2012 despite the low fertilizer requirement of saffron some studies confirmed that about 16 80 of saffron flower yield changes depended on soil variables shahandeh 1989 therefore proper soil fertility management is a valuable solution for increasing soil organic matter strengthening microbial communities and ultimately improving plants quantitative and qualitative yield especially under drought stress using organic and biological fertilizers and benefiting from proper relationships with plant coexistence with soil microorganisms with proper management of soil fertility and plant nutrition the environment and biodiversity can be preserved and increased the efficiency of using agricultural inputs mostly irrigation water aghhavani shajari 2012 koocheki et al 2015 drought stress is one of the most critical crop production problems in arid and semi arid regions of the world yang et al 2006 high limitation of water resources and high water supply and transmission cost in some areas has caused the optimal irrigation level to be less than the amount of water required to produce maximum yield fallahi et al 2016a proper nutritional and irrigation management and planting of drought tolerant plants effectively increase water use efficiency fuladivanda et al 2000 safari et al 2013 low irrigation is one method for optimizing water consumption in arable lands in which the crop is irrigated lower than the water requirement behdani and fallahi 2015 this strategy can be done by reducing the volume of water in each irrigation increasing irrigation intervals stopping irrigation at a particular time of growth and eliminating the lowest efficiency irrigations if this irrigation method is implemented well it can increase water use efficiency without significantly reducing yield ghorbani nasrabad and hezar jaribi 2010 s a s use has a significant role in arid and semi arid areas to manage irrigation in the agricultural areas khorramdel et al 2013 fallahi et al 2016a superabsorbent polymers are hydrophilic networks that absorb and retain large amounts of water zohurianmehr and kabiri 2008 these polymers appropriately affect the penetration rate density soil structure soil compaction soil texture aggregate stability and evaporation rate abedikoupai and asadkazemi 2006 superabsorbents store 200 500 ml of water per gram of dry weight so that they increase absorption of water in their structure deharralde et al 1998 in this regard many studies have shown the positive effect of irrigation management and s a on the yield of saffron plant flowers azizi zohan et al 2006 khorramdel et al 2013 fallahi et al 2016b in addition to irrigation management the use of ecological fertility methods especially mycorrhizal inoculation and humic acid can effectively supply fertility sources and increase drought tolerance of crops aghhavani shajari 2012 as an organic acid humic acid improves the physical chemical and biological structure of soil and due to its hormonal composition has beneficial effects on the quantitative and qualitative indices of crops barea et al 2005 furthermore humic acid increases the absorption of essential elements soil fertility and plant yield koocheki et al 2015 this compound is a valuable alternative to chemical fertilizers and has beneficial effects on reducing the severity of drought stress in crops sabzevari et al 2010 mycorrhizal fungi by coexisting with many crops improve the nutritional status of the plant and also increase tolerance to environmental stresses especially drought stress through increasing the uptake of nutrients increasing the root s ability to absorb water producing plant hormones increasing resistance to pathogens and environmental stresses and strengthen the microbial community sharma 2002 aghhavani shajari 2012 however little information is available on the role and effect of these microorganisms on growth quantitative and qualitative yield and the amount of production of secondary metabolites in saffron various studies indicated that the use of organic and biological nutritional sources improve the growth of the saffron rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 koocheki et al 2015 aghhavani shajari et al 2016 this experiment aimed to determine quantitative and qualitative characteristics of saffron in response to fertility and irrigation management in mashhad iran conditions 2 materials and methods this research investigated fertility and irrigation management s effect on saffron flowers quantity and quality yield the experiment was conducted at research farm ferdowsi university of mashhad iran 36ºn 59ºe and 985 in 2013 2015 the main climatic parameters in the research station are shown in table 1 meteorological organization of the country 2016 the experiment was performed in a split split plot based on a randomized complete block design with 18 treatments and three replications experimental factors included superabsorbent in two levels using s a and control non s a irrigation intervals in three levels every two three and four weeks and fertility management in three levels humic acid mycorrhiza and control superabsorbent irrigation intervals and fertility treatments were located in main plots subplots and sub sub plots respectively first of all to determine the soil physicochemical properties soil samples were randomly taken from 0 to 30 cm of depth soil and transferred to the laboratory table 2 because of the low organic matter in the experimental field soil rotten cow manure based on 40 ton ha 1 was applied in all studied plots to increase soil organic matter table 2 behdani and fallahi 2015 the dimension of each subplot was 1 1 5 m then saffron corms 7 10 g were sown in an equidistance pattern 10 10 cm at a depth of 15 cm on 6 september 2013 the standard cultivation practices were used and no pesticides or herbicides were used during the growing season s a was used simultaneously to sow at a depth of 15 20 cm according to the manufacturer s recommendations 500 kg ha 1 mycorrhiza fungi glomus intraradices containing 50 spores 25 perlite 25 rotten cow manure was prepared from the manufacturer at hamedan iran number of live spores of fungus were 50 150 per g of soil and was used under the corms 15 g per corm according to manufacturer recommendations humic acid water soluble was used 15 kg ha 1 before and after flowering at the first and second irrigations in both studied years the properties and compounds of humic acid and superabsorbent are given in table 2 irrigation treatments were conducted based on every two three and four weeks equal 5 4 and 3 times flood irrigation about 3000 2400 and 1800 m3 ha 1 respectively by using the contour based on 600 m3 ha 1 per each round fallahi and mahmoodi 2018 at the same volume from mid march to mid may coincide with the highest water requirement of saffron in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 there were three times irrigation before after flowering and in mid winter the quality properties of applied water are given in table 3 finally sampling of saffron flowers was done at the beginning of flowering about mid to late november in 2013 2014 and 2015 flowers were collected every other day after that the flowers were transferred to the laboratory to measure the yield of fresh flowers and dry stigmas due to the low yield of saffron flowers in the first year of planting flower yield was neglected in 2013 2 1 water productivity of irrigation wpi the irrigation water productivity was calculated using eq 1 according to the yield of saffron stigmas in both experiment years irrigation volumes were 3000 2400 and 1800 m3 ha 1 that were experimental treatments irrigation every two three and four weeks respectively plus three times irrigation during the growing season 1800 m3 ha 1 1 wp i g ha 1 total stigma yield g m 3 water irrigation m 3 ha 1 2 2 determining the quality characteristics of saffron stigmas in order to measure the colorimetric components of the dried stigma of saffron in 2015 factors l a and b were read by a colorimeter model tes 135 shenzhen youfu tools co ltd taiwan and chroma indices c and the hue parameter h was determined by using eqs 2 and 3 mcguire 1992 2 chroma a 2 b 2 0 5 3 hue angle tan 1 b a the variable l represents the brightness and can be changed between 0 and 100 so that 100 indicates the maximum brightness and whiteness and 0 indicates blackness variables a and b have positive and negative changes positive values indicate the increase of red color for a and yellow color for b and negative values indicate the increase of green color for a and blue color for b in the samples the chroma is the color intensity and the hue is the color degree the hue is defined as 0 for purple 90 for yellow 180 for bluish green and 270 for blue ebrahimi et al 2015 in order to determine the quality parameters of saffron the amount of crocin color agent picrocrocin flavor agent and safranal aroma agent which are secondary metabolites of dried stigmas were measured from the sample of stigmas in 2015 according to iso ts 3632 2 2013 standard method extraction of dried stigmas was done with distilled water about 500 mg of saffron stigma was weighed from each treatment and poured into erlenmeyer with a volume of 1000 ml the balloons were completely covered with aluminum foil to prevent light from reaching the samples then about 900 ml of distilled water was added to the balloons and the samples were placed on a magnetic mixer for one hour the volumetric balloon was increased to the target line with distilled water and shaken again to obtain a uniform solution then using a pipette transferred 20 ml of the solution to a 200 ml volumetric balloon and increased to volume the solution was remixed to obtain a uniform solution and it filtered with an air vacuum pump and silicate filter paper the soluble light absorption was measured using a spectrophotometer wpa model s2000 uv vis spectrophotometer at 254 330 and 440 nm for picrocrocin safranal and crocin respectively the results were expressed based on the maximum absorption of one percent aqueous solution at the mentioned wavelengths based on minimum dry matter according to eq 4 molina et al 2010 koocheki et al 2016 4 a 1 cm 1 λ max d 10000 m 100 h in this equation d is the read number from the spectrophotometer m is the weight of the saffron stigmas in gram and h is the moisture content of the samples which is considered 6 45 2 3 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova and duncan s multiple range test dmrt was performed using sas 9 3 software sas 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 flowering traits triple interaction effects of experimental treatments were significant on flowering saffron traits in both studied years p 0 05 the highest number of flowers per m2 was obtained in s a three weeks irrigation intervals no application of fertility treatment control 78 33 and s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 175 33 in the first and second growing seasons respectively there was a high difference 123 between the maximum and the minimum number of this trait in the second year the highest flower number per unit area was obtained by using s a this treatment was on average 45 more than non s a also in both growing seasons s a increased on average 48 and 26 fresh saffron flower and dry stigma yields compared to non s a table 4 khorramdel et al 2013 found that increasing s a improved the flower number fresh flower yield flowering rate and dry stigma of saffron cardone et al 2020 reported that flower traits of saffron are influenced by rainfall and the amount of soil moisture aghhavani shajari et al 2020 reported that the highest flower number per m2 and dry stigma yield was obtained in shorter irrigation intervals a negative linear correlation was proved in a study between soil water potential and photosynthesis rate lawlor and tezara 2009 in this regard renaumorata et al 2012 stated that the photosynthesis rate decreased under drought stress conditions therefore according to the results it was found that growth conditions for saffron were less available in the non s a application and low irrigation frequency table 4 so decreasing photosynthesis under drought conditions decreased saffron flower traits the flower yield of saffron improved by using s a and humic acid in longer irrigation intervals in both experimental years the results indicated positive effects of s a three weeks irrigation intervals no use of fertility resources and s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid on dry stigma yields in 2014 and 2015 in general flower number fresh flower and dry stigma yields of saffron per m2 increased three times in the second year compared to the first growing seasons table 4 it has been reported that humic acid was improved soil fertility and crop yield by increasing the absorption of water and essential elements improving the physical chemical and biological properties of soil and producing hormonal compounds sabzevari et al 2010 it seems that humic acid has shown more positive effects on flower and stigma yields under the s a application and longer irrigation intervals then humic acid helped compensate for the decreasing effect of increasing irrigation intervals on stigma yield table 4 koocheki et al 2015 reported that using 100 kg ha 1 of humic acid increased 33 of the saffron flower number m 2 fallahi et al 2020 stated that the stigma yield of saffron improved by applying humic acid but mycorrhiza had a negative effect on this trait they stated that the highest flowers and stigmas yield was obtained by using humic acid with water application of 3600 m3 ha 1 some researchers suggested that humic acid directly such as increasing the repiration rate chlorophyll concentration and hormonal responses and indirectly effect on soil biochemical structures improved nutritional uptake by roots saffron s growth conditions yield by affecting the soil s elements solubility and strengthening the soil microbial community behdani and fallahi 2015 fallahi et al 2020 as a natural organic acid it should be noted that humic acid has many required nutrients for plant growth and regulates plant hormonal activities as a growth regulator zhang 1997 on the other hand this biofertilizer positively affects soil and physiological conditions plant growth and yield by improving cell membrane permeability and producing substances such as superoxide dismutase and alpha tocopherol that play a significant role in stress resistance mallikarjuna 1987 zhang 1997 another study revealed a high yield of dry saffron stigma under the influence of bio hormones application containing humic acid and biologically active substances aytekin and acikgoz 2008 the present study showed that although mycorrhiza could not show many positive effects on the quantitative indices of saffron flowers but this treatment improved the flower and stigma yields in second growing seasons compared to the first year due to the better establishment of microorganisms in the second year table 4 based on the results of aimo et al 2010 inoculation with mycorrhiza increased the flower yield of saffron rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 also expressed mycorrhiza s positive effect on the flower s number of saffron these researchers suggested that organic or biofertilizers in the early years after planting improved the number of replacement corms in the soil rather than increasing the corm yield other researchers stated that mycorrhizal fungi played an essential role in increasing the production and expansion of saffron habitats by improving water absorption behdani and fallahi 2015 rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 stated that the application of g mosseae and g intraradices had no effects on the dry flower yield of saffron in the first and second years due to lack of organic matter in the soil because organic matter is a carbon source the lack of these substances in the soil can influence some mycorrhiza species growth and activity accordingly the use of biofertilizers in arid and semi arid regions may be affected by soil organic matter deficiencies rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 in confirmation these researchers reported that another reason for this problem was the short growth period for microorganisms to coexist with plants in the soil in the first growing season on the other hand since the yield of saffron flowers is directly related to the corms size and the amount of corms nutrients behdani and fallahi 2015 it should be noted that the expected effects of mycorrhiza fertilizers on the flower yield of saffron were due to common effects of these fertilizers on corm yield in the first year rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 therefore it seems that the identification and selection of beneficial species of microorganisms for inoculation with crops should be made based on the adaptation level of these microorganisms to climatic conditions and soil characteristics the amount of organic matter of the cultivated soil regarding the water requirement of saffron some researchers reported that because the corm size of saffron improved more canopies in the second growing season the saffron s evapotranspiration was increased 22 rather than the first growing season therefore these researchers concluded that the amount of water requirement of saffron depends on the age of this crop yarami et al 2011 and these results were in good agreement with the findings of azizi zohan et al 2008 sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 2009 and alizadeh et al 2009 therefore water availability for the plant and saffron yield increased using s a in the second year table 4 in contradiction with saffron is adapted to arid and semi arid regions researches have shown that the selection of appropriate irrigation systems is effective in increasing of corm size and yield of saffron alizadeh et al 2009 dejuan et al 2009 sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 2009 because increasing the corm size in the first year improves the flower and stigma yields of saffron in the second year a study showed by 85 reduction in the osmotic potential of saffron leaves under water stress compared to the control treatment renaumorata et al 2012 kumar 2009 found that despite the low water requirement of saffron the presence of soil moisture stimulated flowering also irrigation in autumn accelerated flowering and increased the production and yield of saffron based on the other results saffron s water requirement increased during the winter due to canopy development also it has been reported that the most critical periods of saffron irrigation were april and may due to the growth of corms in these months yarami et al 2011 accordingly it seems that flower and corm yields can be improved by increasing the number of irrigations depending on the type of soil and climatic conditions in these months table 4 in confirmation of the results of this study ahmadee et al 2013 and fallahi et al 2014 stated the positive effect of s a on saffron flower yield based on this fact water availability affects plant growth so the application of s a probably accelerates the emergence of leaves increases the growth of corms and finally improves flowers yield of saffron by improving the preservation of nutrients in the soil and increasing the moisture content of rhizosphere behdani and fallahi 2015 other researchers found that since saffron cultivation areas have heavy soil texture and low moisture content s a is essential to improve this plant s growing conditions and economic yield khorramdel et al 2013 some of the benefits of s a include improving water and food storage capacity for a long time reducing irrigation frequency improving water uniform consumption for plants accelerating roots growth reducing nutrient leaching in the soil optimal using of chemical fertilizers improving aeration of the soil availability planting in arid and desert regions increasing the activity of soil microorganisms such as mycorrhizal fungi and improving the stability of soil structure behdani and fallahi 2015 therefore it seems that the saffron yield can be increased by performing appropriate management to improve soil fertility and upgrade irrigation systems and management 3 2 water productivity of irrigation wpi the results showed significant effects of studied treatments on water productivity of irrigation wpi of saffron stigma p 0 05 among all treatments wpi improved by increasing the irrigation intervals from two to four weeks in the second growing season table 5 application of s a under all fertility sources and irrigation intervals were increased wpi on average 91 compared to non sa in the second growing season the highest amount of this trait was obtained in s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 2 138 g ha 1 in 2015 table 5 the research study showed that the highest and lowest values of wpi of saffron were obtained by applying 40 and 0 kg ha 1 s a respectively fallahi et al 2016b s a can be improved plants growth and yield by reducing food leaching and water stress improving soil aeration and porosity increasing rainfall productivity and improving soil microbial community shooshtarian et al 2012 khorramdel et al 2013 on the other hand s a with higher soil moisture availability accelerates cell division in corms and improves the corms yield of saffron khorramdel et al 2013 fallahi et al 2014 behdani 2011 reported that shorter irrigation intervals improved the corm and stigma yield other researchers stated the positive effect of reducing soil water potential on wpi renaumorata et al 2012 based on another study the flood irrigation method with 24 days irrigation intervals was preferable to row irrigation with shorter irrigation intervals less water is consumed in this method producing bigger corms and ultimately improved saffron flowering azizi zohan et al 2006 koocheki et al 2014 stated that saffron irrigation based on 75 of the plant s water requirement could be a necessary action in arid and semi arid regions due to its high economic value consumption in these areas therefore despite cultivating saffron in semi arid regions gresta et al 2008 koocheki et al 2014 saffron irrigation can be reduced by using s a and increasing the irrigation intervals finally saffron wpi can be improved during the growth period 3 3 quality indicators of saffron stigma 3 3 1 components of colorimetry variance analysis results of colorimetric components in the hunterlab system l a b indicated the positive and significant effects of experimental factors on some colorimetry indices p 0 05 the l index improved on average 14 in s a treatment compared to control under all studied treatments table 6 the variable l represents the amount of brightness and brilliance between 0 and 100 so that the 100 no indicates the maximum brightness and whiteness and the 0 no indicates blackness therefore high amounts of this component are considered desirable in the plant bagheri et al 2016 jabbari 2016 saklar et al 1999 stated that low brightness was due to the formation of brown pigments and non enzymatic browning reactions in general the highest and lowest brightness of saffron stigma observed in s a three weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 32 44 and non sa three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 16 62 respectively table 6 this indicates that the availability of moisture plays a significant role in improving the brightness of saffron stigma based on the research of fallahi et al 2020 the lower volume of consumed water 3600 m3 ha 1 decreased redness and increased yellowness of stigma rather than more volume 4200 and 4800 m3 ha 1 application of humic acid mycorrhiza and control treatments respectively resulted in the highest values of a index the highest amount of redness was obtained in two weeks of irrigation intervals table 6 the index of a varies from negative green color to positive red color values the higher values more positive represent the more redness while the more negative values indicate more greening jabbari 2016 so the amount of crocin increased in optimal moisture availability it seems that most of the studied sample s redness is probably due to crocin pigments in saffron stigma accordingly providing favorable conditions for moisture availability improved the red index of saffron stigma interaction effects between studied treatments also revealed positive effects of mycorrhiza and humic acid on maintaining the redness indices of saffron color in conditions of decreasing water availability table 6 in this regard fallahi et al 2017 results showed that the highest amount of a index was observed in rosella hibiscus sabdariffa in the absence of drought stress mycorrhizal inoculation with the g intraradices therefore it should be noted that both fertility treatments play essential roles by improving the water availability to perform plant metabolisms under low irrigation conditions and improving the color indices of the saffron based on the results of duangmal et al 2008 the red color may be due to the accumulation of anthocyanins in different parts of the plant it has been reported that the redder seed of pomegranate punica granatum represented more redness opara et al 2009 consumption of 2 mm salicylic acid increased the redness and brightness of saffron stigmas according to jabbari 2016 the redness and brightness of saffron stigmas increased by using two mm salicylic acid the lowest b value was observed in shorter irrigation intervals table 6 the positive and negative values of the b index indicate yellow and blue colors respectively bagheri et al 2016 jabbari 2016 in this regard ergunes and tarhan 2006 and fallahi et al 2017 reported that high levels of yellowness b were not desirable for red fruits accordingly avoiding water stress is very important to maintain the appearance of saffron stigma the lowest value of the b a index was obtained in two weeks irrigation intervals which indicated the advantage of this treatment the low amount of this ratio indicates less yellowness of saffron stigma table 6 these results were a good agreement with the findings of nuruddin et al 2003 about the color of the tomato plant solanum lycopersicum under low irrigation conditions on the other hand the lowest amount of b index 13 63 and b a 0 5667 was observed in non sa three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza table 6 researchers in a similar study on rosella suggested that the values of b and b a decreased under the influence of simultaneous use of mycorrhiza and humic acid fallahi et al 2017 the index of b is a parameter to indicate the amount of yellowness in the sample and is affected by the concentration of carotenoid pigments the higher amount of carotenoids the higher the value of b index ayaseh et al 2014 patan and costentino 2010 reported that beta carotene increased under drought stress also based on riahinia et al 2013 results carotenoids play an essential role under stress so that they accumulate in plants to reduce oxidative stress fallahi et al 2017 concluded that water stress in rosella improved carotenoid pigments and b index furthermore moisture availability increased an index by producing anthocyanin compounds it seems that providing favorable conditions for moisture availability and applying appropriate fertilizers lead to better control of the environment around the plant roots produce fewer carotenoids improve the color parameters of saffron stigma and possibly increase the amount of crocin in it the hue variable indicates the predominant color of the sample bagheri et al 2016 values of this parameter can be changed from 0 to 360 so that 0 indicates purple red 90 angle indicates the yellow color 180 angle indicates the greenish color and 270 angle indicates blue color pathare et al 2013 less hue index is a desirable trait because the degree of hue angle is closer to zero the redness of stigma is more the chroma is an index to show the intensity or saturation of the color and its large amounts are desirable ergunes and tarhan 2006 researchers state that chroma is an index for expressing a quantitative amount of color increasing this trait increases visible colors intensity to the human eye in contrast the hue is a qualitative index used by people to express the product color which is the color angle pathare et al 2013 the present study results showed that the lowest hue was obtained in two weeks of irrigation intervals table 6 in this regard jabbari 2016 reported that redness and color intensity in saffron improved by increasing salicylic acid the hue index also decreased under moderate water stress in tomatoes patane and cosentino 2010 the application of humic acid improved the chroma color intensity in saffron stigma compared to the control treatment table 16 in a similar experiment on rosella researchers found that the application of humic mycorrhizal under drought stress caused a relative increase in the chroma index fallahi et al 2017 based on interaction effects s a s use under all irrigation intervals and nutritional management reduced the hue index and improved the chroma of saffron stigma compared to non sa that are desirable changes table 6 fallahi et al 2017 stated that the amount of chroma were 44 4 and 37 9 respectively in the optimal availability of moisture and drought stress in rosella also the maximum amount of hue was observed in non sa three weeks irrigation intervals no fertility treatment 1 876 and the minimum desirable amount of hue was obtained in s a two weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 0 1783 so a significant difference was observed between these two treatments which resulted in favorable conditions for improving the quality indices of saffron stigma furthermore the non sa four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 100 7 and after that s a three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 94 76 resulted in the maximum amount of chroma table 6 a study reported that the pomegranate seeds redder the higher the chroma index color intensity opara et al 2009 therefore the present research results indicated that proper irrigation and fertility management could improve the color quality of saffron stigma one of the most important indices of saffron appearance and effective in its marketability 3 3 2 crocin picrocrocin and safranal content in saffron stigma the variance analysis results showed significant effects of experimental treatments on the qualitative composition of saffron flower stigma p 0 05 the highest amount of crocin picrocrocin and safranal in stigma was obtained by using s a so that there was a difference on average of 22 between these treatments with non sa table 6 crocin is one of the water soluble carotenoids representing the red color of saffron and the bitter taste of this plant is related to colorless glycosides called picrocrocin is soluble in water safranal is produced from the decomposition of bitter glycosides related to saffron s aroma behdani and fallahi 2015 the highest crocin amount was obtained in the three week irrigation intervals 156 5 a 440 1 and decreased by increasing irrigation intervals lower water availability resulted in the highest crocin and picrocrocin table 6 however studies of fallahi et al 2020 and koocheki and seyyedi 2016 stated that as the volume of used water decreased the contents of crocin and picrocrocin enhanced among nutritional treatments the taste and aroma indices of saffron stigma improved by using s a longer irrigation intervals every four weeks table 6 feizi et al 2014 stated that picrocrocin was the only qualitative composition of saffron affected by summer irrigation the results indicated that all indices that related to color taste and aroma of saffron were increased under the influence of mycorrhiza humic acid and then control treatments respectively table 6 mycorrhiza can be able to improve the quantity and quality traits of plant by increasing the water absorption and some nutrients through regulating their chemical properties sembok et al 2015 in a study investigating the effects of ammonium phosphate fertilizer two fertile phosphorus biofertilizer and their combined application on the quality yield of saffron flowers researchers found two fertile phosphorus biofertilizer and ammonium phosphate fertilizer had positive and negative effects respectively on the amount of picrocrocin they stated that the highest amount of crocin was observed in the chemical and biological fertilizers and the lowest amount was observed in the control treatment naghdi badi et al 2011 other researchers have been mentioned the positive effect of biological fertilizers in increasing crocin picrocrocin and safranal omidi et al 2009 in another study the amounts of crocin and picrocrocin of saffron stigma increased by using biofertilizers humic acid and bioaminopalis compared to the control treatment golzari jahanabadi 2015 also heidari et al 2014 stated that the combined use of biofertilizers pseudomonas putida and bacillus lentus and chemical fertilizer 25 kg nitrogen improved the amount of picrocrocin by 12 rather than control this study also showed that the highest levels of safranal and crocin were obtained in biofertilizer and control treatments respectively based on hasanzadeh aval 2015 results the amount of picrocrocin of saffron stigma increased by increasing the amount of cow manure in this regard it has been reported that the quality yield of saffron can be affected by the use of biofertilizers and the provision of compounds hormones and water soluble vitamins creation of cooperation with other microorganisms production of primary compounds that are effective in the biosynthesis of glucosides and their analysis into secondary compounds wu et al 2005 heidari et al 2014 in the present study longer irrigation intervals s a and mycorrhiza s simultaneous use improved the quality of saffron stigma table 6 the results of interactions effects of all studied treatments indicated that the maximum amount of crocin and picrocrocin were obtained in s a three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 225 9 a 440 1 and 86 58 a 254 1 respectively and the highest amount of safranal was observed in s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 47 03 a 330 1 table 6 according to the results and studies it is recommended to use organic and biological fertilizers such as humic acid and suitable mycorrhiza species and provide the required moisture for saffron to improve this plant s quality characteristics on the other hand applying humic acid and mycorrhiza and appropriate irrigation intervals every two or three weeks improved saffron flowers quantitative and qualitative characteristics in this regard it has been stated that although the application of nutrients and increasing their levels improved the speed and rate of plant growth it is possible to increase the quality indices to a specific concentration so that if the growth rate is higher than the production rate and the number of quality indices it will reduce its concentration in the stigma but if a factor increases the yield of a compound per unit area also it increases the yield of other active ingredients heidari et al 2014 it has been reported that bigger corms improve the quantitative and qualitative yield of saffron stigmas by increasing access to solutes and elements in the soil and increasing biosynthetic enzyme activity in synthesizing secondary compounds tajik et al 2012 another research showed that saffron cultivation in soil with more suitable moisture made better coloring of stigma cardone et al 2020 the present results also showed that the color components such as l a hue angle chroma and crocin improved by the more irrigation times and the amount of picrocrocin and safranal increased by applying the appropriate drought stress also s a and appropriate organic and biological fertilizers could improve all quality indices of saffron stigma 4 conclusion the results showed the positive effects of s a consumption irrigation intervals and fertility resources on qualitative characteristics of saffron flowers the fresh flower yield dry stigma yield brightness redness and color intensity of the stigma were affected by s a consumption among all treatments and the amount of crocin picrocrocin and safranal in saffron stigma the highest number of flower dry stigma yield wpi and safranal were observed using s a 4 weeks irrigation intervals humic acid especially in the second year furthermore providing favorable conditions for moisture availability improved most saffron indices on the other hand applying humic acid in the field could compensate for the lack of water most of the studied indices improved by applying s a four weeks irrigation intervals and using humic acid and then mycorrhiza especially in the second year declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9524,increasing the saffron quantity and quality is essential and should be considered to achieve the desired performance in this regard to study the effect of nutrient and irrigation management on the quality and yield of saffron an experiment was carried out at the research station the ferdowsi university of mashhad iran in 2013 2015 the study was performed as a split split plot based on a randomized complete block design with 18 treatments experimental factors were 1 superabsorbent s a application and non application non s a 2 irrigation intervals every two three and four weeks and 3 nutrient management humic acid mycorrhiza glomus intraradices and control among all treatments the application of s a increased on average 61 fresh saffron flower and dry stigma yields in both growing seasons s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid were increased number of flower dry stigma yields 175 33 per m2 and 7 472 kg ha 1 respectively and water productivity of irrigation of saffron stigma 2 138 g ha 1 in 2015 the use of s a and humic acid compensated for water shortage and increased stigmas yield furthermore the maximum l observed in s a three weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 32 44 among all treatments the lowest amount of b value and hue was observed in shorter irrigation intervals so application of s a two weeks irrigation intervals humic acid resulted in the minimum amount of hue 0 1783 that was a desirable trait the maximum crocin and picrocrocin obtained in s a three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 225 9 a 440 1 and 86 58 a 254 1 respectively and the highest safranal content observed in s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 47 03 a 330 1 in general it seems that the application of humic acid mycorrhiza s a and longer irrigation intervals can significantly increase the quality and yield of saffron keywords crocin humic acid irrigation interval mycorrhiza superabsorbent 1 introduction saffron has economic social environmental and political roles in the agriculture of iran saffron has special importance among different plant species because of its particular ecological nests compared to other plants and their unique economic characteristics behdani and fallahi 2015 hasanzadeh aval 2015 studies have shown that iran is the largest saffron producer globally but the average stigma yield is relatively low compared with other producer countries the reasons for improving yields in many countries such as italy and spain can be proper nutrition bigger corms proper planting storing and harvesting hasanzadeh aval 2015 aghhavani shajari 2017 furthermore any factor that reduces the effects of environmental stresses and provides adequate nutritional needs of saffron can be considered a positive factor in reducing the yield gap for this plant behdani and fallahi 2015 therefore it is necessary to increase the saffron yield by improving agricultural management and conducting relevant research rezvani moghaddam et al 2014 since the most crucial factor determining the corm to start flowering is the corm s size therefore creating suitable environmental conditions is very important for obtaining a large sized corm and high stigma yield behdani and fallahi 2015 in this regard proper nutrition and irrigation management are essential to achieve bigger corm and improve saffron flowers quantitative and qualitative yield these days agricultural intensification due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides decreased the soil organic matter microbial activities and saffron crop yield aghhavani shajari 2012 despite the low fertilizer requirement of saffron some studies confirmed that about 16 80 of saffron flower yield changes depended on soil variables shahandeh 1989 therefore proper soil fertility management is a valuable solution for increasing soil organic matter strengthening microbial communities and ultimately improving plants quantitative and qualitative yield especially under drought stress using organic and biological fertilizers and benefiting from proper relationships with plant coexistence with soil microorganisms with proper management of soil fertility and plant nutrition the environment and biodiversity can be preserved and increased the efficiency of using agricultural inputs mostly irrigation water aghhavani shajari 2012 koocheki et al 2015 drought stress is one of the most critical crop production problems in arid and semi arid regions of the world yang et al 2006 high limitation of water resources and high water supply and transmission cost in some areas has caused the optimal irrigation level to be less than the amount of water required to produce maximum yield fallahi et al 2016a proper nutritional and irrigation management and planting of drought tolerant plants effectively increase water use efficiency fuladivanda et al 2000 safari et al 2013 low irrigation is one method for optimizing water consumption in arable lands in which the crop is irrigated lower than the water requirement behdani and fallahi 2015 this strategy can be done by reducing the volume of water in each irrigation increasing irrigation intervals stopping irrigation at a particular time of growth and eliminating the lowest efficiency irrigations if this irrigation method is implemented well it can increase water use efficiency without significantly reducing yield ghorbani nasrabad and hezar jaribi 2010 s a s use has a significant role in arid and semi arid areas to manage irrigation in the agricultural areas khorramdel et al 2013 fallahi et al 2016a superabsorbent polymers are hydrophilic networks that absorb and retain large amounts of water zohurianmehr and kabiri 2008 these polymers appropriately affect the penetration rate density soil structure soil compaction soil texture aggregate stability and evaporation rate abedikoupai and asadkazemi 2006 superabsorbents store 200 500 ml of water per gram of dry weight so that they increase absorption of water in their structure deharralde et al 1998 in this regard many studies have shown the positive effect of irrigation management and s a on the yield of saffron plant flowers azizi zohan et al 2006 khorramdel et al 2013 fallahi et al 2016b in addition to irrigation management the use of ecological fertility methods especially mycorrhizal inoculation and humic acid can effectively supply fertility sources and increase drought tolerance of crops aghhavani shajari 2012 as an organic acid humic acid improves the physical chemical and biological structure of soil and due to its hormonal composition has beneficial effects on the quantitative and qualitative indices of crops barea et al 2005 furthermore humic acid increases the absorption of essential elements soil fertility and plant yield koocheki et al 2015 this compound is a valuable alternative to chemical fertilizers and has beneficial effects on reducing the severity of drought stress in crops sabzevari et al 2010 mycorrhizal fungi by coexisting with many crops improve the nutritional status of the plant and also increase tolerance to environmental stresses especially drought stress through increasing the uptake of nutrients increasing the root s ability to absorb water producing plant hormones increasing resistance to pathogens and environmental stresses and strengthen the microbial community sharma 2002 aghhavani shajari 2012 however little information is available on the role and effect of these microorganisms on growth quantitative and qualitative yield and the amount of production of secondary metabolites in saffron various studies indicated that the use of organic and biological nutritional sources improve the growth of the saffron rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 koocheki et al 2015 aghhavani shajari et al 2016 this experiment aimed to determine quantitative and qualitative characteristics of saffron in response to fertility and irrigation management in mashhad iran conditions 2 materials and methods this research investigated fertility and irrigation management s effect on saffron flowers quantity and quality yield the experiment was conducted at research farm ferdowsi university of mashhad iran 36ºn 59ºe and 985 in 2013 2015 the main climatic parameters in the research station are shown in table 1 meteorological organization of the country 2016 the experiment was performed in a split split plot based on a randomized complete block design with 18 treatments and three replications experimental factors included superabsorbent in two levels using s a and control non s a irrigation intervals in three levels every two three and four weeks and fertility management in three levels humic acid mycorrhiza and control superabsorbent irrigation intervals and fertility treatments were located in main plots subplots and sub sub plots respectively first of all to determine the soil physicochemical properties soil samples were randomly taken from 0 to 30 cm of depth soil and transferred to the laboratory table 2 because of the low organic matter in the experimental field soil rotten cow manure based on 40 ton ha 1 was applied in all studied plots to increase soil organic matter table 2 behdani and fallahi 2015 the dimension of each subplot was 1 1 5 m then saffron corms 7 10 g were sown in an equidistance pattern 10 10 cm at a depth of 15 cm on 6 september 2013 the standard cultivation practices were used and no pesticides or herbicides were used during the growing season s a was used simultaneously to sow at a depth of 15 20 cm according to the manufacturer s recommendations 500 kg ha 1 mycorrhiza fungi glomus intraradices containing 50 spores 25 perlite 25 rotten cow manure was prepared from the manufacturer at hamedan iran number of live spores of fungus were 50 150 per g of soil and was used under the corms 15 g per corm according to manufacturer recommendations humic acid water soluble was used 15 kg ha 1 before and after flowering at the first and second irrigations in both studied years the properties and compounds of humic acid and superabsorbent are given in table 2 irrigation treatments were conducted based on every two three and four weeks equal 5 4 and 3 times flood irrigation about 3000 2400 and 1800 m3 ha 1 respectively by using the contour based on 600 m3 ha 1 per each round fallahi and mahmoodi 2018 at the same volume from mid march to mid may coincide with the highest water requirement of saffron in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 there were three times irrigation before after flowering and in mid winter the quality properties of applied water are given in table 3 finally sampling of saffron flowers was done at the beginning of flowering about mid to late november in 2013 2014 and 2015 flowers were collected every other day after that the flowers were transferred to the laboratory to measure the yield of fresh flowers and dry stigmas due to the low yield of saffron flowers in the first year of planting flower yield was neglected in 2013 2 1 water productivity of irrigation wpi the irrigation water productivity was calculated using eq 1 according to the yield of saffron stigmas in both experiment years irrigation volumes were 3000 2400 and 1800 m3 ha 1 that were experimental treatments irrigation every two three and four weeks respectively plus three times irrigation during the growing season 1800 m3 ha 1 1 wp i g ha 1 total stigma yield g m 3 water irrigation m 3 ha 1 2 2 determining the quality characteristics of saffron stigmas in order to measure the colorimetric components of the dried stigma of saffron in 2015 factors l a and b were read by a colorimeter model tes 135 shenzhen youfu tools co ltd taiwan and chroma indices c and the hue parameter h was determined by using eqs 2 and 3 mcguire 1992 2 chroma a 2 b 2 0 5 3 hue angle tan 1 b a the variable l represents the brightness and can be changed between 0 and 100 so that 100 indicates the maximum brightness and whiteness and 0 indicates blackness variables a and b have positive and negative changes positive values indicate the increase of red color for a and yellow color for b and negative values indicate the increase of green color for a and blue color for b in the samples the chroma is the color intensity and the hue is the color degree the hue is defined as 0 for purple 90 for yellow 180 for bluish green and 270 for blue ebrahimi et al 2015 in order to determine the quality parameters of saffron the amount of crocin color agent picrocrocin flavor agent and safranal aroma agent which are secondary metabolites of dried stigmas were measured from the sample of stigmas in 2015 according to iso ts 3632 2 2013 standard method extraction of dried stigmas was done with distilled water about 500 mg of saffron stigma was weighed from each treatment and poured into erlenmeyer with a volume of 1000 ml the balloons were completely covered with aluminum foil to prevent light from reaching the samples then about 900 ml of distilled water was added to the balloons and the samples were placed on a magnetic mixer for one hour the volumetric balloon was increased to the target line with distilled water and shaken again to obtain a uniform solution then using a pipette transferred 20 ml of the solution to a 200 ml volumetric balloon and increased to volume the solution was remixed to obtain a uniform solution and it filtered with an air vacuum pump and silicate filter paper the soluble light absorption was measured using a spectrophotometer wpa model s2000 uv vis spectrophotometer at 254 330 and 440 nm for picrocrocin safranal and crocin respectively the results were expressed based on the maximum absorption of one percent aqueous solution at the mentioned wavelengths based on minimum dry matter according to eq 4 molina et al 2010 koocheki et al 2016 4 a 1 cm 1 λ max d 10000 m 100 h in this equation d is the read number from the spectrophotometer m is the weight of the saffron stigmas in gram and h is the moisture content of the samples which is considered 6 45 2 3 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova and duncan s multiple range test dmrt was performed using sas 9 3 software sas 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 flowering traits triple interaction effects of experimental treatments were significant on flowering saffron traits in both studied years p 0 05 the highest number of flowers per m2 was obtained in s a three weeks irrigation intervals no application of fertility treatment control 78 33 and s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 175 33 in the first and second growing seasons respectively there was a high difference 123 between the maximum and the minimum number of this trait in the second year the highest flower number per unit area was obtained by using s a this treatment was on average 45 more than non s a also in both growing seasons s a increased on average 48 and 26 fresh saffron flower and dry stigma yields compared to non s a table 4 khorramdel et al 2013 found that increasing s a improved the flower number fresh flower yield flowering rate and dry stigma of saffron cardone et al 2020 reported that flower traits of saffron are influenced by rainfall and the amount of soil moisture aghhavani shajari et al 2020 reported that the highest flower number per m2 and dry stigma yield was obtained in shorter irrigation intervals a negative linear correlation was proved in a study between soil water potential and photosynthesis rate lawlor and tezara 2009 in this regard renaumorata et al 2012 stated that the photosynthesis rate decreased under drought stress conditions therefore according to the results it was found that growth conditions for saffron were less available in the non s a application and low irrigation frequency table 4 so decreasing photosynthesis under drought conditions decreased saffron flower traits the flower yield of saffron improved by using s a and humic acid in longer irrigation intervals in both experimental years the results indicated positive effects of s a three weeks irrigation intervals no use of fertility resources and s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid on dry stigma yields in 2014 and 2015 in general flower number fresh flower and dry stigma yields of saffron per m2 increased three times in the second year compared to the first growing seasons table 4 it has been reported that humic acid was improved soil fertility and crop yield by increasing the absorption of water and essential elements improving the physical chemical and biological properties of soil and producing hormonal compounds sabzevari et al 2010 it seems that humic acid has shown more positive effects on flower and stigma yields under the s a application and longer irrigation intervals then humic acid helped compensate for the decreasing effect of increasing irrigation intervals on stigma yield table 4 koocheki et al 2015 reported that using 100 kg ha 1 of humic acid increased 33 of the saffron flower number m 2 fallahi et al 2020 stated that the stigma yield of saffron improved by applying humic acid but mycorrhiza had a negative effect on this trait they stated that the highest flowers and stigmas yield was obtained by using humic acid with water application of 3600 m3 ha 1 some researchers suggested that humic acid directly such as increasing the repiration rate chlorophyll concentration and hormonal responses and indirectly effect on soil biochemical structures improved nutritional uptake by roots saffron s growth conditions yield by affecting the soil s elements solubility and strengthening the soil microbial community behdani and fallahi 2015 fallahi et al 2020 as a natural organic acid it should be noted that humic acid has many required nutrients for plant growth and regulates plant hormonal activities as a growth regulator zhang 1997 on the other hand this biofertilizer positively affects soil and physiological conditions plant growth and yield by improving cell membrane permeability and producing substances such as superoxide dismutase and alpha tocopherol that play a significant role in stress resistance mallikarjuna 1987 zhang 1997 another study revealed a high yield of dry saffron stigma under the influence of bio hormones application containing humic acid and biologically active substances aytekin and acikgoz 2008 the present study showed that although mycorrhiza could not show many positive effects on the quantitative indices of saffron flowers but this treatment improved the flower and stigma yields in second growing seasons compared to the first year due to the better establishment of microorganisms in the second year table 4 based on the results of aimo et al 2010 inoculation with mycorrhiza increased the flower yield of saffron rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 also expressed mycorrhiza s positive effect on the flower s number of saffron these researchers suggested that organic or biofertilizers in the early years after planting improved the number of replacement corms in the soil rather than increasing the corm yield other researchers stated that mycorrhizal fungi played an essential role in increasing the production and expansion of saffron habitats by improving water absorption behdani and fallahi 2015 rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 stated that the application of g mosseae and g intraradices had no effects on the dry flower yield of saffron in the first and second years due to lack of organic matter in the soil because organic matter is a carbon source the lack of these substances in the soil can influence some mycorrhiza species growth and activity accordingly the use of biofertilizers in arid and semi arid regions may be affected by soil organic matter deficiencies rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 in confirmation these researchers reported that another reason for this problem was the short growth period for microorganisms to coexist with plants in the soil in the first growing season on the other hand since the yield of saffron flowers is directly related to the corms size and the amount of corms nutrients behdani and fallahi 2015 it should be noted that the expected effects of mycorrhiza fertilizers on the flower yield of saffron were due to common effects of these fertilizers on corm yield in the first year rezvani moghaddam et al 2013 therefore it seems that the identification and selection of beneficial species of microorganisms for inoculation with crops should be made based on the adaptation level of these microorganisms to climatic conditions and soil characteristics the amount of organic matter of the cultivated soil regarding the water requirement of saffron some researchers reported that because the corm size of saffron improved more canopies in the second growing season the saffron s evapotranspiration was increased 22 rather than the first growing season therefore these researchers concluded that the amount of water requirement of saffron depends on the age of this crop yarami et al 2011 and these results were in good agreement with the findings of azizi zohan et al 2008 sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 2009 and alizadeh et al 2009 therefore water availability for the plant and saffron yield increased using s a in the second year table 4 in contradiction with saffron is adapted to arid and semi arid regions researches have shown that the selection of appropriate irrigation systems is effective in increasing of corm size and yield of saffron alizadeh et al 2009 dejuan et al 2009 sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 2009 because increasing the corm size in the first year improves the flower and stigma yields of saffron in the second year a study showed by 85 reduction in the osmotic potential of saffron leaves under water stress compared to the control treatment renaumorata et al 2012 kumar 2009 found that despite the low water requirement of saffron the presence of soil moisture stimulated flowering also irrigation in autumn accelerated flowering and increased the production and yield of saffron based on the other results saffron s water requirement increased during the winter due to canopy development also it has been reported that the most critical periods of saffron irrigation were april and may due to the growth of corms in these months yarami et al 2011 accordingly it seems that flower and corm yields can be improved by increasing the number of irrigations depending on the type of soil and climatic conditions in these months table 4 in confirmation of the results of this study ahmadee et al 2013 and fallahi et al 2014 stated the positive effect of s a on saffron flower yield based on this fact water availability affects plant growth so the application of s a probably accelerates the emergence of leaves increases the growth of corms and finally improves flowers yield of saffron by improving the preservation of nutrients in the soil and increasing the moisture content of rhizosphere behdani and fallahi 2015 other researchers found that since saffron cultivation areas have heavy soil texture and low moisture content s a is essential to improve this plant s growing conditions and economic yield khorramdel et al 2013 some of the benefits of s a include improving water and food storage capacity for a long time reducing irrigation frequency improving water uniform consumption for plants accelerating roots growth reducing nutrient leaching in the soil optimal using of chemical fertilizers improving aeration of the soil availability planting in arid and desert regions increasing the activity of soil microorganisms such as mycorrhizal fungi and improving the stability of soil structure behdani and fallahi 2015 therefore it seems that the saffron yield can be increased by performing appropriate management to improve soil fertility and upgrade irrigation systems and management 3 2 water productivity of irrigation wpi the results showed significant effects of studied treatments on water productivity of irrigation wpi of saffron stigma p 0 05 among all treatments wpi improved by increasing the irrigation intervals from two to four weeks in the second growing season table 5 application of s a under all fertility sources and irrigation intervals were increased wpi on average 91 compared to non sa in the second growing season the highest amount of this trait was obtained in s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 2 138 g ha 1 in 2015 table 5 the research study showed that the highest and lowest values of wpi of saffron were obtained by applying 40 and 0 kg ha 1 s a respectively fallahi et al 2016b s a can be improved plants growth and yield by reducing food leaching and water stress improving soil aeration and porosity increasing rainfall productivity and improving soil microbial community shooshtarian et al 2012 khorramdel et al 2013 on the other hand s a with higher soil moisture availability accelerates cell division in corms and improves the corms yield of saffron khorramdel et al 2013 fallahi et al 2014 behdani 2011 reported that shorter irrigation intervals improved the corm and stigma yield other researchers stated the positive effect of reducing soil water potential on wpi renaumorata et al 2012 based on another study the flood irrigation method with 24 days irrigation intervals was preferable to row irrigation with shorter irrigation intervals less water is consumed in this method producing bigger corms and ultimately improved saffron flowering azizi zohan et al 2006 koocheki et al 2014 stated that saffron irrigation based on 75 of the plant s water requirement could be a necessary action in arid and semi arid regions due to its high economic value consumption in these areas therefore despite cultivating saffron in semi arid regions gresta et al 2008 koocheki et al 2014 saffron irrigation can be reduced by using s a and increasing the irrigation intervals finally saffron wpi can be improved during the growth period 3 3 quality indicators of saffron stigma 3 3 1 components of colorimetry variance analysis results of colorimetric components in the hunterlab system l a b indicated the positive and significant effects of experimental factors on some colorimetry indices p 0 05 the l index improved on average 14 in s a treatment compared to control under all studied treatments table 6 the variable l represents the amount of brightness and brilliance between 0 and 100 so that the 100 no indicates the maximum brightness and whiteness and the 0 no indicates blackness therefore high amounts of this component are considered desirable in the plant bagheri et al 2016 jabbari 2016 saklar et al 1999 stated that low brightness was due to the formation of brown pigments and non enzymatic browning reactions in general the highest and lowest brightness of saffron stigma observed in s a three weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 32 44 and non sa three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 16 62 respectively table 6 this indicates that the availability of moisture plays a significant role in improving the brightness of saffron stigma based on the research of fallahi et al 2020 the lower volume of consumed water 3600 m3 ha 1 decreased redness and increased yellowness of stigma rather than more volume 4200 and 4800 m3 ha 1 application of humic acid mycorrhiza and control treatments respectively resulted in the highest values of a index the highest amount of redness was obtained in two weeks of irrigation intervals table 6 the index of a varies from negative green color to positive red color values the higher values more positive represent the more redness while the more negative values indicate more greening jabbari 2016 so the amount of crocin increased in optimal moisture availability it seems that most of the studied sample s redness is probably due to crocin pigments in saffron stigma accordingly providing favorable conditions for moisture availability improved the red index of saffron stigma interaction effects between studied treatments also revealed positive effects of mycorrhiza and humic acid on maintaining the redness indices of saffron color in conditions of decreasing water availability table 6 in this regard fallahi et al 2017 results showed that the highest amount of a index was observed in rosella hibiscus sabdariffa in the absence of drought stress mycorrhizal inoculation with the g intraradices therefore it should be noted that both fertility treatments play essential roles by improving the water availability to perform plant metabolisms under low irrigation conditions and improving the color indices of the saffron based on the results of duangmal et al 2008 the red color may be due to the accumulation of anthocyanins in different parts of the plant it has been reported that the redder seed of pomegranate punica granatum represented more redness opara et al 2009 consumption of 2 mm salicylic acid increased the redness and brightness of saffron stigmas according to jabbari 2016 the redness and brightness of saffron stigmas increased by using two mm salicylic acid the lowest b value was observed in shorter irrigation intervals table 6 the positive and negative values of the b index indicate yellow and blue colors respectively bagheri et al 2016 jabbari 2016 in this regard ergunes and tarhan 2006 and fallahi et al 2017 reported that high levels of yellowness b were not desirable for red fruits accordingly avoiding water stress is very important to maintain the appearance of saffron stigma the lowest value of the b a index was obtained in two weeks irrigation intervals which indicated the advantage of this treatment the low amount of this ratio indicates less yellowness of saffron stigma table 6 these results were a good agreement with the findings of nuruddin et al 2003 about the color of the tomato plant solanum lycopersicum under low irrigation conditions on the other hand the lowest amount of b index 13 63 and b a 0 5667 was observed in non sa three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza table 6 researchers in a similar study on rosella suggested that the values of b and b a decreased under the influence of simultaneous use of mycorrhiza and humic acid fallahi et al 2017 the index of b is a parameter to indicate the amount of yellowness in the sample and is affected by the concentration of carotenoid pigments the higher amount of carotenoids the higher the value of b index ayaseh et al 2014 patan and costentino 2010 reported that beta carotene increased under drought stress also based on riahinia et al 2013 results carotenoids play an essential role under stress so that they accumulate in plants to reduce oxidative stress fallahi et al 2017 concluded that water stress in rosella improved carotenoid pigments and b index furthermore moisture availability increased an index by producing anthocyanin compounds it seems that providing favorable conditions for moisture availability and applying appropriate fertilizers lead to better control of the environment around the plant roots produce fewer carotenoids improve the color parameters of saffron stigma and possibly increase the amount of crocin in it the hue variable indicates the predominant color of the sample bagheri et al 2016 values of this parameter can be changed from 0 to 360 so that 0 indicates purple red 90 angle indicates the yellow color 180 angle indicates the greenish color and 270 angle indicates blue color pathare et al 2013 less hue index is a desirable trait because the degree of hue angle is closer to zero the redness of stigma is more the chroma is an index to show the intensity or saturation of the color and its large amounts are desirable ergunes and tarhan 2006 researchers state that chroma is an index for expressing a quantitative amount of color increasing this trait increases visible colors intensity to the human eye in contrast the hue is a qualitative index used by people to express the product color which is the color angle pathare et al 2013 the present study results showed that the lowest hue was obtained in two weeks of irrigation intervals table 6 in this regard jabbari 2016 reported that redness and color intensity in saffron improved by increasing salicylic acid the hue index also decreased under moderate water stress in tomatoes patane and cosentino 2010 the application of humic acid improved the chroma color intensity in saffron stigma compared to the control treatment table 16 in a similar experiment on rosella researchers found that the application of humic mycorrhizal under drought stress caused a relative increase in the chroma index fallahi et al 2017 based on interaction effects s a s use under all irrigation intervals and nutritional management reduced the hue index and improved the chroma of saffron stigma compared to non sa that are desirable changes table 6 fallahi et al 2017 stated that the amount of chroma were 44 4 and 37 9 respectively in the optimal availability of moisture and drought stress in rosella also the maximum amount of hue was observed in non sa three weeks irrigation intervals no fertility treatment 1 876 and the minimum desirable amount of hue was obtained in s a two weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 0 1783 so a significant difference was observed between these two treatments which resulted in favorable conditions for improving the quality indices of saffron stigma furthermore the non sa four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 100 7 and after that s a three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 94 76 resulted in the maximum amount of chroma table 6 a study reported that the pomegranate seeds redder the higher the chroma index color intensity opara et al 2009 therefore the present research results indicated that proper irrigation and fertility management could improve the color quality of saffron stigma one of the most important indices of saffron appearance and effective in its marketability 3 3 2 crocin picrocrocin and safranal content in saffron stigma the variance analysis results showed significant effects of experimental treatments on the qualitative composition of saffron flower stigma p 0 05 the highest amount of crocin picrocrocin and safranal in stigma was obtained by using s a so that there was a difference on average of 22 between these treatments with non sa table 6 crocin is one of the water soluble carotenoids representing the red color of saffron and the bitter taste of this plant is related to colorless glycosides called picrocrocin is soluble in water safranal is produced from the decomposition of bitter glycosides related to saffron s aroma behdani and fallahi 2015 the highest crocin amount was obtained in the three week irrigation intervals 156 5 a 440 1 and decreased by increasing irrigation intervals lower water availability resulted in the highest crocin and picrocrocin table 6 however studies of fallahi et al 2020 and koocheki and seyyedi 2016 stated that as the volume of used water decreased the contents of crocin and picrocrocin enhanced among nutritional treatments the taste and aroma indices of saffron stigma improved by using s a longer irrigation intervals every four weeks table 6 feizi et al 2014 stated that picrocrocin was the only qualitative composition of saffron affected by summer irrigation the results indicated that all indices that related to color taste and aroma of saffron were increased under the influence of mycorrhiza humic acid and then control treatments respectively table 6 mycorrhiza can be able to improve the quantity and quality traits of plant by increasing the water absorption and some nutrients through regulating their chemical properties sembok et al 2015 in a study investigating the effects of ammonium phosphate fertilizer two fertile phosphorus biofertilizer and their combined application on the quality yield of saffron flowers researchers found two fertile phosphorus biofertilizer and ammonium phosphate fertilizer had positive and negative effects respectively on the amount of picrocrocin they stated that the highest amount of crocin was observed in the chemical and biological fertilizers and the lowest amount was observed in the control treatment naghdi badi et al 2011 other researchers have been mentioned the positive effect of biological fertilizers in increasing crocin picrocrocin and safranal omidi et al 2009 in another study the amounts of crocin and picrocrocin of saffron stigma increased by using biofertilizers humic acid and bioaminopalis compared to the control treatment golzari jahanabadi 2015 also heidari et al 2014 stated that the combined use of biofertilizers pseudomonas putida and bacillus lentus and chemical fertilizer 25 kg nitrogen improved the amount of picrocrocin by 12 rather than control this study also showed that the highest levels of safranal and crocin were obtained in biofertilizer and control treatments respectively based on hasanzadeh aval 2015 results the amount of picrocrocin of saffron stigma increased by increasing the amount of cow manure in this regard it has been reported that the quality yield of saffron can be affected by the use of biofertilizers and the provision of compounds hormones and water soluble vitamins creation of cooperation with other microorganisms production of primary compounds that are effective in the biosynthesis of glucosides and their analysis into secondary compounds wu et al 2005 heidari et al 2014 in the present study longer irrigation intervals s a and mycorrhiza s simultaneous use improved the quality of saffron stigma table 6 the results of interactions effects of all studied treatments indicated that the maximum amount of crocin and picrocrocin were obtained in s a three weeks irrigation intervals mycorrhiza 225 9 a 440 1 and 86 58 a 254 1 respectively and the highest amount of safranal was observed in s a four weeks irrigation intervals humic acid 47 03 a 330 1 table 6 according to the results and studies it is recommended to use organic and biological fertilizers such as humic acid and suitable mycorrhiza species and provide the required moisture for saffron to improve this plant s quality characteristics on the other hand applying humic acid and mycorrhiza and appropriate irrigation intervals every two or three weeks improved saffron flowers quantitative and qualitative characteristics in this regard it has been stated that although the application of nutrients and increasing their levels improved the speed and rate of plant growth it is possible to increase the quality indices to a specific concentration so that if the growth rate is higher than the production rate and the number of quality indices it will reduce its concentration in the stigma but if a factor increases the yield of a compound per unit area also it increases the yield of other active ingredients heidari et al 2014 it has been reported that bigger corms improve the quantitative and qualitative yield of saffron stigmas by increasing access to solutes and elements in the soil and increasing biosynthetic enzyme activity in synthesizing secondary compounds tajik et al 2012 another research showed that saffron cultivation in soil with more suitable moisture made better coloring of stigma cardone et al 2020 the present results also showed that the color components such as l a hue angle chroma and crocin improved by the more irrigation times and the amount of picrocrocin and safranal increased by applying the appropriate drought stress also s a and appropriate organic and biological fertilizers could improve all quality indices of saffron stigma 4 conclusion the results showed the positive effects of s a consumption irrigation intervals and fertility resources on qualitative characteristics of saffron flowers the fresh flower yield dry stigma yield brightness redness and color intensity of the stigma were affected by s a consumption among all treatments and the amount of crocin picrocrocin and safranal in saffron stigma the highest number of flower dry stigma yield wpi and safranal were observed using s a 4 weeks irrigation intervals humic acid especially in the second year furthermore providing favorable conditions for moisture availability improved most saffron indices on the other hand applying humic acid in the field could compensate for the lack of water most of the studied
