7855,study region abbay river basin ethiopia study focus this research focused on assessing the spatio temporal availability and variability of water resources potential using physically based hydrological model the availability and spatial variability of water balance components were modeled for each subbasins of abbay river basin new hydrological insights for the region multi statistical performance criteria proved that arcswat model has the capacity to reproduce flows that agree with the measured flows at daily time scale simulation and found as applicable over abbay river basin the calibration and validation were done at different subbasins the result revealed that the performance of the model well improved as the basin was partitioned into subbasins for reproduction of the measured flow at different flow segments the model performed very good especially for high and peak flows segments the rainfall distribution revealed that the basin is characterized by high spatial and temporal variation of rainfall three fourth of the annual rainfall was contributed from june to september the water balance components analysis proved that evapotranspiration is high over the basin which covers more than half 55 20 of the annual rainfall water yield wyld qmm covers only 21 73 of the annual rainfall this research can be used as basis to give emphasis on water resources potential modeling in the future considering climate and land use changes graphical abstract ga1 keywords abbay basin hydrological modeling water resources potential water balance components data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction fresh water is essential for human well being and social economic sustainability yuan et al 2016 basis for life in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems jackson et al 2001 quantifying the spatial and temporal availability of water potential is the most important objectives for hydrologists gholamabbas et al 2015 the demand for fresh water correlates with population growth economic development and with changing the living habits of people water scarcity emerges from a combination of hydrological variability and high human use wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2016 and the imbalance between supply and demand of water resources not only restricts the balance of the ecosystem but also affects the sustainable socio economic development zhang et al 2022 modeling the spatial and temporal water resource potential and its variation is crucial for providing the strategic information needed for long term planning developing managing and utilizing the available potential in sustainable ways etefatilahun ashine 2021 it is also vital to partly overcome problems due to data scarcity in the basin gebiyaw et al 2021 since the spatial and temporal detailed information on freshwater availability is so far limited especially for africa schuol et al 2008a 2008b in the current research considerable attention has been paid to surface runoff and subsurface contributions to streams and water storage lakes ponds and wetlands diekkrüger et al 2018 however evapotranspiration from the land surface lakes ponds and wetlands water in unsaturated soil eventually transpired productive flow and evaporated water storage stored in the soil have been gaining attention in recent years junchao et al 2021 quantifying the amount of water resources and its components are very essential for its management planning and development however quantitative assessment of the availability of water resources potential plays a critical role in sustainable water resources management padowski and jawitz 2012 most researches done on abbay river basin has been focused on surface and subsurface runoff and less has been done on detail water balance components for each subbasin for example gebiyaw et al 2021 evaluate the hydrological processes and spatial distribution of the hydrological components of the upper blue nile basin the water budget of the upper blue nile basin was studied by wuletawu et al 2017 using jgrass newage model system and satellite data at daily basis however the water balance components for each subbasins were not studied spatial and temporal variability in hydrological responses of the upper blue nile basin was assessed by tatenda et al 2018 the percentage of precipitation leaving the watersheds through the river drainage ratio was calculated at a monthly resolution the effects of climate change on water resources in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia was assessed malede et al 2022 daniel et al 2021 vincent et al 2018 sintayehu and fulco 2015 etc moreover most hydrological studies in the basin were either limited to small subbasins gragne et al 2008 dessie et al 2014 getachew et al 2017 bitew et al 2019 meseret et al 2020 where better hydrometeorological data are available in general the review if previous research indicated that the detail water resources potential availability and its component for each subbasin were seldom addressed these gaps prompted this research to model in detail the spatiotemporal variability and availability of water resource potential and its components specifically this research focused on the following three specific objectives 1 evaluating the performance of arcswat model at daily time scale and at different flow quantile domain 2 assessing the spatial and seasonal availability and variability of water resources potential 3 quantifying the water balance components for each subbasin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the upper blue nile basin originates from the ethiopian plateau known as abbay in ethiopian is located within 7 5 to 12 north and 34 to 40 east fig 1 the basin has a complex topography ranging from lowlands 500 m a s l near ethio sudan border to mountain ranges 4250 m a s l in the central highlands the basin has an area of about 177 000 sq km excluding rahad and dinder with fourteen subbasin as shown on fig 1 while it is nearly 199 000 sq km including rahad and dinder abbay river basin accounts 17 of ethiopia s land mass and nearly 7 of the nile basin surface area the basin is the major source of the nile water resources which contributes above 60 of the overall river nile flow at aswan dam in egypt mulat and moges 2014 the annual average flow at the outlet from lake tana 3 5 bcm represents about 7 of the total flow at sudan border while at the border average annual discharge is 49 4 bcm with the occurrence of lowest flow april and highest flow august bceom 1999 the basin consists of three seasons from october to the end of february is the dry season from march to may is a short rainy season and june to september is the major rainy season tesemma et al 2010 2 2 hydrological modeling approach for this study the gis interface soil water assessment tool arcswat 2012 was applied swat soil and water assessment tool is a comprehensive semi distributed river basin model arnold et al 2012a 2012b computationally efficient neitsch et al 2011 and applied in addressing hydrologic and environmental issues gassman et al 2007 akoko et al 2021 over abbay river basin arcswat was widely applied for hydrological model and water potential assessment tatenda et al 2018 abeyou et al 2018 meseret et al 2020 gebiyaw et al 2021 sediment management analysis shimelis et al 2010 easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 ali 2014 climate and land use change impact assessment melke and abegaz 2017 wakjira et al 2020 achenafi et al 2020 vincent et al 2018 and is recommended as a permissible modeling tool the model also demonstrated good performance in producing the patterns and trend of the observed discharge which assures the suitability of the swat model for future scenario analysis rebecca et al 2019 thus it was expected that arcswat is powerful model to address our research objectives the model is based on the water balance equation as follows 1 s w t s w 0 t i t r day i q surf i e a i w seep i q gw i where swt is the final soil water content mm swo is the initial soil water content on day i mm t is the time days rday is the amount of precipitation on day i mm qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and qgw is the amount of groundwater flow on day i mm neitsch et al 2011 2 2 1 input data for modeling the arcswat model requires various input data such as soil land use cover meteorological and digital elevation model dem data soil land use and dem with 30 m 30 m resolution data were collected from the ethiopian ministry of water and energy mwe abbay basin authority and eastern nile technical regional office entro the collected soil data was the harmonized world soil database extracted from food and agriculture organization of the united nations whereas land use land cover data were extracted from the global land cover characterization glcc1992 database of the united states geological survey usgs with a spatial resolution of 1 km with 24 land use classes and global land cover 2 glc2000 at a resolution of 1 km for this research to consider the heterogeneity of the basin the land use land cover were reclassified by integrating the two land cover maps as shown in fig 2 b meteorological data including rainfall temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours from 46 meteorological stations fig 2 c were collected from national meteorology agency nma the length of recorded period of those meteorological data were from 1980 to 2016 hydrological data used for calibration and validation of arcswat model were collected from ethiopian ministry of water and energy mwe the recorded period of collected flow data varied from gauge station to gauge station between 1990 and 2014 2 2 2 arcswat modeling process watershed delineation is the first stage for arcswat simulation process dem with 30 m 30 m resolution was applied to delineate the study area though it is possible to setup arcswat for the entire basin of about 177 000 sq km excluding rahad and dinder for this study the basin was divided into two parts i e the upper abbay basin kessie gauge as outlet and the lower abbay basin border gauge as outlet the performance of arcswat were evaluated at multisite including gauges located at major tributary and main abbay river the simulation was thus done step by step in such a way that the outflow of the upper basin used as inflow for the lower basin in the largest basin the performance of the complex model improved when the number of partitioned subbasins was increased getachew et al 2017 this way of model setup is important for abbay river basin known by heterogeneous physical characteristics since it enables to consider those characteristics in the simulation process it is also important to identify the dominant parameters that highly affect the rainfall runoff process for each subbasin and increase the arcswat performance the model was also setup considering the basin as natural condition because we assumed that the existed very few structures have no significant influence on model results the recent researches done over the basin also did not take these few hydraulic structures in their arcswat model setup hydrologic response units hru were defined by overlaying soils land use and slope classes fig 2 a b d respectively the final hrus were defined based on a threshold percentage i e only those land use classes soil units and slope classes in a sub catchment that were greater than the respective threshold value were considered for most applications threshold value of 20 land use 10 soil and 20 slope are adequate winchell et al 2013 but for this research the threshold values of 15 10 and 15 were used for land use soils and slope classes respectively since the default value significantly reduces the heterogeneity of the watershed as the researcher checked in the trial simulation swat weather database was used to generate the wgen statistics the swat weather database efficiently calculating the wgen statistics of several weather stations in a one step run essenfelder 2016 based on the length and availability of meteorological elements i e daily precipitation temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity eight stations from the upper and eleven stations from the lower abbay basin were selected to generate the wgen statistics evapotranspiration is another element in the arcswat water balance component penman monteith monteith 1965 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves hargreaves and zohrab 1985 are available methods in arcswat to estimate evapotranspiration these methods require different meteorological elements as input the hargreaves method requires air temperature only neitsch et al 2009 and it was selected for this research since it was mostly applied in several previous researches done on abbay basin the second phase of the swat hydrologic simulation is the routing phase which consists of the movement of water in the stream network for this study the variable storage method was used to route the flow of water in the channel which is based on a simple continuity equation 2 2 3 model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation sensitivity analysis important to identify the most influential parameters worqlula et al 2018 in sufi 2 there are two types of sensitivity analysis i e global sensitivity analysis and one at a time sensitivity analysis for this study global sensitivity analysis was adopted the arc swat model was run multiple times for each subbasin to identify the most sensitive parameters for each subbasin and then the final sensitive parameters that highly control the flow behavior were summarized into two major categories the upper and lower parts of the abbay basin it is therefore important to detect which parameters are most sensitive on a spatial basis over abbay river basin the t test and p value were used to measure the sensitivity and significance of parameters the t test provides a measure of sensitivity larger absolute values are more sensitive and p values determine the significance of the sensitivity a value close to zero has more significance abbaspour 2014 calibration and validation were performed using sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 in swat cup swat cup provides room for users to manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between auto calibration runs arnold et al 2012a 2012b this is basically important to reduce parameters based on their sensitivity moreover sufi 2 accounts for all sources of uncertainties such as uncertainty in the controlling variables conceptual model parameters and measured data which is computed as the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu hadi et al 2014 the model was set up to simulate the flow at daily time step as one of the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of arcswat model at daily scale calibration and validation were performed at various gauge locations including major tributaries the two gauge points kessie and border were used as control points to calibrate and validate the flow at the main river to which various tributaries contribute from upstream the calibration and validation period vary at each outlet location this is mainly because of variations in the length of time series availability of discharge data at each gauge point thus at kessie gauge station the calibration and validation periods were from 1990 to 2005 and 2006 to 2014 respectively the lower part was calibrated and validated at border didessa guder mugher beles anger fetam and birr gauge stations with various recorded lengths of time between 1990 and 2014 two years of warmup periods were considered the performance of arcswat model was also calibrated and validated at various flow quantile for this research the both simulated and measured flow data were discretized into four groups based on probability of exceedance 0 2 2 20 20 70 and 70 100 and evaluation were undertaken for each group after the model was calibrated and validated and checked its applicability arcswat model was rerun using meteorological input data from 1980 to 2016 keeping physical model parameters constant the simulation results from 1980 to 2016 were used for water balance components analysis 2 2 4 model performance evaluation in order to evaluate the model s performance relative to the observed data the following three performance measures were used nash and sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse correlation coefficient r2 and percent difference between simulated and observed data pbias nash and sutcliffe 1970 calibration for hydrology at a p bias 15 r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 is acceptable santhi et al 2007 the performance ranges at various time scales are shown in table 1 the capability of the arcswat model to capture uncertainty was also evaluated based on p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2007 the p factor is the percentage of the measured data bracketed by the 95ppu this index provides a measure of the model s ability to capture uncertainties the r factor on the other hand is a measure of the quality of the calibration and indicates the thickness of the 95ppu arnold et al 2012a 2012b ideally the range of values as p factor 100 and r factor 0 indicates good quality of data and models ability to capture uncertainty under less stringent model quality requirements the p factor 0 5 and r factor 1 3 are still sufficient schuol et al 2008a 2008b 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and seasonal rainfall distribution rainfall across ethiopia is very seasonal there are three seasons locally named major rainy season june september which is dominated by major rainfall belg feb may short rainy season and bega october january brings generally dry weather to central and northern ethiopia global guidance unit ggu 2016 these classifications however slightly vary in the southern parts of the country characterized by bimodal rainfall pattern with rainfall periods from march to may and from september to november wogayehu et al 2018 for this study seasons were classified as major rainy season june september minor rainy season february may and dry season october january since the local terms are not repeatable to the international reader the long term daily rainfall 1980 2016 from 46 meteorological stations fig 2 c over the basin were averaged on monthly seasonally and annual basis and interpolated by inverse distance weighting idw method to make spatial surfaces and assess its distribution as shown in fig 3 the annual rainfall varied from 904 51 mm to 2161 68 mm subbasins such as didessa eastern part of dabus wonbera southern part of anger upper part of beles southern south eastern part of tana basin and western part of gojam received from mid to high rainfall depth central parts lower part of north gojam welaka beshilo jemma most downstream part of the basin near ethio sudan border and the south east parts guder and mugher are relatively defined by low to mid rainfall depth in major jjas rainy season the rainfall depth varied from 722 91 mm to 1761 19 mm while in minor fmam rainy season it varied from 82 12 mm to 400 19 mm with regard to percentage of occurrence from 53 78 to 88 72 of the total annual rainfall occurred from june to september and the remaining fractions were occurred during minor rainy and dry season the long term average rainfall depicted that 73 4 16 43 and 10 21 of the total annual rainfall occurred in major rainy minor rainy and dry seasons respectively the result of this research strongly coincide with previous research results getachew et al 2021 abeer et al 2019 erwin et al 2017 3 2 sensitivity analysis results there are about 23 physical parameters that controlee the rainfall runoff process in arcswat model ashraf and ahmet 2013 for abbay basin those 23 parameters were included to identify the most influential swat parameters on predicting flow components based on the t test the larger absolute value the more sensitive and p value a value close to zero is more significant 11 parameters were found as sensitive for the upper part of abbay basin table 2 soil conservation service scs runoff curve number a cn2 mgt was the most sensitive parameter that affects the simulation result available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol and surface runoff lag time v surlag bsn were the second and third sensitive parameters controlling the flow simulation generally table 2 indicates the rank of sensitivity of parameters from up to downward for the lower part of abbay river basin before calibration and validation at each gauge point was undertaken sensitivity analysis was done for the entire basin from kassie to the border by considering border gauge station table 3 indicated the sensitivity analysis results ranked with their level of sensitivity and significance similar to the upper parts of the basin 11 parameters were found as sensitive for lower parts of the basin scs runoff curve number a cn2 mgt and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol were the first and second most sensitive parameters from both upper and lower part of sensitivity analysis result the final fitted value for effective channel hydraulic conductivity ch k2 rte seems high according to arnold et al 2012a 2012b the result of this research revealed that the river bed over abbay basin are characterized from moderate to very high loss rates this is because the channel bed materials are dominated by sand and gravel table 2 and table 3 showed that sensitive parameter types were found to be similar in both the upper and lower parts of the abbay river basin however their sensitivity ranks varied from upper to lower except for the first and last two parameters those sensitive parameters table 3 were used for calibration and validation at didessa beles anger birr guder muger and fetam gauge stations the final fitted values of parameters for seven subbasins are shown in table 4 the result confirmed that though similar sensitive parameters types were used for calibration their final fitted values were different across seven subbasins this indicates the various characteristics of subbasins such as topography land management practices or rainfall patterns 3 3 calibration and validation result the calibration and validation of simulated results against measured values for the entire abbay basin at various gauge locations is shown in table 5 although absolute criteria for judging model performance have yet to be established arnold et al 2012a 2012b moriasi et al 2007 2015 defined the values of r2 and nse to weigh the performance of models table 1 the performance of the arcswat model at border gauge station indicated r2 0 79 and nse 0 76 and the validation result verified r2 0 72 and nse 0 71 while at kessie gauge station r2 nse was 0 74 0 69 during calibration and 0 73 0 69 during validation the model was also calibrated and validated at various major tributaries where measured gauge data are available this is important to assess the spatial water potential availability throughout the entire abbay basin starting from the most upstream sub basin lake tana sub basin to the border thus arcswat model s applicability was assessed at seven sub basins beles anger didessa birr guder mugher and fetam as the result indicated table 5 the performance of the model varied between sub basins at calibration stage r2 varied from 0 71 birr to 0 82 didessa and nse from 0 61 guder and 0 8 didessa and mugher while at validation stage r2 varied from 0 69 guder to 0 8 didessa and nse from 0 63 guder and 0 75 beles birr and mugher the least model performance was shown at guder subbasin in some calibration points nonetheless the input parameters were similar the model was well performed at validation stage than at calibration stage and the reverse was true for other gauge points this performance variation may possibly due to differences in quality of data mainly the rainfall and measured flows in calibration and validation stage the meteorological and hydrological data quality my subject to several errors such as incorrect or inaccurate data entered mistyped data and malfunctioning of instrumentation inadequate documentation human errors anomalies in the field data collection periodic malfunctioning of sensors abnormal values and data gaps faybishenko et al 2021 the performance of the arcswat model was also evaluated based on its capability to capture uncertainties with 95ppu using p factor and r factor for the upper part of the abbay basin the p factor and r factor were 0 73 73 and 0 81 respectively for the lower part of the abbay basin p factor and r factor were 0 74 74 and 1 03 respectively based on schuol et al 2008a 2008b in which p factor 0 5 and r factor 1 3 are sufficient the arcswat model for the abbay basin achieved the acceptable range the model efficiency was also evaluated based on the percent of difference between simulated and measured values the graphical visualization fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 revealed that arcswat model both underestimated and overestimated in various calibration and validation period the model specially lacks to capture peak flows in some periods and overestimated the peak flow in some other period however the aggregated differences between measured and simulated values over the entire calibration and validation period revealed overestimation of flow table 5 column six pbias values oscillated between 3 5 and 13 the negative values showed the overestimation of the model the minimum absolute value 3 5 was for didessa while the maximum absolute value 13 was for lower fetam gauge station overall the model performed well falling within the tolerable ranges defined by moriasi et al 2015 previous research done over the abbay river basin using the arcswat model meseret et al 2020 wakjira et al 2020 belay et al 2021 gemechu et al 2021 gebiyaw et al 2021 were also with in the acceptable ranges the calibration and validation of this research at daily time scale also showed good performances after evaluated with multi criteria generally from the statistical performance criteria and graphical visualization it can be concluded that the arcswat model has the capacity to simulate flows that agree with the measured values and is applicable over the abbay river basin at different spatial scales the simulated discharge may be used as an alternative data source in areas where measured flow is not available or a high missed value is a problem for the intended purpose 3 4 swat performance at different quantile domain the previous performance evaluation table 5 was based on aggregated simulated and measured flows for the entire calibration and validation periods evaluating the performance of arcswat model with various quantile domain is essential this allowed us to evaluate the model s ability to simulate various segments of the hydrograph governed by different hydrological processes vinod et al 2018 flow duration curves fdc are important tools for evaluating model performance since it assist in evaluating the reproduction of discharges of different magnitudes yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and used for hydrological behavior interpretation thalli et al 2020 fig 7 indicated the flow duration curve fdc of various simulation and measured flow combinations at two major gauge points kessie and border gauge stations the flow duration curve covers the daily data from 1999 to 2005 border and 1992 2014 kessie which is similar for the data period used in fig 4 from graphical visualization it can be concluded that in most of flow segments the model overestimates as compared to measured value the percent of bias pbias indicated in table 6 also supported the graphical visualization regarding overestimation of the model performance of arcswat model was evaluated at different flow magnitudes in this section kling gupta efficiency kge proposed by gupta et al 2019 was also applied since it addresses several shortcomings in nse and is increasingly used for model calibration and evaluation wouter et al 2019 the results of evaluation were shown in table 6 for peak and high flow segments the arcswat model performed very well within the acceptable range of evaluation criteria both at calibration and validation stage for the two flow segments r2 kge and nse values were from 0 83 to 0 98 0 62 to 0 95 and 0 64 to 0 94 respectively the results of performance for mid and low flow segments however indicated some inconsistency as it can be seen in table 6 for mid flows r2 kge and nse values were within the tolerable ranges at the two gauge points except validation result at kessie gauge point where the low value of kge and nse 0 3 and 0 46 respectively were found for low flow 70 100 at border gauge point the kge and nse values were low both at calibration and validation stages for this research inconsistency of evaluation result for mid and low flow didn t indicate the models inability to capture the flows this is because with similar flow segments it was found contradicted evaluation results at calibration and validation stage on the other hand the overall aggregated evaluation results at calibration and validation stage see table 5 proved reasonable performance of the model thus the low values of kge and nse possibly due to model input data quality such as rainfall and quality of measured flow data the poor data quality may be due to different causes as described by chao et al 2015 3 5 water balance results modeling the spatial dynamics of water balance components will provide important information for the management of water resources gabriel et al 2009 in this research abbay basin water balance components were done for each subbasin with the model simulation results from 1980 to 2016 the main components considered for analysis were precipitation precipmm potential evapotranspiration petmm actual evapotranspiration etmm surface runoff surqmm ground water flow gw qmm lateral flow lat qmm and total water yield wyldmm table 7 shows results of the water balance components for the major subbasins the spatial distribution of water balance components were shown in fig 8 annual average rainfall varied from 904 52 mm welaka to 2161 68 mm anger the southern guder didessa fincha and anger subbasins and northern tana subbasin parts of the basin are characterized by annual average rainfall between 1600 mm and 2200 mm while beshilo north gojam mugher beles wonbera and south gojam subbasins received annual rainfall between 1000 mm and 1550 mm as compared to other subbasins welaka jemma and dabus subbasins were characterized by low annual rainfall depth between 900 mm and 950 mm the potential evapotranspiration over the basin varied from 1289 28 mm to 1998 85 mm the maximum potential evapotranspiration 1701 8 1998 85 mm was observed over didessa south gojam tana dabus and beles subbasins the highest value of pet 1998 85 mm was observed in beles subbasin the central part of the basin north and south gojam wonbera fincha and anger the pet varied from 1457 98 mm to 1646 79 mm whereas in eastern and south eastern parts primarily jemma beshilo welaka and mugher pet was between 1298 28 mm and 1378 81 mm the results of the annual et revealed that the variation rages from 443 87 mm to 1051 01 mm table 7 and fig 8 c the maximum et was observed in the most upstream part of the basin tana basin while the minimum et was shown in the eastern part mainly welaka jemma and parts of the beshilo subbasin the trend of et over the basin indicated a decreasing trend from north to south except for the anger subbasin and west to east the et result of this research is consistent with the previous research allam et al 2016 gebiyaw et al 2021 the ratio of evapotranspiration et and water yield wyld to the rainfall was shown in fig 8 e fig 8 f respectively the percent of et varied from 30 23 to 66 34 and on average 55 20 of the total rainfall was escaped as et the et result of this research almost equal with the previous research work by wuletawu et al 2017 the annual depth of water that is left at each subbasin outlet in the form of runoff wyld is the other basic water balance component modeling the wyld of each subbasin is important for planning developing and managing water resources based on their availability the annual water yield varied from subbasin to subbasin between 183 60 mm and 411 79 mm the maximum water yield was shown in the downstream part of the basin while the minimum water yield was indicated in the south east parts mugher and guder subbasin the minimum maximum fig 8 f and average percent of water yield to total rainfall were 11 79 34 28 and 21 73 respectively the result of the water yield fraction is similar to research done by gebiyaw et al 2021 assessing the seasonal variation of the components within a year is very essential fig 9 shows the seasonal distribution of water balance components the segment of surface runoff surqmm ground water flow gw qmm lateral flow lat qmm and total water yield wyldmm were done with different season of the year the average annual contribution of surqmm to wyldmm was 26 01 in major rainy season minor rainy season and dry season the percent of contribution of surqmm varied from 5 64 to 39 16 0 65 to 7 36 and 0 2 to 4 53 respectively fig 9 a d as it is depicted in fig 9 a d in major and minor rainy seasons the contribution of surqmm is higher in eastern and parts of abbay basin mainly beshilo welaka jemma and n gojam whereas in dry season it is reversed the eastern abbay basin topography represents the highlands ragged mountainous and land cover is primarily characterized by dominantly cultivated denekew and bekele 2009 which facilitates surface runoff than the rainfall infiltrates in to subsurface minimum fraction of sur q to wyld q was found in tana basin in the major rainy season the availability of lakes affects flow regimes by changing the magnitude of stream flow usually by attenuating flows zuzanna et al 2017 the reduced fraction of sur q to wyld q for tana basin may be affected by the presence of lake tana but it needs further research on lake effects on stream out flow and model performance gwq to wyld covers the largest portion an average annual 65 5 the fraction of gw q to wyld q on a seasonal basis varied from 28 56 to 59 76 major rainy season 0 24 to 11 78 minor rainy season and 0 82 to 37 31 dry season gw q to wyld q is at its highest value over tana subbasin during the dry season the third component of water yield is lateral flow the lat q to wyld ratio in major and minor rainy season varied from 3 46 to 10 95 and 0 05 to 1 81 respectively the annual average lateral flow over the basin was found as 8 5 quantifying the spatial and temporal availability of water resources is important for planning managing and developing resources on sustainable ways 4 conclusion this study provided a comprehensive assessment of water resources potential and its components over abbay river basin using arcswat model at daily simulation scale inverse distance weighting idw method was applied to make spatial surface of water balance components the spatial distribution rain fall over abbay basin indicated that the basin is characterized by high annual and seasonal variation of rainfall depth the aggregated calibration and validation result revealed that arcswat model has the capacity to simulate flows that agree with the measured values and is applicable over the abbay river basin at different spatial scales the identified sensitive parameters that highly affect the rainfall runoff process for each subbasins will be used as basis for future reaches on abbay river basin using sawt model the calibration and validation of the model at different flow segments using fdc also showed a reasonable model efficiency arcswat model well performed for disaggregated flows peak high mid and low flows evaluated independently that resembled the measured flow the spatio temporal assessment of water balance components of the abbay river basin are very important for various purposes as the basin is a potential source of water for the entire nile flow the quantitative results of the water balance components are essential in planning developing and managing process of the resources especially the assessment result of evapotranspiration is very important for its management and improves agricultural yields over the basin moreover due to the transboundary nature of the river it is subjected to complexities regarding utilization planning developing and managing water resources thus the result of this research will provide deep insight for policymakers professionals experts and any other concerned bodies finally this research was based on considerations that exclude climate change impacts the soil moisture storage component was not also considered thus we suggest to do researches considering climate

7855,study region abbay river basin ethiopia study focus this research focused on assessing the spatio temporal availability and variability of water resources potential using physically based hydrological model the availability and spatial variability of water balance components were modeled for each subbasins of abbay river basin new hydrological insights for the region multi statistical performance criteria proved that arcswat model has the capacity to reproduce flows that agree with the measured flows at daily time scale simulation and found as applicable over abbay river basin the calibration and validation were done at different subbasins the result revealed that the performance of the model well improved as the basin was partitioned into subbasins for reproduction of the measured flow at different flow segments the model performed very good especially for high and peak flows segments the rainfall distribution revealed that the basin is characterized by high spatial and temporal variation of rainfall three fourth of the annual rainfall was contributed from june to september the water balance components analysis proved that evapotranspiration is high over the basin which covers more than half 55 20 of the annual rainfall water yield wyld qmm covers only 21 73 of the annual rainfall this research can be used as basis to give emphasis on water resources potential modeling in the future considering climate and land use changes graphical abstract ga1 keywords abbay basin hydrological modeling water resources potential water balance components data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction fresh water is essential for human well being and social economic sustainability yuan et al 2016 basis for life in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems jackson et al 2001 quantifying the spatial and temporal availability of water potential is the most important objectives for hydrologists gholamabbas et al 2015 the demand for fresh water correlates with population growth economic development and with changing the living habits of people water scarcity emerges from a combination of hydrological variability and high human use wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2016 and the imbalance between supply and demand of water resources not only restricts the balance of the ecosystem but also affects the sustainable socio economic development zhang et al 2022 modeling the spatial and temporal water resource potential and its variation is crucial for providing the strategic information needed for long term planning developing managing and utilizing the available potential in sustainable ways etefatilahun ashine 2021 it is also vital to partly overcome problems due to data scarcity in the basin gebiyaw et al 2021 since the spatial and temporal detailed information on freshwater availability is so far limited especially for africa schuol et al 2008a 2008b in the current research considerable attention has been paid to surface runoff and subsurface contributions to streams and water storage lakes ponds and wetlands diekkrüger et al 2018 however evapotranspiration from the land surface lakes ponds and wetlands water in unsaturated soil eventually transpired productive flow and evaporated water storage stored in the soil have been gaining attention in recent years junchao et al 2021 quantifying the amount of water resources and its components are very essential for its management planning and development however quantitative assessment of the availability of water resources potential plays a critical role in sustainable water resources management padowski and jawitz 2012 most researches done on abbay river basin has been focused on surface and subsurface runoff and less has been done on detail water balance components for each subbasin for example gebiyaw et al 2021 evaluate the hydrological processes and spatial distribution of the hydrological components of the upper blue nile basin the water budget of the upper blue nile basin was studied by wuletawu et al 2017 using jgrass newage model system and satellite data at daily basis however the water balance components for each subbasins were not studied spatial and temporal variability in hydrological responses of the upper blue nile basin was assessed by tatenda et al 2018 the percentage of precipitation leaving the watersheds through the river drainage ratio was calculated at a monthly resolution the effects of climate change on water resources in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia was assessed malede et al 2022 daniel et al 2021 vincent et al 2018 sintayehu and fulco 2015 etc moreover most hydrological studies in the basin were either limited to small subbasins gragne et al 2008 dessie et al 2014 getachew et al 2017 bitew et al 2019 meseret et al 2020 where better hydrometeorological data are available in general the review if previous research indicated that the detail water resources potential availability and its component for each subbasin were seldom addressed these gaps prompted this research to model in detail the spatiotemporal variability and availability of water resource potential and its components specifically this research focused on the following three specific objectives 1 evaluating the performance of arcswat model at daily time scale and at different flow quantile domain 2 assessing the spatial and seasonal availability and variability of water resources potential 3 quantifying the water balance components for each subbasin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the upper blue nile basin originates from the ethiopian plateau known as abbay in ethiopian is located within 7 5 to 12 north and 34 to 40 east fig 1 the basin has a complex topography ranging from lowlands 500 m a s l near ethio sudan border to mountain ranges 4250 m a s l in the central highlands the basin has an area of about 177 000 sq km excluding rahad and dinder with fourteen subbasin as shown on fig 1 while it is nearly 199 000 sq km including rahad and dinder abbay river basin accounts 17 of ethiopia s land mass and nearly 7 of the nile basin surface area the basin is the major source of the nile water resources which contributes above 60 of the overall river nile flow at aswan dam in egypt mulat and moges 2014 the annual average flow at the outlet from lake tana 3 5 bcm represents about 7 of the total flow at sudan border while at the border average annual discharge is 49 4 bcm with the occurrence of lowest flow april and highest flow august bceom 1999 the basin consists of three seasons from october to the end of february is the dry season from march to may is a short rainy season and june to september is the major rainy season tesemma et al 2010 2 2 hydrological modeling approach for this study the gis interface soil water assessment tool arcswat 2012 was applied swat soil and water assessment tool is a comprehensive semi distributed river basin model arnold et al 2012a 2012b computationally efficient neitsch et al 2011 and applied in addressing hydrologic and environmental issues gassman et al 2007 akoko et al 2021 over abbay river basin arcswat was widely applied for hydrological model and water potential assessment tatenda et al 2018 abeyou et al 2018 meseret et al 2020 gebiyaw et al 2021 sediment management analysis shimelis et al 2010 easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 ali 2014 climate and land use change impact assessment melke and abegaz 2017 wakjira et al 2020 achenafi et al 2020 vincent et al 2018 and is recommended as a permissible modeling tool the model also demonstrated good performance in producing the patterns and trend of the observed discharge which assures the suitability of the swat model for future scenario analysis rebecca et al 2019 thus it was expected that arcswat is powerful model to address our research objectives the model is based on the water balance equation as follows 1 s w t s w 0 t i t r day i q surf i e a i w seep i q gw i where swt is the final soil water content mm swo is the initial soil water content on day i mm t is the time days rday is the amount of precipitation on day i mm qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and qgw is the amount of groundwater flow on day i mm neitsch et al 2011 2 2 1 input data for modeling the arcswat model requires various input data such as soil land use cover meteorological and digital elevation model dem data soil land use and dem with 30 m 30 m resolution data were collected from the ethiopian ministry of water and energy mwe abbay basin authority and eastern nile technical regional office entro the collected soil data was the harmonized world soil database extracted from food and agriculture organization of the united nations whereas land use land cover data were extracted from the global land cover characterization glcc1992 database of the united states geological survey usgs with a spatial resolution of 1 km with 24 land use classes and global land cover 2 glc2000 at a resolution of 1 km for this research to consider the heterogeneity of the basin the land use land cover were reclassified by integrating the two land cover maps as shown in fig 2 b meteorological data including rainfall temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours from 46 meteorological stations fig 2 c were collected from national meteorology agency nma the length of recorded period of those meteorological data were from 1980 to 2016 hydrological data used for calibration and validation of arcswat model were collected from ethiopian ministry of water and energy mwe the recorded period of collected flow data varied from gauge station to gauge station between 1990 and 2014 2 2 2 arcswat modeling process watershed delineation is the first stage for arcswat simulation process dem with 30 m 30 m resolution was applied to delineate the study area though it is possible to setup arcswat for the entire basin of about 177 000 sq km excluding rahad and dinder for this study the basin was divided into two parts i e the upper abbay basin kessie gauge as outlet and the lower abbay basin border gauge as outlet the performance of arcswat were evaluated at multisite including gauges located at major tributary and main abbay river the simulation was thus done step by step in such a way that the outflow of the upper basin used as inflow for the lower basin in the largest basin the performance of the complex model improved when the number of partitioned subbasins was increased getachew et al 2017 this way of model setup is important for abbay river basin known by heterogeneous physical characteristics since it enables to consider those characteristics in the simulation process it is also important to identify the dominant parameters that highly affect the rainfall runoff process for each subbasin and increase the arcswat performance the model was also setup considering the basin as natural condition because we assumed that the existed very few structures have no significant influence on model results the recent researches done over the basin also did not take these few hydraulic structures in their arcswat model setup hydrologic response units hru were defined by overlaying soils land use and slope classes fig 2 a b d respectively the final hrus were defined based on a threshold percentage i e only those land use classes soil units and slope classes in a sub catchment that were greater than the respective threshold value were considered for most applications threshold value of 20 land use 10 soil and 20 slope are adequate winchell et al 2013 but for this research the threshold values of 15 10 and 15 were used for land use soils and slope classes respectively since the default value significantly reduces the heterogeneity of the watershed as the researcher checked in the trial simulation swat weather database was used to generate the wgen statistics the swat weather database efficiently calculating the wgen statistics of several weather stations in a one step run essenfelder 2016 based on the length and availability of meteorological elements i e daily precipitation temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity eight stations from the upper and eleven stations from the lower abbay basin were selected to generate the wgen statistics evapotranspiration is another element in the arcswat water balance component penman monteith monteith 1965 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves hargreaves and zohrab 1985 are available methods in arcswat to estimate evapotranspiration these methods require different meteorological elements as input the hargreaves method requires air temperature only neitsch et al 2009 and it was selected for this research since it was mostly applied in several previous researches done on abbay basin the second phase of the swat hydrologic simulation is the routing phase which consists of the movement of water in the stream network for this study the variable storage method was used to route the flow of water in the channel which is based on a simple continuity equation 2 2 3 model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation sensitivity analysis important to identify the most influential parameters worqlula et al 2018 in sufi 2 there are two types of sensitivity analysis i e global sensitivity analysis and one at a time sensitivity analysis for this study global sensitivity analysis was adopted the arc swat model was run multiple times for each subbasin to identify the most sensitive parameters for each subbasin and then the final sensitive parameters that highly control the flow behavior were summarized into two major categories the upper and lower parts of the abbay basin it is therefore important to detect which parameters are most sensitive on a spatial basis over abbay river basin the t test and p value were used to measure the sensitivity and significance of parameters the t test provides a measure of sensitivity larger absolute values are more sensitive and p values determine the significance of the sensitivity a value close to zero has more significance abbaspour 2014 calibration and validation were performed using sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 in swat cup swat cup provides room for users to manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between auto calibration runs arnold et al 2012a 2012b this is basically important to reduce parameters based on their sensitivity moreover sufi 2 accounts for all sources of uncertainties such as uncertainty in the controlling variables conceptual model parameters and measured data which is computed as the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu hadi et al 2014 the model was set up to simulate the flow at daily time step as one of the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of arcswat model at daily scale calibration and validation were performed at various gauge locations including major tributaries the two gauge points kessie and border were used as control points to calibrate and validate the flow at the main river to which various tributaries contribute from upstream the calibration and validation period vary at each outlet location this is mainly because of variations in the length of time series availability of discharge data at each gauge point thus at kessie gauge station the calibration and validation periods were from 1990 to 2005 and 2006 to 2014 respectively the lower part was calibrated and validated at border didessa guder mugher beles anger fetam and birr gauge stations with various recorded lengths of time between 1990 and 2014 two years of warmup periods were considered the performance of arcswat model was also calibrated and validated at various flow quantile for this research the both simulated and measured flow data were discretized into four groups based on probability of exceedance 0 2 2 20 20 70 and 70 100 and evaluation were undertaken for each group after the model was calibrated and validated and checked its applicability arcswat model was rerun using meteorological input data from 1980 to 2016 keeping physical model parameters constant the simulation results from 1980 to 2016 were used for water balance components analysis 2 2 4 model performance evaluation in order to evaluate the model s performance relative to the observed data the following three performance measures were used nash and sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse correlation coefficient r2 and percent difference between simulated and observed data pbias nash and sutcliffe 1970 calibration for hydrology at a p bias 15 r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 is acceptable santhi et al 2007 the performance ranges at various time scales are shown in table 1 the capability of the arcswat model to capture uncertainty was also evaluated based on p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2007 the p factor is the percentage of the measured data bracketed by the 95ppu this index provides a measure of the model s ability to capture uncertainties the r factor on the other hand is a measure of the quality of the calibration and indicates the thickness of the 95ppu arnold et al 2012a 2012b ideally the range of values as p factor 100 and r factor 0 indicates good quality of data and models ability to capture uncertainty under less stringent model quality requirements the p factor 0 5 and r factor 1 3 are still sufficient schuol et al 2008a 2008b 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and seasonal rainfall distribution rainfall across ethiopia is very seasonal there are three seasons locally named major rainy season june september which is dominated by major rainfall belg feb may short rainy season and bega october january brings generally dry weather to central and northern ethiopia global guidance unit ggu 2016 these classifications however slightly vary in the southern parts of the country characterized by bimodal rainfall pattern with rainfall periods from march to may and from september to november wogayehu et al 2018 for this study seasons were classified as major rainy season june september minor rainy season february may and dry season october january since the local terms are not repeatable to the international reader the long term daily rainfall 1980 2016 from 46 meteorological stations fig 2 c over the basin were averaged on monthly seasonally and annual basis and interpolated by inverse distance weighting idw method to make spatial surfaces and assess its distribution as shown in fig 3 the annual rainfall varied from 904 51 mm to 2161 68 mm subbasins such as didessa eastern part of dabus wonbera southern part of anger upper part of beles southern south eastern part of tana basin and western part of gojam received from mid to high rainfall depth central parts lower part of north gojam welaka beshilo jemma most downstream part of the basin near ethio sudan border and the south east parts guder and mugher are relatively defined by low to mid rainfall depth in major jjas rainy season the rainfall depth varied from 722 91 mm to 1761 19 mm while in minor fmam rainy season it varied from 82 12 mm to 400 19 mm with regard to percentage of occurrence from 53 78 to 88 72 of the total annual rainfall occurred from june to september and the remaining fractions were occurred during minor rainy and dry season the long term average rainfall depicted that 73 4 16 43 and 10 21 of the total annual rainfall occurred in major rainy minor rainy and dry seasons respectively the result of this research strongly coincide with previous research results getachew et al 2021 abeer et al 2019 erwin et al 2017 3 2 sensitivity analysis results there are about 23 physical parameters that controlee the rainfall runoff process in arcswat model ashraf and ahmet 2013 for abbay basin those 23 parameters were included to identify the most influential swat parameters on predicting flow components based on the t test the larger absolute value the more sensitive and p value a value close to zero is more significant 11 parameters were found as sensitive for the upper part of abbay basin table 2 soil conservation service scs runoff curve number a cn2 mgt was the most sensitive parameter that affects the simulation result available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol and surface runoff lag time v surlag bsn were the second and third sensitive parameters controlling the flow simulation generally table 2 indicates the rank of sensitivity of parameters from up to downward for the lower part of abbay river basin before calibration and validation at each gauge point was undertaken sensitivity analysis was done for the entire basin from kassie to the border by considering border gauge station table 3 indicated the sensitivity analysis results ranked with their level of sensitivity and significance similar to the upper parts of the basin 11 parameters were found as sensitive for lower parts of the basin scs runoff curve number a cn2 mgt and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol were the first and second most sensitive parameters from both upper and lower part of sensitivity analysis result the final fitted value for effective channel hydraulic conductivity ch k2 rte seems high according to arnold et al 2012a 2012b the result of this research revealed that the river bed over abbay basin are characterized from moderate to very high loss rates this is because the channel bed materials are dominated by sand and gravel table 2 and table 3 showed that sensitive parameter types were found to be similar in both the upper and lower parts of the abbay river basin however their sensitivity ranks varied from upper to lower except for the first and last two parameters those sensitive parameters table 3 were used for calibration and validation at didessa beles anger birr guder muger and fetam gauge stations the final fitted values of parameters for seven subbasins are shown in table 4 the result confirmed that though similar sensitive parameters types were used for calibration their final fitted values were different across seven subbasins this indicates the various characteristics of subbasins such as topography land management practices or rainfall patterns 3 3 calibration and validation result the calibration and validation of simulated results against measured values for the entire abbay basin at various gauge locations is shown in table 5 although absolute criteria for judging model performance have yet to be established arnold et al 2012a 2012b moriasi et al 2007 2015 defined the values of r2 and nse to weigh the performance of models table 1 the performance of the arcswat model at border gauge station indicated r2 0 79 and nse 0 76 and the validation result verified r2 0 72 and nse 0 71 while at kessie gauge station r2 nse was 0 74 0 69 during calibration and 0 73 0 69 during validation the model was also calibrated and validated at various major tributaries where measured gauge data are available this is important to assess the spatial water potential availability throughout the entire abbay basin starting from the most upstream sub basin lake tana sub basin to the border thus arcswat model s applicability was assessed at seven sub basins beles anger didessa birr guder mugher and fetam as the result indicated table 5 the performance of the model varied between sub basins at calibration stage r2 varied from 0 71 birr to 0 82 didessa and nse from 0 61 guder and 0 8 didessa and mugher while at validation stage r2 varied from 0 69 guder to 0 8 didessa and nse from 0 63 guder and 0 75 beles birr and mugher the least model performance was shown at guder subbasin in some calibration points nonetheless the input parameters were similar the model was well performed at validation stage than at calibration stage and the reverse was true for other gauge points this performance variation may possibly due to differences in quality of data mainly the rainfall and measured flows in calibration and validation stage the meteorological and hydrological data quality my subject to several errors such as incorrect or inaccurate data entered mistyped data and malfunctioning of instrumentation inadequate documentation human errors anomalies in the field data collection periodic malfunctioning of sensors abnormal values and data gaps faybishenko et al 2021 the performance of the arcswat model was also evaluated based on its capability to capture uncertainties with 95ppu using p factor and r factor for the upper part of the abbay basin the p factor and r factor were 0 73 73 and 0 81 respectively for the lower part of the abbay basin p factor and r factor were 0 74 74 and 1 03 respectively based on schuol et al 2008a 2008b in which p factor 0 5 and r factor 1 3 are sufficient the arcswat model for the abbay basin achieved the acceptable range the model efficiency was also evaluated based on the percent of difference between simulated and measured values the graphical visualization fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 revealed that arcswat model both underestimated and overestimated in various calibration and validation period the model specially lacks to capture peak flows in some periods and overestimated the peak flow in some other period however the aggregated differences between measured and simulated values over the entire calibration and validation period revealed overestimation of flow table 5 column six pbias values oscillated between 3 5 and 13 the negative values showed the overestimation of the model the minimum absolute value 3 5 was for didessa while the maximum absolute value 13 was for lower fetam gauge station overall the model performed well falling within the tolerable ranges defined by moriasi et al 2015 previous research done over the abbay river basin using the arcswat model meseret et al 2020 wakjira et al 2020 belay et al 2021 gemechu et al 2021 gebiyaw et al 2021 were also with in the acceptable ranges the calibration and validation of this research at daily time scale also showed good performances after evaluated with multi criteria generally from the statistical performance criteria and graphical visualization it can be concluded that the arcswat model has the capacity to simulate flows that agree with the measured values and is applicable over the abbay river basin at different spatial scales the simulated discharge may be used as an alternative data source in areas where measured flow is not available or a high missed value is a problem for the intended purpose 3 4 swat performance at different quantile domain the previous performance evaluation table 5 was based on aggregated simulated and measured flows for the entire calibration and validation periods evaluating the performance of arcswat model with various quantile domain is essential this allowed us to evaluate the model s ability to simulate various segments of the hydrograph governed by different hydrological processes vinod et al 2018 flow duration curves fdc are important tools for evaluating model performance since it assist in evaluating the reproduction of discharges of different magnitudes yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and used for hydrological behavior interpretation thalli et al 2020 fig 7 indicated the flow duration curve fdc of various simulation and measured flow combinations at two major gauge points kessie and border gauge stations the flow duration curve covers the daily data from 1999 to 2005 border and 1992 2014 kessie which is similar for the data period used in fig 4 from graphical visualization it can be concluded that in most of flow segments the model overestimates as compared to measured value the percent of bias pbias indicated in table 6 also supported the graphical visualization regarding overestimation of the model performance of arcswat model was evaluated at different flow magnitudes in this section kling gupta efficiency kge proposed by gupta et al 2019 was also applied since it addresses several shortcomings in nse and is increasingly used for model calibration and evaluation wouter et al 2019 the results of evaluation were shown in table 6 for peak and high flow segments the arcswat model performed very well within the acceptable range of evaluation criteria both at calibration and validation stage for the two flow segments r2 kge and nse values were from 0 83 to 0 98 0 62 to 0 95 and 0 64 to 0 94 respectively the results of performance for mid and low flow segments however indicated some inconsistency as it can be seen in table 6 for mid flows r2 kge and nse values were within the tolerable ranges at the two gauge points except validation result at kessie gauge point where the low value of kge and nse 0 3 and 0 46 respectively were found for low flow 70 100 at border gauge point the kge and nse values were low both at calibration and validation stages for this research inconsistency of evaluation result for mid and low flow didn t indicate the models inability to capture the flows this is because with similar flow segments it was found contradicted evaluation results at calibration and validation stage on the other hand the overall aggregated evaluation results at calibration and validation stage see table 5 proved reasonable performance of the model thus the low values of kge and nse possibly due to model input data quality such as rainfall and quality of measured flow data the poor data quality may be due to different causes as described by chao et al 2015 3 5 water balance results modeling the spatial dynamics of water balance components will provide important information for the management of water resources gabriel et al 2009 in this research abbay basin water balance components were done for each subbasin with the model simulation results from 1980 to 2016 the main components considered for analysis were precipitation precipmm potential evapotranspiration petmm actual evapotranspiration etmm surface runoff surqmm ground water flow gw qmm lateral flow lat qmm and total water yield wyldmm table 7 shows results of the water balance components for the major subbasins the spatial distribution of water balance components were shown in fig 8 annual average rainfall varied from 904 52 mm welaka to 2161 68 mm anger the southern guder didessa fincha and anger subbasins and northern tana subbasin parts of the basin are characterized by annual average rainfall between 1600 mm and 2200 mm while beshilo north gojam mugher beles wonbera and south gojam subbasins received annual rainfall between 1000 mm and 1550 mm as compared to other subbasins welaka jemma and dabus subbasins were characterized by low annual rainfall depth between 900 mm and 950 mm the potential evapotranspiration over the basin varied from 1289 28 mm to 1998 85 mm the maximum potential evapotranspiration 1701 8 1998 85 mm was observed over didessa south gojam tana dabus and beles subbasins the highest value of pet 1998 85 mm was observed in beles subbasin the central part of the basin north and south gojam wonbera fincha and anger the pet varied from 1457 98 mm to 1646 79 mm whereas in eastern and south eastern parts primarily jemma beshilo welaka and mugher pet was between 1298 28 mm and 1378 81 mm the results of the annual et revealed that the variation rages from 443 87 mm to 1051 01 mm table 7 and fig 8 c the maximum et was observed in the most upstream part of the basin tana basin while the minimum et was shown in the eastern part mainly welaka jemma and parts of the beshilo subbasin the trend of et over the basin indicated a decreasing trend from north to south except for the anger subbasin and west to east the et result of this research is consistent with the previous research allam et al 2016 gebiyaw et al 2021 the ratio of evapotranspiration et and water yield wyld to the rainfall was shown in fig 8 e fig 8 f respectively the percent of et varied from 30 23 to 66 34 and on average 55 20 of the total rainfall was escaped as et the et result of this research almost equal with the previous research work by wuletawu et al 2017 the annual depth of water that is left at each subbasin outlet in the form of runoff wyld is the other basic water balance component modeling the wyld of each subbasin is important for planning developing and managing water resources based on their availability the annual water yield varied from subbasin to subbasin between 183 60 mm and 411 79 mm the maximum water yield was shown in the downstream part of the basin while the minimum water yield was indicated in the south east parts mugher and guder subbasin the minimum maximum fig 8 f and average percent of water yield to total rainfall were 11 79 34 28 and 21 73 respectively the result of the water yield fraction is similar to research done by gebiyaw et al 2021 assessing the seasonal variation of the components within a year is very essential fig 9 shows the seasonal distribution of water balance components the segment of surface runoff surqmm ground water flow gw qmm lateral flow lat qmm and total water yield wyldmm were done with different season of the year the average annual contribution of surqmm to wyldmm was 26 01 in major rainy season minor rainy season and dry season the percent of contribution of surqmm varied from 5 64 to 39 16 0 65 to 7 36 and 0 2 to 4 53 respectively fig 9 a d as it is depicted in fig 9 a d in major and minor rainy seasons the contribution of surqmm is higher in eastern and parts of abbay basin mainly beshilo welaka jemma and n gojam whereas in dry season it is reversed the eastern abbay basin topography represents the highlands ragged mountainous and land cover is primarily characterized by dominantly cultivated denekew and bekele 2009 which facilitates surface runoff than the rainfall infiltrates in to subsurface minimum fraction of sur q to wyld q was found in tana basin in the major rainy season the availability of lakes affects flow regimes by changing the magnitude of stream flow usually by attenuating flows zuzanna et al 2017 the reduced fraction of sur q to wyld q for tana basin may be affected by the presence of lake tana but it needs further research on lake effects on stream out flow and model performance gwq to wyld covers the largest portion an average annual 65 5 the fraction of gw q to wyld q on a seasonal basis varied from 28 56 to 59 76 major rainy

the lat q to wyld ratio in major and minor rainy season varied from 3 46 to 10 95 and 0 05 to 1 81 respectively the annual average lateral flow over the basin was found as 8 5 quantifying the spatial and temporal availability of water resources is important for planning managing and developing resources on sustainable ways 4 conclusion this study provided a comprehensive assessment of water resources potential and its components over abbay river basin using arcswat model at daily simulation scale inverse distance weighting idw method was applied to make spatial surface of water balance components the spatial distribution rain fall over abbay basin indicated that the basin is characterized by high annual and seasonal variation of rainfall depth the aggregated calibration and validation result revealed that arcswat model has the capacity to simulate flows that agree with the measured values and is applicable over the abbay river basin at different spatial scales the identified sensitive parameters that highly affect the rainfall runoff process for each subbasins will be used as basis for future reaches on abbay river basin using sawt model the calibration and validation of the model at different flow segments using fdc also showed a reasonable model efficiency arcswat model well performed for disaggregated flows peak high mid and low flows evaluated independently that resembled the measured flow the spatio temporal assessment of water balance components of the abbay river basin are very important for various purposes as the basin is a potential source of water for the entire nile flow the quantitative results of the water balance components are essential in planning developing and managing process of the resources especially the assessment result of evapotranspiration is very important for its management and improves agricultural yields over the basin moreover due to the transboundary nature of the river it is subjected to complexities regarding utilization planning developing and managing water resources thus the result of this research will provide deep insight for policymakers professionals experts and any other concerned bodies finally this research was based on considerations that exclude climate change impacts the soil moisture storage component was not also considered thus we suggest to do researches considering climate change impacts and soil moisture storage credit authorship contribution statement i declare that this manuscript is original has not been published before and is not currently being considered for

7856,study region the loess plateau china study focus land use and rainfall characteristics are two crucial influencing factors that affect the surface runoff and soil loss process however less attention has been paid to nested watersheds in vulnerable geo ecosystems here we analyzed rainfall characteristics impacts on runoff and sediment in one of the nested watersheds which contains six sub watersheds with different land uses according to rainfall amount duration and maximum rainfall intensity within 30 min i30 180 rainfall events during 2004 2019 were categorized into four types using k means clustering method and different hydrological years were distinguished new hydrological insights for the study region the runoff coefficient and sediment yield under the rainfall regime ⅰ little precipitation moderate duration of precipitation low intensity of precipitation were the lowest under the rainfall regime ⅳ high precipitation short duration of precipitation high intensity of precipitation these values were the largest the average runoff coefficient among the six sub watersheds analyzed varied as follows farmland watershed farming pastoral watershed closed watershed secondary forest watershed mixed forest watershed plantation watershed the closed watershed had the lowest average sediment yield while the farming pastoral watershed showed the highest one in addition the runoff coefficient and sediment yield also changed differently in various hydrological years the results of this study suggest that natural restoration measures are the optimal choice for coordinating the relationship between surface runoff and sediment yield enhanced long term monitoring is needed to accurately describe watershed processes graphical abstract ga1 keywords land use

mohamadi and kavian 2015 chen et al 2018 different rainfall regimes causes different surface runoff and sediment yield as shown in one of the runoff plot in a loess region of gansu province china wei et al 2007 peng and wang 2012 showed that the response of runoff and sediment yield to rainfall characteristics had threshold value the loess plateau is a typical fragile environmental region and a key area of soil and water conversation in china and the world shi and shao 2000 scholars have paid close attention to the region s water erosion but most studies of soil erosion are based on measurements within runoff plots and large river catchments poesen 2018 because the characteristics of the underlying watershed surface are extremely complex when extrapolating runoff plot scale to watershed scale there is less information available about topography slope gradient soils land cover land use and land management sidle et al 2017 the need for small watershed studies continues to be great for understanding and modeling hydrological relationships watershed based approaches have promoted a variety of measures to control surface runoff and soil losses over time including check dams

transpiration and soil evapotranspiration can all be significantly influenced by tree planting wang et al 2011a 2011b jia et al 2017 jin et al 2020 moreover the nested watershed is a complete watershed containing various types of sub watersheds however long term responses of surface runoff and sediment yield on land use and land management are still poorly understood runoff and sediment yields are highly variable long term monitoring has been found to be necessary to accurately characterize watershed processes considering these research gaps we analyzed surface runoff and sediment yield during rainfall events 2004 2019 in one of the nested watersheds contained six sub watersheds and located in the loess plateau china the specific aims of the study were 1 to compare the differences in surface runoff and sediment yield across the six sub watersheds and 2 to examine surface runoff and sediment yield in relation to different rainfall regimes and hydrological years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in the national forest ecosystem field scientific observatory station in ji county shanxi province china the caijiachuan watershed 110 39 45 110 47 45 e 36 17 27 36 18 23 n is located in the south eastern loess plateau china it belongs to the first tributary of the yiting river the second tributary of the xinshui river third tributary of the yellow river fig 1 with altitude ranging from 895 m to 1580 m the watershed covers an area of 39 8 km2 it is generally oriented from west to east and is approximately 12 4 km long the study area is located in a semi humid region the average annual potential evaporation is 1723 9 mm and the annual mean air temperature is 10 2 c the average long term for 1985 2021 annual precipitation is 575 9 mm 85 of precipitation falls mainly from may to october the primary soil type is alditol and the topographic features are typical of a loess hilly and gully region the watershed is 84 forested the upstream part of the watershed has natural secondary forests that are primarily composed of quercus liaotungensis populus davidiana and betula dahurica the middle part of the watershed has plantations of chinese pine pinus tabuliformis black locust robinia pseudoacacia and chinese arborvitae platycladus orientalis and the downstream part of the watershed is dominated by farmland and grassland wang et al 2012 as stated above the caijiachuan watershed contains six sub watersheds fig 1 at the outflow of each sub watershed six compound weirs were constructed table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics of each sub watershed including the secondary forest watershed sw mixed forest watershed mw closed watershed cw plantation watershed pw farmland watershed fw and farming pastoral watershed fpw the sw which consists mainly quercus liaotungensis populus davidiana and betula dahurica has the most common type of vegetation formed by secondary succession the mw consists of artificially planted vegetation in secondary forests the artificial vegetation in the pw was planted in the 1990s the cw has closed farmland and grassland to avoid the impact of human activities farmland and grassland are the two main land use types in the fpw 2 2 rainfall monitoring a tipping bucket rainfall gauge isco 674 teledyne company usa 0 1 mm was installed to record the incident rainfall in each weir at the same time five rainfall gauges hobo rg3 m onset company usa 0 2 mm with an accuracy of 0 2 mm were also set up at other locations in the watershed in total eleven rainfall gauges were installed in the caijiachuan watershed fig 1 the rainfall amount ra mm rainfall duration rd h and maximum rainfall intensity of 30 min i30 mm h 1 were obtained using these monitoring data combined with the location of the rainfall gauges kriging interpolation was used to calculate the mean rainfall over the entire watershed in the caijiachuan watershed precipitation from may to october accounted for more than 80 of the annual precipitation and erosive rainfall mainly occurred during this time thus rainfall was recorded every 5 min from may to october during 2014 2019 according to our early findings zhang et al 1996 rainfall events with less than 10 mm generally did not cause significant changes in the water level the rainfall runoff events included in the study occurred between may and october during 2004 2019 and they were chosen based on the following criteria a a total event precipitation of at least 10 mm b no precipitation for at least 6 h between two events 2 3 surface runoff and sediment yield monitoring an automatic sampler and ultrasonic water level gauge isco 6700 teledyne company usa were arranged in each compound weir during may october from 2014 to 2019 and the water level was measured every 5 min in addition an automatic long term measuring water level gauge nissan water research type 62 japan was used for correction we used the velocity area method and the base flow using the linear cutting method to calculate the flow rate and runoff data of the watershed based on the observed water level and calibrated water level flow curve a rectangular section with a small triangular groove was adopted to effectively solve the problem of observation accuracy at low water flow the parameter list and stage discharge formulas of the weirs are shown in table 2 artificial sampling was carried out from july to august in 2004 2019 according to the fluctuation of the water level during a rainfall event the water samples were collected manually on the weirs at a certain time and the sediment content was measured by laboratory filter drying when taking water samples the water level was observed with a water gauge which was used to calibrate the measured data of the self recording water gauge the sediments were separated from the water samples and allowed to settle before drying in an oven 2 4 statistical analysis in this study rainfall events were divided by k means clustering method the runoff coefficient is a measure of the ability of a watershed to generate runoff zheng et al 2021 the following formulas were used to calculate the runoff coefficient and soil erosion modulus sem 1 r c r p 100 2 sem sl a where rc r and p are the runoff coefficient of the watershed surface runoff at the watershed outlet mm and precipitation mm respectively sem sl and a are the soil erosion modulus of the watershed t km 2 sediment load at the watershed outlet t and watershed area km2 respectively we used python software v 3 10 0 dua and graff 2019 to conduct the k means clustering analysis for different rainfall regimes a one way anova was applied to compare differences of the runoff coefficient and sediment yield among land use types the least significant difference lsd test was used to determine specific differences among various land uses in all cases differences were statistically significant at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out in the spss software with a version of 22 0 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics as shown in fig 2 the annual variation in precipitation in the watershed was large the year with the most precipitation was 2014 678 8 mm while the year with the least precipitation was 2010 333 2 mm the hydrological year was determined using the pearson iii frequency curve and annual precipitation data from ji county station for 1960 2019 wet years were defined as those with precipitation greater than or equal to p 25 544 7 mm dry years were defined as those with precipitation less than or equal to p 75 423 4 mm and normal years were defined as those when precipitation occurs between wet and dry years li et al 2020 in terms of rainfall for the experimental period from 2004 to 2019 the years 2004 2008 2009 2010 2012 2015 and 2019 were dry years the years 2011 2013 2014 and 2016 were wet years and the years 2005 2006 2007 2016 and 2018 were normal ones based on the ra rd and i30 the 180 rainfall events were grouped into four types table 3 the rainfall regime ⅰ little precipitation moderate duration of precipitation and low intensity of precipitation was the most common rainfall regime in the study area the duration of precipitation in the rainfall regime ⅱ was the shortest of the four rainfall regimes and had an average amount and intensity of precipitation the rainfall regime ⅳ represented extreme rainstorms with higher rainfall shorter rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity than that of the rainfall regime ⅲ during may 2004 october 2019 the rainfall regime ⅰ appeared 100 events the total rainfall amount of this regime was 1723 3 mm and the total rainfall duration of the regime was 1660 4 h there were 55 observations of the rainfall regime ⅱ in all rainfall events with a total of 1248 1 mm and 375 4 h the rainfall regime ⅲ was observed 17 times with a total duration of 655 4 h and a total amount of 1077 0 mm the total rainfall amount and duration of the rainfall regime ⅳ was 687 7 mm and 143 5 h respectively however it occurred only 8 times as is shown in fig 3 b the total amounts of the four rainfall regimes were different in different years rainfall amount of the rainfall regime ⅰ was higher than in the rainfall regime ⅱ except in 2005 2006 2007 2014 and 2018 because the rainfall regime ⅰ was the most common rainfall event fig 3 a fig 3 d shows that i30 of the rainfall regime ⅳ was lower than in the rainfall regime ⅲ ⅰ and ⅱ as shown in fig 3 on the whole the distributions of the rainfall regimes showed high variations among different years the rainfall regime ⅱ showed the most obvious interannual variations for example the rainfall amounts in 2010 2017 and 2019 were 16 1 14 9 and 12 4 mm respectively and the rainfall amounts in 2007 2014 and 2018 were 157 2 144 4 and 138 9 mm respectively regarding the rainfall regime ⅳ all eight events appeared only in 2004 2006 2011 2014 2017 and 2019 no other years have seen such rainfall events 3 2 surface runoff and sediment yield in sub watersheds with different land use cover according to fig 4 in 2004 2019 the mean runoff coefficient from may to october the growing season was ranked in the following order fw 2 42 fpw 2 38 cw 1 11 sw 1 08 mw 0 73 pw 0 43 the runoff coefficients during the growing season differed by years for instance the lowest and the highest values in the fw were 1 62 in 2004 and 3 14 in 2017 respectively however the lowest and highest values in the sw were 0 36 in 2013 and 1 76 in 2012 respectively during the experimental years the variation in the runoff coefficient in the fpw c v 65 57 was the largest followed by that in the sw c v 48 67 and the smallest was in the pw c v 17 75 fig 5 shows the runoff coefficient in the hydrological years of the studied sub watersheds there were no significant variations of the runoff coefficient in the different hydrological years overall the runoff coefficient of the fw was the highest followed by the fpw whereas the runoff coefficient of the pw was the lowest it is worth mentioning that the runoff coefficient of the fw was significantly higher than that of the fpw p 0 05 the sem of the sw was the lowest followed by that in the cw and the soil erosion modules of the fw and fpw were higher than those of the other sub watersheds table 4 3 3 surface runoff and sediment yield under different rainfall regimes the runoff coefficient under each rainfall regime was different fig 6 the runoff coefficient of the rainfall regime ⅰ was notably lower than under other rainfall regimes in the fpw and pw the runoff coefficient of the rainfall regime iv was highest comparing the runoff coefficient of different rainfall regimes the sw had the smallest difference as shown in fig 7 there were clear differences in the runoff coefficient of the studied sub watersheds with different land use types in hydrological years in addition to the fw and fpw there were no significant differences in other land use types overall the runoff coefficient of the rainfall regime iv was highest under the rainfall regime ⅰ the sem among all six sub watershed was very small even close to zero table 4 the sem of the rainfall regime iv was as much as tenfold that of the rainfall regime ⅱ among all six sub watersheds the sem of the sw was lowest 4 discussion 4 1 effects of land use on surface runoff and soil loss in this study surface runoff and sediment yield varied significantly relying on the type of sub watershed land use fig 4 there is ample evidence in the literature that revegetation can actually reduce surface runoff and sediment yield wei et al 2009 liang et al 2020 the vegetation canopy can effectively intercept rainfall dunkerley 2000 zhang et al 2016 thus weakening rainfall energy and reducing soil erosion roots also improve soil resistance to erosion and enhance the soil moisture infiltration rate yu et al 2016 wang et al 2021 furthermore litter layer can exert major effects in relation to decreasing the surface runoff and sediment yield chen et al 2018 cui et al 2022 the surface runoff and soil loss of the fw and fpw were higher than other sub watersheds the forest coverage of the fw and fpw is 10 93 and 45 30 respectively however the forest coverage of the other sub watersheds is above 80 thus vegetation coverage might be a very significant impact factor controlling runoff generation and soil loss zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 feng et al 2016 it follows that reasonably increasing the vegetation coverage is an active strategy to control serious soil erosion for instance the annual sediment flux was decreased to approximately 0 2 billion tons which was largely due to the implementation of the grain for green project vegetation coverage within the loess plateau increased from 31 9 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 according to an analysis of 59 watersheds over the loess plateau annual runoff coefficients and sem decreased with increased vegetation coverage zhang et al 2022 furthermore anthropogenic disturbances had a significant impact on the fw and fpw corn was widely farmed in these sub watersheds seeding occurred in the late april and machine harvesting was conducted in early october unlike vegetation bare soil surfaces are exposed to rainfall resulting in increased water surface runoff and sediment yield el kateb et al 2013 however there is a direct link among grazing plant coverage and soil erosion palacio et al 2014 according to a study in semiarid woodlands in eastern australia vandandorj et al 2017 livestock grazing had a direct overwhelming effect on the rate of infiltration soils have been compacted or hardened at shallow depths as a result of farmland management as well as reduced soil infiltration capacity zhou et al 2010 sirimarco et al 2018 increased runoff response zhao et al 2010 and increased resistance to root penetration it is worth mentioning that in some old plantations trees grow to only approximately 30 50 of the normal height and are colloquially referred to as little old man trees similar phenomena have occurred in other areas of the loess plateau chen et al 2015 jia et al 2017 in semi arid and semi humid locations the severe loss of deep soil water due to artificial forest restoration and long term precipitation shortages promote soil drying and ecological deterioration chen et al 2008 the pw had the lowest runoff coefficient figs 4 and 5 the most likely explanation was run on infiltration liu et al 2012 because plantations consume more water and soil water deficit was very serious compared with secondary forest sediment yields were scarce in the sw and cw especially after severe storms the analysis found that the sw and cw were determined to be in the advanced stage of community succession with a rich species composition stable community and high resistance stability guariguata and ostertag 2001 4 2 responses of surface runoff and soil losses to different rainfall regimes in the caijiachuan watershed although the rainfall amount of the rainfall regime ⅰ was smaller than that of the other rainfall regimes it was the most frequent rainfall event meanwhile under the rainfall regime ⅰ almost no erosion events recorded in the six sub watersheds most of the low intensity rainfall would be trapped by vegetation canopy and litter comparatively the rainfall regime ⅲ accounts for about a third of the total rainfall events and had a little erosive effect on the soil the rainfall regime ⅳ was extreme rainfall event that occurred just eight times during 16 years in comparison with the other rainfall regimes the rainfall regime iv resulted in much greater surface runoff and soil loss indicating that the regime ⅳ was the most destructive rainfall type in the semiarid loess hilly region surface runoff and sediment yield were mainly caused by rainfall with short rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity wei et al 2007 in other parts of china such as the karst region in southwest china rain showers with very high rainfall and intensity more easily caused soil loss peng and wang 2012 hence the rainfall regime iv was most sensitive to surface runoff and sediment yield to rainfall regimes followed by ⅱ ⅲ and ⅰ the surface runoff and soil erosion in hilly and gully regions were not simply related to a rainfall eigenvalue the surface runoff and soil erosion of the pw mw fw and fpw were higher than those during rainfall storms without antecedent rainfall when rainfall events with large antecedent rainfall depth for instance the sem of the pw mw fw and fpw was 117 250 98 457 134 587 and 160 188 t km 2 respectively it is possible that antecedent rainfalls increased the prior antecedent soil moisture before the storms thus reduced the water buffering capacity of the soil gao et al 2019 there was no obvious variance in the runoff coefficient in different hydrological years the infiltration of excess surface runoff is thought to be the primary runoff generation mechanism on the loess plateau compared to plot scale studies the rainfall regime had little effect on surface runoff and soil erosion for one thing the surface conditions e g topography geomorphology altitude slope and soils of a watershed are complicated for another thing forests possess the ability to preserve water and their soils have a high osmotic capacity and a high storage capacity the water flow regulation fuction of watersheds represents their ability to control minimizes flood peaks by modulating direct runoff through soil water infiltration and percolation through the soil profile tarigan et al 2018 4 3 implications and limitations with the establishment of the grain for green project in the late 1990s large scale ecological restoration has been conducted in the loess plateau and the implementation of artificial ecological forest areas has occurred at a relatively large scale however due to the unreasonable expansion of some artificial ecological forests a series of severe issues appeared such as single stand structure excessive plant density and poor biodiversity liu et al 2018 the planted artificial vegetation may develop a dried soil layer obstructing the normal growth and succession of vegetation fu et al 2017 as a result the long term viability of plant regeneration has been hampered and diminished the benefits of soil and water conservation wang et al 2011a 2011b chen et al 2018 according to the recent reports the loess plateau s current artificial vegetation coverage was near the region s water carrying capacity threshold q feng et al 2016 x feng et al 2016 to alleviate the adverse effects on the water supply and to promote the conservation of the water and soil of artificial vegetation in the study region in addition to traditional timber oriented forest management thinning is an important forest management activity tian et al 2021 the focus of the expansion of vegetation cover on the loess plateau has switched to address extreme rainfall thus natural vegetation succession might be a good technique for ecological restoration efforts in hilly and gully areas on the loess plateau such forest trees might promote long term soil conservation without jeopardizing future water demand however there are some limitations in this work which can help to guide future research 1 due to the sediment was sampled manually and some rainfall events occurred at night the amount of sediment data was relatively small although the sample size is small the events are representative because they include different rainfall amount rainfall intensity and rainfall duration therefore a sediment concentration meter is required at each weir to measure sediment 2 in addition to land use cover other sub watershed characteristics soils geology and topography affect runoff and sediment output these factors require more detailed study 5 conclusion in this study based on ra rd and i30 180 rainfall events from 2004 to 2019 in one of the small watershed of the loess plateau were classified into four rainfall regimes by the k means clustering method the average runoff coefficient among the studied six sub watersheds varied as follows fw 2 42 fpw 2 38 cw 1 11 sw 1 08 mw 0 73 pw 0 43 however the sem of the natural restoration sub watersheds the sw and cw was lowest generally surface runoff and sediment yield under the rainfall regime ⅳ large rainfall amount and intensity were highest while those under the rainfall regime ⅰ low rainfall amount and intensity high frequency were lowest the runoff coefficient and sediment yield of the rainfall regime ⅰ little precipitation moderate duration of precipitation low intensity of precipitation were least in the rainfall regime ⅳ high precipitation short duration of precipitation high intensity of precipitation they were largest the cw had the lowest average sediment yield while the fpw showed the highest one in addition to the fw and fpw the influence of hydrological years on surface runoff of this sub watershed was not significant due to forest regulation operations natural restoration measures such as secondary forest measures and closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation are the optimal choice to control soil erosion for sustainable sub watershed management in the future others in this field or different fields may use the findings presented in this work to inspire some future research most of the studies on surface runoff and sediment yield were focused on the runoff plot scale while there have been no studies at the watershed scale thus it is necessary to increase the long term observations of hydrological processes in the watershed in addition it is necessary to compare the runoff dynamics of watercourses at different spatial scales in particular in nested watersheds this will show how the watershed scale processes and their distribution reflect changes in water flows and propagate downstream credit authorship contribution statement jiongchang zhao methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft jianjun zhang conceptualization

mohamadi and kavian 2015 chen et al 2018 different rainfall regimes causes different surface runoff and sediment yield as shown in one of the runoff plot in a loess region of gansu province china wei et al 2007 peng and wang 2012 showed that the response of runoff and sediment yield to rainfall characteristics had threshold value the loess plateau is a typical fragile environmental region and a key area of soil and water conversation in china and the world shi and shao 2000 scholars have paid close attention to the region s water erosion but most studies of soil erosion are based on measurements within runoff plots and large river catchments poesen 2018 because the characteristics of the underlying watershed surface are extremely complex when extrapolating runoff plot scale to watershed scale there is less information available about topography slope gradient soils land cover land use and land management sidle et al 2017 the need for small watershed studies continues to be great for understanding and modeling hydrological relationships watershed based approaches have promoted a variety of measures to control surface runoff and soil losses over time including check dams terraces grass strips natural vegetation restoration and various shrub and tree plantations zhao et al 2013 in particular in the 1990s the chinese government initiated a large scale grain for green project to combat soil erosion and improve the environment deng et al 2014 yu et al 2020 due to the phenomenon of water and soil losses in recent decades water runoff changes in the yellow river basin have attracted much attention especially in the middle reaches of the river zuo et al 2016 numerous studies on the response of surface runoff to different land uses have indicated significant variability with rainfall regimes at different scales lópez tarazón and estrany 2017 guastini et al 2019 yu et al 2022 nonuniform variations in land use vegetation coverage have been linked to hydrological responses across watersheds roa garcía et al 2011 warburton et al 2012 salemi et al 2013 gao et al 2018 watershed hydrological processes canopy interception runoff vegetation transpiration and soil evapotranspiration can all be significantly influenced by tree planting wang et al 2011a 2011b jia et al 2017 jin et al 2020 moreover the nested watershed is a complete watershed containing various types of sub watersheds however long term responses of surface runoff and sediment yield on land use and land management are still poorly understood runoff and sediment yields are highly variable long term monitoring has been found to be necessary to accurately characterize watershed processes considering these research gaps we analyzed surface runoff and sediment yield during rainfall events 2004 2019 in one of the nested watersheds contained six sub watersheds and located in the loess plateau china the specific aims of the study were 1 to compare the differences in surface runoff and sediment yield across the six sub watersheds and 2 to examine surface runoff and sediment yield in relation to different rainfall regimes and hydrological years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in the national forest ecosystem field scientific observatory station in ji county shanxi province china the caijiachuan watershed 110 39 45 110 47 45 e 36 17 27 36 18 23 n is located in the south eastern loess plateau china it belongs to the first tributary of the yiting river the second tributary of the xinshui river third tributary of the yellow river fig 1 with altitude ranging from 895 m to 1580 m the watershed covers an area of 39 8 km2 it is generally oriented from west to east and is approximately 12 4 km long the study area is located in a semi humid region the average annual potential evaporation is 1723 9 mm and the annual mean air temperature is 10 2 c the average long term for 1985 2021 annual precipitation is 575 9 mm 85 of precipitation falls mainly from may to october the primary soil type is alditol and the topographic features are typical of a loess hilly and gully region the watershed is 84 forested the upstream part of the watershed has natural secondary forests that are primarily composed of quercus liaotungensis populus davidiana and betula dahurica the middle part of the watershed has plantations of chinese pine pinus tabuliformis black locust robinia pseudoacacia and chinese arborvitae platycladus orientalis and the downstream part of the watershed is dominated by farmland and grassland wang et al 2012 as stated above the caijiachuan watershed contains six sub watersheds fig 1 at the outflow of each sub watershed six compound weirs were constructed table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics of each sub watershed including the secondary forest watershed sw mixed forest watershed mw closed watershed cw plantation watershed pw farmland watershed fw and farming pastoral watershed fpw the sw which consists mainly quercus liaotungensis populus davidiana and betula dahurica has the most common type of vegetation formed by secondary succession the mw consists of artificially planted vegetation in secondary forests the artificial vegetation in the pw was planted in the 1990s the cw has closed farmland and grassland to avoid the impact of human activities farmland and grassland are the two main land use types in the fpw 2 2 rainfall monitoring a tipping bucket rainfall gauge isco 674 teledyne company usa 0 1 mm was installed to record the incident rainfall in each weir at the same time five rainfall gauges hobo rg3 m onset company usa 0 2 mm with an accuracy of 0 2 mm were also set up at other locations in the watershed in total eleven rainfall gauges were installed in the caijiachuan watershed fig 1 the rainfall amount ra mm rainfall duration rd h and maximum rainfall intensity of 30 min i30 mm h 1 were obtained using these monitoring data combined with the location of the rainfall gauges kriging interpolation was used to calculate the mean rainfall over the entire watershed in the caijiachuan watershed precipitation from may to october accounted for more than 80 of the annual precipitation and erosive rainfall mainly occurred during this time thus rainfall was recorded every 5 min from may to october during 2014 2019 according to our early findings zhang et al 1996 rainfall events with less than 10 mm generally did not cause significant changes in the water level the rainfall runoff events included in the study occurred between may and october during 2004 2019 and they were chosen based on the following criteria a a total event precipitation of at least 10 mm b no precipitation for at least 6 h between two events 2 3 surface runoff and sediment yield monitoring an automatic sampler and ultrasonic water level gauge isco 6700 teledyne company usa were arranged in each compound weir during may october from 2014 to 2019 and the water level was measured every 5 min in addition an automatic long term measuring water level gauge nissan water research type 62 japan was used for correction we used the velocity area method and the base flow using the linear cutting method to calculate the flow rate and runoff data of the watershed based on the observed water level and calibrated water level flow curve a rectangular section with a small triangular groove was adopted to effectively solve the problem of observation accuracy at low water flow the parameter list and stage discharge formulas of the weirs are shown in table 2 artificial sampling was carried out from july to august in 2004 2019 according to the fluctuation of the water level during a rainfall event the water samples were collected manually on the weirs at a certain time and the sediment content was measured by laboratory filter drying when taking water samples the water level was observed with a water gauge which was used to calibrate the measured data of the self recording water gauge the sediments were separated from the water samples and allowed to settle before drying in an oven 2 4 statistical analysis in this study rainfall events were divided by k means clustering method the runoff coefficient is a measure of the ability of a watershed to generate runoff zheng et al 2021 the following formulas were used to calculate the runoff coefficient and soil erosion modulus sem 1 r c r p 100 2 sem sl a where rc r and p are the runoff coefficient of the watershed surface runoff at the watershed outlet mm and precipitation mm respectively sem sl and a are the soil erosion modulus of the watershed t km 2 sediment load at the watershed outlet t and watershed area km2 respectively we used python software v 3 10 0 dua and graff 2019 to conduct the k means clustering analysis for different rainfall regimes a one way anova was applied to compare differences of the runoff coefficient and sediment yield among land use types the least significant difference lsd test was used to determine specific differences among various land uses in all cases differences were statistically significant at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out in the spss software with a version of 22 0 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics as shown in fig 2 the annual variation in precipitation in the watershed was large the year with the most precipitation was 2014 678 8 mm while the year with the least precipitation was 2010 333 2 mm the hydrological year was determined using the pearson iii frequency curve and annual precipitation data from ji county station for 1960 2019 wet years were defined as those with precipitation greater than or equal to p 25 544 7 mm dry years were defined as those with precipitation less than or equal to p 75 423 4 mm and normal years were defined as those when precipitation occurs between wet and dry years li et al 2020 in terms of rainfall for the experimental period from 2004 to 2019 the years 2004 2008 2009 2010 2012 2015 and 2019 were dry years the years 2011 2013 2014 and 2016 were wet years and the years 2005 2006 2007 2016 and 2018 were normal ones based on the ra rd and i30 the 180 rainfall events were grouped into four types table 3 the rainfall regime ⅰ little precipitation moderate duration of precipitation and low intensity of precipitation was the most common rainfall regime in the study area the duration of precipitation in the rainfall regime ⅱ was the shortest of the four rainfall regimes and had an average amount and intensity of precipitation the rainfall regime ⅳ represented extreme rainstorms with higher rainfall shorter rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity than that of the rainfall regime ⅲ during may 2004 october 2019 the rainfall regime ⅰ appeared 100 events the total rainfall amount of this regime was 1723 3 mm and the total rainfall duration of the regime was 1660 4 h there were 55 observations of the rainfall regime ⅱ in all rainfall events with a total of 1248 1 mm and 375 4 h the rainfall regime ⅲ was observed 17 times with a total duration of 655 4 h and a total amount of 1077 0 mm the total rainfall amount and duration of the rainfall regime ⅳ was 687 7 mm and 143 5 h respectively however it occurred only 8 times as is shown in fig 3 b the total amounts of the four rainfall regimes were different in different years rainfall amount of the rainfall regime ⅰ was higher than in the rainfall regime ⅱ except in 2005 2006 2007 2014 and 2018 because the rainfall regime ⅰ was the most common rainfall event fig 3 a fig 3 d shows that i30 of the rainfall regime ⅳ was lower than in the rainfall regime ⅲ ⅰ and ⅱ as shown in fig 3 on the whole the distributions of the rainfall regimes showed high variations among different years the rainfall regime ⅱ showed the most obvious interannual variations for example the rainfall amounts in 2010 2017 and 2019 were 16 1 14 9 and 12 4 mm respectively and the rainfall amounts in 2007 2014 and 2018 were 157 2 144 4 and 138 9 mm respectively regarding the rainfall regime ⅳ all eight events appeared only in 2004 2006 2011 2014 2017 and 2019 no other years have seen such rainfall events 3 2 surface runoff and sediment yield in sub watersheds with different land use cover according to fig 4 in 2004 2019 the mean runoff coefficient from may to october the growing season was ranked in the following order fw 2 42 fpw 2 38 cw 1 11 sw 1 08 mw 0 73 pw 0 43 the runoff coefficients during the growing season differed by years for instance the lowest and the highest values in the fw were 1 62 in 2004 and 3 14 in 2017 respectively however the lowest and highest values in the sw were 0 36 in 2013 and 1 76 in 2012 respectively during the experimental years the variation in the runoff coefficient in the fpw c v 65 57 was the largest followed by that in the sw c v 48 67 and the smallest was in the pw c v 17 75 fig 5 shows the runoff coefficient in the hydrological years of the studied sub watersheds there were no significant variations of the runoff coefficient in the different hydrological years overall the runoff coefficient of the fw was the highest followed by the fpw whereas the runoff coefficient of the pw was the lowest it is worth mentioning that the runoff coefficient of the fw was significantly higher than that of the fpw p 0 05 the sem of the sw was the lowest followed by that in the cw and the soil erosion modules of the fw and fpw were higher than those of the other sub watersheds table 4 3 3 surface runoff and sediment yield under different rainfall regimes the runoff coefficient under each rainfall regime was different fig 6 the runoff coefficient of the rainfall regime ⅰ was notably lower than under other rainfall regimes in the fpw and pw the runoff coefficient of the rainfall regime iv was highest comparing the runoff coefficient of different rainfall regimes the sw had the smallest difference as shown in fig 7 there were clear differences in the runoff coefficient of the studied sub watersheds with different land use types in hydrological years in addition to the fw and fpw there were no significant differences in other land use types overall the runoff coefficient of the rainfall regime iv was highest under the rainfall regime ⅰ the sem among all six sub watershed was very small even close to zero table 4 the sem of the rainfall regime iv was as much as tenfold that of the rainfall regime ⅱ among all six sub watersheds the sem of the sw was lowest 4 discussion 4 1 effects of land use on surface runoff and soil loss in this study surface runoff and sediment yield varied significantly relying on the type of sub watershed land use fig 4 there is ample evidence in the literature that revegetation can actually reduce surface runoff and sediment yield wei et al 2009 liang et al 2020 the vegetation canopy can effectively intercept rainfall dunkerley 2000 zhang et al 2016 thus weakening rainfall energy and reducing soil erosion roots also improve soil resistance to erosion and enhance the soil moisture infiltration rate yu et al 2016 wang et al 2021 furthermore litter layer can exert major effects in relation to decreasing the surface runoff and sediment yield chen et al 2018 cui et al 2022 the surface runoff and soil loss of the fw and fpw were higher than other sub watersheds the forest coverage of the fw and fpw is 10 93 and 45 30 respectively however the forest coverage of the other sub watersheds is above 80 thus vegetation coverage might be a very significant impact factor controlling runoff generation and soil loss zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 feng et al 2016 it follows that reasonably increasing the vegetation coverage is an active strategy to control serious soil erosion for instance the annual sediment flux was decreased to approximately 0 2 billion tons which was largely due to the implementation of the grain for green project vegetation coverage within the loess plateau increased from 31 9 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 according to an analysis of 59 watersheds over the loess plateau annual runoff coefficients and sem decreased with increased vegetation coverage zhang et al 2022 furthermore anthropogenic disturbances had a significant impact on the fw and fpw corn was widely farmed in these sub watersheds seeding occurred in the late april and machine harvesting was conducted in early october unlike vegetation bare soil surfaces are exposed to rainfall resulting in increased water surface runoff and sediment yield el kateb et al 2013 however there is a direct link among grazing plant coverage and soil erosion palacio et al 2014 according to a study in semiarid woodlands in eastern australia vandandorj et al 2017 livestock grazing had a direct overwhelming effect on the rate of infiltration soils have been compacted or hardened at shallow depths as a result of farmland management as well as reduced soil infiltration capacity zhou et al 2010 sirimarco et al 2018 increased runoff response zhao et al 2010 and increased resistance to root penetration it is worth mentioning that in some old plantations trees grow to only approximately 30 50 of the normal height and are colloquially referred to as little old man trees similar phenomena have occurred in other areas of the loess plateau chen et al 2015 jia et al 2017 in semi arid and semi humid locations the severe loss of deep soil water due to artificial forest restoration and long term precipitation shortages promote soil drying and ecological deterioration chen et al 2008 the pw had the lowest runoff coefficient figs 4 and 5 the most likely explanation was run on infiltration liu et al 2012 because plantations consume more water and soil water deficit was very serious compared with secondary forest sediment yields were scarce in the sw and cw especially after severe storms the analysis found that the sw and cw were determined to be in the advanced stage of community succession with a rich species composition stable community and high resistance stability guariguata and ostertag 2001 4 2 responses of surface runoff and soil losses to different rainfall regimes in the caijiachuan watershed although the rainfall amount of the rainfall regime ⅰ was smaller than that of the other rainfall regimes it was the most frequent rainfall event meanwhile under the rainfall regime ⅰ almost no erosion events recorded in the six sub watersheds most of the low intensity rainfall would be trapped by vegetation canopy and litter comparatively the rainfall regime ⅲ accounts for about a third of the total rainfall events and had a little erosive effect on the soil the rainfall regime ⅳ was extreme rainfall event that occurred just eight times during 16 years in comparison with the other rainfall regimes the rainfall regime iv resulted in much greater surface runoff and soil loss indicating that the regime ⅳ was the most destructive rainfall type in the semiarid loess hilly region surface runoff and sediment yield were mainly caused by rainfall with short rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity wei et al 2007 in other parts of china such as the karst region in southwest china rain showers with very high rainfall and intensity more easily caused soil loss peng and wang 2012 hence the rainfall regime iv was most sensitive to surface runoff and sediment yield to rainfall regimes followed by ⅱ ⅲ and ⅰ the surface runoff and soil erosion in hilly and gully regions were not simply related to a rainfall eigenvalue the surface runoff and soil erosion of the pw mw fw and fpw were higher than those during rainfall storms without antecedent rainfall when rainfall events with large antecedent rainfall depth for instance the sem of the pw mw fw and fpw was 117 250 98 457 134 587 and 160 188 t km 2 respectively it is possible that antecedent rainfalls increased the prior antecedent soil moisture before the storms thus reduced the water buffering capacity of the soil gao et al 2019 there was no obvious variance in the runoff coefficient in different hydrological years the infiltration of excess surface runoff is thought to be the primary runoff generation mechanism on the loess plateau compared to plot scale studies the rainfall regime had little effect on surface runoff and soil erosion for one thing the surface conditions e g topography geomorphology altitude slope and soils of a watershed are complicated for another thing forests possess the ability to preserve water and their soils have a high osmotic capacity and a high storage capacity the water flow regulation fuction of watersheds represents their ability to control minimizes flood peaks by modulating direct runoff through soil water infiltration and percolation through the soil profile tarigan et al 2018 4 3 implications and limitations with the establishment of the grain for green project in the late 1990s large scale ecological restoration has been conducted in the loess plateau and the implementation of artificial ecological forest areas has occurred at a relatively large scale however due to the unreasonable expansion of some artificial ecological forests a series of severe issues appeared such as single stand structure excessive plant density and poor biodiversity liu et al 2018 the planted artificial vegetation may develop a dried soil layer obstructing the normal growth and succession of vegetation fu et al 2017 as a result the long term viability of plant regeneration has been hampered and diminished the benefits of soil and water conservation wang et al 2011a 2011b chen et al 2018 according to the recent reports the loess plateau s current artificial vegetation coverage was near the region s water carrying capacity threshold q feng et al 2016 x feng et al 2016 to alleviate the adverse effects on the water supply and to promote the conservation of the water and soil of artificial vegetation in the study region in addition to traditional timber oriented forest management thinning is an important forest management activity tian et al 2021 the focus of the expansion of vegetation cover on the loess plateau has switched to address extreme rainfall thus natural vegetation succession might be a good technique for ecological restoration efforts in hilly and gully areas on the loess plateau such forest trees might promote long term soil conservation without jeopardizing future water demand however there are some limitations in this work which can help to guide future research 1 due to the sediment was sampled manually and some rainfall events occurred at night the amount of sediment data was relatively small although the sample size is small the events are representative because they include different rainfall amount rainfall intensity and rainfall duration therefore a sediment concentration meter is required at each weir to measure sediment 2 in addition to land use cover other sub watershed characteristics soils geology and topography affect runoff and sediment output these factors require more detailed study 5 conclusion in this study based on ra rd and i30 180 rainfall events from 2004 to 2019 in one of the small watershed of the loess plateau were classified into four rainfall regimes by the k means clustering method the average runoff coefficient among the studied six sub watersheds varied as follows fw 2 42 fpw 2 38 cw 1 11 sw 1 08 mw 0 73 pw 0 43 however the sem of the natural restoration sub watersheds the sw and cw was lowest generally surface runoff and sediment yield under the rainfall regime ⅳ large rainfall amount and intensity were highest while those under the rainfall regime ⅰ low rainfall amount and intensity high frequency were lowest the runoff coefficient and sediment yield of the rainfall regime ⅰ little precipitation moderate duration of precipitation low intensity of precipitation were least in the rainfall regime ⅳ high precipitation short duration of precipitation high intensity of precipitation they were largest the cw had the lowest average sediment yield while the fpw showed the highest one in addition to the fw and fpw the influence of hydrological years on surface runoff of this sub watershed was not significant due to forest regulation operations natural restoration measures such as secondary forest measures and closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation are the optimal choice to control soil erosion for sustainable sub watershed management in the future others in this field or different fields may use the findings presented in this work to inspire some future research most of the studies on surface runoff and sediment yield were focused on the runoff plot scale while there have been no studies at the watershed scale thus it is necessary to increase the long term observations of hydrological processes in the watershed in addition it is necessary to compare the runoff dynamics of watercourses at different spatial scales in particular in nested watersheds this will show how the watershed scale processes and their distribution reflect changes in water flows and propagate downstream credit authorship contribution statement jiongchang zhao methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft jianjun zhang conceptualization

7857,study region the akaki catchment is found in the upper awash river basin in ethiopia study focus understanding the accuracy of rainfall forecasts in the data scarce urban catchment has a multitude of benefits given the increased urban flood risk caused by climate change and urbanization in this study accuracy of the weather research and forecasting wrf model rainfall forecast was evaluated using citizen science data categorical and continuous accuracy evaluation metrics were used beside gauge representativeness effect new hydrological insights for the region the rainfall forecasts performance accuracy is high for 1 3 days lead time but deteriorates for 4 5 days lead time the wrf model captured the temporal dynamics and the rainfall amount according to the estimated kge values the model has relatively higher detection performance for no rain and light rain events 6 mm day but it has lower performance for moderate and heavy rain events 6 mm day use of data from a single rain gauge misrepresents the accuracy level of the rainfall forecast in the study area the gauge representativeness error contributed a variance of 28 08 83 33 to the variance of wrf gauge rainfall difference thus the use of citizen science rainfall monitoring program is an essential alternative source of information where in situ rainfall monitoring is limited that can be used to understand the true accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts graphical abstract ga1 keywords wrf rainfall forecast citizen science rainfall data accuracy evaluation addis ababa akaki catchment ethiopia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction citizen science cs the participation of ordinary people in scientific research offers an unprecedented opportunity as a hydro meteorological data source starkey et al 2017 however there are still concerns regarding whether the quality of cs data is sufficient for the requirements of various applications walker et al 2016 showed that citizen scientists can collect rainfall data that is as reliable as the data collected by professionals if there is regular and thorough supervision as a result many researchers are investigating how cs can fill data gaps in hydro meteorological studies muller et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 weeser et al 2018 see 2019 alfonso et al 2022 for instance ferede et al 2020 showed that cs data of rainfall streamflow and groundwater can be used to estimate recharge to a shallow groundwater aquifer starkey et al 2017 reported that qualitative and quantitative data collected by volunteers can inform characterization of river response before and after floods and improve modeling simulations in weather and flood early warning a concerted effort is required to investigate how cs can fill data gaps in rainfall monitoring in general and rainfall forecasting in particular the potential of cs in rainfall monitoring and forecasting is immense but only few examples are available in the literature for example reges et al 2016 showed how volunteer monitoring can be linked with forecasting they suggested using various tools for data collection analysis mapping and a web interface for hydro meteorological studies liu et al 2020 pointed out the importance of building a sustainable relationship among government and citizen scientists for improved weather forecasting and risk communication le et al 2016 identified and suggested the application of crowdsourcing observations in the form of pictures and videos for flood modeling from three projects in argentina france and new zealand they recommended a clear and simple data collection procedure efficient communication plan and awareness creation to enhance the citizen scientists understanding of natural hazards as a key driver for success neset et al 2021 investigated the process of co designing a cs climate services program for urban climate resilience with the citizensensing mobile app they indicated that time effort flexibility and reflectivity are highly required in the co design process nipen et al 2020 integrated a vast network of citizen observations in an operational setting in a sparsely gauged catchment they emphasized the need for quality control before applying cs observations in weather forecasting systems overall the values of cs for environmental data monitoring for scientific discoveries and natural and environmental solutions was immense alfonso et al 2022 capdevila et al 2020 mckinley et al 2017 the applicability of cs data for rainfall forecast accuracy evaluation in an operational weather and flood forecasting system is not well explored moreover the density of conventional rain gauge networks operated by the ethiopian meteorology institute emi is low and thus measurements are not necessarily representative of the true rainfall amount haile et al 2009 the conventional rainfall monitoring gauges installed by national meteorological institute is not designed particular for extreme rainfall monitoring as a result the emi rain gauge network within akaki catchment is sparse the average of the interstation distances of the emi raingauges is around 15 km in akaki which is larger than the 10 km resolution of the rainfall forecasts this makes it difficult to correctly quantify the accuracy of rainfall forecasts by the weather research forecasting wrf model which is used by emi to issue forecasts therefore there is a strong need to explore complimentary data sources such as cs data to serve as a reference dataset to quantify and understand rainfall forecast accuracy in the data scarce urban catchment where flooding is most common see 2019 tian et al 2019 and to thoroughly understand the high extreme rainfall climatology in these areas the wrf model is the most common mesoscale numerical model used for rainfall forecasting done et al 2004 chawla et al 2018 it has sufficiently high horizontal and vertical resolution to forecast mesoscale weather phenomena with a convective nature which are often forced by topography challenges powers et al 2017 the wrf model in urban areas incorporates localized city features including urban structures to parameterize and capture the mesoscale atmospheric conditions city canopy and heat islands powers et al 2017 there are few studies reported on the use of wrf model rainfall forecasts for urban flooding especially in data scarce complex terrain urban catchments patel et al 2019 jeworrek et al 2021 the performance of this model varies in different topographic and climatic conditions topography has been shown to influence the wrf rainfall forecast accuracy due to terrain smoothing applied during numerical stability which misrepresents the true rainfall and advection effect of orographic rainfall wiersema et al 2020 jeworrek et al 2021 moreover climate condition has been shown to influence the accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts due to the shift in the intertropical convergent zone itcz in east africa in mountainous urban catchments ntwali et al 2016 thus it is vital to understand the accuracy of this dataset before applying it to operational hydrologic forecasting purposes in an urban catchment prathipati et al 2022 despite the advancement of hydro meteorological forecasting technologies the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts and its quantitative characterization remains poorly understood most previous studies used conventional rain gauge networks to assess the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts pennelly et al 2014 jeworrek et al 2021 yet conventional rain gauges are inherently sparse in data scarce regions therefore it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy and spatial variability of rainfall forecast cristiano 2017 moreover those studies are highly concentrated in rural areas little information is documented about the accuracy of the wrf model over urban areas using high density rain gauge networks patel et al 2019 a significant change in meteorological features can be observed in urban environments due to a change in surface energy flux jiang et al 2014 therefore it is important to understand the accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts in the data scarce urban setting to enhance flood forecasting systems operational forecasting systems can benefit from citizens observations in validating the rainfall forecast accuracy and its improvement a comprehensive review of cs in applications of pluvial flooding can be found in see 2019 recent studies focused on the use of cs observation for improving precipitation estimates bárdossy et al 2021 and for radar rainfall bias correction mapiam et al 2022 however studies on the applicability of citizen science rainfall observation to assess the wrf rainfall forecasts in urban settings for pluvial flood risk management are limited see 2019 cs can provide alternative high quality rainfall datasets that can be used in atmospheric science muller et al 2015 moreover citizen observations can be used to understand the systematic errors stemming from rain gauge measurement iteratively while evaluating wrf model rainfall forecast accuracy the present study will enhance our understanding on the use of citizens observations for evaluating the accuracy of rainfall forecast spatial scale discrepancies between the rainfall forecast and the reference dataset increases the level of uncertainty during accuracy evaluation the citizens rainfall measurements using rain gauges are point rainfall or within a scale of centimeters conversely wrf model forecasts are on a grid resolution of kilometer scale e g 10 km by 10 km in this study most previous studies assumed that wrf model rainfall forecast error is solely the responsibility of spatial scale inconsistency between the rain gauge observation and the wrf model forecast chawla et al 2018 rogelis and werner 2018 pennelly et al 2014 this assumption is not always correct error can arise from the rain gauge representativeness as demonstrated during accuracy evaluation of satellite and radar rainfall products villarini et al 2008 haile et al 2009 tessema et al 2020 the effect of rain gauge representativeness on the estimated accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast remains to be addressed this study aims to explore the potential of citizens rainfall observations for evaluating the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts and understanding the rain gauge representativeness error in an urban data scarce region daily cs and conventional rainfall data collected from june to september 2020 in the urban akaki catchment addis ababa ethiopia was used for evaluation the added value of a relatively dense citizens observation network for evaluation of wrf model rainfall forecast is explored the rain gauge density of this study is higher than the existing conventional network and most published cs rain gauge networks fehri et al 2020 walker et al 2016 the study will deepen our understanding on the use of cs observation for an operational rainfall and flood forecasting systems and for achieving the sustainable development goals sdg 6 fritz et al 2019 the urban akaki catchment is prone to frequent flooding due to topographic climate and anthropogonic changes birhanu et al 2016 the frequent flooding is responsible for urban transport interruption and inundation of residents cs approach can fill data gaps and generate knowledge to accurately predict evaluate and understand the flood risk of the catchment 2 material and methods we installed a relatively dense rain gauge network to establish a cs based rainfall monitoring program for evaluating the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast a suite of four evaluation approaches were used which comprised continuous evaluation metrics categorical performance metrics gauge representativeness error and bias decomposition three main datasets were adopted namely the daily rainfall data collected by citizen scientists the conventional network operated by emi and up to five days lead time rainfall forecast of the wrf model as issued by emi point to pixel and pixel to pixel evaluation approaches were considered in evaluating the accuracy of the wrf model rainfall forecast pixel to pixel evaluation was performed using reference data from the dense rain gauge network of the cs program point to pixel evaluation was conducted using single rain gauge observation from the cs and the conventional system as reference datasets 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the urban akaki catchment ethiopia the akaki catchment is within the upper awash river sub basin and it includes the sprawling capital city of addis ababa fig 1 the catchment covers the highly developed urban area and rural areas its location ranges between 8 46 9 14 n and 38 34 39 04 e along the western margin of the ethiopian rift valley it is characterized by complex topography with an elevation range between 2048 m and 3370 m above sea level a m s l it covers a catchment area of nearly 1500 km2 and ends at aba samuel reservoir downstream the akaki catchment is considered the main source of water supply for the capital city this urban catchment is characterised by frequent fluvial and pluvial flooding which mainly occur in the downstream part of the catchment area the inter tropical convergence zone itcz seasonal migration controls the rainfall variability in the akaki catchment seleshi and zanke 2004 the summer main rainy season kiremt june to september contributes about 70 of the annual rainfall amount within the catchment moderate and high daily rainfall variations were observed during summer kiremt and belg february to april seasons respectively conway et al 2004 the long term mean annual rainfall amount ranges between 900 mm and 1470 mm with the upstream of the catchment receiving the highest rainfall magnitude the maximum mean monthly rainfall amount is around 300 mm that occurs during the months of july and august conway et al 2004 in contrast low rainfall magnitude occurs from november to january the daily temperature range in the catchment is between 9 9 c and 24 5 c the catchment generates rapid runoff that can cause flooding due to urbanization and steep topography in the upstream region currently ongoing efforts are attempting to enhance the coverage and quality of rainfall data within the catchment however little is known about the accuracy of operational rainfall forecast within this urban catchment 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 citizen science rainfall monitoring program the citizen science program was established before the start of the summer rainy season june to september 2020 unfortunately this period coincided with the time for the emergence of coronavirus covid 19 thus group workshops could not be organized for the consultation and training of citizen scientists instead volunteers were recruited from the community to be engaged as citizen scientists and individually trained the citizen scientists were recruited based on the ability to communicate write listen and speak the local language and have access to a cell phone for the ease of supervision men and women were granted equal opportunity to be engaged as citizen scientists the importance of rainfall data for data gap filling flood risk management and agricultural scheduling were discussed with the initially identified 32 candidates of citizen scientists finally 19 citizen scientists were selected based on their willingness to participate education level age and relative location of rain gauge to residence in order to motivate and prolong the cs program small financial incentives were considered for transmitting data and compensations for time taken to conduct the observation walker et al 2021 the selected 19 citizen scientists were equipped with low cost rain gauges having a graduated plastic cylinder from emi the rain gauge was designed particularly for community based rainfall monitoring with 150 mm capacity 400 cm² area and 0 25 mm increment of graduated markers which increases with rainfall depth the rainfall measurement was taken every day at 9 00 am local time matching measurement time by emi using a standardised recording sheet after the measurement was conducted the rain gauges were emptied for the next recording day training was provided to the citizen scientists demonstrating the equipment and on data recording following relevant guidance for cs programs haile et al 2019 walker et al 2019 initially 32 citizen scientists volunteered for the rainfall monitoring the benefit of rainfall data monitoring such as for flood and drought risk management and the criteria for selecting citizen scientists was described to them the selection was then made considering their willingness education level age and other criteria tedla et al 2022 nineteen 19 citizen scientists were selected from 32 candidates who met most of the criteria and who lived close to the selected gauging location men and women were offered equal opportunity to participate as citizen scientists p9l3 l9 but only few females met the criteria fewer women volunteered or lived near to the rain gauge site for more information about the citizen science program reference is made to tedla et al 2022 the wrf model with a grid of 10 km by 10 km spatial resolution is used by emi to issue rainfall forecasts therefore we installed nine rain gauges at the corners and center of the grid with similar resolution to that of the wrf model fig 2 and eight rain gauges outside of the grid element within the urban catchment additionally there are a conventional and a tipping bucket rain gauge tbr at the center of the grid element the tbr is used for cs rainfall data quality control purposes initially we did not have any quantitative information about the spatial distribution of rainfall in the study area however we expected large rainfall variation within the 10 km by 10 km grid element considering the topographic variations the urban setting and citizens experience of past rainfall events as a result it was decided to install nine 9 rain gauges within single grid element another problem we faced was the lack of information about the spatial rainfall pattern within the grid element to inform the decision on the location of the raingauges considering this lack of isohyetal map we configured the distribution of the raingauges in such a way that the area covered by each rain gauge is nearly equal within the pixel 10 km by 10 km thus the rain gauges were installed to accurately capture the spatiotemporal rainfall pattern in an urban environment within the akaki catchment we installed the rain gauges at the center of the grid element of the wrf rainfall forecast the wrf grid was obtained from the ethiopian meteorological institute emi moreover the raingauges were installed for the grid element that covers downstream and upstream part of the catchment to capture spatial variability of the rainfall 2 2 2 conventional rain gauge data the daily time series rainfall data from june to september 2020 within the akaki catchment was collected from emi however only one conventional rain gauge exists within the grid element of interest for evaluation of the wrf model rainfall forecast the name of this conventional station is kotebe and it is found at the center of the pixel the data from this rain gauge station was used for rainfall forecast evaluation after checking for completeness and consistency 2 2 3 wrf model rainfall forecast we used the rainfall forecast from the wrf model with advanced research wrf dynamic core wrf arw version 3 9 1 1 done et al 2004 this wrf model was configured within emi with two fully interactive nested grid domains the first domain d01 comprises 30 km grid spacing covering the majority of africa and much of the south atlantic and indian oceans the second wrf nested domain d02 covers east africa and the indian ocean at a horizontal resolution of 10 km grid spacing composed of 352 352 grid points fig 2 the wrf model rainfall forecast is highly dependent on model configuration especially cumulus cu parameterization and microphysics mp schemes the current wrf model employed several parameterization schemes including the thompson microphysics scheme merino et al 2022 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global forecast model gfs provides both the initial conditions and the lateral boundary conditions for wrf model configuration at six hour intervals at emi two combined best performing urban schemes were used in the wrf model configuration to consider urbanization effect this configuration was then used to hindcast the events using gfs initial and boundary conditions twelve hour spin up time was considered before the actual forecast start time rainfall forecast error was minimized with the help of data assimilation schemes nudging and 3dvar the physics schemes adopted in this wrf model rainfall forecast are shown in table 1 and reference is made to teklay et al 2019 2 3 data quality control frequent supervision refresher training and feedback to citizen scientists along with field inspections were conducted to reduce errors during citizen science rainfall data collection this is vital to identify error sources at an early stage to correct citizen scientists during supervision and to provide swift feedback to the volunteers the data collected prior to june 2020 was discarded in cases where there were suspicious measurements this was due to citizen scientist inexperience at the early stage of the observation period the rainfall amounts within the catchment are mainly influenced by urban dynamics elevation differences and spatial rainfall variations on the other hand the cs rainfall data may be affected by random and systematic errors with some of the error introduced by the citizen scientists this error can be reduced by adopting a rainfall quality control procedure the current study acknowledges the strong need for cs rainfall observation quality control especially when volunteers are involved in rainfall data collection and recording a progressive quality control procedure was employed to detect and remove error from simple to detect errors to the most complex errors data quality was evaluated using visual inspection graphically and with statistical tests reference is made to tedla et al 2022 for the data quality assessment of the cs rainfall data in this study 2 4 evaluation approach the wrf model rainfall forecast was evaluated against the rainfall data from the conventional rain gauge and the cs program pixel to pixel and point to pixel approaches were followed during evaluation for the pixel to pixel evaluation the point rainfall data from the nine 9 rain gauges was converted to spatial averaged rainfall amount over the grid element area weighted average of the rainfall from the 9 rain gauges was used as the reference data to evaluate the accuracy of the wrf rainfall forecast in point to pixel evaluation single rain gauge at the center of the grid element provided the reference rainfall data continuous and categorical evaluation metrics and gauge representative error were used for the accuracy assessment as described below 2 4 1 continuous evaluation metrics here taylor diagram taylor 2001 empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf and the modified kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 gupta et al 2009 evaluation metrics were considered for the evaluation of wrf model rainfall forecast the kge eq 1 decomposes the performance of the rainfall forecast into three different forms which are the linear correlation r eq 2 the bias ratio β eq 3 which measures the overestimation or underestimation of rainfall forecast against the observations and the variability ratio γ eq 4 which estimates the relative measure of the dispersion kling et al 2012 the kge was chosen to understand the rainfall forecast ability to reproduce the spatiotemporal dynamics r and maintain volume and distribution of the rainfall β and γ respectively the optimum value for kge r and β is 1 whereas γ s optimal value is 0 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 2 r i 1 n o i o f i f i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n f i f 2 3 β μ f μ o 4 γ cv f cv o σ f μ f σ o μ o where n is the number of observations oi and fi are the observed and the corresponding forecasted rainfall values at day i respectively o and f are the arithmetic mean of the observations and rainfall forecast 2 4 2 categorical performance metrics probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were used to assess the detection or reproducing ability of the rainfall forecast for this purpose a binary skill score was developed with yes or and no categories using a contingency table table 2 heavy rainfall rates up to 20 mm day as classified by haile and rientjes 2015 were included in this categorical evaluation procedure the fraction of observed rainfall amount that was correctly detected by the wrf model rainfall forecast were computed and evaluated with pod eq 5 the incorrectly detected rainfall amounts by the wrf model were computed and evaluated with far eq 6 the range of the score values for pod and far are from 0 to 1 with a perfect score of 1 and 0 respectively the critical success index csi or threat score measures the fraction of forecast events that were correctly predicted eq 7 its perfect score is 1 5 pod h h m 6 far fa h fa 7 csi h h m fa where h represents a hit a wrf model rainfall forecast that correctly detects the type of rainfall event measured at the corresponding rain gauge station m represents a miss an event recorded at the rain gauge but not correctly detected by the wrf model fa represents a false alarm a rainfall event detected by the wrf model but not at the rain gauge 2 4 3 gauge representativeness error verification of rainfall forecast from the wrf model often uses a single gauge against pixel rainfall forecast chawla et al 2018 this over or underestimated the reported rainfall forecast error since a single gauge could not represent the entire area of the pixel haile et al 2012 thus to better understand gauge effect on wrf rainfall forecast accuracy the gauge representativeness error difference between true rainfall and gauge has to be separated from the wrf gauge difference for this purpose we adopted the error variance separation method evsm haile et al 2012 as described below 8 var r f r t var r f r g var r g r t where rt is the true pixel average rainfall which is unknown by lack of raingauges to capture it mm d 1 rf is the wrf rainfall forecast over the pixel mm d 1 and rg the rainfall amount measured by single rain gauge within the wrf pixel area mm d 1 the first and the second terms on the right hand side of eq 8 are the variance of wrf gauge difference var rf rg and gauge representativeness error respectively var rg rt the left side of eq 8 is the variance of wrf error var rf rt the variance of wrf error can be estimated from the daily values of wrf rainfall forecast and the cs rainfall data at each station as follows 9 var r f r g i n r fi r gi 2 n where n is the number of samples and i 1 2 3 4 n the mean variance of the gauge representativeness error can be estimated from the variance reduction factor vrf as follows ciach et al 2003 haile et al 2012 10 var r g r t var r g x vrf where var rg is the variance of citizen scientist measured rainfall with respect to each rain gauge and variance reduction factor corresponding to the citizen scientists rain gauge stations is labeled as vrf the vrf can be quantified from the rainfall correlation structure estimation of the study area 11 vrf 1 2 a a ρ xg x d x 2 1 a 2 a a ρ x y d x 2 d y 2 where ρ is the spatial correlation function xg is the rain gauge location within the wrf pixel and a is areal domain of wrf with coordinates x and y exponential model with three parameters eqn 12 was applied to determine the spatial correlation structure as used in haile et al 2009 the level of linear dependence of rainfall observation among a pair of rain gauge stations separated by the distance d is expressed with a spatial correlation coefficient ρ for this a three parameter exponential model was developed to express the relationship among the correlation coefficient ρ and interstation distance d the model was used to understand the spatial rainfall variability haile et al 2009 tessema et al 2020 the model is expressed below in eq 12 and shows an increase in the interstation distance with a reduction pattern of correlation 12 ρ d c o exp d d o s o where co is the nugget factor a correlation value at near zero inter station distance d is the distance between a pair of stations do is the correlation distance decorrelation scale and so is the shape factor or parameter the parameters co do and so are model fitting parameters 2 4 4 bias decomposition the total bias is an indicative of an average systematic error over the analysis period for the current study total bias of the rainfall forecast was decomposed into its components to understand the source of the systematic error haile et al 2012 tessema et al 2020 the total bias is expressed as follows 13 bias i 1 n r fi i 1 n r gi then the total bias is decomposed in to three components 14 hit b ias i 1 n r fi r gi r f 0 r g 0 15 missed b ias i 1 n r g r f 0 r g 0 16 false b ias i 1 n r f r f 0 r g 0 where rf and rg are the wrf model rainfall forecast and the reference citizen science rainfall data respectively the number of paired datasets is denoted with n 3 results 3 1 rainfall variability and quality control after conducting quality control the period from june to september 2020 was considered for further analysis the summary statistics of rainfall data from conventional gauge and cs monitoring program along with 5 days lead time wrf model rainfall forecast is shown in table 4 the mean rainfall magnitude of the cs rain gauge ranges from 7 8 to 9 1 mm per day table 3 this revealed that the rain events could be labeled as moderate to heavy and had a large spatial variation a wide mean rainfall range the coefficient of variation cv of the daily rainfall varied between 1 02 mm at station ta01 and 1 3 mm at station ye01 fig 1 the mean rainfall amount was smaller than the standard deviation sd cv 100 for all cs and conventional rain gauges the lowest and the largest magnitude of cs mean rainfall were observed at station ko 01 and im 01 respectively the largest rainfall amount was observed at me01 rain gauge with a magnitude of 65 mm on 4 august 2020 moreover the highest rainfall totals were in july and august during 2020 summer rainy season the statistics of the wrf model rainfall forecast is well within a range of cs and conventional observed rainfall amount especially for the first 24 h forecast table 4 however major variations were observed against the observations as the lead time increased from 1 day to 5 days on average the rainfall forecast overestimated the cs pixel average observations by 0 5 1 4 and 3 4 mm per day for 1 day 2 days and 3 days lead time respectively conversely underestimation was shown on the 4 days and 5 days lead time with an amount ranging from 2 to 5 mm of rainfall over the observation period the reason behind the larger magnitude of cumulative rainfall value for the citizen science pixel average could be due to under representation of the rainfall magnitude at the center of the pixel as compared to the entire pixel average rainfall 10 km by 10 km the rainfall observation has passed through a rigorous quality control procedure thus the over and underestimations of extreme rainfall amounts is caused by the model s limitation which calls for efforts to improve the model performance for these conditions the spatial and temporal pattern of the observed rainfall was examined using exceedance probability plots the exceedance probabilities of daily rainfall amount of the individual citizen science rain gauges within the pixel and the pixel average rainfall amount for the period june to september 2020 was shown in fig 13 the figure shows that the high rainfall magnitudes of stations me01 su01 ye01 and ar01 exceed the average rainfall amount of the grid element however the low rainfall magnitudes of these stations are smaller than the average rainfall amount the rainfall of the other stations is smaller than the average rainfall amount for all rainfall value ranges hence the exceedance probably plots showed spatial variation of rainfall 3 2 spatial correlation structure characteristic first the exponential model was fitted for the daily cs observed rainfall data against inter station distance the correlation at zero inter station distance co is equal to 1 0 eq 12 initially the shape parameter value was found to be 0 53 with a correlation distance do of 12 1 km in the second case we found that co 0 95 a shape parameter of 0 61 and a correlation distance of 19 89 km for which the correlation became 0 48 the value of the shape parameter revealed a sharp decline in the correlation structure as shown in fig 3 there is a decreasing trend in the daily correlation structure of the rainfall the plot of correlation between rainfall and station separation distance is shown in fig 4 the plot shows strong scatted indicating that the correlation varies substantially for the same inter station distance this indicates that the distance between two pair of stations is not always the only factor causing spatial differences in the daily rainfall amount within the catchment however distance is still the most dominant explanatory factor for spatial rainfall variation within the akaki catchment the fitting curve shows a sharp decline of the correlation coefficient for small separation distances and a gradual decline for large separation distance the scatter plot in fig 5 shows a weak relationship between the seasonal rainfall amount and elevation of stations this suggests that factors other than elevation have a large effect on the seasonal rainfall over these elevation ranges 2000 m and 2400 m these factors include wind direction inter station distance and terrain aspect however the seasonal rainfall moderately increases with elevation above 2400 m the correlation between seasonal rainfall and elevation is only 0 01 and between seasonal rainfall and station distance from the center of the grid element is 0 67 thus the seasonal daily rainfall distribution of 2020 was mostly explained by interstation distance rather than station elevation 3 3 forecast accuracy based on continuous evaluation metrics as a part of continuous evaluation metrics figs 6 8 show scatter plots of the wrf rainfall forecast against the cs pixel average cs single pixel center and conventional rain gauge observations respectively single pixel center and pixel average rain gauges were incorporated in the forecast assessment in order to understand the error level due to effect of the spatial representation whereas the conventional gauge was considered to understand its limitation and advantage in evaluating the rainfall forecast the scatter plot revealed that all the three categories of rain gauge data have strong mutual relationship to that of the wrf model rainfall forecast for 1 3 days lead time the correlation ameliorated when pixel average rain gauges were considered as reference data during rainfall forecast evaluation over the observation period fig 6 the correlation values between the rainfall forecast and the observations explains the strength of the relationship between the variables as shown in the scatter plot in figs 6 8 on daily time interval the correlation value of 0 81 0 74 0 63 0 55 and 0 45 was found for 1 day to 5 days lead time respectively when evaluated against the pixel average cs rainfall data this relationship is deteriorated when assessed against the conventional and single gauge cs rainfall observations the forecast accuracy increased when the pixel average was adopted for assessment suggesting presence of spatial gauge representation effect taylor diagrams taylor 2001 were employed to evaluate the rainfall forecast using the observed rainfall data as part of a continuous evaluation metrics approach fig 9 the result was presented by comparing the spatial scale difference among point rain gauge center of pixel and pixel average cs rain gauges against the wrf model rainfall forecast furthermore the result was interpreted in terms of the taylor diagram s complimentary statistical information correlation coefficient cc centered root mean squared difference rmsd and the normalized standard deviations sd for this purpose all nine 9 cs and conventional rain gauges were employed for the evaluation point to pixel and pixel to pixel evaluation approach was followed the rmsd value for all point to pixel and pixel to pixel were found to be less than 10 and 8 mm per day respectively regardless of the forecast lead time fig 9 the centered rmsd value was between 3 2 and 10 mm per day irrespective of the spatial scale evaluation within the pixel however the forecast showed an increase in the value of rmsd as the lead time increases from 1 day to 5 days moreover a better rainfall forecast performance was observed when pixel to pixel accuracy assessment of wrf model was conducted rmsd 3 2 mm per day for 1 day lead time against cs pixel average rather than the point to pixel evaluation rmsd 5 7 and 5 8 mm per day for 1 day lead time with cs single gauge and conventional gauges respectively the result suggests a single gauge is not adequate to capture the true accuracy of the rainfall forecast the degree of association between observation and rainfall forecast can be understood with cc within the taylor diagram the cc value ranges from 0 40 to 0 81 the pixel to pixel comparison revealed a strong performance in terms of the cc except for the 5 days lead time forecast showed more or less a constant value no significant difference in performance was observed for both pixel to pixel and point to pixel accuracy assessment in terms of cc value the result indicates a strong association when the forecast lead time decreases from 5 days to 1 day a weaker association was observed beyond 4 days lead time forecast cc value less than or equal to 0 4 the sd value was considered in the present taylor diagram to examine the degree of scatter of the forecast values around the mean measure of dispersion as compared to the observation the forecasts are closer to the observation indicating similarity in terms of sd less than 10 mm and similar dispersion with that of the observed values however a higher variation was noticed for the 3 days lead time forecast with point to pixel and pixel to pixel evaluation approach than the observed the 1 day and 2 days lead time forecast exhibited a higher value of sd about the mean to the reference gauges for those lead times the sd increases by the ratio of the variances of forecast over the observed dataset based on the taylor diagram analysis fig 9 the wrf model rainfall forecast exhibited a good performance accuracy up to 3 days lead time regardless of the evaluation approach point to pixel or pixel to pixel however moderately poor accuracy was observed for rainfall forecast beyond 4 days lead time the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf was used to evaluate the forecast accuracy against the cs pixel average cs single and conventional rainfall data within the catchment fig 11 the accuracy is said to increase as the wrf model rainfall forecast gets closer to the observed even though there is a minor accuracy difference among rainfall forecasts fig 11 the 1 3 days lead time wrf rainfall forecast shows a strong agreement with the observation regardless of the reference datasets however the 4 days and 5 days lead time forecast revealed a weak relationship with the observation in terms of ecdf the 1 day lead time rainfall forecast outperformed all the other forecasts in capturing the daily rainfall distribution within the pixel in the akaki catchment according to the quantile of rainfall forecast the 4 and 5 days lead time rainfall forecast underestimated the observed rainfall however the 1 3 days lead time rainfall forecast showed a slight over estimation the 5 days lead time showed the lowest performance in capturing heavy daily rainfall amounts moreover all the rainfall forecasts showed overestimation when evaluated against the conventional rain gauge especially between 10 and 30 mm of rainfall amount per day 3 3 1 the modified kling gupta efficiency kge the estimated modified kling gupta efficiency kge with its three components linear correlation cc bias γ variability ratio β is shown in table 5 for all lead times the wrf model rainfall forecast performance is higher when evaluated against the pixel average rain gauge than the single rain gauge pixel center as explained by higher kge values the median of the kge values for 1 day up to 5 days lead time is 0 74 0 66 0 52 0 48 and 0 32 respectively using pixel average rain gauge observations better kge values were found as the temporal forecasting scale decreases from 5 days to 1 day lead time table 5 the kge values of the rainfall forecasts for cs and single gauge conventional gauge were lower as compared to the pixel average rainfall observations apart from that there is no trend with the variability ratio values across the lead times between the forecast and the reference datasets 3 4 forecast detection skill using categorical indices the rainfall forecast detection skill of wrf model is demonstrated with the median values of catagorical indices probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi fig 10 a score ranging from 0 to 1 was used for all the catagorical verification indices 1 indicates perfect skill for pod and csi where as 0 is the perfect score for far since the sample size of the rainfall data above 21 mm is too small to analyze the statistics we have considered 21 mm as the upper limit of the threshild for evaluating the forecasts using the categorical indices the result revealed that the wrf model rainfall forecasts showed a high probability of detection rate for no rain events for all lead times exept for the 5 days lead time forecast particlularly the 1 day lead time forecast showed the highest detection skill with pod median value of 0 97 for no rain events the low no rain and light rain and high 16 mm day rainfall forecast detection capability of the wrf model was good however the detection ability of the model for rainfall intensities between 6 and 16 mm per day showed low skill relative to the other rainfall events within the pixel with pod value less than 0 45 the far catagorical metrics showed higher forecast performance for the low rainfall no rain and light rain and high rainfall intensities 16 mm day fig 10 the far median value of the forecast for no rain and high rainfall intencities is 0 03 and 0 04 respectively for the 1 day lead time forecast there is only a slight varaition in the far values for all lead times however the 5 days lead time forecast of the model showed poor performance produced low capability in terms of reporting false alaarms moreover the far showed a relatively poor performance for medium rainfall rates 6 16 mm day the critical success index csi reveals the overall performance of the wrf model rainfall forecast by combinng the various aspects of the pod and far against the observation results showed that most of the wrf model forecast were able to capture the observation for no rain and high rainfall rates with csi 0 5 regardless of the forecast lead tme the highest csi value was for the 1 day lead time with a magnitude of 0 76 however major performance reduction was observed with an increase in the forecat lead time from 1 day to 5 days moreover very low performance was observed for rainfall rates between 5 and 10 mm day with csi 0 25 for all lead times the result could be attributed to the frequency of the event being forecast and the convective weather nature 3 5 gauge representativeness error the gauge representativeness error was mainly expressed in terms of variance the variance terms were expressed as ratios to the variance of the total wrf gauge difference var rf rg the results suggest that the variance of the gauge error is responsible for up to 12 36 57 93 of the variance of the wrf gauge differences table 6 as expected the gauge areal representativeness error depends on the gauge location in the wrf pixel in this study the distance between a gauge and a pixel center varies between 0 and 7 07 km gauges located close to the pixel center ko01 have the smallest contribution of gauge error variance to that of wrf gauge difference however this does not necessarily indicate representativeness of the gauge measurement after filtering out the gauge representativeness error the actual variance of the wrf error can be obtained from eq 9 the gauge representativeness error var rg rt ranges from 5 4 to 15 0 suggesting the influence of the rain gauge location on the gauge representativeness error variance the result showed the error variance decreases as the rain gauge is located near to the center of the pixel this is manifested by the large value 46 3 of wrf gauge difference var rf rg at station im01 which is located at the corner of the pixel the variance of the gauge representativeness error is lower than the variance of the wrf gauge difference and the actual wrf error variance var rf rt the need for true areal rainfall is mandatory to reduce the single gauge error effect on wrf rainfall forecast the remaining disagreement is due to the gauge representativeness error which is the variance of the wrf gauge differences most of the gauges which are located near the center of the pixel ko01 led to smaller magnitude of gauge representativeness error than those located far from the center of the pixel ta01 the actual variance of wrf ranges from 28 1 to 96 3 of the disagreement between true rainfall amount and the wrf rainfall forecast the gauge representativeness error contributes about 28 08 83 to the variance of wrf gauge difference we have noted that the variance of gauge representativeness error is much smaller than the actual variance of the wrf error nevertheless the contribution of gauge representativeness error to the forecasted wrf accuracy was too large to be ignored 3 6 bias decomposition the bar chart in fig 12 represents the bias as a percent of total observed rainfall amount the actual and estimated biases of the wrf model rainfall forecast were determined using pixel average and single pixel center gauge rainfall data as reference respectively the actual total bias of wrf rainfall forecast for the 1 day lead time was 5 7 fig 12 the estimated total bias of the forecast increased to 15 5 when evaluated with a single pixel center gauge the difference between the actual and estimated bias is around 9 8 for the 1 day lead time which signals the importance of sufficient spatial rainfall observation to accurately assess the forecast accuracy besides the total bias increased as the lead time increased from 1 day lead time to 5 days lead time in both cases pixel average and single pixel center gauge however the total bias shows overestimation for the first 3 days lead time and underestimation for the 4 and 5 days lead time the underestimation is mainly caused by the high missed rainfall over the observation period the difference in total bias between pixel average and single pixel center gauge could be attributed to the gauge representativeness error since a single pixel center gauge cannot completely represent the entire area of the pixel 100 km2 that is the inadequacy of single gauge to capture the true spatial rainfall amount the contribution of missed bias was larger than hit bias and smaller than false bias regardless of the reference dataset used fig 12 all three component biases were increased with lead time however there was still a difference among the magnitude of bias components depending on the forecast lead time 4 discussion adopting a dense rain gauge network operated by citizen scientists can have a multitude of scientific and societal benefits such as for flood forecasting this study contributes to the emerging understanding on the usability of quality controlled citizen observed rainfall data for the accuracy evaluation of rainfall forecasts the results revealed that multiple cs rain gauges provided an opportunity to fill data gaps and systematically evaluate the rainfall forecast this data useability can further be enhanced by properly establishing the cs program and a strict supervision procedure walker et al 2019 the value of spatial representation of the cs rainfall data was enhanced through quality control qc procedure the cs rainfall data was high quality as verified against the tipping bucket rain gauge tbr and conventional rain gauge data tedla et al 2022 the findings of the rainfall forecast accuracy in terms of scatter plots revealed that all the observations had strong mutual relationship to the rainfall forecast up to 1 3 days lead time the correlation between the rainfall forecast and the reference data outperformed when the reference data was from the cs pixel average observations instead of single gauge nevertheless this relationship deteriorates when the lead time increases to 4 and 5 days lead time the weaker association between the forecast and the observation could be due to systematic error from the observers model physics uncertainty natural climate variability and the orographic nature of the rainfall jeworrek et al 2021 chawla et al 2018 similarly the rmsd cc and the sd values from the taylor diagram indicated similar outcomes to that of the scatter plots where the accuracy of rainfall forecast decreased with lead time and the cs pixel average observations outperformed the other observations the ecdf revealed that the 1 day lead time rainfall forecast captured the rainfall distribution against all the observations within the catchment forecast overestimation was found for 1 3 days lead time while a slight underestimation was noticed for the 4 and 5 days leadtime based on the ecdf plot this could be associated with the uncertainties in the numerical model parameterization the kge value reduced when the forecasts were compared against data from single raingauge observed by citizen scientists and conventional observation than the pixel average rainfall data the kge values indicated that the rainfall forecast accuracy was consistent with previous studies that were conducted in different hydro climatic conditions umer et al 2022 yue et al 2021 in addition the kge values of the current study were shown to decrease with lead time similar to the work of jabbari and bae 2018 the spatial dense rain gauge network within a single pixel 9 rain gauges provided an opportunity to better evaluate the accuracy of the rainfall forecast as compare to a single gauge at the center of the pixel the dense rain gauge data allowed pixel to pixel evaluation of the rainfall forecast accuracy which is not the case in most previous studies teklay et al 2019 chawla et al 2018 the use of multiple cs rain gauges within a pixel means that there is a high probability to detect or reject a given rainfall forecast over the observation period this allows retaining much information about the rainfall data to understand the rainfall forecast regardless of the uncertainty due to the wrf model it is wise to consider that the result is specific to the current study region over the observation period moreover further evaluation of rainfall forecasts with cs rain gauge networks in different hydro climatic regions should be conducted to assess the robustness of the approach as the results could be different the rainfall forecast accuracy evaluation results with categorical indices showed that the model reliably detects rainy days with high accuracy up 3 days lead time however lower performance in terms of capturing ability was observed for medium to high rainfall amount high detection performance was observed for no rain and light rain events 6 mm day rainfall however lower detection performance was found for moderate rainfall events the result of pod far and csi of wrf model rainfall forecasts are more or less similar to the previous studies conducted in other catchments detecting light rain events is much easier than heavy rainfall events according to pod far and csi values teklay et al 2019 the rainfall forecast correctly estimated low rainfall intensity threshold events than medium and high rainfall threshold events however this is mainly dependent on the type of wrf configuration type chawla et al 2018 pennelly et al 2014 and catchment characteristics moreover this could be related to the model physics natural rainfall variability convective systems and possible uncertainties related to the cs observation this problem can be dealt with by the assimilation of cs rainfall observations with the wrf model forecast during the reanalysis stage to fine tune the initial condition of the model physics on the other hand the high detection performance of the model for low and high rainfall forecast could be attributed to the data assimilation scheme used during operational forecasting stage the amount of error resulting from both model forecast and data was examined in additional to instrumental and personal observation errors the spatial misrepresentation of cs rain gauges could induce error tessema et al 2020 our findings showed that error did not solely come from model forecast but also from rain gauge data this finding was made possible with the perusal and treatment of multiple citizen science rain gauge datasets as a network instead of individual gauging stations the gauge representativeness error effect indicated that the variance of the cs gauge error was responsible for up to 28 08 83 of the variance of the wrf gauge differences the actual variance of wrf ranged from 28 1 to 96 3 of the disagreement between true value and the wrf rainfall forecast the wrf gauge difference error contributed about 15 9 46 3 to the variance to that end the contribution of gauge representativeness error to the forecasted wrf accuracy was paramount to our knowledge there are no studies that have applied the error variance separation method for wrf gauge representativeness error variance decomposition this enhances our understanding of how gauge representativeness error affects the wrf rainfall forecast accuracy moreover the wide range of percent bias variations including in the three bias components could be related to the natural variability of rainfall observer s error and error from the numerical model gauge representativeness error and bias decomposition revealed important information about the error source of wrf model rainfall forecast as it was the case for satellite rainfall datasets haile et al 2012 tessema et al 2020 since the rainfall forecast error was found to be high for heavy rainfall events future studies must evaluate how the error propagates to streamflow simulation for flood forecasting the method by worako et al 2022 can be adopted for evaluating error propagation in practice the data assimilation scheme is employed to reduce the error within the wrf model powers et al 2017 data assimilation techniques and a real time updating scheme can further improve the performance of the current rainfall forecast liu et al 2008 powers et al 2017 the wrf model rainfall forecast performance is dependent on the type of cumulus parameterisation schemes a sensitive issue in wrf modeling of rainfall and catchment characteristics chawla et al 2018 the present study employed a single parameterization scheme thus has a limitation in understanding the effect of parameterisation scheme on wrf rainfall forecast accuracy future studies should consider testing other parameterization schemes on a different hydro climatic catchment to reach a comprehensive conclusion on the performance of wrf model rainfall forecast with multiple citizens rainfall observations among the limitations of the current study is its temporal scale which is insufficient for operational flood forecasting and long term flood prediction studies the temporal scale limitation was also noticed in other studies with different hydro climate conditions bárdossy et al 2021 this concern can be resolved by employing rainfall disaggregation from daily to hourly time step with the temporal distribution pattern from tipping bucket rain gauge tbr networks however this may further increase the uncertainty level of the hourly rainfall data if there is a spatial scale issue between the location of tbr and cs stations thus future studies should explore the possibility of cs programs acquiring rainfall data on higher spatial and temporal scale sub daily and hourly this can be achieved by increasing the number of citizen scientists with frequent engagement such as to record rainfall data in sub daily time interval e g hourly data or record the start and end time of the rainfall events the evaluation in this study aimed at rainfall forecasts for lead times that are equal or longer than one day for sub daily lead times citizen scientists for instance can record the start and end time of the rainfall events and this information can be used in combination with sub daily satellite rainfall data for this specific study most of the grid elements of the wrf rainfall forecasts does not have emi rain gauge while a maximum of only single rain gauge was installed by emi office in the wrf rainfall grid elements as a result the true error of wrf rainfall forecasts cannot be known using the emi rain gauge as reference here true error is defined as the difference of the total amount of rainfall forecast and total amount of the actual rainfall single raingauge cannot capture the actual rainfall amount that occurred across 10 km by 10 km grid element of wrf rainfall forecast this is a common problem across the world to overcome such kind of challenges we have installed and monitored nine 9 rain gauges across 10 km by 10 km grid element citizen scientists recorded the rainfall data to reduce the monitoring cost citizen science has twin benefits as it helps volunteers to understand the rainfall characteristics and it helps to fill data gaps we feel that engaging a large number of citizen scientists through a rainfall monitoring program is an essential data gap filling alternative where in situ rainfall monitoring is limited that can be used to understand the true accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts this is especially manifested in data scarce regions where there are low hydrometeorological services moreover this is the first article that has evaluated wrf rainfall forecast through a vast network of citizen science observations within a single grid and within a sparsely gauged catchment a single gauge regardless of conventional or citizen science based monitoring is not a representative reference to evaluate the accuracy of wrf rainfall forecast within the pixel i e point to pixel evaluation have larger uncertainty as compared pixel to pixel evaluation the conventional and a single cs rain gage ko01 station are located at the center of the pixel however the use of multiple cs rain gauge is needed for the accurate evaluation of wrf rainfall forecasts with in the catchment thus adopting numerous cs rain gauge data for evaluating rainfall forecast has a paramount importance especially in areas where existing conventional stations are sparse 5 conclusions in this study the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts was evaluated on a scale of 10 km by 10 km spatial resolution and on a daily temporal resolution up to 5 days lead time the study area was the akaki catchment addis ababa ethiopia nine experimental rain gauge networks within a single pixel were set up for the cs rainfall monitoring the network density is high and unprecedented for wrf model accuracy evaluation in ethiopia the analysis was carried out using single pixel center and pixel average experimental rain gauge network data within the catchment the analysis was conducted on daily time step during the rainy season of june to september 2020 the accuracy was evaluated using categorical indices and continuous metrics moreover the accuracy was assessed in terms of gauge representativeness error and bias decomposition techniques the following concluding remarks are drawn from the results of the present study the use of a cs rainfall monitoring scheme can complement the conventional rainfall monitoring scheme in providing credible spatial and temporal coverage of rainfall data if proper quality control procedure is employed thus future weather forecasting studies should enhance the cs rain gauge density coverage and temporal scale for the benefits of operational forecasting systems the capability of wrf model rainfall forecasts was significantly affected by forecast lead time the accuracy of the rainfall forecast was high for 1 3 days lead time but deteriorated for 4 5 days lead time the wrf model rainfall forecast indicated higher performance when evaluated with cs pixel average rain gauge data as compared to the single pixel center gauge data in the study area this has also been manifested by the comprehensive verification of the wrf model rainfall forecast using continuous evaluation metrics kge cc rmse and ecdf the estimated median kge value for 1 5 days lead time was 0 74 0 66 0 52 0 48 and 0 32 respectively using pixel average rain gauge observations moreover the ecdf result revealed that the 1 day lead time rainfall forecast have the highest performance the pod far and csi values of the rainfall forecast were found to be good for up to 3 days lead time showing strong capability of detecting no rain and light rain events however moderate and heavy rain events were not well captured the study comes to the conclusion that gauge representativeness error cannot be ignored while evaluating the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast since it contributed a variance of 28 08 83 33 to the variance of wrf gauge rainfall difference large scale domain is required to further understand and establish the reasonableness of the evaluated outcomes and the sensitivity of the wrf model rainfall forecast to examine the effect of scale variations and model scheme configuration large scale case studies e g regional should be examined in the future our results suggested that the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast cannot be accurately evaluated solely with a single gauge dataset at a scale of the model resolution thus spatial representation of pixel average rainfall data similar to our cs based experimental rain gauge network is mandatory to explicitly understand and evaluate the accuracy of the rainfall forecast future studies should focus on enhancing the spatial and temporal coverage of cs rainfall monitoring to

7857,study region the akaki catchment is found in the upper awash river basin in ethiopia study focus understanding the accuracy of rainfall forecasts in the data scarce urban catchment has a multitude of benefits given the increased urban flood risk caused by climate change and urbanization in this study accuracy of the weather research and forecasting wrf model rainfall forecast was evaluated using citizen science data categorical and continuous accuracy evaluation metrics were used beside gauge representativeness effect new hydrological insights for the region the rainfall forecasts performance accuracy is high for 1 3 days lead time but deteriorates for 4 5 days lead time the wrf model captured the temporal dynamics and the rainfall amount according to the estimated kge values the model has relatively higher detection performance for no rain and light rain events 6 mm day but it has lower performance for moderate and heavy rain events 6 mm day use of data from a single rain gauge misrepresents the accuracy level of the rainfall forecast in the study area the gauge representativeness error contributed a variance of 28 08 83 33 to the variance of wrf gauge rainfall difference thus the use of citizen science rainfall monitoring program is an essential alternative source of information where in situ rainfall monitoring is limited that can be used to understand the true accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts graphical abstract ga1 keywords wrf rainfall forecast citizen science rainfall data accuracy evaluation addis ababa akaki catchment ethiopia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction citizen science cs the participation of ordinary people in scientific research offers an unprecedented opportunity as a hydro meteorological data source starkey et al 2017 however there are still concerns regarding whether the quality of cs data is sufficient for the requirements of various applications walker et al 2016 showed that citizen scientists can collect rainfall data that is as reliable as the data collected by professionals if there is regular and thorough supervision as a result many researchers are investigating how cs can fill data gaps in hydro meteorological studies muller et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 weeser et al 2018 see 2019 alfonso et al 2022 for instance ferede et al 2020 showed that cs data of rainfall streamflow and groundwater can be used to estimate recharge to a shallow groundwater aquifer starkey et al 2017 reported that qualitative and quantitative data collected by volunteers can inform characterization of river response before and after floods and improve modeling simulations in weather and flood early warning a concerted effort is required to investigate how cs can fill data gaps in rainfall monitoring in general and rainfall forecasting in particular the potential of cs in rainfall monitoring and forecasting is immense but only few examples are available in the literature for example reges et al 2016 showed how volunteer monitoring can be linked with forecasting they suggested using various tools for data collection analysis mapping and a web interface for hydro meteorological studies liu et al 2020 pointed out the importance of building a sustainable relationship among government and citizen scientists for improved weather forecasting and risk communication le et al 2016 identified and suggested the application of crowdsourcing observations in the form of pictures and videos for flood modeling from three projects in argentina france and new zealand they recommended a clear and simple data collection procedure efficient communication plan and awareness creation to enhance the citizen scientists understanding of natural hazards as a key driver for success neset et al 2021 investigated the process of co designing a cs climate services program for urban climate resilience with the citizensensing mobile app they indicated that time effort flexibility and reflectivity are highly required in the co design process nipen et al 2020 integrated a vast network of citizen observations in an operational setting in a sparsely gauged catchment they emphasized the need for quality control before applying cs observations in weather forecasting systems overall the values of cs for environmental data monitoring for scientific discoveries and natural and environmental solutions was immense alfonso et al 2022 capdevila et al 2020 mckinley et al 2017 the applicability of cs data for rainfall forecast accuracy evaluation in an operational weather and flood forecasting system is not well explored moreover the density of conventional rain gauge networks operated by the ethiopian meteorology institute emi is low and thus measurements are not necessarily representative of the true rainfall amount haile et al 2009 the conventional rainfall monitoring gauges installed by national meteorological institute is not designed particular for extreme rainfall monitoring as a result the emi rain gauge network within akaki catchment is sparse the average of the interstation distances of the emi raingauges is around 15 km in akaki which is larger than the 10 km resolution of the rainfall forecasts this makes it difficult to correctly quantify the accuracy of rainfall forecasts by the weather research forecasting wrf model which is used by emi to issue forecasts therefore there is a strong need to explore complimentary data sources such as cs data to serve as a reference dataset to quantify and understand rainfall forecast accuracy in the data scarce urban catchment where flooding is most common see 2019 tian et al 2019 and to thoroughly understand the high extreme rainfall climatology in these areas the wrf model is the most common mesoscale numerical model used for rainfall forecasting done et al 2004 chawla et al 2018 it has sufficiently high horizontal and vertical resolution to forecast mesoscale weather phenomena with a convective nature which are often forced by topography challenges powers et al 2017 the wrf model in urban areas incorporates localized city features including urban structures to parameterize and capture the mesoscale atmospheric conditions city canopy and heat islands powers et al 2017 there are few studies reported on the use of wrf model rainfall forecasts for urban flooding especially in data scarce complex terrain urban catchments patel et al 2019 jeworrek et al 2021 the performance of this model varies in different topographic and climatic conditions topography has been shown to influence the wrf rainfall forecast accuracy due to terrain smoothing applied during numerical stability which misrepresents the true rainfall and advection effect of orographic rainfall wiersema et al 2020 jeworrek et al 2021 moreover climate condition has been shown to influence the accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts due to the shift in the intertropical convergent zone itcz in east africa in mountainous urban catchments ntwali et al 2016 thus it is vital to understand the accuracy of this dataset before applying it to operational hydrologic forecasting purposes in an urban catchment prathipati et al 2022 despite the advancement of hydro meteorological forecasting technologies the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts and its quantitative characterization remains poorly understood most previous studies used conventional rain gauge networks to assess the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts pennelly et al 2014 jeworrek et al 2021 yet conventional rain gauges are inherently sparse in data scarce regions therefore it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy and spatial variability of rainfall forecast cristiano 2017 moreover those studies are highly concentrated in rural areas little information is documented about the accuracy of the wrf model over urban areas using high density rain gauge networks patel et al 2019 a significant change in meteorological features can be observed in urban environments due to a change in surface energy flux jiang et al 2014 therefore it is important to understand the accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts in the data scarce urban setting to enhance flood forecasting systems operational forecasting systems can benefit from citizens observations in validating the rainfall forecast accuracy and its improvement a comprehensive review of cs in applications of pluvial flooding can be found in see 2019 recent studies focused on the use of cs observation for improving precipitation estimates bárdossy et al 2021 and for radar rainfall bias correction mapiam et al 2022 however studies on the applicability of citizen science rainfall observation to assess the wrf rainfall forecasts in urban settings for pluvial flood risk management are limited see 2019 cs can provide alternative high quality rainfall datasets that can be used in atmospheric science muller et al 2015 moreover citizen observations can be used to understand the systematic errors stemming from rain gauge measurement iteratively while evaluating wrf model rainfall forecast accuracy the present study will enhance our understanding on the use of citizens observations for evaluating the accuracy of rainfall forecast spatial scale discrepancies between the rainfall forecast and the reference dataset increases the level of uncertainty during accuracy evaluation the citizens rainfall measurements using rain gauges are point rainfall or within a scale of centimeters conversely wrf model forecasts are on a grid resolution of kilometer scale e g 10 km by 10 km in this study most previous studies assumed that wrf model rainfall forecast error is solely the responsibility of spatial scale inconsistency between the rain gauge observation and the wrf model forecast chawla et al 2018 rogelis and werner 2018 pennelly et al 2014 this assumption is not always correct error can arise from the rain gauge representativeness as demonstrated during accuracy evaluation of satellite and radar rainfall products villarini et al 2008 haile et al 2009 tessema et al 2020 the effect of rain gauge representativeness on the estimated accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast remains to be addressed this study aims to explore the potential of citizens rainfall observations for evaluating the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts and understanding the rain gauge representativeness error in an urban data scarce region daily cs and conventional rainfall data collected from june to september 2020 in the urban akaki catchment addis ababa ethiopia was used for evaluation the added value of a relatively dense citizens observation network for evaluation of wrf model rainfall forecast is explored the rain gauge density of this study is higher than the existing conventional network and most published cs rain gauge networks fehri et al 2020 walker et al 2016 the study will deepen our understanding on the use of cs observation for an operational rainfall and flood forecasting systems and for achieving the sustainable development goals sdg 6 fritz et al 2019 the urban akaki catchment is prone to frequent flooding due to topographic climate and anthropogonic changes birhanu et al 2016 the frequent flooding is responsible for urban transport interruption and inundation of residents cs approach can fill data gaps and generate knowledge to accurately predict evaluate and understand the flood risk of the catchment 2 material and methods we installed a relatively dense rain gauge network to establish a cs based rainfall monitoring program for evaluating the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast a suite of four evaluation approaches were used which comprised continuous evaluation metrics categorical performance metrics gauge representativeness error and bias decomposition three main datasets were adopted namely the daily rainfall data collected by citizen scientists the conventional network operated by emi and up to five days lead time rainfall forecast of the wrf model as issued by emi point to pixel and pixel to pixel evaluation approaches were considered in evaluating the accuracy of the wrf model rainfall forecast pixel to pixel evaluation was performed using reference data from the dense rain gauge network of the cs program point to pixel evaluation was conducted using single rain gauge observation from the cs and the conventional system as reference datasets 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the urban akaki catchment ethiopia the akaki catchment is within the upper awash river sub basin and it includes the sprawling capital city of addis ababa fig 1 the catchment covers the highly developed urban area and rural areas its location ranges between 8 46 9 14 n and 38 34 39 04 e along the western margin of the ethiopian rift valley it is characterized by complex topography with an elevation range between 2048 m and 3370 m above sea level a m s l it covers a catchment area of nearly 1500 km2 and ends at aba samuel reservoir downstream the akaki catchment is considered the main source of water supply for the capital city this urban catchment is characterised by frequent fluvial and pluvial flooding which mainly occur in the downstream part of the catchment area the inter tropical convergence zone itcz seasonal migration controls the rainfall variability in the akaki catchment seleshi and zanke 2004 the summer main rainy season kiremt june to september contributes about 70 of the annual rainfall amount within the catchment moderate and high daily rainfall variations were observed during summer kiremt and belg february to april seasons respectively conway et al 2004 the long term mean annual rainfall amount ranges between 900 mm and 1470 mm with the upstream of the catchment receiving the highest rainfall magnitude the maximum mean monthly rainfall amount is around 300 mm that occurs during the months of july and august conway et al 2004 in contrast low rainfall magnitude occurs from november to january the daily temperature range in the catchment is between 9 9 c and 24 5 c the catchment generates rapid runoff that can cause flooding due to urbanization and steep topography in the upstream region currently ongoing efforts are attempting to enhance the coverage and quality of rainfall data within the catchment however little is known about the accuracy of operational rainfall forecast within this urban catchment 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 citizen science rainfall monitoring program the citizen science program was established before the start of the summer rainy season june to september 2020 unfortunately this period coincided with the time for the emergence of coronavirus covid 19 thus group workshops could not be organized for the consultation and training of citizen scientists instead volunteers were recruited from the community to be engaged as citizen scientists and individually trained the citizen scientists were recruited based on the ability to communicate write listen and speak the local language and have access to a cell phone for the ease of supervision men and women were granted equal opportunity to be engaged as citizen scientists the importance of rainfall data for data gap filling flood risk management and agricultural scheduling were discussed with the initially identified 32 candidates of citizen scientists finally 19 citizen scientists were selected based on their willingness to participate education level age and relative location of rain gauge to residence in order to motivate and prolong the cs program small financial incentives were considered for transmitting data and compensations for time taken to conduct the observation walker et al 2021 the selected 19 citizen scientists were equipped with low cost rain gauges having a graduated plastic cylinder from emi the rain gauge was designed particularly for community based rainfall monitoring with 150 mm capacity 400 cm² area and 0 25 mm increment of graduated markers which increases with rainfall depth the rainfall measurement was taken every day at 9 00 am local time matching measurement time by emi using a standardised recording sheet after the measurement was conducted the rain gauges were emptied for the next recording day training was provided to the citizen scientists demonstrating the equipment and on data recording following relevant guidance for cs programs haile et al 2019 walker et al 2019 initially 32 citizen scientists volunteered for the rainfall monitoring the benefit of rainfall data monitoring such as for flood and drought risk management and the criteria for selecting citizen scientists was described to them the selection was then made considering their willingness education level age and other criteria tedla et al 2022 nineteen 19 citizen scientists were selected from 32 candidates who met most of the criteria and who lived close to the selected gauging location men and women were offered equal opportunity to participate as citizen scientists p9l3 l9 but only few females met the criteria fewer women volunteered or lived near to the rain gauge site for more information about the citizen science program reference is made to tedla et al 2022 the wrf model with a grid of 10 km by 10 km spatial resolution is used by emi to issue rainfall forecasts therefore we installed nine rain gauges at the corners and center of the grid with similar resolution to that of the wrf model fig 2 and eight rain gauges outside of the grid element within the urban catchment additionally there are a conventional and a tipping bucket rain gauge tbr at the center of the grid element the tbr is used for cs rainfall data quality control purposes initially we did not have any quantitative information about the spatial distribution of rainfall in the study area however we expected large rainfall variation within the 10 km by 10 km grid element considering the topographic variations the urban setting and citizens experience of past rainfall events as a result it was decided to install nine 9 rain gauges within single grid element another problem we faced was the lack of information about the spatial rainfall pattern within the grid element to inform the decision on the location of the raingauges considering this lack of isohyetal map we configured the distribution of the raingauges in such a way that the area covered by each rain gauge is nearly equal within the pixel 10 km by 10 km thus the rain gauges were installed to accurately capture the spatiotemporal rainfall pattern in an urban environment within the akaki catchment we installed the rain gauges at the center of the grid element of the wrf rainfall forecast the wrf grid was obtained from the ethiopian meteorological institute emi moreover the raingauges were installed for the grid element that covers downstream and upstream part of the catchment to capture spatial variability of the rainfall 2 2 2 conventional rain gauge data the daily time series rainfall data from june to september 2020 within the akaki catchment was collected from emi however only one conventional rain gauge exists within the grid element of interest for evaluation of the wrf model rainfall forecast the name of this conventional station is kotebe and it is found at the center of the pixel the data from this rain gauge station was used for rainfall forecast evaluation after checking for completeness and consistency 2 2 3 wrf model rainfall forecast we used the rainfall forecast from the wrf model with advanced research wrf dynamic core wrf arw version 3 9 1 1 done et al 2004 this wrf model was configured within emi with two fully interactive nested grid domains the first domain d01 comprises 30 km grid spacing covering the majority of africa and much of the south atlantic and indian oceans the second wrf nested domain d02 covers east africa and the indian ocean at a horizontal resolution of 10 km grid spacing composed of 352 352 grid points fig 2 the wrf model rainfall forecast is highly dependent on model configuration especially cumulus cu parameterization and microphysics mp schemes the current wrf model employed several parameterization schemes including the thompson microphysics scheme merino et al 2022 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global forecast model gfs provides both the initial conditions and the lateral boundary conditions for wrf model configuration at six hour intervals at emi two combined best performing urban schemes were used in the wrf model configuration to consider urbanization effect this configuration was then used to hindcast the events using gfs initial and boundary conditions twelve hour spin up time was considered before the actual forecast start time rainfall forecast error was minimized with the help of data assimilation schemes nudging and 3dvar the physics schemes adopted in this wrf model rainfall forecast are shown in table 1 and reference is made to teklay et al 2019 2 3 data quality control frequent supervision refresher training and feedback to citizen scientists along with field inspections were conducted to reduce errors during citizen science rainfall data collection this is vital to identify error sources at an early stage to correct citizen scientists during supervision and to provide swift feedback to the volunteers the data collected prior to june 2020 was discarded in cases where there were suspicious measurements this was due to citizen scientist inexperience at the early stage of the observation period the rainfall amounts within the catchment are mainly influenced by urban dynamics elevation differences and spatial rainfall variations on the other hand the cs rainfall data may be affected by random and systematic errors with some of the error introduced by the citizen scientists this error can be reduced by adopting a rainfall quality control procedure the current study acknowledges the strong need for cs rainfall observation quality control especially when volunteers are involved in rainfall data collection and recording a progressive quality control procedure was employed to detect and remove error from simple to detect errors to the most complex errors data quality was evaluated using visual inspection graphically and with statistical tests reference is made to tedla et al 2022 for the data quality assessment of the cs rainfall data in this study 2 4 evaluation approach the wrf model rainfall forecast was evaluated against the rainfall data from the conventional rain gauge and the cs program pixel to pixel and point to pixel approaches were followed during evaluation for the pixel to pixel evaluation the point rainfall data from the nine 9 rain gauges was converted to spatial averaged rainfall amount over the grid element area weighted average of the rainfall from the 9 rain gauges was used as the reference data to evaluate the accuracy of the wrf rainfall forecast in point to pixel evaluation single rain gauge at the center of the grid element provided the reference rainfall data continuous and categorical evaluation metrics and gauge representative error were used for the accuracy assessment as described below 2 4 1 continuous evaluation metrics here taylor diagram taylor 2001 empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf and the modified kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 gupta et al 2009 evaluation metrics were considered for the evaluation of wrf model rainfall forecast the kge eq 1 decomposes the performance of the rainfall forecast into three different forms which are the linear correlation r eq 2 the bias ratio β eq 3 which measures the overestimation or underestimation of rainfall forecast against the observations and the variability ratio γ eq 4 which estimates the relative measure of the dispersion kling et al 2012 the kge was chosen to understand the rainfall forecast ability to reproduce the spatiotemporal dynamics r and maintain volume and distribution of the rainfall β and γ respectively the optimum value for kge r and β is 1 whereas γ s optimal value is 0 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 2 r i 1 n o i o f i f i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n f i f 2 3 β μ f μ o 4 γ cv f cv o σ f μ f σ o μ o where n is the number of observations oi and fi are the observed and the corresponding forecasted rainfall values at day i respectively o and f are the arithmetic mean of the observations and rainfall forecast 2 4 2 categorical performance metrics probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were used to assess the detection or reproducing ability of the rainfall forecast for this purpose a binary skill score was developed with yes or and no categories using a contingency table table 2 heavy rainfall rates up to 20 mm day as classified by haile and rientjes 2015 were included in this categorical evaluation procedure the fraction of observed rainfall amount that was correctly detected by the wrf model rainfall forecast were computed and evaluated with pod eq 5 the incorrectly detected rainfall amounts by the wrf model were computed and evaluated with far eq 6 the range of the score values for pod and far are from 0 to 1 with a perfect score of 1 and 0 respectively the critical success index csi or threat score measures the fraction of forecast events that were correctly predicted eq 7 its perfect score is 1 5 pod h h m 6 far fa h fa 7 csi h h m fa where h represents a hit a wrf model rainfall forecast that correctly detects the type of rainfall event measured at the corresponding rain gauge station m represents a miss an event recorded at the rain gauge but not correctly detected by the wrf model fa represents a false alarm a rainfall event detected by the wrf model but not at the rain gauge 2 4 3 gauge representativeness error verification of rainfall forecast from the wrf model often uses a single gauge against pixel rainfall forecast chawla et al 2018 this over or underestimated the reported rainfall forecast error since a single gauge could not represent the entire area of the pixel haile et al 2012 thus to better understand gauge effect on wrf rainfall forecast accuracy the gauge representativeness error difference between true rainfall and gauge has to be separated from the wrf gauge difference for this purpose we adopted the error variance separation method evsm haile et al 2012 as described below 8 var r f r t var r f r g var r g r t where rt is the true pixel average rainfall which is unknown by lack of raingauges to capture it mm d 1 rf is the wrf rainfall forecast over the pixel mm d 1 and rg the rainfall amount measured by single rain gauge within the wrf pixel area mm d 1 the first and the second terms on the right hand side of eq 8 are the variance of wrf gauge difference var rf rg and gauge representativeness error respectively var rg rt the left side of eq 8 is the variance of wrf error var rf rt the variance of wrf error can be estimated from the daily values of wrf rainfall forecast and the cs rainfall data at each station as follows 9 var r f r g i n r fi r gi 2 n where n is the number of samples and i 1 2 3 4 n the mean variance of the gauge representativeness error can be estimated from the variance reduction factor vrf as follows ciach et al 2003 haile et al 2012 10 var r g r t var r g x vrf where var rg is the variance of citizen scientist measured rainfall with respect to each rain gauge and variance reduction factor corresponding to the citizen scientists rain gauge stations is labeled as vrf the vrf can be quantified from the rainfall correlation structure estimation of the study area 11 vrf 1 2 a a ρ xg x d x 2 1 a 2 a a ρ x y d x 2 d y 2 where ρ is the spatial correlation function xg is the rain gauge location within the wrf pixel and a is areal domain of wrf with coordinates x and y exponential model with three parameters eqn 12 was applied to determine the spatial correlation structure as used in haile et al 2009 the level of linear dependence of rainfall observation among a pair of rain gauge stations separated by the distance d is expressed with a spatial correlation coefficient ρ for this a three parameter exponential model was developed to express the relationship among the correlation coefficient ρ and interstation distance d the model was used to understand the spatial rainfall variability haile et al 2009 tessema et al 2020 the model is expressed below in eq 12 and shows an increase in the interstation distance with a reduction pattern of correlation 12 ρ d c o exp d d o s o where co is the nugget factor a

parameters co do and so are model fitting parameters 2 4 4 bias decomposition the total bias is an indicative of an average systematic error over the analysis period for the current study total bias of the rainfall forecast was decomposed into its components to understand the source of the systematic error haile et al 2012 tessema et al 2020 the total bias is expressed as follows 13 bias i 1 n r fi i 1 n r gi then the total bias is decomposed in to three components 14 hit b ias i 1 n r fi r gi r f 0 r g 0 15 missed b ias i 1 n r g r f 0 r g 0 16 false b ias i 1 n r f r f 0 r g 0 where rf and rg are the wrf model rainfall forecast and the reference citizen science rainfall data respectively the number of paired datasets is denoted with n 3 results 3 1 rainfall variability and quality control after conducting quality control the period from june to september 2020 was considered for further analysis the summary statistics of rainfall data from conventional gauge and cs monitoring program along with 5 days lead time wrf model rainfall forecast is shown in table 4 the mean rainfall magnitude of the cs rain gauge ranges from 7 8 to 9 1 mm per day table 3 this revealed that the rain events could be labeled as moderate to heavy and had a large spatial variation a wide mean rainfall range the coefficient of variation cv of the daily rainfall varied between 1 02 mm at station ta01 and 1 3 mm at station ye01 fig 1 the mean rainfall amount was smaller than the standard deviation sd cv 100 for all cs and conventional rain gauges the lowest and the largest magnitude of cs mean rainfall were observed at station ko 01 and im 01 respectively the largest rainfall amount was observed at me01 rain gauge with a magnitude of 65 mm on 4 august 2020 moreover the highest rainfall totals were in july and august during 2020 summer rainy season the statistics of the wrf model rainfall forecast is well within a range of cs and conventional observed rainfall amount especially for the first 24 h forecast table 4 however major variations were observed against the observations as the lead time increased from 1 day to 5 days on average the rainfall forecast overestimated the cs pixel average observations by 0 5 1 4 and 3 4 mm per day for 1 day 2 days and 3 days lead time respectively conversely underestimation was shown on the 4 days and 5 days lead time with an amount ranging from 2 to 5 mm of rainfall over the observation period the reason behind the larger magnitude of cumulative rainfall value for the citizen science pixel average could be due to under representation of the rainfall magnitude at the center of the pixel as compared to the entire pixel average rainfall 10 km by 10 km the rainfall observation has passed through a rigorous quality control procedure thus the over and underestimations of extreme rainfall amounts is caused by the model s limitation which calls for efforts to improve the model performance for these conditions the spatial and temporal pattern of the observed rainfall was examined using exceedance probability plots the exceedance probabilities of daily rainfall amount of the individual citizen science rain gauges within the pixel and the pixel average rainfall amount for the period june to september 2020 was shown in fig 13 the figure shows that the high rainfall magnitudes of stations me01 su01 ye01 and ar01 exceed the average rainfall amount of the grid element however the low rainfall magnitudes of these stations are smaller than the average rainfall amount the rainfall of the other stations is smaller than the average rainfall amount for all rainfall value ranges hence the exceedance probably plots showed spatial variation of rainfall 3 2 spatial correlation structure characteristic first the exponential model was fitted for the daily cs observed rainfall data against inter station distance the correlation at zero inter station distance co is equal to 1 0 eq 12 initially the shape parameter value was found to be 0 53 with a correlation distance do of 12 1 km in the second case we found that co 0 95 a shape parameter of 0 61 and a correlation distance of 19 89 km for which the correlation became 0 48 the value of the shape parameter revealed a sharp decline in the correlation structure as shown in fig 3 there is a decreasing trend in the daily correlation structure of the rainfall the plot of correlation between rainfall and station separation distance is shown in fig 4 the plot shows strong scatted indicating that the correlation varies substantially for the same inter station distance this indicates that the distance between two pair of stations is not always the only factor causing spatial differences in the daily rainfall amount within the catchment however distance is still the most dominant explanatory factor for spatial rainfall variation within the akaki catchment the fitting curve shows a sharp decline of the correlation coefficient for small separation distances and a gradual decline for large separation distance the scatter plot in fig 5 shows a weak relationship between the seasonal rainfall amount and elevation of stations this suggests that factors other than elevation have a large effect on the seasonal rainfall over these elevation ranges 2000 m and 2400 m these factors include wind direction inter station distance and terrain aspect however the seasonal rainfall moderately increases with elevation above 2400 m the correlation between seasonal rainfall and elevation is only 0 01 and between seasonal rainfall and station distance from the center of the grid element is 0 67 thus the seasonal daily rainfall distribution of 2020 was mostly explained by interstation distance rather than station elevation 3 3 forecast accuracy based on continuous evaluation metrics as a part of continuous evaluation metrics figs 6 8 show scatter plots of the wrf rainfall forecast against the cs pixel average cs single pixel center and conventional rain gauge observations respectively single pixel center and pixel average rain gauges were incorporated in the forecast assessment in order to understand the error level due to effect of the spatial representation whereas the conventional gauge was considered to understand its limitation and advantage in evaluating the rainfall forecast the scatter plot revealed that all the three categories of rain gauge data have strong mutual relationship to that of the wrf model rainfall forecast for 1 3 days lead time the correlation ameliorated when pixel average rain gauges were considered as reference data during rainfall forecast evaluation over the observation period fig 6 the correlation values between the rainfall forecast and the observations explains the strength of the relationship between the variables as shown in the scatter plot in figs 6 8 on daily time interval the correlation value of 0 81 0 74 0 63 0 55 and 0 45 was found for 1 day to 5 days lead time respectively when evaluated against the pixel average cs rainfall data this relationship is deteriorated when assessed against the conventional and single gauge cs rainfall observations the forecast accuracy increased when the pixel average was adopted for assessment suggesting presence of spatial gauge representation effect taylor diagrams taylor 2001 were employed to evaluate the rainfall forecast using the observed rainfall data as part of a continuous evaluation metrics approach fig 9 the result was presented by comparing the spatial scale difference among point rain gauge center of pixel and pixel average cs rain gauges against the wrf model rainfall forecast furthermore the result was interpreted in terms of the taylor diagram s complimentary statistical information correlation coefficient cc centered root mean squared difference rmsd and the normalized standard deviations sd for this purpose all nine 9 cs and conventional rain gauges were employed for the evaluation point to pixel and pixel to pixel evaluation approach was followed the rmsd value for all point to pixel and pixel to pixel were found to be less than 10 and 8 mm per day respectively regardless of the forecast lead time fig 9 the centered rmsd value was between 3 2 and 10 mm per day irrespective of the spatial scale evaluation within the pixel however the forecast showed an increase in the value of rmsd as the lead time increases from 1 day to 5 days moreover a better rainfall forecast performance was observed when pixel to pixel accuracy assessment of wrf model was conducted rmsd 3 2 mm per day for 1 day lead time against cs pixel average rather than the point to pixel evaluation rmsd 5 7 and 5 8 mm per day for 1 day lead time with cs single gauge and conventional gauges respectively the result suggests a single gauge is not adequate to capture the true accuracy of the rainfall forecast the degree of association between observation and rainfall forecast can be understood with cc within the taylor diagram the cc value ranges from 0 40 to 0 81 the pixel to pixel comparison revealed a strong performance in terms of the cc except for the 5 days lead time forecast showed more or less a constant value no significant difference in performance was observed for both pixel to pixel and point to pixel accuracy assessment in terms of cc value the result indicates a strong association when the forecast lead time decreases from 5 days to 1 day a weaker association was observed beyond 4 days lead time forecast cc value less than or equal to 0 4 the sd value was considered in the present taylor diagram to examine the degree of scatter of the forecast values around the mean measure of dispersion as compared to the observation the forecasts are closer to the observation indicating similarity in terms of sd less than 10 mm and similar dispersion with that of the observed values however a higher variation was noticed for the 3 days lead time forecast with point to pixel and pixel to pixel evaluation approach than the observed the 1 day and 2 days lead time forecast exhibited a higher value of sd about the mean to the reference gauges for those lead times the sd increases by the ratio of the variances of forecast over the observed dataset based on the taylor diagram analysis fig 9 the wrf model rainfall forecast exhibited a good performance accuracy up to 3 days lead time regardless of the evaluation approach point to pixel or pixel to pixel however moderately poor accuracy was observed for rainfall forecast beyond 4 days lead time the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf was used to evaluate the forecast accuracy against the cs pixel average cs single and conventional rainfall data within the catchment fig 11 the accuracy is said to increase as the wrf model rainfall forecast gets closer to the observed even though there is a minor accuracy difference among rainfall forecasts fig 11 the 1 3 days lead time wrf rainfall forecast shows a strong agreement with the observation regardless of the reference datasets however the 4 days and 5 days lead time forecast revealed a weak relationship with the observation in terms of ecdf the 1 day lead time rainfall forecast outperformed all the other forecasts in capturing the daily rainfall distribution within the pixel in the akaki catchment according to the quantile of rainfall forecast the 4 and 5 days lead time rainfall forecast underestimated the observed rainfall however the 1 3 days lead time rainfall forecast showed a slight over estimation the 5 days lead time showed the lowest performance in capturing heavy daily rainfall amounts moreover all the rainfall forecasts showed overestimation when evaluated against the conventional rain gauge especially between 10 and 30 mm of rainfall amount per day 3 3 1 the modified kling gupta efficiency kge the estimated modified kling gupta efficiency kge with its three components linear correlation cc bias γ variability ratio β is shown in table 5 for all lead times the wrf model rainfall forecast performance is higher when evaluated against the pixel average rain gauge than the single rain gauge pixel center as explained by higher kge values the median of the kge values for 1 day up to 5 days lead time is 0 74 0 66 0 52 0 48 and 0 32 respectively using pixel average rain gauge observations better kge values were found as the temporal forecasting scale decreases from 5 days to 1 day lead time table 5 the kge values of the rainfall forecasts for cs and single gauge conventional gauge were lower as compared to the pixel average rainfall observations apart from that there is no trend with the variability ratio values across the lead times between the forecast and the reference datasets 3 4 forecast detection skill using categorical indices the rainfall forecast detection skill of wrf model is demonstrated with the median values of catagorical indices probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi fig 10 a score ranging from 0 to 1 was used for all the catagorical verification indices 1 indicates perfect skill for pod and csi where as 0 is the perfect score for far since the sample size of the rainfall data above 21 mm is too small to analyze the statistics we have considered 21 mm as the upper limit of the threshild for evaluating the forecasts using the categorical indices the result revealed that the wrf model rainfall forecasts showed a high probability of detection rate for no rain events for all lead times exept for the 5 days lead time forecast particlularly the 1 day lead time forecast showed the highest detection skill with pod median value of 0 97 for no rain events the low no rain and light rain and high 16 mm day rainfall forecast detection capability of the wrf model was good however the detection ability of the model for rainfall intensities between 6 and 16 mm per day showed low skill relative to the other rainfall events within the pixel with pod value less than 0 45 the far catagorical metrics showed higher forecast performance for the low rainfall no rain and light rain and high rainfall intensities 16 mm day fig 10 the far median value of the forecast for no rain and high rainfall intencities is 0 03 and 0 04 respectively for the 1 day lead time forecast there is only a slight varaition in the far values for all lead times however the 5 days lead time forecast of the model showed poor performance produced low capability in terms of reporting false alaarms moreover the far showed a relatively poor performance for medium rainfall rates 6 16 mm day the critical success index csi reveals the overall performance of the wrf model rainfall forecast by combinng the various aspects of the pod and far against the observation results showed that most of the wrf model forecast were able to capture the observation for no rain and high rainfall rates with csi 0 5 regardless of the forecast lead tme the highest csi value was for the 1 day lead time with a magnitude of 0 76 however major performance reduction was observed with an increase in the forecat lead time from 1 day to 5 days moreover very low performance was observed for rainfall rates between 5 and 10 mm day with csi 0 25 for all lead times the result could be attributed to the frequency of the event being forecast and the convective weather nature 3 5 gauge representativeness error the gauge representativeness error was mainly expressed in terms of variance the variance terms were expressed as ratios to the variance of the total wrf gauge difference var rf rg the results suggest that the variance of the gauge error is responsible for up to 12 36 57 93 of the variance of the wrf gauge differences table 6 as expected the gauge areal representativeness error depends on the gauge location in the wrf pixel in this study the distance between a gauge and a pixel center varies between 0 and 7 07 km gauges located close to the pixel center ko01 have the smallest contribution of gauge error variance to that of wrf gauge difference however this does not necessarily indicate representativeness of the gauge measurement after filtering out the gauge representativeness error the actual variance of the wrf error can be obtained from eq 9 the gauge representativeness error var rg rt ranges from 5 4 to 15 0 suggesting the influence of the rain gauge location on the gauge representativeness error variance the result showed the error variance decreases as the rain gauge is located near to the center of the pixel this is manifested by the large value 46 3 of wrf gauge difference var rf rg at station im01 which is located at the corner of the pixel the variance of the gauge representativeness error is lower than the variance of the wrf gauge difference and the actual wrf error variance var rf rt the need for true areal rainfall is mandatory to reduce the single gauge error effect on wrf rainfall forecast the remaining disagreement is due to the gauge representativeness error which is the variance of the wrf gauge differences most of the gauges which are located near the center of the pixel ko01 led to smaller magnitude of gauge representativeness error than those located far from the center of the pixel ta01 the actual variance of wrf ranges from 28 1 to 96 3 of the disagreement between true rainfall amount and the wrf rainfall forecast the gauge representativeness error contributes about 28 08 83 to the variance of wrf gauge difference we have noted that the variance of gauge representativeness error is much smaller than the actual variance of the wrf error nevertheless the contribution of gauge representativeness error to the forecasted wrf accuracy was too large to be ignored 3 6 bias decomposition the bar chart in fig 12 represents the bias as a percent of total observed rainfall amount the actual and estimated biases of the wrf model rainfall forecast were determined using pixel average and single pixel center gauge rainfall data as reference respectively the actual total bias of wrf rainfall forecast for the 1 day lead time was 5 7 fig 12 the estimated total bias of the forecast increased to 15 5 when evaluated with a single pixel center gauge the difference between the actual and estimated bias is around 9 8 for the 1 day lead time which signals the importance of sufficient spatial rainfall observation to accurately assess the forecast accuracy besides the total bias increased as the lead time increased from 1 day lead time to 5 days lead time in both cases pixel average and single pixel center gauge however the total bias shows overestimation for the first 3 days lead time and underestimation for the 4 and 5 days lead time the underestimation is mainly caused by the high missed rainfall over the observation period the difference in total bias between pixel average and single pixel center gauge could be attributed to the gauge representativeness error since a single pixel center gauge cannot completely represent the entire area of the pixel 100 km2 that is the inadequacy of single gauge to capture the true spatial rainfall amount the contribution of missed bias was larger than hit bias and smaller than false bias regardless of the reference dataset used fig 12 all three component biases were increased with lead time however there was still a difference among the magnitude of bias components depending on the forecast lead time 4 discussion adopting a dense rain gauge network operated by citizen scientists can have a multitude of scientific and societal benefits such as for flood forecasting this study contributes to the emerging understanding on the usability of quality controlled citizen observed rainfall data for the accuracy evaluation of rainfall forecasts the results revealed that multiple cs rain gauges provided an opportunity to fill data gaps and systematically evaluate the rainfall forecast this data useability can further be enhanced by properly establishing the cs program and a strict supervision procedure walker et al 2019 the value of spatial representation of the cs rainfall data was enhanced through quality control qc procedure the cs rainfall data was high quality as verified against the tipping bucket rain gauge tbr and conventional rain gauge data tedla et al 2022 the findings of the rainfall forecast accuracy in terms of scatter plots revealed that all the observations had strong mutual relationship to the rainfall forecast up to 1 3 days lead time the correlation between the rainfall forecast and the reference data outperformed when the reference data was from the cs pixel average observations instead of single gauge nevertheless this relationship deteriorates when the lead time increases to 4 and 5 days lead time the weaker association between the forecast and the observation could be due to systematic error from the observers model physics uncertainty natural climate variability and the orographic nature of the rainfall jeworrek et al 2021 chawla et al 2018 similarly the rmsd cc and the sd values from the taylor diagram indicated similar outcomes to that of the scatter plots where the accuracy of rainfall forecast decreased with lead time and the cs pixel average observations outperformed the other observations the ecdf revealed that the 1 day lead time rainfall forecast captured the rainfall distribution against all the observations within the catchment forecast overestimation was found for 1 3 days lead time while a slight underestimation was noticed for the 4 and 5 days leadtime based on the ecdf plot this could be associated with the uncertainties in the numerical model parameterization the kge value reduced when the forecasts were compared against data from single raingauge observed by citizen scientists and conventional observation than the pixel average rainfall data the kge values indicated that the rainfall forecast accuracy was consistent with previous studies that were conducted in different hydro climatic conditions umer et al 2022 yue et al 2021 in addition the kge values of the current study were shown to decrease with lead time similar to the work of jabbari and bae 2018 the spatial dense rain gauge network within a single pixel 9 rain gauges provided an opportunity to better evaluate the accuracy of the rainfall forecast as compare to a single gauge at the center of the pixel the dense rain gauge data allowed pixel to pixel evaluation of the rainfall forecast accuracy which is not the case in most previous studies teklay et al 2019 chawla et al 2018 the use of multiple cs rain gauges within a pixel means that there is a high probability to detect or reject a given rainfall forecast over the observation period this allows retaining much information about the rainfall data to understand the rainfall forecast regardless of the uncertainty due to the wrf model it is wise to consider that the result is specific to the current study region over the observation period moreover further evaluation of rainfall forecasts with cs rain gauge networks in different hydro climatic regions should be conducted to assess the robustness of the approach as the results could be different the rainfall forecast accuracy evaluation results with categorical indices showed that the model reliably detects rainy days with high accuracy up 3 days lead time however lower performance in terms of capturing ability was observed for medium to high rainfall amount high detection performance was observed for no rain and light rain events 6 mm day rainfall however lower detection performance was found for moderate rainfall events the result of pod far and csi of wrf model rainfall forecasts are more or less similar to the previous studies conducted in other catchments detecting light rain events is much easier than heavy rainfall events according to pod far and csi values teklay et al 2019 the rainfall forecast correctly estimated low rainfall intensity threshold events than medium and high rainfall threshold events however this is mainly dependent on the type of wrf configuration type chawla et al 2018 pennelly et al 2014 and catchment characteristics moreover this could be related to the model physics natural rainfall variability convective systems and possible uncertainties related to the cs observation this problem can be dealt with by the assimilation of cs rainfall observations with the wrf model forecast during the reanalysis stage to fine tune the initial condition of the model physics on the other hand the high detection performance of the model for low and high rainfall forecast could be attributed to the data assimilation scheme used during operational forecasting stage the amount of error resulting from both model forecast and data was examined in additional to instrumental and personal observation errors the spatial misrepresentation of cs rain gauges could induce error tessema et al 2020 our findings showed that error did not solely come from model forecast but also from rain gauge data this finding was made possible with the perusal and treatment of multiple citizen science rain gauge datasets as a network instead of individual gauging stations the gauge representativeness error effect indicated that the variance of the cs gauge error was responsible for up to 28 08 83 of the variance of the wrf gauge differences the actual variance of wrf ranged from 28 1 to 96 3 of the disagreement between true value and the wrf rainfall forecast the wrf gauge difference error contributed about 15 9 46 3 to the variance to that end the contribution of gauge representativeness error to the forecasted wrf accuracy was paramount to our knowledge there are no studies that have applied the error variance separation method for wrf gauge representativeness error variance decomposition this enhances our understanding of how gauge representativeness error affects the wrf rainfall forecast accuracy moreover the wide range of percent bias variations including in the three bias components could be related to the natural variability of rainfall observer s error and error from the numerical model gauge representativeness error and bias decomposition revealed important information about the error source of wrf model rainfall forecast as it was the case for satellite rainfall datasets haile et al 2012 tessema et al 2020 since the rainfall forecast error was found to be high for heavy rainfall events future studies must evaluate how the error propagates to streamflow simulation for flood forecasting the method by worako et al 2022 can be adopted for evaluating error propagation in practice the data assimilation scheme is employed to reduce the error within the wrf model powers et al 2017 data assimilation techniques and a real time updating scheme can further improve the performance of the current rainfall forecast liu et al 2008 powers et al 2017 the wrf model rainfall forecast performance is dependent on the type of cumulus parameterisation schemes a sensitive issue in wrf modeling of rainfall and catchment characteristics chawla et al 2018 the present study employed a single parameterization scheme thus has a limitation in understanding the effect of parameterisation scheme on wrf rainfall forecast accuracy future studies should consider testing other parameterization schemes on a different hydro climatic catchment to reach a comprehensive conclusion on the performance of wrf model rainfall forecast with multiple citizens rainfall observations among the limitations of the current study is its temporal scale which is insufficient for operational flood forecasting and long term flood prediction studies the temporal scale limitation was also noticed in other studies with different hydro climate conditions bárdossy et al 2021 this concern can be resolved by employing rainfall disaggregation from daily to hourly time step with the temporal distribution pattern from tipping bucket rain gauge tbr networks however this may further increase the uncertainty level of the hourly rainfall data if there is a spatial scale issue between the location of tbr and cs stations thus future studies should explore the possibility of cs programs acquiring rainfall data on higher spatial and temporal scale sub daily and hourly this can be achieved by increasing the number of citizen scientists with frequent engagement such as to record rainfall data in sub daily time interval e g hourly data or record the start and end time of the rainfall events the evaluation in this study aimed at rainfall forecasts for lead times that are equal or longer than one day for sub daily lead times citizen scientists for instance can record the start and end time of the rainfall events and this information can be used in combination with sub daily satellite rainfall data for this specific study most of the grid elements of the wrf rainfall forecasts does not have emi rain gauge while a maximum of only single rain gauge was installed by emi office in the wrf rainfall grid elements as a result the true error of wrf rainfall forecasts cannot be known using the emi rain gauge as reference here true error is defined as the difference of the total amount of rainfall forecast and total amount of the actual rainfall single raingauge cannot capture the actual rainfall amount that occurred across 10 km by 10 km grid element of wrf rainfall forecast this is a common problem across the world to overcome such kind of challenges we have installed and monitored nine 9 rain gauges across 10 km by 10 km grid element citizen scientists recorded the rainfall data to reduce the monitoring cost citizen science has twin benefits as it helps volunteers to understand the rainfall characteristics and it helps to fill data gaps we feel that engaging a large number of citizen scientists through a rainfall monitoring program is an essential data gap filling alternative where in situ rainfall monitoring is limited that can be used to understand the true accuracy of wrf rainfall forecasts this is especially manifested in data scarce regions where there are low hydrometeorological services moreover this is the first article that has evaluated wrf rainfall forecast through a vast network of citizen science observations within a single grid and within a sparsely gauged catchment a single gauge regardless of conventional or citizen science based monitoring is not a representative reference to evaluate the accuracy of wrf rainfall forecast within the pixel i e point to pixel evaluation have larger uncertainty as compared pixel to pixel evaluation the conventional and a single cs rain gage ko01 station are located at the center of the pixel however the use of multiple cs rain gauge is needed for the accurate evaluation of wrf rainfall forecasts with in the catchment thus adopting numerous cs rain gauge data for evaluating rainfall forecast has a paramount importance especially in areas where existing conventional stations are sparse 5 conclusions in this study the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecasts was evaluated on a scale of 10 km by 10 km spatial resolution and on a daily temporal resolution up to 5 days lead time the study area was the akaki catchment addis ababa ethiopia nine experimental rain gauge networks within a single pixel were set up for the cs rainfall monitoring the network density is high and unprecedented for wrf model accuracy evaluation in ethiopia the analysis was carried out using single pixel center and pixel average experimental rain gauge network data within the catchment the analysis was conducted on daily time step during the rainy season of june to september 2020 the accuracy was evaluated using categorical indices and continuous metrics moreover the accuracy was assessed in terms of gauge representativeness error and bias decomposition techniques the following concluding remarks are drawn from the results of the present study the use of a cs rainfall monitoring scheme can complement the conventional rainfall monitoring scheme in providing credible spatial and temporal coverage of rainfall data if proper quality control procedure is employed thus future weather forecasting studies should enhance the cs rain gauge density coverage and temporal scale for the benefits of operational forecasting systems the capability of wrf model rainfall forecasts was significantly affected by forecast lead time the accuracy of the rainfall forecast was high for 1 3 days lead time but deteriorated for 4 5 days lead time the wrf model rainfall forecast indicated higher performance when evaluated with cs pixel average rain gauge data as compared to the single pixel center gauge data in the study area this has also been manifested by the comprehensive verification of the wrf model rainfall forecast using continuous evaluation metrics kge cc rmse and ecdf the estimated median kge value for 1 5 days lead time was 0 74 0 66 0 52 0 48 and 0 32 respectively using pixel average rain gauge observations moreover the ecdf result revealed that the 1 day lead time rainfall forecast have the highest performance the pod far and csi values of the rainfall forecast were found to be good for up to 3 days lead time showing strong capability of detecting no rain and light rain events however moderate and heavy rain events were not well captured the study comes to the conclusion that gauge representativeness error cannot be ignored while evaluating the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast since it contributed a variance of 28 08 83 33 to the variance of wrf gauge rainfall difference large scale domain is required to further understand and establish the reasonableness of the evaluated outcomes and the sensitivity of the wrf model rainfall forecast to examine the effect of scale variations and model scheme configuration large scale case studies e g regional should be examined in the future our results suggested that the accuracy of wrf model rainfall forecast cannot be accurately evaluated solely with a single gauge dataset at a scale of the model resolution thus spatial representation of pixel average rainfall data similar to our cs based experimental rain gauge network is mandatory to explicitly understand and evaluate the accuracy of the rainfall forecast future studies should focus on enhancing the spatial and temporal coverage of cs rainfall monitoring to better understand the performance of wrf model rainfall forecast across sites and translate the rainfall forecast to flood forecast declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

furthermore the relationships among ess are complex at different scales su et al 2020a as revealed by previous studies scale not only changed the correlation directions among ess but also changed the significance of correlations among ess bai et al 2020 qiao et al 2018 existing studies have analyzed ess in the same range from pixel scale to county or town scale to the best of our knowledge there

guangdong statistical bureau 2021 according to the national bureau of statistics of china the population of the prd has increased by 22 million in the past 10 years accounting for 62 of the whole

when the correlation of two wress passes the significance test p 0 05 a positive correlation coefficient indicates that there is a trade off relationship otherwise it means a synergistic relationship yang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 we sampled each analysis result with 10 000 random points in gis and analyzed the correlation of point data in spss to eliminate the unit difference we used the z score method to standardize the various sampling values before analysis considering that n and p export are negative indicators the positive and negative signs were adjusted after standardization 3 results 3 1 land use change the two primary land use types in gd were woodland and cultivated land which accounted for 80 of the whole gd in the past 20 years table 2 and fig 3 cultivated land and woodland showed downward trends in gd and the prd during the study period but the construction land continued to increase especially in the prd fig 3 the construction land increased by 4826 86 km2 in gd which primarily came from cultivated land 3573 12 km2 followed by woodland 1628 87 km2 in the prd the area of construction land increased by 4346 01 km2 from 2000 2020 the proportion of grassland in gd and prd decreased firstly and then increased the growth of grasslands may be owing to a growing awareness of the health benefits of public green spaces chen et al 2019 moreover the wetland and bare land constantly decreased during the study period 3 2 wress change 3 2 1 water yield the total water yield exhibited an increasing trend in gd and the water yield of the prd increased by 1724 08 106 m3 which is greater than a third of that of the entire gd table 3 the high value areas of water yield were concentrated in the middle of the prd and the southwest coastal area of gd fig 4 in most regions the water yield showed negligible change and the heightened areas were mainly concentrated in the prd which overlapped with the areas with increased construction land fig 3 and fig 4 and declined areas were scattered 3 2 2 water purification total n export in gd reduced from 115 662 21 t to 108 784 59 t the changing trend of n export in the prd was consistent with that in gd table 3 which means the purification capacity of the n element has been ameliorated the n output in most places was less than 10 kg ha and the high value area of n output was mostly concentrated near the rivers and construction land fig 4 and only very small coastal areas had n export of less than zero most regions in gd had a negligible change in n export changes but there were more regions with increased or decreased n export in the prd fig 4 in the study period total p export in gd first increased and then decreased and the p export in 2020 6533 40 t was less than that in 2000 6550 91 t however the total p export of the prd increased continually and the purification capacity of p in the prd dwindled the spatial distribution of p coincided with that of the n export mostly and the p export increased more in the prd than that in other areas of gd 3 2 3 soil retention total soil retention in gd heightened by 135 084 57 t during the past 20 years contrarily the soil retention in the prd dwindled gradually the soil retention in the northern and eastern gd regions was higher than that in the central and southwestern regions the areas with increased or decreased soil retention in gd were scattered throughout the province with little overall change fig 4 areas with a concentrated reduction in foshan had changed from waterbody to construction land and cultivated land in the past 20 years and the areas with concentrated increases in maoming had changed from cultivated land to woodland mainly fruit trees 3 3 trade offs of wress at different scales there were significant correlations p 0 01 among the wress table 4 in the gd scale trade offs predominantly existed between water yield and other wress and the correlation coefficient between water yield and soil retention was less than that between water yield and water purification there was a positive correlation between soil retention and water purification and a similar correlation existed between the water purifications of n and p except for the correlation between water yield and water purification of p other trade offs and synergies decreased slightly over time on the prd scale the trade off coefficients between water yield and other wres were greater than those of the gd province in contrast to gd province the trade off between water yield and water purification p as well as water yield and soil retention increased with time simultaneously the synergistic degree of soil retention and water purification increased slightly 4 discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial changes of wress the temporal and spatial changes in ess are caused by various factors in this study the increase in water yield over time was chiefly due to land use change the evapotranspiration of construction land is less than that of vegetation covered land zhang et al 2021 then the rapid growth of construction land from 2000 to 2010 may be the main reason why the growth of water yield in the early stage of the study was greater than that in the late stage fig 3 although precipitation and evapotranspiration have been proved to be the most important factors affecting water yield li et al 2017 the 20 year average meteorological data input into the invest model in this study however considering spatial differences more water yield in coastal areas is still due to large precipitation as for water purification the n and p export decreases in gd indicating the enhancement of the water purification capacity the reduction in the total area of cultivated land 44 453 34 km2 led to the reduction of fertilization which contributed to the increase of water purification in the whole province fu et al 2017 additionally it cannot be ignored that human domestic sewage and industrial sewage are the main sources of p export liu et al 2008 with the expansion of construction land and the increase in population density wetlands and woodlands with strong water purification capacity have shrunk significantly in the past 20 years ai et al 2019 which can explain the increase in p emission of the prd during the past two decades soil retention got some gain in gd but appeared some loss in the prd existing studies in the xiangjiang river basin have found similar results for gd liang et al 2021 which indicates that soil conservation has improved gradually through some governance and preventive measures such as the grain for green program and comprehensive management based on a small watershed yan and kasanin grubin 2019 the changing trend of soil retention with time in the prd was consistent with that reported in existing studies yang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019 and the substantial increase in the proportion of construction land in the prd has resulted in shrinkage of vegetation covered areas such as forest land and cultivated land s h wang et al 2020 x wang et al 2020 the spatial change in soil retention is mainly correlated with topographic changes wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020a the mountainous areas in northern gd with large topographic fluctuations are more vulnerable to soil erosion whereas the soil formed on red bed parent material in the mountains of gd has greater soil erosion efficiency wang et al 2021 yan and kasanin grubin 2019 overall even in the same province the change direction of wress at different scales is not the same and the main driving factors may change by downscaling and upscaling 4 2 scale effects on the linkages of wress in this study we explore trade offs and synergies between the three types of wress at different scales and times the four wress were significantly correlated principally on account of water related biophysical processes a trade off existed between soil retention and water yield which was similar to that found in taihu lake basin and yunnan province south of china bai et al 2020 wang et al 2017 but it was contrary to the previous research results on the songhua river basin and the chinese loess plateau north of china su et al 2020b yang et al 2020b which may be due to different recovery rates by forest density in southern and northern china after the grain for green program in 1999 islam et al 2020 su et al 2020a wang et al 2017 a trade off also existed between water yield and water purification at both the prd and gd and in the study of taihu lake basin the same relationship existed at the county scale but the correlations were not significant at the pixel scale bai et al 2020 as a result the analysis granularity in the scale effect may be the main factor affecting the significance of the correlation among ess as time goes by the correlation coefficient among wress in the prd scale gradually increased whereas the trade offs and synergies in gd slightly reduced from 2000 to 2020 the correlation coefficients involved in wress in the prd were larger than those in gd relevant researchers have pointed out that there are more driving factors when the scale increases su et al 2020a other researchers argued that the choice of stakeholders is the main reason for the trade offs between different scales o higgins et al 2018 there is no change in the direction of trade off and synergy involved in wress which is slightly different from the research on ess at other scales bai et al 2020 qiao et al 2018 previous studies regarding scale effects on the relationship among ess often selected different granularities such as pixel scale and county level scale for the same research scope while this study expanded the research scope with the same granularity this study examined the two administrative scales of urban agglomeration and province rather than a single watershed used by other researchers which may help decision makers put forward more targeted management suggestions 4 3 policy implications for wress management practice in the past 20 years although most wress exhibited a benign trend in the entire gd the water purification and soil retention services in the prd had declined owing to the speedy development of urbanization policymakers should consider the leading drivers of ess at different scales balance spatial differences and carry out systematic governance zhu et al 2020 land use planning and cost benefit incentives to stakeholders are feasible ways to integrate ecosystem services into the decision making process daily and matson 2008 o higgins et al 2018 in this study the reduction of cultivated land has made a prominent contribution to the water purification capacity in the province moreover the p emissions in the prd have a strong association with the industrial and living sources of construction land forests have been proven to own strong soil and water conservation and nutrient retention capacity yan and kasanin grubin 2019 liu et al 2008 as a consequence in the future we should strengthen the construction of water conservation forests and continue to systematically implement the grain for green program especially in the regions of mountainous to low land meanwhile we should make intensive use of construction land for the built areas increasing roof greening and strengthening forest belt construction can elevate soil retention and lessen nutrient emissions simultaneously furthermore maintaining coastal wetlands and mangroves in gd is an effective measure to avoid water eutrophication ai et al 2019 islam et al 2020 on the other hand linking the economic development of stakeholders with ecosystem services can also avoid unnecessary trade offs o higgins et al 2018 as industrial and domestic sources in construction land are the main sources of sewage the punishment for exceeding the standard of sewage discharged by sewage enterprises and the encouragement for residents to reduce pollution should be implemented additionally environmental protection and pollution control in the upper reaches can reduce the accumulation of pollutants in the lower reaches gallaher et al 2013 romulo et al 2018 hence the economically developed prd should make appropriate economic compensation for the upper reaches of gd to make up for the sacrifices made by the upper regions to protect water quality and encourage farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizer on cultivated land 4 4 limitations and future directions to make these results more accurate this study used more detailed grid data 30 m 30 m and more accurate data standardization methods than existing studies however given the complexity of ecosystems assessment uncertainty is very common liang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 in this study when setting the n and p export coefficients the coefficient settings in different articles were quite different which had a certain impact on the output results of the invest model in the future more sampling point data and correction results of multiple models should be combined to reduce the inaccuracy of the evaluation results this study analyzed the trade offs among wress but the driving mechanism among the various wress was still unclear furthermore there are multiple factors such as climate factors and socioeconomic factors that have an impact on ess future research should collect more data probe into the impact of different factors on wress at different scales and propose management strategies from multiple fronts 5 conclusion the invest model was been adopted to explore the spatio temporal changes in wress both at gd and the prd scale and the trade offs among wress were explored by correlation analysis the main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 lulc change of the prd is more striking than in guangdong province woodland and cultivated land in gd reduced from 2000 to 2020 and the proportion of construction land increased significantly 2 the wress heightened in the entire gd but the water purification of p and soil retention in the prd declined slightly in this study land use change was the main factor affecting changes in wress and different dominant driving factors affect wress change at different scales 3 correlation analysis showed that relationships among wress were the same at gd and the prd trade offs existed between water yield and other wress and synergies existed between water purification and soil retention 4 the correlation coefficient of gd reduced slightly with time whereas the correlation coefficient of the prd increased slightly and the granularity of the analysis is an important factor affecting the significance of ess we proposed methods to ameliorate wress and reduce trade offs from the aspects of land use planning and stakeholder incentives while our study was applied to gd and the prd the methodology and the conclusions can be applied to other urban agglomerations and provinces funding this work was supported by the national

relationships between water related ecosystem services wress at diverse scales remain unclear this study evaluated spatio temporal changes in water yield water purification and soil retention from 2000 to 2020 the invest model was used to depict the wress and correlation analysis was used to detect trade offs in wress at different scales new hydrological insights for the region i the proportion of construction land increased most from 2000 to 2020 especially in the prd whereas that of cultivated land and forest exhibited downward trends ii during the study period the three wress showed an increase in gd but water purification and soil retention services showed a decrease in the prd iii for the two scales trade offs existed between water yield and other wress and synergies between soil retention and water purification and iv the correlation coefficients among wress in the prd were greater than in the whole gd and the correlation coefficients of the two scales changed in different directions with time this study expands the scale effect on the relationships among ecosystem services and puts forward suggestions for the sustainable development of wress with consideration of land

in the current study are presented in this paper and the underlying data sources have been compiled in the text 1 introduction ecosystem services ess refer to the benefits provided by nature directly or indirectly costanza et al 1997 it has been widely recognized that ess change with scale spatial pattern supply and demand and their correlations change with scales by different ecological and social structures o higgins et al 2018 scholes et al 2013 su et al 2020a zheng et al 2021 for instance small scale es supply zones may be transformed into a self sufficient place when the study area expands costanza 2008 o higgins et al 2018 and the accumulation of pollutants and decrease of biodiversity on a large scale comes from the decline of ess on a small scale scholes et al 2013 furthermore the relationships among ess are complex at different scales su et al 2020a as revealed by previous studies scale not only changed the correlation directions among ess but also changed the significance of correlations among ess bai et al 2020 qiao et al 2018 existing studies have analyzed ess in the same range from pixel scale to county or town scale to the best of our knowledge there are rare studies that have investigated the complex relationships of cross scale ess therefore to facilitate the decision making of managers in dissimilar ranges it is necessary to explore the differences in the relationships between ess at various scales water related ecosystem services wress arise from water ecosystems and their surrounding terrestrial ecosystems which ensure basic human needs and regulate numerous ecological processes chen et al 2018 sahle et al 2018 wress are being weakened by land use change and human activities which will further exert a profound influence on food security energy security and other ecological processes hao et al 2019 romulo et al 2018 the value of wress has gradually become recognized within sustainable development the changes in wress over

showed downward trends in gd and the prd during the study period but the construction land continued to increase especially in the prd fig 3 the construction land increased by 4826 86 km2 in gd which primarily came from cultivated land 3573 12 km2 followed by woodland 1628 87 km2 in the prd the area of construction land increased by 4346 01 km2 from 2000 2020 the proportion of grassland in gd and prd decreased firstly and then increased the growth of grasslands may be owing to a growing awareness of the health benefits of public green spaces chen et al 2019 moreover the wetland and bare land constantly decreased during the study period 3 2 wress change 3 2 1 water yield the total water yield exhibited an increasing trend in gd and the water yield of the prd increased by 1724 08 106 m3 which is greater than a third of that of the entire gd table 3 the high value areas of water yield were concentrated in the middle of the prd and the southwest coastal area of gd fig 4 in most regions the water yield showed negligible change and the heightened areas were mainly concentrated in the prd which overlapped with the areas with increased construction land fig 3 and fig 4 and declined areas were scattered 3 2 2 water purification total n export in gd reduced from 115 662 21 t to 108 784 59 t the changing trend of n export in the prd was consistent with that in gd table 3 which means the purification capacity of the n element has been ameliorated the n output in most places was less than 10 kg ha and the high value area of n output was mostly concentrated near the rivers and construction land fig 4 and only very small coastal areas had n export of less than zero most regions in gd had a negligible change in n export changes but there were more regions with increased or decreased n export in the prd fig 4 in the study period total p export in gd first increased and then decreased and the p export in 2020 6533 40 t was less than that in 2000 6550 91 t however the total p export of the prd increased continually and the purification capacity of p in the prd dwindled the spatial distribution of p coincided with that of the n export mostly and the p export increased more in the prd than that in other areas of gd 3 2 3 soil retention total soil retention in gd heightened by 135 084 57 t during the past 20 years contrarily the soil retention in the prd dwindled gradually the soil retention in the northern and eastern gd regions was higher than that in the central and southwestern regions the areas with increased or decreased soil retention in gd were scattered throughout the province with little overall change fig 4 areas with a concentrated reduction in foshan had changed from waterbody to construction land and cultivated land in the past 20 years and the areas with concentrated increases in maoming had changed from cultivated land to woodland mainly fruit trees 3 3 trade offs of wress at different scales there were significant correlations p 0 01 among the wress table 4 in the gd scale trade offs predominantly existed between water yield and other wress and the correlation coefficient between water yield and soil retention was less than that between water yield and water purification there was a positive correlation between soil retention and water purification and a similar correlation existed between the water purifications of n and p except for the correlation between water yield and water purification of p other trade offs and synergies decreased slightly over time on the prd scale the trade off coefficients between water yield and other wres were greater than those of the gd province in contrast to gd province the trade off between water yield and water purification p as well as water yield and soil retention increased with time simultaneously the synergistic degree of soil retention and water purification increased slightly 4 discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial changes of wress the temporal and spatial changes in ess are caused by various factors in this study the increase in water yield over time was chiefly due to land use change the evapotranspiration of construction land is less than that of vegetation covered land zhang et al 2021 then the rapid growth of construction land from 2000 to 2010 may be the main reason why the growth of water yield in the early stage of the study was greater than that in the late stage fig 3 although precipitation and evapotranspiration have been proved to be the most important factors affecting water yield li et al 2017 the 20 year average meteorological data input into the invest model in this study however considering spatial differences more water yield in coastal areas is still due to large precipitation as for water purification the n and p export decreases in gd indicating the enhancement of the water purification capacity the reduction in the total area of cultivated land 44 453 34 km2 led to the reduction of fertilization which contributed to the increase of water purification in the whole province fu et al 2017 additionally it cannot be ignored that human domestic sewage and industrial sewage are the main sources of p export liu et al 2008 with the expansion of construction land and the increase in population density wetlands and woodlands with strong water purification capacity have shrunk significantly in the past 20 years ai et al 2019 which can explain the increase in p emission of the prd during the past two decades soil retention got some gain in gd but appeared some loss in the prd existing studies in the xiangjiang river basin have found similar results for gd liang et al 2021 which indicates that soil conservation has improved gradually through some governance and preventive measures such as the grain for green program and comprehensive management based on a small watershed yan and kasanin grubin 2019 the changing trend of soil retention with time in the prd was consistent with that reported in existing studies yang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019 and the substantial increase in the proportion of construction land in the prd has resulted in shrinkage of vegetation covered areas such as forest land and cultivated land s h wang et al 2020 x wang et al 2020 the spatial change in soil retention is mainly correlated with topographic changes wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020a the mountainous areas in northern gd with large topographic fluctuations are more vulnerable to soil erosion whereas the soil formed on red bed parent material in the mountains of gd has greater soil erosion efficiency wang et al 2021 yan and kasanin grubin 2019 overall even in the same province the change direction of wress at different scales is not the same and the main driving factors may change by downscaling and upscaling 4 2 scale effects on the linkages of wress in this study we explore trade offs and synergies between the three types of wress at different scales and times the four wress were significantly correlated principally on account of water related biophysical processes a trade off existed between soil retention and water yield which was similar to that found in taihu lake basin and yunnan province south of china bai et al 2020 wang et al 2017 but it was contrary to the previous research results on the songhua river basin and the chinese loess plateau north of china su et al 2020b yang et al 2020b which may be due to different recovery rates by forest density in southern and northern china after the grain for green program in 1999 islam et al 2020 su et al 2020a wang et al 2017 a trade off also existed between water yield and water purification at both the prd and gd and in the study of taihu lake basin the same relationship existed at the county scale but the correlations were not significant at the pixel scale bai et al 2020 as a result the analysis granularity in the scale effect may be the main factor affecting the significance of the correlation among ess as time goes by the correlation coefficient among wress in the prd scale gradually increased whereas the trade offs and synergies in gd slightly reduced from 2000 to 2020 the correlation coefficients involved in wress in the prd were larger than those in gd relevant researchers have pointed out that there are more driving factors when the scale increases su et al 2020a other researchers argued that the choice of stakeholders is the main reason for the trade offs between different scales o higgins et al 2018 there is no change in the direction of trade off and synergy involved in wress which is slightly different from the research on ess at other scales bai et al 2020 qiao et al 2018 previous studies regarding scale effects on the relationship among ess often selected different granularities such as pixel scale and county level scale for the same research scope while this study expanded the research scope with the same granularity this study examined the two administrative scales of urban agglomeration and province rather than a single watershed used by other researchers which may help decision makers put forward more targeted management suggestions 4 3 policy implications for wress management practice in the past 20 years although most wress exhibited a benign trend in the entire gd the water purification and soil retention services in the prd had declined owing to the speedy development of urbanization policymakers should consider the leading drivers of ess at different scales balance spatial differences and carry out systematic governance zhu et al 2020 land use planning and cost benefit incentives to stakeholders are feasible ways to integrate ecosystem services into the decision making process daily and matson 2008 o higgins et al 2018 in this study the reduction of cultivated land has made a prominent contribution to the water purification capacity in the province moreover the p emissions in the prd have a strong association with the industrial and living sources of construction land forests have been proven to own strong soil and water conservation and nutrient retention capacity yan and kasanin grubin 2019 liu et al 2008 as a consequence in the future we should strengthen the construction of water conservation forests and continue to systematically implement the grain for green program especially in the regions of mountainous to low land meanwhile we should make intensive use of construction land for the built areas increasing roof greening and strengthening forest belt construction can elevate soil retention and lessen nutrient emissions simultaneously furthermore maintaining coastal wetlands and mangroves in gd is an effective measure to avoid water eutrophication ai et al 2019 islam et al 2020 on the other hand linking the economic development of stakeholders with ecosystem services can also avoid unnecessary trade offs o higgins et al 2018 as industrial and domestic sources in construction land are the main sources of sewage the punishment for exceeding the standard of sewage discharged by sewage enterprises and the encouragement for residents to reduce pollution should be implemented additionally environmental protection and pollution control in the upper reaches can reduce the accumulation of pollutants in the lower reaches gallaher et al 2013 romulo et al 2018 hence the economically developed prd should make appropriate economic compensation for the upper reaches of gd to make up for the sacrifices made by the upper regions to protect water quality and encourage farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizer on cultivated land 4 4 limitations and future directions to make these results more accurate this study used more detailed grid data 30 m 30 m and more accurate data standardization methods than existing studies however given the complexity of ecosystems assessment uncertainty is very common liang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 in this study when setting the n and p export coefficients the coefficient settings in different articles were quite different which had a certain impact on the output results of the invest model in the future more sampling point data and correction results of multiple models should be combined to reduce the inaccuracy of the evaluation results this study analyzed the trade offs among wress but the driving mechanism among the various wress was still unclear furthermore there are multiple factors such as climate factors and socioeconomic factors that have an impact on ess future research should collect more data probe into the impact of different factors on wress at different scales and propose management strategies from multiple fronts 5 conclusion the invest model was been adopted to explore the spatio temporal changes in wress both at gd and the prd scale and the trade offs among wress were explored by correlation analysis the main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 lulc change of the prd is more striking than in guangdong province woodland and cultivated land in gd reduced from 2000 to 2020 and the proportion of construction land increased significantly 2 the wress heightened in the entire gd but the water purification of p and soil retention in the prd declined slightly in this study land use change was the main factor affecting changes in wress and different dominant driving factors affect wress change at different scales 3 correlation analysis showed that relationships among wress were the same at gd and the prd trade offs existed between water yield and other wress and synergies existed between water purification and soil retention 4 the correlation coefficient of gd reduced slightly with time whereas the correlation coefficient of the prd increased slightly and the granularity of the analysis is an important factor affecting the significance of ess we proposed methods to ameliorate wress and reduce trade offs from the aspects of land use planning and stakeholder incentives while our study was applied to gd and the prd the methodology and the conclusions can be applied to other urban agglomerations and provinces funding this work was supported by the national

7859,study region this study investigates the supraglacial lakes sgls of sermeq avannarleq glacier this glacier is in southwest greenland which has active glacial meltwater study focus supraglacial lakes sgls are an essential part of the hydrological systems of ice sheets and their development is vital for determining the stability of ice sheets this paper use 188 scenes of landsat images during the melting season from 2000 to 2020 with google earth engine to analyze the seasonal changes of the sgls new hydrological insights 1 the area volume and depth of the sgls increased indicating the increasing melt in this area from 2000 to 2020 2 the sgls development peaked at 190 200 days of the year the melting area significantly expanded at the initial stage while the melting depth change was more significant than the area at the later stage 3 the elevation reached by the sgls advanced approximately 300 m inland from 1400 m to 1700 m elevation the convergence of small lakes 0 25 km2 the reappearance of buried lakes and the distribution of sgls zone shift inland occurred during the sgls development 4 high recurrence lake area was mostly below 2 km2 and the recurrence rate of water were related to geographical factors this study can provide technical support and a point of reference for monitoring the surface hydrological systems in greenland ice sheet keywords greenland ice sheet supraglacial lakes google earth engine long term change internal year characteristics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface melting is an essential component of the hydrological systems of ice sheets pope et al 2016 and supraglacial lakes sgls are one of the central representations of surface melting banwell et al 2019 smith et al 2017 the development of sgls affects the stability of ice sheets by forming fractures banwell et al 2013 and inducing basal slip lemos et al 2018 stevens et al 2015 researchers also found that the surface rivers forming on ice sheets could potentially export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects bell et al 2017 by lowering the surface reflectance the sgls will act as a positive feedback on surface melt promoting surface runoff the meltwater injection to the bed and meltwater induced ice shelf fracture all of which may contribute to future reductions in ice sheet mass bell et al 2018 bevis et al 2019 karlsson et al 2021 except the ice sheet the development of meltwater on the ice surface also contribute to the rising of global sea levels cazenave and llovel 2010 khazendar et al 2019 unlike the small and shallow sgls on the antarctic ice sheet the sgls on the greenland ice sheet gris are more extensive nghiem et al 2012 meltwater exists almost all around gris previous studies have emphasized that as the global temperature rises yearly surface melting has annually increased with the global temperature rise yuan et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the duration and elevation of melting have also increased leeson et al 2015 liang et al 2012a the extreme melting event that occurred in july 2012 affected almost the entire greenland region before the advent of remote sensing technique research on hydrology is mainly partial and short term due to the inaccessibility of the study area echelmeyer and harrison 1990 knight and russell 1993 the recent increase in remote sensing satellites in polar regions has enabled long term observations of sgls and hydrological information can be more intuitively and accurately obtained based on medium and long term monitoring results hydrological simulations are used to understand the possible future water system development fichefet et al 2003 leeson et al 2015 optical satellite data are continually applied for sgl observations during the melting season legleiter et al 2014 liang et al 2012b satellites can cover a wide area for a long time but they are highly susceptible to weather conditions candra et al 2019 in addition synthetic aperture radar sar satellites can survey the changes in water storage on the ice sheet in winter benedek and willis 2020 however the boundary between the higher saturation melting snow and the sgls during the melting season is difficult to distinguish in radar images because of their similarity radiometry schröder et al 2020 radars have a certain degree of penetrability and can detect sgls under ice floes dirscherl et al 2021 stevens et al 2015 but they have less data and are difficult to use in the production of datasets nevertheless long term sgls research continues to be concentrated on a small number of image collections or on spatio temporal analysis with a short duration or sparse image collection hochreuther et al 2021 khan et al 2020 yang et al 2021 this situation is primarily due to the complexity of both data acquisition and processing thus this study utilized google earth engine gee for data processing gee is a cloud platform that integrates multi satellite imagery and geospatial data and it is frequently used to detect changes map trends and quantify differences on the surface of the earth for large scale and long duration detection castillo et al 2020 gorelick et al 2017 in terms of polar research gee has recently been applied to surface melting liang et al 2021 tuckett et al 2021 vegetation classification gray et al 2020 iceberg movement koo et al 2021 this study utilized gee to retrieve sgls on available daily data for the sermeq avannarleq glacier the sermeq avannarleq glacier is located on the west side of greenland immediately north of jakobshavn glacier the sermeq avannarleq glacier has been extensively studied by previous scholars and has a large amount of remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 the spatio temporal changes in the sgls during 21 melting seasons and the topographic information were analyzed this study aimed to utilize the gee cloud computing platform to investigate the development of long term sgls and the changes in the area volume depth elevation recurrence rate and other attributes of the sgls 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sermeq avannarleq glacier fig 1 is located in southwest greenland at approximately 69 25 n 49 55 w north of the jakobshavn glacier the sermeq avannarleq glacier has received extensive attention because it is a relatively easy to reach location andrews et al 2018 phillips et al 2011 2013 considering the large quantity of acquirable data and the maximum elevation of supraglacial lakes leeson et al 2015 a study area fig 1 was selected to obtain adequate information about the changes in sgls the overlapping areas in the satellite imagery were taken as a reference landsat path row 8 11 9 11 10 11 to ensure maximum image acquisition the study area is an approximate rectangle of 9370 08 km2 and the highest elevation is approximately 1800 m the study area is not a natural drainage basin and its boundary is limited by the spatial coverage of satellite images these regions were masked to avoid the interference of mountains and oceans when extracting the sgls leaving an area of 8009 19 km2 for more accurate research 2 2 data preprocessing with gee gee which is powered by the google cloud platform allows researchers to perform geospatial processing at a large scale this tool provided collection 1 tier 1 top of atmosphere reflectance t1 toa data from landsat 7 and landsat 8 which were used to extract sgls in sermeq avannarleq glacier from 2000 to 2020 fig 2 a and b landsat toa reflectance adequately represents surface reflectance pope 2016 and has been used for studying ice sheet hydrology banwell et al 2019 williamson et al 2018 we chose may 1 to september 30 day of the year doy 121 274 for non leap years and 122 275 for leap years fitzpatrick et al 2014 sundal et al 2009 yuan et al 2020 as the yearly study period after retrieving these image products the data were processed by cloud masking gap filling band renaming ice sheet range masking and filtering effective pixels images with an effective area percentage percentage of non null area in the study area after masking of greater than 90 were considered possible data and incorporated in the subsequent second visual screening in addition to processing satellite image data some necessary geographic data were also inputted into the gee including the ice surface elevation and bed elevation for greenland based on the verification of multiple digital elevation models dem for ice elevation in previous studies xing et al 2020 arcticdem published by the polar geospatial center of the university of minnesota was the most suitable dem for our study providing ice surface elevation data with a 32 m resolution here a higher resolution was not necessary arthur et al 2020 turton et al 2021 xing et al 2020 the bed elevation was acquired from icebridge bedmachine greenland version 4 with a spatial resolution of 150 m 150 m both data were resampled to the same 30 m resolution as the landsat data 2 3 supraglacial lake area delineation we used the normalized difference water index adapted for ice ndwi ice yang and smith 2013 which is suitable for extracting meltwater in glaciological environments to identify the sgls during the melting season on the gris ndwi ice is defined as follows 1 ndwi ice blue red blue red the blue and red bands in eq 1 correspond to the reflectance in the blue and red bands respectively this version of ndwi ice has been widely used in the extraction of sgls in antarctica greenland and the qinghai tibet plateau fitzpatrick et al 2014 studies have found that ndwi ice produced fewer false sgls classifications in blue ice and slush areas arthur et al 2020 and it is suitable for distinguishing sgls on the gris during the melting season we chose a threshold of 0 25 ndwi ice 0 25 based on previous studies and the extracted area was considered to be water bell et al 2017 doyle et al 2013 however the ndwi ice cannot fully discern lakes from shaded terrain and cloud shadowed areas moussavi et al 2020 which can have a significant effect on the classification of sgls accordingly we manually checked the images for shadow and deleted data with obvious shadow effects we eliminated sgls smaller than 5 pixels 30 m resolution and linear features narrower than 2 pixels which have relatively large uncertainties to further improve the extraction accuracy for sgls arthur et al 2020 williamson et al 2018 2 4 depth and volume estimation depth is an essential factor for sgls and it affects the flexure and fracture of the ice the mainstream methods for estimating the depth of sgls are a physically based single band method and an empirical band ratio method pope 2016 we chose the former one due to the absence of field verified empirical data a model based on the optical properties of water bouguet lambert bee law philpot 1989 was used to simulate the attenuation of incoming radiance as it passed through water the model s expression is as follows 2 l z λ l 0 λ exp k λ z where l z λ is the water exiting spectral radiance for depth z l 0 λ is the spectral radiance at zero depth k λ z defines the spectral attenuation and z represents the water depth all variables in this formula are related to the wavelength except for z after transforming the formula the water depth can be obtained using eq 3 3 z in a d r in r w r g where a d is the bottom albedo r is the reflectance from optically deep water r w is the reflectance of a lake pixel and g is related to the specific spectral attenuation usually expressed as a constant in gee each variable uses a specific calculation the lake bed reflectance a d is typically determined by the reflectance outside the identified lake areas in this study a d was obtained by selecting 1 pixel outside of each identified lake in each scene and averaging their values moussavi et al 2020 r is the reflectivity of seawater with a depth greater than 40 m moussavi et al 2016 sneed and hamilton 2007 and it usually represented by the reflectivity of the front edge of the ice shelf pope 2016 however this experiment set r as zero due to the uncertainty in the optical images affected by the study area clouds sea ice etc and the complexity of the extensive data operations arthur et al 2020 banwell et al 2019 macdonald et al 2018 the values of g were set according to the research of pope et al 2016 on multiple sensor bands pope et al 2016 when setting the values of g red g 0 7507 and panchromatic g 0 3817 bands were used for landsat 8 and the red g 0 8049 band was used for landsat 7 the lake volume was calculated by multiplying the pixel area and depth 2 5 information retrieving with gee each individual lake object in the images must be extracted to obtain the differences in the geographic information between each scene and the development of the sgls in gee accordingly the raster images of the sgls extracted from the landsat images were vectorized and then each discontinuous vector unit eight neighbor discontinuous was broken up to acquire multiple single lake objects fig 2 c the area depth volume and elevation for each lake were read and seven attributes area minimum depth maximum depth average depth depth standard deviation sd volume and elevation were obtained for each lake calculations on area volume and lake number are intended to analyze the changes in water storage depth parameters are intended to discuss the processes that lake develop downwards and wide the elevation category is used to analyze the aggregation and movement of the distribution in the development of the sgls this study regards the average elevation as the elevation of each lake because the range of elevation changes within a single lake was minimal the sgls elevation distribution and the largest and deepest lakes in the year were also screened from the data to explore more characteristics of sgls after integrating these data 54 attributes table 1 from all sgls in each scene were combined for the spatiotemporal analysis of sgls from 2000 to 2020 fig 2 d 3 results 3 1 data availability 3 1 1 effective images a total of 220 available images were obtained for the study area from 2000 to 2020 through preliminary screening in gee landsat 7 and landsat 8 had 107 and 113 images respectively thirty two images were poorly extracted in sgls information after visual screening owing to the influence of cloud and terrain shadows finally 188 images were used to extract information on sgls comprising 19 images without water and 169 images with water fig 3 the landsat 7 images covered the years 2000 2013 and landsat 8 was primarily responsible for the data after 2013 the data from 2000 to 2005 were concentrated in the early period of the melting season with 48 00 of the available images in may and june and another 32 00 in september meanwhile the data from 2006 to 2013 mainly cover the middle part of the melting season june july and august and contained 84 38 images since 2013 the data density has escalated due to the availability of landsat 8 but the amount of data was still small in september the percentage of available images for may to september after 2013 is 18 75 13 75 32 50 26 25 and 8 75 respectively 3 1 2 total error assessment the main uncertainties in this study arose from the following aspects the simulation error in filling the landsat 7 gaps the accuracy of the cloud and shadow filters the effects of the shadows of surface features and the accuracy of ndwi ice method in response to these deviations we adopted a series of countermeasures we used the built in treatment method in gee for the first two deviations to make corrections more details are provided in section 2 2 furthermore we limit the scope of the study area by masking fig 1 to avoid bare rock and its shadows manual screening was also conducted to reduce the misjudgment of water bodies caused by terrain shadows to verify the accuracy of the ndwi ice extraction of the sgls we compared the results of high resolution images worldview 3 for supervised classification with the results of the ndwi ice global threshold based on landsat 8 the results show that the sgls areas extracted by the two methods differed by 9 02 with the small bodies of water being the main reason for this divergence accounting for 71 80 this discrepancy can be eliminated by the post processing of lakes extracted by ndwi ice based on these results we examined the ndwi ice calculation results and manually identified data for our study area of approximately 76 677 12 km2 in 1300 groups during a 21 year period the kappa coefficient mean intersection over union and f1 score of the sgls extracted with a ndwi ice greater than 0 25 were 0 85 0 79 and 0 87 respectively therefore the processed ndwi ice results can accurately represent the range of sgls 3 2 changes in the water storage of sgls 3 2 1 area volume and depth the yearly area volume and depth of the sgls typically increased and then decreased but the changes have different characteristics in one melting period fig 4 in terms of the area and volume sgls began to develop around doy 120 160 and reached a peak at doy 190 200 sgls were rarely detected on optical images around doy 240 270 the change in depth was relatively slow compared with the apparent extremes for volume and area the average depth of the sgls reached its peak at doy 190 230 and the maximum depth change reached a maximum value at approximately doy 180 which was about 10 days earlier than that of the average depth the maximum area of sgls in the study area was approximately 40 70 km2 and the maximum volume was approximately 60 100 10 3 km3 from 2000 to 2020 in addition the area and volume changes in the individual scenes also had unique differences for example on july 13 2015 doy 194 the area and volume reaching 90 90 km2 and 168 02 10 3 km3 respectively were significantly larger than the other dates in the study period on july 6 2015 the area of the sgls reached 75 82 km2 in terms of lake depth the average was 1 19 m the sd was 0 71 m and the average depth range was 0 06 3 02 m the maximum depth value widely fluctuated from 2 5 m to 5 m for the overall monthly change the maximum average depth and the maximum depth occurred in july which were 1 49 and 3 56 m respectively the maximum melting depth significantly fluctuated early in the melting season and the maximum lake depth was larger than 2 m on some dates in may we calculated a moving average of the results during 2000 2010 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 to explore the changing trends in the area volume and depth of the sgls fig 4 the 2010 2020 average blue line mainly appears above the 2000 2010 average red line indicating that the area volume and depth of the sgls increased on the same days of each year the monthly average changes during the three periods are shown in table 2 melting is most intense in july and august in july and august of the first two periods the area expanded by 20 70 and 13 63 km2 and the volume expanded by 33 50 10 3 and 21 00 10 3 km3 respectively the difference between 2005 and 2015 and 2010 2020 was smaller than that for the previous span the area only expanded by 3 07 km2 in july and it even decreased in other months however the monthly average volume still expanded in may june july august and september with a maximum value of 12 02 10 3 km3 in july depth drastically changes in july and august and the average mean depths in those two months increased from 0 10 m to 0 21 m in three periods the maximum depth drastically changes in july from 0 26 m to 0 62 m the depth changes were highly profound from 2000 to 2020 3 2 2 number of lakes the sgls were divided into large lakes 0 25 km2 and small lakes 0 25 km2 based on area studies have shown that small lakes area in western greenland account for less than 15 of the overall sgls area yang et al 2021 fig 5 a shows the total number of lakes and the changes in the number of large and small lakes from 2000 to 2020 excluding the vast number of lakes present by doy 180 in 2015 the number of sgls was approximately 300 500 per year of which 300 400 were small and 60 100 were large in 2015 980 lakes were detected of which 100 were large lakes the number of large and small lakes had noticeable differences in peak times the small lakes peaked at approximately doy 180 meanwhile the large lakes peaked at approximately doy 200 after the melting season began the large lakes appeared at doy 140 160 peaked at doy 180 210 and disappeared at doy 250 260 the average number of large lakes was 60 80 in years with sufficient data the large sgls showed no obvious trends from 2000 to 2020 fig 5 b the number of large lakes changed significantly when the available data were relatively abundant in july 2008 june 2010 july 2014 june 2016 and july 2019 which may be due to the significant water storage and drainage phenomenon during these periods 3 2 3 largest and deepest lakes this study also examined extreme lakes which were the single lakes with the largest area and largest depth within each scene table 3 the average area of the largest lake was 2 77 km2 and the average depth of the deepest lake was 4 00 m from 2000 to 2020 the largest lake was 4 74 km2 on july 14 2012 and the deepest lake was 5 83 m on august 13 2012 in terms of the average value for the appear date of largest lake and deepest lake the largest lakes appeared about 10 days earlier than the deepest lakes although the lakes mean depths were close the differences in area volume and maximum depth were significant the largest yearly area and depth appear on the same image in more than 70 of cases at approximately doy 200 in all years except for 2009 2012 and 2016 the deepest lakes appeared before the largest lakes among the three years where the lake with the largest area appeared first the largest lake appeared 10 days earlier than the deepest lake in 2009 and 2016 in 2012 the largest lake appeared at doy 196 which was 30 days earlier than the deepest lake at doy 226 in 2000 2004 and 2010 the deepest lake appeared at approximately doy 175 while the largest lake appeared at approximately doy 220 which was more than 40 days later in terms of elevation the largest lakes were aggregated in two zones at 900 1000 and 1300 1400 m which contained the largest lakes for 8 and 6 years respectively the deepest lakes were aggregated at 900 1000 m for 8 years of the study period the elevation of the largest lake was higher than that of the deepest lake at averages of 1164 85 and 967 11 m table 3 3 3 lake altitude and spatial patterns 3 3 1 annual increase in elevation all sgls in the study area developed below 1800 m in surface elevation and the average yearly altitude was between 700 m and 1200 m in terms of elevation changes fig 6 a the maximum elevation showed a clear upward trend increasing by approximately 300 m and the average elevation moved upward by approximately 200 m these increases are consistent with those observed by other studies leeson et al 2015 by contrast the minimum elevation slightly decreased and was approximately 200 m during all years from 2000 to 2020 in addition to the rise in the yearly maximum and average lake elevations the elevation for each day also moved upward the monthly mean elevation during 2000 2010 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 increased between each period the elevation escalated about 50 m between 2000 and 2010 and 2005 2015 except for a decrease of 63 94 m in june however the changes between 2005 and 2015 and 2010 2020 were relatively small the elevation raised by 10 20 m at the beginning and end of the season and only by approximately 1 m in june and july in august the elevation decreased by 17 09 m between 2010 and 2020 moreover sgls usually develop at the lowest elevation in early may however on may 9 2014 doy 129 and may 7 2019 doy 127 the maximum lake elevations both exceed 1000 m at 1009 19 and 1436 70 m respectively 3 3 2 elevation rise during the year the elevation distribution differed throughout a single melting season during sgls development the lake shifts inland in a band specifically the highest and lowest elevations of lakes move upward during the development the average daily elevations and sd of elevation from 2000 to 2020 are shown in fig 6 b during the initial melting period approximately doy 121 190 the average elevation slowly augmented approximately at a rate of 13 46 m d at the end of the melting period approximately doy 235 374 the average elevation relatively rapidly decreased approximately at a rate of 29 76 m d which was more than twice that during the ascent the sd indicates the degree of dispersion in lake elevation on that date the sd of all images obtained from 2000 to 2020 was within 400 m and the average sd for the entire study period was 190 87 m the sgls were relatively scattered in the early and late stages of the season however the distribution was more concentrated in the middle of melting the sd for doy 170 220 from 2000 to 2020 were between 150 and 250 m therefore the elevation range of the lakes was narrowest during periods of intense melting the elevations of large and small lakes were also investigated the average elevations of large and small lakes were 1094 25 and 962 38 m and the sds were 158 56 and 224 54 m respectively more than 90 of these lakes were between 600 m and 1600 m nevertheless the small lakes were widely distributed over the range where sgls appeared 22 79 occur at 800 1000 m and 26 74 at 1200 1400 m the large lakes were more concentrated in elevation with 84 16 occurring at 800 1400 m only 4 65 of the large lakes occur in areas below 800 m table 3 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 inter annual changes of sgls the area volume and depth of the sgls in the study area expanded from 2000 to 2020 figs 4 and 5 table 2 the seasonal increases in area volume and depth were not only reflected in the maximum values but also for values of each doy during the melting season the most drastic changes manifested in july and august during the middle of the melting period table 2 when analyzing the data by 10 year periods 2000 2010 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 the average area and volume drastically changed between the 2000 2010 and the 2005 2015 periods however the average depth slightly changed between the 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 periods the average area slightly changed and the average depth and volume changes were sharper the data during these two periods indicate that the growth rate of the sgls area has slowed in recent years but the melting depth continued to grow table 2 the formation of sgls significantly extended inland fig 6 a which is consistent with previous studies in various areas of greenland leeson et al 2015 turton et al 2021 the maximum elevation of sgls in the study area extended 300 m inland over the study period reaching approximately 1700 m and the maximum elevation increase rate was approximately 12 48 m yr this finding is similar to the data of sgl maximum elevation movement in previous study gledhill and williamson 2018 the maximum achievable elevation raised rapidly during 2000 2015 but it slowed down during 2015 2020 which may have been due to climatic conditions related to the north atlantic oscillation leeson et al 2015 4 2 development characteristics of sgls during the development of sgls the area and volume changes followed a normal distribution meanwhile the depth changes followed a binomial distribution during 2000 2020 the time of the peak average area and depth were consistent and concentrated at doy 190 200 however after the area began to decline the average depth remained at maximum for approximately 30 days fig 4 we speculate that the small lakes converged into a large lake at approximately doy 180 200 fig 5 a this speculation is due to the significant changes in the number of large and small lakes but small changes in the total lake area additionally the average yearly depth and maximum depth trends were not consistent fig 4 the maximum depth appeared doy 180 before the maximum average depth doy 190 200 each year fig 4 c d this finding shows that a lake still expands in submerged width when it is at its deepest accessible depth the maximum yearly depth occurred at an elevation of approximately 1000 m at which many deep lakes and large lakes formed table 3 during development the elevation of the sgls rose in a band shape specifically other sgls at low altitudes drained while some were formed at high altitudes fig 6 b this finding is consistent with time series analyses in other regions of greenland fitzpatrick et al 2014 sundal et al 2009 the standard deviation of the elevation indicates the concentration of the elevation distribution this study found that sgls in the study area were mainly concentrated within an elevation of 200 m therefore the sgls zone were concentrated during sgls development additionally the rise in the average elevation was much greater than 200 m which also reflects the banded characteristics of the lake development in the early stages of sgls formation the elevation quickly increased with a peak at approximately doy 210 however the elevation of the sgls decreased at approximately twice that rate the retreat of the lakes was more intense from the elevation perspective 4 3 factors of recurrence frequency influence the recurrence frequency of the sgls was calculated by merging their location information within the same year and superimposing the location information for the sgls that appeared during the melting season in each year fig 7 a the recurrence rate of sgls in the study area over the study period was relatively high a water area of 170 54 km2 which was 36 21 of the total lake area was present for 5 years or more small sgls meltwater channels and the outer areas of large lakes showed low recurrence the frequency of the obtainable meltwater channels from 2000 to 2020 was usually less than twice large lakes had a higher recurrence rate than small lakes liang et al 2012a but the lake area was not directly proportional to the recurrence rate the area of lake with a high recurrence rate is below 2 km2 mainly concentrated in 0 5 1 5 km2 fig 7 b the recurrence rate for lakes which was larger than 4 0 km2 was about 40 to explore the relationship between the high recurrence rate and geographical factors we analyzed the elevations slopes and aspects of the surface and bed in the study area for waters with a recurrence rate of more than 60 the number of recurrences between 2000 and 2020 was 13 fig 7 c additionally 0 22 km2 of the water area had a 100 recurrence rate from 2000 to 2020 of which 74 90 was from the same lake inset in fig 7 a given that the sgls with a recurrence rate of 100 21 times mainly occurs in one lake its particularity will make the statistical results inaccurate hence we did not consider the case where the recurrence rate was 21 the areas with a high recurrence rate were concentrated at a surface elevation of 900 1400 m of which 900 1000 m was highly concentrated containing 29 72 of the area with high recurrence the elevation ranges with high recurrence rate also meet the zone of deep lakes and large lakes formed the bed elevations of lakes with high recurrence rates were primarily at an elevation of 0 400 m moreover the bed elevations of the sgls with a recurrence rate higher than 60 were all approximately at 110 m in terms of the slope and aspect of the surface and bed 84 91 of the surface slope in the areas with high recurrence rates was less than 2 5 and the bed slope was primarily 0 10 the surface and bed slopes of the lakes with high recurrence rates were small because they formed in depressions which also caused the recurrence rate of the central areas of the sgls to be higher than that of the periphery no obvious pattern was observed in the surface aspect of this area and the bed aspect was primarily from the south to the northwest which may be related to the direction of the ice flow in the study area banwell et al 2014 the recurrence rate was correlated with the geographical factors of the study area which is consistent with the distribution of antarctic sgls stokes et al 2019 4 4 hydrological events extreme weather conditions occurred in many years causing deviations from the general trend between 2000 and 2020 sgls generally reached their maximum depth first followed by the maximum area however the maximum area in 2012 was reached 30 days earlier than the maximum depth which may be due to abnormally high temperatures colosio et al 2021 enabling the extraction of the largest single lake area 4 74 km2 in the 21 year span in 2015 the sgls reached the largest area 90 90 km2 and volume 168 02 10 3 km3 for the entire study period on doy 180 in 2015 the largest number of sgls in the study period appeared these data are much larger than those in any other years this abnormal melting was due to exceptional atmospheric conditions which were possibly caused by arctic amplification tedesco et al 2016 the changes in the number of large lakes demonstrated that the drainage and storage of water also drastically changed during the year fig 5 b in addition to water from melting ice rain and snow also rapidly increased water storage additionally not all the sgls that disappeared in the experiment discharged through runoff or infiltration during winter portions of lakes were covered by snow and ice lampkin et al 2020 which melted during the next melting season this phenomenon is the reason for the extremely high lake elevation above 1000 m at the beginning of melting detected in 2014 and 2019 5 conclusions sgls reflect the melting conditions of the ice sheets which is related to the stability of the ice sheet and ice shelf this study analyzed the sgls at sermeq avannarleq in greenland with gee from 2000 to 2020 the development of sgls over 21 years was analyzed through the sgls distributions and 54 related attributes obtained by gee the results show that the melting in the study area intensified over the study period and drastic melting mainly occurred in july and august the expansion in melting is manifested in the increasing area for the early stage meanwhile the depth of sgls has more significantly increased in recent year the elevation of the sgls in the study area also significantly developed inland and climbed 300 m in the last 21 years this phenomenon has slowed in the past 5 years which may be due to the north atlantic oscillation moreover many abnormal weather events occurred during 2000 2020 which may have caused phenomena such as an escalation in the area of the sgls an increase in the melting time and earlier melting the development of sgls throughout a single year showed specific overall patterns the peak area and average depth occurred at approximately doy 190 200 during this period the small lakes converged into a larger lake with small changes in area and average depth the annual maximum depth occurred at approximately doy 180 prior to the average depth peak specifically the sgl still expands in submerged width when it is at its deepest accessible depth the distribution of sgls zone shifts inland over a year and the lakes were concentrated within the melting zone the elevation slowly raised during melting but decreased nearly twice as fast during freezing the sgls generally developed from low to high elevation over the year however because some buried lakes reopened in the early stages of melting lakes with higher elevations were also obtained in the early stages of melting the area of sgls with a high recurrence rate was below 2 km2 and over 2 km2 lakes showed lower recurrence rates the geographical characteristics of the lakes with high recurrence rates are notable large and deep sgls and those with high recurrence rates primarily occurred at a surface elevation of approximately 1000 m additionally sgls with high recurrence rates primarily occurred in areas with small slopes for the surface and bed because the lakes mainly converged on depressions with relatively flat surfaces moreover a correlation was observed between the recurrence rate and the bed slope which may be related to the flow direction of the ice the main problem faced by this study was insufficient data which directly caused statistical errors in the time series analysis however this type of loss is difficult to avoid in the long term daily observation of sgls based on the methods used in this study future research could consider utilizing multi source remote sensing data to observe the year round evolution of sgls over a large area the results of this study aid in understanding the evolution of sgls in greenland ice sheet furthermore the information acquisition method using gee can be applied for long term and large scale extraction of multi source ice surface hydrological information in the future credit authorship contribution

7859,study region this study investigates the supraglacial lakes sgls of sermeq avannarleq glacier this glacier is in southwest greenland which has active glacial meltwater study focus supraglacial lakes sgls are an essential part of the hydrological systems of ice sheets and their development is vital for determining the stability of ice sheets this paper use 188 scenes of landsat images during the melting season from 2000 to 2020 with google earth engine to analyze the seasonal changes of the sgls new hydrological insights 1 the area volume and depth of the sgls increased indicating the increasing melt in this area from 2000 to 2020 2 the sgls development peaked at 190 200 days of the year the melting area significantly expanded at the initial stage while the melting depth change was more significant than the area at the later stage 3 the elevation reached by the sgls advanced approximately 300 m inland from 1400 m to 1700 m elevation the convergence of small lakes 0 25 km2 the reappearance of buried lakes and the distribution of sgls zone shift inland occurred during the sgls development 4 high recurrence lake area was mostly below 2 km2 and the recurrence rate of water were related to geographical factors this study can provide technical support and a point of reference for monitoring the surface hydrological systems in greenland ice sheet keywords greenland ice sheet supraglacial lakes google earth engine long term change internal year characteristics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface melting is an essential component of the hydrological systems of ice sheets pope et al 2016 and supraglacial lakes sgls are one of the central representations of surface melting banwell et al 2019 smith et al 2017 the development of sgls affects the stability of ice sheets by forming fractures banwell et al 2013 and inducing basal slip lemos et al 2018 stevens et al 2015 researchers also found that the surface rivers forming on ice sheets could potentially export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects bell et al 2017 by lowering the surface reflectance the sgls will act as a positive feedback on surface melt promoting surface runoff the meltwater injection to the bed and meltwater induced ice shelf fracture all of which may contribute to future reductions in ice sheet mass bell et al 2018 bevis et al 2019 karlsson et al 2021 except the ice sheet the development of meltwater on the ice surface also contribute to the rising of global sea levels cazenave and llovel 2010 khazendar et al 2019 unlike the small and shallow sgls on the antarctic ice sheet the sgls on the greenland ice sheet gris are more extensive nghiem et al 2012 meltwater exists almost all around gris previous studies have emphasized that as the global temperature rises yearly surface melting has annually increased with the global temperature rise yuan et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the duration and elevation of melting have also increased leeson et al 2015 liang et al 2012a the extreme melting event that occurred in july 2012 affected almost the entire greenland region before the advent of remote sensing technique research on hydrology is mainly partial and short term due to the inaccessibility of the study area echelmeyer and harrison 1990 knight and russell 1993 the recent increase in remote sensing satellites in polar regions has enabled long term observations of sgls and hydrological information can be more intuitively and accurately obtained based on medium and long term monitoring results hydrological simulations are used to understand the possible future water system development fichefet et al 2003 leeson et al 2015 optical satellite data are continually applied for sgl observations during the melting season legleiter et al 2014 liang et al 2012b satellites can cover a wide area for a long time but they are highly susceptible to weather conditions candra et al 2019 in addition synthetic aperture radar sar satellites can survey the changes in water storage on the ice sheet in winter benedek and willis 2020 however the boundary between the higher saturation melting snow and the sgls during the melting season is difficult to distinguish in radar images because of their similarity radiometry schröder et al 2020 radars have a certain degree of penetrability and can detect sgls under ice floes dirscherl et al 2021 stevens et al 2015 but they have less data and are difficult to use in the production of datasets nevertheless long term sgls research continues to be concentrated on a small number of image collections or on spatio temporal analysis with a short duration or sparse image collection hochreuther et al 2021 khan et al 2020 yang et al 2021 this situation is primarily due to the complexity of both data acquisition and processing thus this study utilized google earth engine gee for data processing gee is a cloud platform that integrates multi satellite imagery and geospatial data and it is frequently used to detect changes map trends and quantify differences on the surface of the earth for large scale and long duration detection castillo et al 2020 gorelick et al 2017 in terms of polar research gee has recently been applied to surface melting liang et al 2021 tuckett et al 2021 vegetation classification gray et al 2020 iceberg movement koo et al 2021 this study utilized gee to retrieve sgls on available daily data for the sermeq avannarleq glacier the sermeq avannarleq glacier is located on the west side of greenland immediately north of jakobshavn glacier the sermeq avannarleq glacier has been extensively studied by previous scholars and has a large amount of remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 the spatio temporal changes in the sgls during 21 melting seasons and the topographic information were analyzed this study aimed to utilize the gee cloud computing platform to investigate the development of long term sgls and the changes in the area volume depth elevation recurrence rate and other attributes of the sgls 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sermeq avannarleq glacier fig 1 is located in southwest greenland at approximately 69 25 n 49 55 w north of the jakobshavn glacier the sermeq avannarleq glacier has received extensive attention because it is a relatively easy to reach location andrews et al 2018 phillips et al 2011 2013 considering the large quantity of acquirable data and the maximum elevation of supraglacial lakes leeson et al 2015 a study area fig 1 was selected to obtain adequate information about the changes in sgls the overlapping areas in the satellite imagery were taken as a reference landsat path row 8 11 9 11 10 11 to ensure maximum image acquisition the study area is an approximate rectangle of 9370 08 km2 and the highest elevation is approximately 1800 m the study area is not a natural drainage basin and its boundary is limited by the spatial coverage of satellite images these regions were masked to avoid the interference of mountains and oceans when extracting the sgls leaving an area of 8009 19 km2 for more accurate research 2 2 data preprocessing with gee gee which is powered by the google cloud platform allows researchers to perform geospatial processing at a large scale this tool provided collection 1 tier 1 top of atmosphere reflectance t1 toa data from landsat 7 and landsat 8 which were used to extract sgls in sermeq avannarleq glacier from 2000 to 2020 fig 2 a and b landsat toa reflectance adequately represents surface reflectance pope 2016 and has been used for studying ice sheet hydrology banwell et al 2019 williamson et al 2018 we chose may 1 to september 30 day of the year doy 121 274 for non leap years and 122 275 for leap years fitzpatrick et al 2014 sundal et al 2009 yuan et al 2020 as the yearly study period after retrieving these image products the data were processed by cloud masking gap filling band renaming ice sheet range masking and filtering effective pixels images with an effective area percentage percentage of non null area in the study area after masking of greater than 90 were considered possible data and incorporated in the subsequent second visual screening in addition to processing satellite image data some necessary geographic data were also inputted into the gee including the ice surface elevation and bed elevation for greenland based on the verification of multiple digital elevation models dem for ice elevation in previous studies xing et al 2020 arcticdem published by the polar geospatial center of the university of minnesota was the most suitable dem for our study providing ice surface elevation data with a 32 m resolution here a higher resolution was not necessary arthur et al 2020 turton et al 2021 xing et al 2020 the bed elevation was acquired from icebridge bedmachine greenland version 4 with a spatial resolution of 150 m 150 m both data were resampled to the same 30 m resolution as the landsat data 2 3 supraglacial lake area delineation we used the normalized difference water index adapted for ice ndwi ice yang and smith 2013 which is suitable for extracting meltwater in glaciological environments to identify the sgls during the melting season on the gris ndwi ice is defined as follows 1 ndwi ice blue red blue red the blue and red bands in eq 1 correspond to the reflectance in the blue and red bands respectively this version of ndwi ice has been widely used in the extraction of sgls in antarctica greenland and the qinghai tibet plateau fitzpatrick et al 2014 studies have found that ndwi ice produced fewer false sgls classifications in blue ice and slush areas arthur et al 2020 and it is suitable for distinguishing sgls on the gris during the melting season we chose a threshold of 0 25 ndwi ice 0 25 based on previous studies and the extracted area was considered to be water bell et al 2017 doyle et al 2013 however the ndwi ice cannot fully discern lakes from shaded terrain and cloud shadowed areas moussavi et al 2020 which can have a significant effect on the classification of sgls accordingly we manually checked the images for shadow and deleted data with obvious shadow effects we eliminated sgls smaller than 5 pixels 30 m resolution and linear features narrower than 2 pixels which have relatively large uncertainties to further improve the extraction accuracy for sgls arthur et al 2020 williamson et al 2018 2 4 depth and volume estimation depth is an essential factor for sgls and it affects the flexure and fracture of the ice the mainstream methods for estimating the depth of sgls are a physically based single band method and an empirical band ratio method pope 2016 we chose the former one due to the absence of field verified empirical data a model based on the optical properties of water bouguet lambert bee law philpot 1989 was used to simulate the attenuation of incoming radiance as it passed through water the model s expression is as follows 2 l z λ l 0 λ exp k λ z where l z λ is the water exiting spectral radiance for depth z l 0 λ is the spectral radiance at zero depth k λ z defines the spectral attenuation and z represents the water depth all variables in this formula are related to the wavelength except for z after transforming the formula the water depth can be obtained using eq 3 3 z in a d r in r w r g where a d is the bottom albedo r is the reflectance from optically deep water r w is the reflectance of a lake pixel and g is related to the specific spectral attenuation usually expressed as a constant in gee each variable uses a specific calculation the lake bed reflectance a d is typically determined by the reflectance outside the identified lake areas in this study a d was obtained by selecting 1 pixel outside of each identified lake in each scene and averaging their values moussavi et al 2020 r is the reflectivity of seawater with a depth greater than 40 m moussavi et al 2016 sneed and hamilton 2007 and it usually represented by the reflectivity of the front edge of the ice shelf pope 2016 however this experiment set r as zero due to the uncertainty in the optical images affected by the study area clouds sea ice etc and the complexity of the extensive data operations arthur et al 2020 banwell et al 2019 macdonald et al 2018 the values of g were set according to the research of pope et al 2016 on multiple sensor bands pope et al 2016 when setting the values of g red g 0 7507 and panchromatic g 0 3817 bands were used for landsat 8 and the red g 0 8049 band was used for landsat 7 the lake volume was calculated by multiplying the pixel area and depth 2 5 information retrieving with gee each individual lake object in the images must be extracted to obtain the differences in the geographic information between each scene and the development of the sgls in gee accordingly the raster images of the sgls extracted from the landsat images were vectorized and then each discontinuous vector unit eight neighbor discontinuous was broken up to acquire multiple single lake objects fig 2 c the area depth volume and elevation for each lake were read and seven attributes area minimum depth maximum depth average depth depth standard deviation sd volume and elevation were obtained for each lake calculations on area volume and lake number are intended to analyze the changes in water storage depth parameters are intended to discuss the processes that lake develop downwards and wide the elevation category is used to analyze the aggregation and movement of the distribution in the development of the sgls this study regards the average elevation as the elevation of each lake because the range of elevation changes within a single lake was minimal the sgls elevation distribution and the largest and deepest lakes in the year were also screened from the data to explore more characteristics of sgls after integrating these data 54 attributes table 1 from all sgls in each scene were combined for the spatiotemporal analysis of sgls from 2000 to 2020 fig 2 d 3 results 3 1 data availability 3 1 1 effective images a total of 220 available images were obtained for the study area from 2000 to 2020 through preliminary screening in gee landsat 7 and landsat 8 had 107 and 113 images respectively thirty two images were poorly extracted in sgls information after visual screening owing to the influence of cloud and terrain shadows finally 188 images were used to extract information on sgls comprising 19 images without water and 169 images with water fig 3 the landsat 7 images covered the years 2000 2013 and landsat 8 was primarily responsible for the data after 2013 the data from 2000 to 2005 were concentrated in the early period of the melting season with 48 00 of the available images in may and june and another 32 00 in september meanwhile the data from 2006 to 2013 mainly cover the middle part of the melting season june july and august and contained 84 38 images since 2013 the data density has escalated due to the availability of landsat 8 but the amount of data was still small in september the percentage of available images for may to september after 2013 is 18 75 13 75 32 50 26 25 and 8 75 respectively 3 1 2 total error assessment the main uncertainties in this study arose from the following aspects the simulation error in filling the landsat 7 gaps the accuracy of the cloud and shadow filters the effects of the shadows of surface features and the accuracy of ndwi ice method in response to these deviations we adopted a series of countermeasures we used the built in treatment method in gee for the first two deviations to make corrections more details are provided in section 2 2 furthermore we limit the scope of the study area by masking fig 1 to avoid bare rock and its shadows manual screening was also conducted to reduce the misjudgment of water bodies caused by terrain shadows to verify the accuracy of the ndwi ice extraction of the sgls we compared the results of high resolution images worldview 3 for supervised classification with the results of the ndwi ice global threshold based on landsat 8 the results show that the sgls areas extracted by the two methods differed by 9 02 with the small bodies of water being the main reason for this divergence accounting for 71 80 this discrepancy can be eliminated by the post processing of lakes extracted by ndwi ice based on these results we examined the ndwi ice calculation results and manually identified data for our study area of approximately 76 677 12 km2 in 1300 groups during a 21 year period the kappa coefficient mean intersection over union and f1 score of the sgls extracted with a ndwi ice greater than 0 25 were 0 85 0 79 and 0 87 respectively therefore the processed ndwi ice results can accurately represent the range of sgls 3 2 changes in the water storage of sgls 3 2 1 area volume and depth the yearly area volume and depth of the sgls typically increased and then decreased but the changes have different characteristics in one melting period fig 4 in terms of the area and volume sgls began to develop around doy 120 160 and reached a peak at doy 190 200 sgls were rarely detected on optical images around doy 240 270 the change in depth was relatively slow compared with the apparent extremes for volume and area the average depth of the sgls reached its peak at doy 190 230 and the maximum depth change reached a maximum value at approximately doy 180 which was about 10 days earlier than that of the average depth the maximum area of sgls in the study area was approximately 40 70 km2 and the maximum volume was approximately 60 100 10 3 km3 from 2000 to 2020 in addition the area and volume changes in the individual scenes also had unique differences for example on july 13 2015 doy 194 the area and volume reaching 90 90 km2 and 168 02 10 3 km3 respectively were significantly larger than the other dates in the study period on july 6 2015 the area of the sgls reached 75 82 km2 in terms of lake depth the average was 1 19 m the sd was 0 71 m and the average depth range was 0 06 3 02 m the maximum depth value widely fluctuated from 2 5 m to 5 m for the overall monthly change the maximum average depth and the maximum depth occurred in july which were 1 49 and 3 56 m respectively the maximum melting depth significantly fluctuated early in the melting season and the maximum lake depth was larger than 2 m on some dates in may we calculated a moving average of the results during 2000 2010 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 to explore the changing trends in the area volume and depth of the sgls fig 4 the 2010 2020 average blue line mainly appears above the 2000 2010 average red line indicating that the area volume and depth of the sgls increased on the same days of each year the monthly average changes during the three periods are shown in table 2 melting is most intense in july and august in july and august of the first two periods the area expanded by 20 70 and 13 63 km2 and the volume expanded by 33 50 10 3 and 21 00 10 3 km3 respectively the difference between 2005 and 2015 and 2010 2020 was smaller than that for the previous span the area only expanded by 3 07 km2 in july and it even decreased in other months however the monthly average volume still expanded in may june july august and september with a maximum value of 12 02 10 3 km3 in july depth drastically changes in july and august and the average mean depths in those two months increased from 0 10 m to 0 21 m in three periods the maximum depth drastically changes in july from 0 26 m to 0 62 m the depth changes were highly profound from 2000 to 2020 3 2 2 number of lakes the sgls were divided into large lakes 0 25 km2 and small lakes 0 25 km2 based on area studies have shown that small lakes area in western greenland account for less than 15 of the overall sgls area yang et al 2021 fig 5 a shows the total number of lakes and the changes in the number of large and small lakes from 2000 to 2020 excluding the vast number of lakes present by doy 180 in 2015 the number of sgls was approximately 300 500 per year of which 300 400 were small and 60 100 were large in 2015 980 lakes were detected of which 100 were large lakes the number of large and small lakes had noticeable differences in peak times the small lakes peaked at approximately doy 180 meanwhile the large lakes peaked at approximately doy 200 after the melting season began the large lakes appeared at doy 140 160 peaked at doy 180 210 and disappeared at doy 250 260 the average number of large lakes was 60 80 in years with sufficient data the large sgls showed no obvious trends from 2000 to 2020 fig 5 b the number of large lakes changed significantly when the available data were relatively abundant in july 2008 june 2010 july 2014 june 2016 and july 2019 which may be due to the significant water storage and drainage phenomenon during these periods 3 2 3 largest and deepest lakes this study also examined extreme lakes which were the single lakes with the largest area and largest depth within each scene table 3 the average area of the largest lake was 2 77 km2 and the average depth of the deepest lake was 4 00 m from 2000 to 2020 the largest lake was 4 74 km2 on july 14 2012 and the deepest lake was 5 83 m on august 13 2012 in terms of the average value for the appear date of largest lake and deepest lake the largest lakes appeared about 10 days earlier than the deepest lakes although the lakes mean depths were close the differences in area volume and maximum depth were significant the largest yearly area and depth appear on the same image in more than 70 of cases at approximately doy 200 in all years except for 2009 2012 and 2016 the deepest lakes appeared before the largest lakes among the three years where the lake with the largest area appeared first the largest lake appeared 10 days earlier than the deepest lake in 2009 and 2016 in 2012 the largest lake appeared at doy 196 which was 30 days earlier than the deepest lake at doy 226 in 2000 2004 and 2010 the deepest lake appeared at approximately doy 175 while the largest lake appeared at approximately doy 220 which was more than 40 days later in terms of elevation the largest lakes were aggregated in two zones at 900 1000 and 1300 1400 m which contained the largest lakes for 8 and 6 years respectively the deepest lakes were aggregated at 900 1000 m for 8 years of the study period the elevation of the largest lake was higher than that of the deepest lake at averages of 1164 85 and 967 11 m table 3 3 3 lake altitude and spatial patterns 3 3 1 annual increase in elevation all sgls in the study area developed below 1800 m in surface elevation and the average yearly altitude was between 700 m and 1200 m in terms of elevation changes fig 6 a the maximum elevation showed a clear upward trend increasing by approximately 300 m and the average elevation moved upward by approximately 200 m these increases are consistent with those observed by other studies leeson et al 2015 by contrast the minimum elevation slightly decreased and was approximately 200 m during all years from 2000 to 2020 in addition to the rise in the yearly maximum and average lake elevations the elevation for each day also moved upward the monthly mean elevation during 2000 2010 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 increased between each period the elevation escalated about 50 m between 2000 and 2010 and 2005 2015 except for a decrease of 63 94 m in june however the changes between 2005 and 2015 and 2010 2020 were relatively small the elevation raised by 10 20 m at the beginning and end of the season and only by approximately 1 m in june and july in august the elevation decreased by 17 09 m between 2010 and 2020 moreover sgls usually develop at the lowest elevation in early may however on may 9 2014 doy 129 and may 7 2019 doy 127 the maximum lake elevations both exceed 1000 m at 1009 19 and 1436 70 m respectively 3 3 2 elevation rise during the year the elevation distribution differed throughout a single melting season during sgls development the lake shifts inland in a band specifically the highest and lowest elevations of lakes move upward during the development the average daily elevations and sd of elevation from 2000 to 2020 are shown in fig 6 b during the initial melting period approximately doy 121 190 the average elevation slowly augmented approximately at a rate of 13 46 m d at the end of the melting period approximately doy 235 374 the average elevation relatively rapidly decreased approximately at a rate of 29 76 m d which was more than twice that during the ascent the sd indicates the degree of dispersion in lake elevation on that date the sd of all images obtained from 2000 to 2020 was within 400 m and the average sd for the entire study period was 190 87 m the sgls were relatively scattered in the early and late stages of the season however the distribution was more concentrated in the middle of melting the sd for doy 170 220 from 2000 to 2020 were between 150 and 250 m therefore the elevation range of the lakes was narrowest during periods of intense melting the elevations of large and small lakes were also investigated the average elevations of large and small lakes were 1094 25 and 962 38 m and the sds were 158 56 and 224 54 m respectively more than 90 of these lakes were between 600 m and 1600 m nevertheless the small lakes were widely distributed over the range where sgls appeared 22 79 occur at 800 1000 m and 26 74 at 1200 1400 m the large lakes were more concentrated in elevation with 84 16 occurring at 800 1400 m only 4 65 of the large lakes occur in areas below 800 m table 3 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 inter annual changes of sgls the area volume and depth of the sgls in the study area expanded from 2000 to 2020 figs 4 and 5 table 2 the seasonal increases in area volume and depth were not only reflected in the maximum values but also for values of each doy during the melting season the most drastic changes manifested in july and august during the middle of the melting period table 2 when analyzing the data by 10 year periods 2000 2010 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 the average area and volume drastically changed between the 2000 2010 and the 2005 2015 periods however the average depth slightly changed between the 2005 2015 and 2010 2020 periods the average area slightly changed and the average depth and volume changes were sharper the data during these two periods indicate that the growth rate of the sgls area has slowed in recent years but the melting depth continued to grow table 2 the formation of sgls significantly extended inland fig 6 a which is consistent with previous studies in various areas of greenland leeson et al 2015 turton et al 2021 the maximum elevation of sgls in the study area extended 300 m inland over the study period reaching approximately 1700 m and the maximum elevation increase rate was approximately 12 48 m yr this finding is similar to the data of sgl maximum elevation movement in previous study gledhill and williamson 2018 the maximum achievable elevation raised rapidly during 2000 2015 but it slowed down during 2015 2020 which may have been due to climatic conditions related to the north atlantic oscillation leeson et al 2015 4 2 development characteristics of sgls during the development of sgls the area and volume changes followed a normal distribution meanwhile the depth changes followed a binomial distribution during 2000 2020 the time of the peak average area and depth were consistent and concentrated at doy 190 200 however after the area began to decline the average depth remained at maximum for approximately 30 days fig 4 we speculate that the small lakes converged into a large lake at approximately doy 180 200 fig 5 a this speculation is due to the significant changes in the number of large and small lakes but small changes in the total lake area additionally the average yearly depth and maximum depth trends were not consistent fig 4 the maximum depth appeared doy 180 before the maximum average depth doy 190 200 each year fig 4 c d this finding shows that a lake still expands in submerged width when it is at its deepest accessible depth the maximum yearly depth occurred at an elevation of approximately 1000 m at which many deep lakes and large lakes formed table 3 during development the elevation of the sgls rose in a band shape specifically other sgls at low altitudes drained while some were formed at high altitudes fig 6 b this finding is consistent with time series analyses in other regions of greenland fitzpatrick et al 2014 sundal et al 2009 the standard deviation of the elevation indicates the concentration of the elevation distribution this study found that sgls in the study area were mainly concentrated within an elevation of 200 m therefore the sgls zone were concentrated during sgls development additionally the rise in the average elevation was much greater than 200 m which also reflects the banded characteristics of the lake development in the early stages of sgls formation the elevation quickly increased with a peak at approximately doy 210 however the elevation of the sgls decreased at approximately twice that rate the retreat of the lakes was more intense from the elevation perspective 4 3 factors of recurrence frequency influence the recurrence frequency of the sgls was calculated by merging their location information within the same year and superimposing the location information for the sgls that appeared during the melting season in each year fig 7 a the recurrence rate of sgls in the study area over the study period was relatively high a water area of 170 54 km2 which was 36 21 of the total lake area was present for 5 years or more small sgls meltwater channels and the outer areas of large lakes showed low recurrence the frequency of the obtainable meltwater channels from 2000 to 2020 was usually less than twice large lakes had a higher recurrence rate than small lakes liang et al 2012a but the lake area was not directly proportional to the recurrence rate the area of lake with a high recurrence rate is below 2 km2 mainly concentrated in 0 5 1 5 km2 fig 7 b the recurrence rate for lakes which was larger than 4 0 km2 was about 40 to explore the relationship between the high recurrence rate and geographical factors we analyzed the elevations slopes and aspects of the surface and bed in the study area for waters with a recurrence rate of more than 60 the number of recurrences between 2000 and 2020 was 13 fig 7 c additionally 0 22 km2 of the water area had a 100 recurrence rate from 2000 to 2020 of which 74 90 was from the same lake inset in fig 7 a given that the sgls with a recurrence rate of 100 21 times mainly occurs in one lake its particularity will make the statistical results inaccurate hence we did not consider the case where the recurrence rate was 21 the areas with a high recurrence rate were concentrated at a surface elevation of 900 1400 m of which 900 1000 m was highly concentrated containing 29 72 of the area with high recurrence the elevation ranges with high recurrence rate also meet the zone of deep lakes and large lakes formed the bed elevations of lakes with high recurrence rates were primarily at an elevation of 0 400 m moreover the bed elevations of the sgls with a recurrence rate higher than 60 were all approximately at 110 m in terms of the slope and aspect of the surface and bed 84 91 of the surface slope in the areas with high recurrence rates was less than 2 5 and the bed slope was primarily 0 10 the surface and bed slopes of the lakes with high recurrence rates were small because they formed in depressions which also caused the recurrence rate of the central areas of the sgls to be higher than that of the periphery no obvious pattern was observed in the surface aspect of this area and the bed aspect was primarily from the south to the northwest which may be related to the direction of the ice flow in the study area banwell et al 2014 the recurrence rate was correlated with the geographical factors of the study area which is consistent with the distribution of antarctic sgls stokes et al 2019 4 4 hydrological events extreme weather conditions occurred in many years causing deviations from the general trend between 2000 and 2020 sgls generally reached their maximum depth first followed by the maximum area however the maximum area in 2012 was reached 30 days earlier than the maximum depth which may be due to abnormally high temperatures colosio et al 2021 enabling the extraction of the largest single lake area 4 74 km2 in the 21 year span in 2015 the sgls reached the largest area 90 90 km2 and volume 168 02 10 3 km3 for the entire study period on doy 180 in 2015 the largest number of sgls in the study period appeared these data are much larger than those in any other years this abnormal melting was due to exceptional atmospheric conditions which were possibly caused by arctic amplification tedesco et al 2016 the changes in the number of large lakes demonstrated that the drainage and storage of water also drastically changed during the year fig 5 b in addition to water from melting ice rain and snow also rapidly increased water storage additionally not all the sgls that disappeared in the experiment discharged through runoff or infiltration during winter portions of lakes were covered by snow and ice lampkin et al 2020 which melted during the next melting season this phenomenon is the reason for the extremely high lake elevation above 1000 m at the beginning of melting detected in 2014 and 2019 5 conclusions sgls reflect the melting conditions of the ice sheets which is related to the stability of the ice sheet and ice shelf this study analyzed the sgls at sermeq avannarleq in greenland with gee from 2000 to 2020 the development of sgls over 21 years was analyzed through the sgls distributions and 54 related attributes obtained by gee the results show that the melting in the study area intensified over the study period and drastic melting mainly occurred in july and august the expansion in melting is manifested in the increasing area for the early stage meanwhile the depth of sgls has more significantly increased in recent year the elevation of the sgls in the study area also significantly developed inland and climbed 300 m in the last 21 years this phenomenon has slowed in the past 5 years which may be due to the north atlantic oscillation moreover many abnormal weather events occurred during 2000 2020 which may have caused phenomena such as an escalation in the area of the sgls an increase in the melting time and earlier melting the development of sgls throughout a single year showed specific overall patterns the peak area and average depth occurred at approximately doy 190 200 during this period the small lakes converged into a larger lake with small changes in area and average depth the annual maximum depth occurred at approximately doy 180 prior to the average depth peak specifically the sgl still expands in submerged width when it is at its deepest accessible depth the distribution of sgls zone shifts inland over a year and the lakes were concentrated within the melting zone the elevation slowly raised during melting but decreased nearly twice as fast during freezing the sgls generally developed from low to high elevation over the year however because some buried lakes reopened in the early stages of melting lakes with higher elevations were also obtained in the early stages of melting the area of sgls with a high recurrence rate was below 2 km2 and over 2 km2 lakes showed lower recurrence rates the geographical characteristics of the lakes with high recurrence rates are notable large and deep sgls and those with high recurrence rates primarily occurred at a surface elevation of approximately 1000 m additionally sgls with high recurrence rates primarily occurred in areas with small slopes for the surface and bed because the lakes mainly converged on depressions with relatively flat surfaces moreover a correlation was observed between the recurrence rate and the bed slope which may be related to the flow direction of the ice the main problem faced by this study was insufficient data which directly caused statistical errors in the time series analysis however this type of loss is difficult to avoid in the long term daily observation of sgls based on the methods used in this study future research could consider utilizing multi source remote sensing data to observe the year round evolution of sgls over a large area the results of this study aid in understanding the evolution of sgls in greenland ice sheet furthermore the information acquisition method using gee can be applied for long term and large scale extraction of multi source ice surface hydrological information in the future credit authorship contribution
