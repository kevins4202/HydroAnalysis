23380,flow characteristics downstream of a rotational oscillating cylinder at reynolds number re 300 was investigated the experiments were conducted using a model cylinder in a recirculating open water channel and the flow field was captured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the model cylinder was set to undergo clockwise and counterclockwise rotation at selected angular amplitude angular amplitude α varying from 0 to 360 and at the lock on frequency ratio f r 1 0 where f r f n f v the ratio of the forcing frequency f n to the natural vortex shedding frequency f v the effects of rotational movement of the cylinder on the near wake downstream of the cylinder were interpreted in terms of the instantaneous vorticity patterns as well as the time averaged streamline topology mean velocity distributions and reynolds shear stress contours based on the observation of the flow patterns and vortex contours it was deduced that the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation produced significant effect on the wake and modified the wake flow structures and vortex shedding patterns the time averaged streamline structures appeared to be non symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the flow keywords flow behavior clockwise and counterclockwise rotation piv rotational angular amplitude 1 introduction the phenomenon of flow induced vibration of circular cylinder has drawn considerable interest over the past decades as the phenomenon has been identified as the cause of fatigue damage in offshore structures such as risers mooring lines and in power plants such as heat exchangers understandably the flow induced vibration is at its strongest when the vortex shedding frequency in the wake is the same as the forcing frequency of the cylinder namely the lock on phenomenon it is the consensus that such vibration is most undesirable to date most of the reported investigations on flow induced vibration have been mainly concentrated on a cylinder undergoing inline and transverse oscillations with respect to the flow direction williamson and roshko 1988 khalak and williamson 1996 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 chaplin et al 2005 williamson and govardhaan 2008 impact of forced rotation on the wake of a rigidly mounted cylinder for example drilling riser has not been investigated as widely some of the recent experimental and numerical works can be found in filler et al 1991 mahfouz and badr 2000 mittal and kumar 2003 bourgue and jacono 2014 and sellappan and pottebaum 2014 most of the reported experimental studies for the rotationally oscillating cylinder were focused on the flow behaviors based on the flow visualization technique tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 conducted an experimental study on flow past an oscillating cylinder at reynolds number re 15000 re u 0 d υ where d was the cylinder diameter u 0 was the free stream velocity and υ was the kinematic viscosity using flow visualization and laser doppler velocity measurements the forcing dimensionless velocity amplitudes varied from 0 to 16 and forcing strouhal number from 0 17 to 3 3 four distinct flow modes at different forcing condition and significant reduction of viv at high forcing frequency were observed based on the findings obtained using hot wire anemometry and smoke wire flow visualization fujisawa et al 2001 proposed a method for actively controlling vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder at re 6700 and 20000 through rotational oscillations they found that the velocity fluctuations and the fluid forces were reduced by the feedback control with the optimum values of phase lag and feedback gain thiria et al 2006 found that the structure of the shed vortex and fluctuations of drag coefficients were strongly affected by the forcing parameters such as the forcing amplitude and the ratio of forced and natural frequencies of the vortex shedding they also found that the forced wake is characterized by a lock on region where the vortices were shed at the forcing frequency and a region where the vortices could be reorganized to produce a second frequency close to that for the unforced wake lee and lee 2006 found that the lock on phenomenon always occurred at f r 1 0 f r defined as the ratio of the forcing frequency f n to the natural vortex shedding frequency f v and the frequency range of lock on regime expanded with increasing oscillation amplitude they also found that the drag coefficient was reduced when f r was less than 1 0 at a constant oscillation amplitude of 30 lee and lee 2008 further found that depending on f r three well defined flow regimes could be discerned i e non lock on transitional and lock on regimes nazarinia et al 2012 investigated flow past a cylinder subjected to combined translational and rotational oscillations and found that both v r the ratio between the translational and rotational velocities and f r had significant effects on the synchronization of the near wake vortex structures kumar et al 2013 observed that rotary oscillations of a cylinder had significant effect on the wake structure the lock on of the wake to the forcing frequency depended not only on the forcing parameters but also on the downstream distance from the cylinder to the authors knowledge the experimental investigations on flow past a rotational oscillating cylinder were mostly performed at high reynolds numbers re 2000 or low reynolds number re 185 gao et al 2017 due to the limitation of the experimental conditions few experimental investigations were performed at re 300 or in the vicinity of re 300 for example taneda 1978 investigated the effect of the control parameters on the two dimensional wake flow behind a rotational oscillating cylinder for 30 re 300 in the further study of wu et al 1989 the control parameters was found to be strongly affected the fluid forces acting on the cylinder at re 300 however very little is known about the flow characteristics behind the cylinder undergoing a clockwise and counterclockwise rotation at re 300 moreover the effect of rotational angular amplitude on the flow pattern remains to be elucidated therefore the purpose of the present study was to investigate the flow behavior behind a clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating cylinder at a lock on frequency ratio of f r 1 0 for re 300 the forcing rotational angular amplitude α was varied from 0 to 360 the flow field behind the rotational oscillating cylinder was captured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the effects of forcing rotational angular amplitude on the near wake were deduced based on the patterns of instantaneous vorticity as well as the time averaged streamline topology mean velocity distribution and reynolds shear stress contours 2 experimental setup the experiments were performed in a recirculating open water channel 6 m long and a rectangular cross section of 0 3 m 0 4 m w h at the maritime research center nanyang technological university details of the water channel can be found in gao et al 2013 the model used in this experiment was a brass cylinder of diameter d 30 mm with a length of l 500 mm the blockage ratio d w of the test cylinder was about 10 smaller than the blockage ratios adopted in the experimental study of fujisawa et al 2001 lim and lee 2003 and braza et al 2006 which were about 20 25 and 20 8 respectively the effect of blockage ratio was considered to be ignored in the present study the water depth was 300 mm the clearance between the cylinder and the water channel bottom was about 3 mm 0 1d resulting into an aspect ratio of 9 9 10 similar to wang et al 2013 where the clearance between the cylinder and the water channel bottom was about 2 mm 0 1d the effect due to vortex interaction along the span of the cylinder on the shedding behavior at the mid plane was likely to be minimal norberg 2003 lau et al 2004 the aspect ratio was considered to be large enough to ensure the two dimensional flow at the mid plane slaouti and gerrard 1981 west and apelt 1993 lam and zou 2009 wang et al 2013 ma et al 2018 fig 1 shows a definition sketch of the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the laser sheet was positioned for the measurements in the horizontal x y plane at the mid height of water depth h s 150 mm the camera was placed under the test section perpendicular to the horizontal plane which means that the field of view was taken from the bottom of water channel the cylinder was forced to rotate in a clockwise and counterclockwise manner about its longitudinal axis and with different angular amplitude α ranging from 0 to 360 and at 30 increments using a stepper motor the rotational speed and angular amplitudes were precisely controlled by a programmable controller the pre set rotational frequency was set to equal to the natural vortex shedding frequency behind the stationary cylinder that is the frequency ratio f r 1 0 the freestream velocity was about 0 01 m s and the corresponding reynolds number re u 0 d υ was 300 in order to ensure the uniformity of the inlet flow the stilling chamber upstream of the contraction fitted with perforated steel plates and a honeycomb screen was adopted gao et al 2010 2013 the uncertainty in this study was estimated using a 95 confidence interval to be less than 2 5 for the freestream velocity u 0 and the free stream turbulence intensity in the test section was estimated to be less than 0 2 in this study the piv system lavision model was used to capture the flow field behind the rotational oscillating cylinder the particles were illuminated using light from a quantel system double cavity nd yag laser with a wavelength of 527 nm and a 2 mm thick laser sheet power 120 mj per pulse duration 5 ns the flow is seeding using the neutrally buoyant hollow glass spheres spherocel 110p8 with approximate diameter of 10 15 μm as the tracer particles which offered good traceability and scattering efficiency the particle images were recorded using a 12 bit charge coupled device ccd camera and had a resolution of 1 6 k 1 2 k pixels and a frame rate of 15 hz based on a compromise between the requirements of recording a large field of view and resolving detailed flow structures the viewing area was chosen to be about 130 m m 180 m m the lavision davis software was used to process the raw particle images and determine the flow fields velocity vectors were determined using the fft fast fourier transform method based on cross correlation algorithm with the standard gaussian sub pixel fit structured as an iterative multi grid method the processing procedure included two passes starting with a grid size of 64 64 pixels stepping down to 32 32 pixels overlapping by 50 which gives a spatial resolution of 7500 vectors in the viewing area then a 3 3 median filter was applied to remove possible outliers in the vector map the central vector was then replaced with the averaged vector obtained from the neighboring interrogation windows if it had deviated by more than 5 times the rms root mean square value of the eight surrounding neighbours for the smoothing process the 3 3 average filter was chosen to establish the final vector maps for each case a set of 1050 frames of the instantaneous flow fields was acquired i e 70 s recordings 3 results and discussion 3 1 instantaneous flow patterns flow past a rotational oscillating cylinder was examined over a range of rotational angular amplitudes α 0 360 and special attention was paid on the instantaneous flow field during an oscillation period at a constant frequency ratio f n f v 1 0 details of the findings are discussed in the following sections the instantaneous vorticity contours ω ω z d u 0 behind the rotational oscillating cylinder at different rotational angular amplitudes are shown in fig 2 where the solid and dashed lines represent positive and negative values respectively the instantaneous vorticity fields clearly show that the rotational angular amplitude has significant effect on the wake flow structures different vortex shedding modes are observed for various rotational angular amplitudes α for all of the examined rotational angular amplitude α the starting point of the period is considered to be coincided with the moment at which the clockwise vortex begins to shed from the right shear layer comparisons of the flow structures behind the stationary and rotational oscillating cylinder are presented to illustrate the effects of rotational angular amplitude as can be seen in fig 2 for the stationary cylinder two vortex streets lie on the opposite side of the wake centerline y d 0 and vortex shedding is observed downstream at around x d 2 8 when the cylinder undergoes the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation with a forcing rotational angular amplitude of α 30 the shear layers from both sides of the cylinder appear to be elongated the vortices are shed along paths parallel to the free stream direction although the cylinder rotation has displaced the wake centerline right side where the positive shear layer detached from the left side of the cylinder appears to be slightly deflected from the free stream direction when α is increased to 60 at the starting of the period t 0 t n a clockwise negative vortex is beginning to be shed from the right side shear layer as time goes by at t t n 3 the right side shear layer appears to be rolling up while the left shear layer is split into anticlockwise vorticity concentrations when the cylinder is rotational oscillating backward at t 2 t n 3 the right shear layer is elongated and then split into multiple clockwise vorticity concentrations at t t n a 2s wake mode is observed using the nomenclature of williamson and roshko 1988 which consists of two single vortices of opposite sign shed over one cylinder oscillation cycle p s mode comprises a pair of vortices and a single vortex per cycle as α increases to 90 similar to the case of α 60 a vortex pair of two opposite signed vortices appears to be shed from the right and left side of the cylinder at t 0 t n and t t n respectively with an increase of α to 120 two rows of vortices are observed behind the cylinder when the shed vortices transvers to the downstream the splitting phenomenon of the large scale vortices to multiple small scale vortices is observed from the view of the nomenclature of williamson and roshko 1988 a switch of vortex shedding mode phenomenon behind the cylinder occurs as characterized by a vortex pair of two opposite signed vortices and a single negative vortex shed during one rotational oscillating period which refers to as p s wake mode increasing of α to 150 the vortex shedding becomes regularly a 2s mode is observed the foci of the vorticity contours moves towards the surface of the cylinder when α increases to 180 the vortex shedding becomes irregularly the scales of the shear layer separated from the cylinder surface increase multiple smaller vorticity concentrations are observed at the downstream wake at α 210 the flow wake appears to be deflected more to one side and the vorticty concentration moves nearer to the cylinder surface a pair of two opposite signed vortices is observed to shed from each side of the cylinder at t 0 t n and t 2 t n 3 respectively and the scale of vortices becomes smaller compared to those observed at α 180 while when α is increased to 240 different from the case of α 210 the shear layer in the left side of the cylinder is still in the developing process at t 2 t n 3 and the regenerated positive vortex is formed at t t n a 2s vortex shedding mode is observed with even larger α at 270 to 300 a 2s configuration is also observed compared to the case of α 240 the shear layers separated from the rotational oscillating cylinder appear to be deflected significantly due to increasing of the rotational oscillation amplitude as α increases to 330 similar to the case of α 210 a vortex pair of two opposite signed vortices appears to be shed from the right and left side of the cylinder at t 0 t n and t 2 t n 3 respectively increasing the rotational oscillation amplitude to α 360 causes a change in the near wake vortex shedding mode the shear layers separated from the rotational oscillating cylinder appear to be elongated and approximately parallel to the wake centerline axis y d 0 an asymmetrical vortex shedding mode can be discerned and comprises a pair of vortices with the same sign and a single vortex with the opposite sign multiple small scale vortices are observed at the downstream location from the results above it can be conclude that the instantaneous flow pattern is modified significantly by the rotational oscillatory motion of the cylinder with increasing of the rotational angular amplitude α different vortex shedding modes are observed i a 2s wake mode at α 30 90 150 240 270 300 ii a p s mode at α 120 180 iii a wake mode between 2s and p s mode at 60 210 and 330 iv double row vortex shedding mode at α 360 fig 3 shows the time histories of the streamwise and cross stream trajectories of negative vortex centers with respect to the rotational angular amplitude α during the first half period the peak position of the first primary negative vorticity is defined as the vortex center significant discrepancies in the locations of the vortex center x c d and y c d with variations of the rotational angular amplitudes are observed for all the tested rotationally angular amplitudes the streamwise trajectories of the first primary vorticity centers appear to have a linear relationship with time for the stationary cylinder the first primary vorticity center is located at x c d 2 8 y c d 0 95 at the starting point of the period when the rotational oscillatory motion is applied to the cylinder the locations of the first primary vorticity centers move towards to the cylinder surface in the range of 60 α 330 and move apart from the cylinder surface at α 30 180 and 330 among the rotational angular amplitudes tested in this study the first shed primary vortex center location for the case of α 180 is the farthest from the cylinder surface and closest to the cylinder surface for the case of α 90 3 2 spectra analysis for the rotationally oscillating cylinder the power spectral density function eu of the streamwise velocity extracted from the successive piv results at the downstream location x d 2 0 y d 0 5 with different rotational angular amplitudes from 30 360 are shown in fig 4 the corresponding non dimensional vortex shedding frequency s t f v d u is equal to 0 21 for the stationary cylinder gao et al 2017 which is in reasonable agreement with the strouhal number reported for the flow regime at the corresponding reynolds number re 300 sumer and fredsoe 1997 in terms of α different and distinct frequencies are observed as can be seen in fig 4 and at α 30 two peaks are observed in the power spectra where the prominent peak occurs at the vortex shedding frequency f v of 0 071 hz s t f v d u 0 0 21 and a smaller peak is observed at f 0 4 f v whereas at α 60 a single dominant frequency is observed at f 0 8 f v and at a value of 0 057 hz lower than that of the natural vortex shedding frequency at α 90 a pronounced peak is observed at f 0 6 f v similar to the case of α 60 a single dominant frequency at f 0 8 f v is also observed at α 120 for α 150 multiple peaks exist in the power spectra for α 180 the vortex shedding frequency f v is equal to the forcing rotational frequency f n with α 210 270 and 360 a pronounced peak is observed at f f v 0 071 h z while a smaller peak is also observed at f 0 4 f v 0 6 f v 0 2 f v for 210 270 and 360 respectively whereas for α 240 and 330 a single pronounced peak is observed at f 0 8 f v from the power spectra it is interesting to note that the dominant frequencies for all rotational angular amplitudes appear to be not larger than the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder 3 3 mean flow field the measurements of mean flow fields and turbulence are performed to obtain an insight into the spatial evolution of wake pattern and flow instability characteristics behind the rotationally oscillating cylinder for all the tested rotational angular amplitude α the time averaged flow field behind the rotationally oscillating cylinder is obtained by averaging all 1050 piv snapshots fig 5 shows the time averaged streamline topologies as a function of rotational angular amplitude α the forcing rotational angular amplitude α plays an important role in the mean flow characteristics different streamline topologies are observed when the cylinder undergoes a clockwise and counterclockwise rotation the flow induced by the motion of the cylinder is found to modify the shapes of the time averaged recirculation zones and the eddy patterns as can be seen in fig 5 and at small rotational amplitude α 30 well defined time averaged recirculation zones composed of two eddies are formed on either side of the rotational oscillating cylinder the size and strength of the two eddies are similar in magnitude when the rotational amplitude α increases to 60 and 90 the symmetry of the two eddies is destroyed and the rotational oscillating cylinder generates a skewed or asymmetric mean flow patterns where the time averaged recirculation zone on the upper side of the cylinder becomes less distinct and eventually disappeared at α 90 when α 120 and 150 the flow structures are still asymmetrical with two eddies and the scales of two eddies appear to be decreased unlike the case of α 180 when the rotational angular amplitude α increases to 180 to 330 a substantial transformation of the patterns is observed where the eddy formations are not closed on either side of the rotational oscillating cylinder this observation may be attributed to the synchronization of the vortex shedding and the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the cylinder when α 360 the patterns of streamline topology appear different and an asymmetrical flow structure is observed the upper anticlockwise eddy appears to dominate the flow field in the near wake region in summary it can be obtained that the rotational oscillation of the cylinder destroys the symmetry of the streamline structures and significantly affects both the velocity distribution and the trajectories of the eddy cores from observation of the streamline topologies above it can be deduced that the asymmetrical eddies will be formed behind the rotational oscillating cylinder with 180 α 330 the streamline depicts a pattern without separation very similar to that of ideal flow past a cylinder at α 360 a closed eddy formation is observed on the lower side of cylinder while a lobe is observed on the upper side of cylinder figs 6 and 7 show the profiles of the dimensionless mean streamwise velocity u u 0 and vertical velocity v u 0 as a function of the non dimesional vertical distance y d at different downstream locations x d 1 0 2 0 the streamwise locations are selected to include the important regions of interest such as that inside and the counterparts outside the time averaged recirculation zone it can be seen in figs 6 and 7 that the shapes of these velocity profiles are somewhat similar to those of a typical recirculation flow near a stationary cylinder as can be seen in fig 6 a close to the surface of the rotational oscillating cylinder at x d 1 0 the streamwise velocity profile u u 0 is negative with the minimum velocity at the center of the time averaged recirculation zone along the axis of symmetry at y d 0 when α 180 o as y d increases in both the positive and negative vertical directions the streamwise velocity u u 0 approaches zero and exceeds unity at a distance far away from the time averaged recirculation zone for most of the cases the maximum value of u u 0 approaches to 1 6 at α 360 for the cases of 180 o α 360 o no negative values of u u 0 are observed since there is the non existence of reverse flow in the lee of the rotational oscillating cylinder the values of u u 0 min are in the range of 0 24 to 0 28 for all α with an increase in the downstream distance x d 2 0 as shown in fig 6 b similar to the cases of 180 o α 360 o at x d 1 0 the streamwise velocity u u 0 is positive which indicates that there is no reverse flow in the lee of the rotational oscillating cylinder compared to the streamwise mean velocity the vertical mean velocity v u 0 shows greater variation with respect to the rotational angular amplitude α as can be seen in fig 7 the vertical mean velocity v u 0 distribution indicates that the distribution is antisymmetry about the wake axis y d 0 when the cylinder undergoes the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation the vertical mean velocity v u 0 becomes larger than that of the stationary cylinder it can be seen from fig 7 a that at the location near to the cylinder surface at x d 1 0 more rotational fluid will be involved as the rotational angular amplitude α increases therefore the vertical velocity v u 0 is increased the maximum value of v u 0 approaches 0 2 for α 180 at the location x d 1 0 and increases to 0 27 for α 360 at the downstream location x d 2 0 fig 8 shows the profiles of the dimensionless root mean square streamwise velocity u r m s u 0 as a function of the dimensionless vertical distance y d at different downstream locations x d 1 0 2 0 at a location close to the surface of rotational oscillating cylinder x d 1 0 the root mean square velocity u r m s u 0 exhibits an approximately m shaped profile with double peaks which are symmetrical about the wake centerline y d 0 for all the tested rotational angular amplitude α the double peak values of u r m s u 0 appear to be much larger for the cases of α 180 than those at α 180 and reaches a maximum value of 0 6 at α 180 which is in accordance with the largest scale of the instantaneous shear layers observed at α 180 the increase in u r m s u 0 with increasing α from 0 to 180 is probably due to the combined effect of rotational oscillation and lock in of the vortex shedding processes at the further downstream location x d 2 0 the irregular distributions of u r m s u 0 with respect to the rotational angular amplitudes α are observed which may be attributed to the complex interactions between the shed vortices and the entrainment fluids 3 4 turbulence characteristics as well known the reynolds stress is the component of the total stress tensor in a fluid to account for turbulent fluctuations in fluid momentum prandtl 1925 firstly gave a comprehensive explanation in the existence of reynolds stress where he proposed that reynolds stress reflects the net transport of momentum across a plane arising from the random movement of fluid particles in the presence of a mean shear due to the non constant of the mean velocity its difference between the initial and final locations of a particle correlates with the direction of travel a momentum flux and consequently reynolds stress is created bernard and handler 1990 bernard et al 1989a b explained the physics of reynolds stress from the analysis of particle paths in turbulent flow in the further study of bernard and handler 1990 the results showed that it is most natural to consider the reynolds stress as originating from two physical mechanisms encompassing the effects of displacement and acceleration of fluid particles however few investigations on the reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy tke have been carried out when the cylinder undergoes clockwise and anticlockwise rotation figs 9 and 10 present the contours of normalized reynolds shear stress u v u 0 2 and normalized turbulent kinetic energy k u 0 2 behind the rotational oscillating cylinder for different rotational oscillating angular amplitudes the solid and dashed lines represent positive and negative values respectively incremental values of the reynolds shear stress u v u 0 2 and tke is 0 005 and 0 03 respectively when the cylinder undergoes a clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating the reynolds shear stress contour appear different compared to the case of non rotational oscillating cylinder and accompanied by asymmetrical distribution with respect to the wake axis y d 0 and significant difference in magnitude of u v u 0 2 for most of the rotational angular amplitude α the maximum magnitude of the reynolds shear stresses u v u 0 2 are observed at the upper side of the cylinder except for the cases of α 90 270 where the maximum magnitude are observed at the lower side of the cylinder note that the magnitude of u v u 0 2 is significantly different at different rotational angular amplitudes the minimum magnitude of u v u 0 2 is about 0 02 at α 150 while the maximum magnitude of u v u 0 2 appears at α 180 with a value of 0 18 nine times of the observed minimum magnitude moreover the location of maximum value of u v u 0 2 appears to have moved towards the cylinder surface when α 180 with reference to the reynolds shear stress contours it can be seen that the width of positive and negative reynolds shear stress contours behind the rotational oscillating cylinder is enlarged as the angular amplitude increases in the tke contours as shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the maximum normalized tke value approaches to the value of 0 59 when α is increased to 180 and then decreases to the value of 0 23 on further increase of α to 360 it is interesting to note that both the maximum values and scales of the tke contours at 0 α 180 appear to be smaller than those at the range of 180 α 360 the smallest scale of the tke contour is occurred at small rotational angular amplitude α 30 the distribution of the tke contours behaves asymmetrically about the centerline where a larger value of the tke contour is almost appeared at the upper side of the rotational oscillating cylinder except for the cases of α 300 and 360 compared to the cases of 180 α 360 when α increases to 360 the scale of the tke contour decreases significantly 4 conclusions the wake structures behind a circular cylinder undergoing clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating have been investigated at the lock on frequency ratio f r 1 0 by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the effects of forcing rotational angular amplitude α on the near wake are observed and interpreted based on the patterns of instantaneous vorticity as well as the time average streamline topology mean velocity distributions and reynolds shear stress contours the conclusions are presented as followed 1 the forcing rotational angular amplitude α plays an important role in the instantaneous wake flow structures different vortex shedding modes are observed with variations of rotational angular amplitude i a 2s wake mode at α 30 90 150 240 270 300 ii a p s mode at α 120 180 iii a wake mode between 2s and p s mode at 60 210 and 330 iv double row vortex shedding mode at α 360 2 with α 0 the flow behavior behind the clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating cylinder is significantly modified resulting in asymmetrical distribution of the streamline structures and shows significantly different in the magnitude of normalized reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy 3 the time averaged recirculation zone disappears when the rotational angular amplitude α increases to 180 for 180 α 330 the time averaged streamlines are characterized by depicting a pattern similar to that of ideal flow past a cylinder and without recirculation zone acknowledgements this research was

water channel and the flow field was captured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the model cylinder was set to undergo clockwise and counterclockwise rotation at selected angular amplitude angular amplitude α varying from 0 to 360 and at the lock on frequency ratio f r 1 0 where f r f n f v the ratio of the forcing frequency f n to the natural vortex shedding frequency f v the effects of rotational movement of the cylinder on the near wake downstream of the cylinder were interpreted in terms of the instantaneous vorticity patterns as well as the time averaged streamline topology mean velocity distributions and reynolds shear stress contours based on the observation of the flow patterns and vortex contours it was deduced that the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation produced significant effect on the wake and modified the wake flow structures and vortex shedding patterns the time averaged streamline structures appeared to be non symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the flow keywords flow behavior clockwise and counterclockwise rotation piv rotational angular amplitude 1 introduction the phenomenon of flow induced vibration of circular

williamson and govardhaan 2008 impact of forced rotation on the wake of a rigidly mounted cylinder for example drilling riser has not been investigated as widely some of the recent experimental and numerical works can be found in filler et al 1991 mahfouz and badr 2000 mittal and kumar 2003 bourgue and jacono 2014 and sellappan and pottebaum 2014 most of the reported experimental studies for the rotationally oscillating cylinder were focused on the flow behaviors based on the flow visualization technique tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 conducted an experimental study on flow past an oscillating cylinder at reynolds number re 15000 re u 0 d υ where d was the cylinder diameter u 0 was the free stream velocity and υ was the kinematic viscosity using flow visualization and laser doppler velocity measurements the forcing dimensionless velocity amplitudes varied from 0 to 16 and forcing strouhal number from 0 17 to 3 3 four distinct flow modes at different forcing condition and significant reduction of viv at high forcing frequency were observed based on the findings obtained using hot wire anemometry and smoke wire flow visualization fujisawa et al 2001 proposed a method for actively controlling vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder at re 6700 and 20000 through rotational oscillations they found that the velocity fluctuations and the fluid forces were reduced by the feedback control with the optimum values of phase lag and feedback gain thiria et al 2006 found that the structure of the shed vortex and fluctuations of drag coefficients were strongly affected by the forcing parameters such as the forcing amplitude and the ratio of forced and natural frequencies of the vortex shedding they also found that the forced wake is characterized by a lock on region where the vortices were shed at the forcing frequency and a region where the vortices could be reorganized to produce a second frequency close to that for the unforced wake lee and lee 2006 found that the lock on phenomenon always occurred at f r 1 0 f r defined as the ratio of the forcing frequency f n to the natural vortex shedding frequency f v and the frequency range of lock on regime expanded with increasing oscillation amplitude they also found that the drag coefficient was reduced when f r was less than 1 0 at a constant oscillation amplitude of 30 lee and lee 2008 further found that depending on f r three well defined flow regimes could be discerned i e non lock on transitional and lock on regimes nazarinia et al 2012 investigated flow past a cylinder subjected to combined translational and rotational oscillations and found that both v r the ratio between the translational and rotational velocities and f r had significant effects on the synchronization of the near wake vortex structures kumar et al 2013 observed that rotary oscillations of a cylinder had significant effect on the wake structure the lock on of the wake to the forcing frequency depended not only on the forcing parameters but also on the downstream distance from the cylinder to the authors knowledge the experimental investigations on flow past a rotational oscillating cylinder were mostly performed at high reynolds numbers re 2000 or low reynolds number re 185 gao et al 2017 due to the limitation of the experimental conditions few experimental investigations were performed at re 300 or in the vicinity of re 300 for example taneda 1978 investigated the effect of the control parameters on the two dimensional wake flow behind a rotational oscillating cylinder for 30 re 300 in the further study of wu et al 1989 the control parameters was found to be strongly affected the fluid forces acting on the cylinder at re 300 however very little is known about the flow characteristics behind the cylinder undergoing a clockwise and counterclockwise rotation at re 300 moreover the effect of rotational angular amplitude on the flow pattern remains to be elucidated therefore the purpose of the present study was to investigate the flow behavior behind a clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating cylinder at a lock on frequency ratio of f r 1 0 for re 300 the forcing rotational angular amplitude α was varied from 0 to 360 the flow field behind the rotational oscillating cylinder was captured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the effects of forcing rotational angular amplitude on the near wake were deduced based on the patterns of instantaneous vorticity as well as the time averaged streamline topology mean velocity distribution and reynolds shear stress contours 2 experimental setup the experiments were performed in a recirculating open water channel 6 m long and a rectangular cross section of 0 3 m 0 4 m w h at the maritime research center nanyang technological university details of the water channel can be found in gao et al 2013 the model used in this experiment was a brass cylinder of diameter d 30 mm with a length of l 500 mm the blockage ratio d w of the test cylinder was about 10 smaller than the blockage ratios adopted in the experimental study of fujisawa et al 2001 lim and lee 2003 and braza et al 2006 which were about 20 25 and 20 8 respectively the effect of blockage ratio was considered to be ignored in the present study the water depth was 300 mm the clearance between the cylinder and the water channel bottom was about 3 mm 0 1d resulting into an aspect ratio of 9 9 10 similar to wang et al 2013 where the clearance between the cylinder and the water channel bottom was about 2 mm 0 1d the effect due to vortex interaction along the span of the cylinder on the shedding behavior at the mid plane was likely to be minimal norberg 2003 lau et al 2004 the aspect ratio was considered to be large enough to ensure the two dimensional flow at the mid plane slaouti and gerrard 1981 west and apelt 1993 lam and zou 2009 wang et al 2013 ma et al 2018 fig 1 shows a definition sketch of the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the laser sheet was positioned for the measurements in the horizontal x y plane at the mid height of water depth h s 150 mm the camera was placed under the test section perpendicular to the horizontal plane which means that the field of view was taken from the bottom of water channel the cylinder was forced to rotate in a clockwise and counterclockwise manner about its longitudinal axis and with different angular amplitude α ranging from 0 to 360 and at 30 increments using a stepper motor the rotational speed and angular amplitudes were precisely controlled by a programmable controller the pre set rotational frequency was set to equal to the natural vortex shedding frequency behind the stationary cylinder that is the frequency ratio f r 1 0 the freestream velocity was about 0 01 m s and the corresponding reynolds number re u 0 d υ was 300 in order to ensure the uniformity of the inlet flow the stilling chamber upstream of the contraction fitted with perforated steel plates and a honeycomb screen was adopted gao et al 2010 2013 the uncertainty in this study was estimated using a 95 confidence interval to be less than 2 5 for the freestream velocity u 0 and the free stream turbulence intensity in the test section was estimated to be less than 0 2 in this study the piv system lavision model was used to capture the flow field behind the rotational oscillating cylinder the particles were illuminated using light from a quantel system double cavity nd yag laser with a wavelength of 527 nm and a 2 mm thick laser sheet power 120 mj per pulse duration 5 ns the flow is seeding using the neutrally buoyant hollow glass spheres spherocel 110p8 with approximate diameter of 10 15 μm as the tracer particles which offered good traceability and scattering efficiency the particle images were recorded using a 12 bit charge coupled device ccd camera and had a resolution of 1 6 k 1 2 k pixels and a frame rate of 15 hz based on a compromise between the requirements of recording a large field of view and resolving detailed flow structures the viewing area was chosen to be about 130 m m 180 m m the lavision davis software was used to process the raw particle images and determine the flow fields velocity vectors were determined using the fft fast fourier transform method based on cross correlation algorithm with the standard gaussian sub pixel fit structured as an iterative multi grid method the processing procedure included two passes starting with a grid size of 64 64 pixels stepping down to 32 32 pixels overlapping by 50 which gives a spatial resolution of 7500 vectors in the viewing area then a 3 3 median filter was applied to remove possible outliers in the vector map the central vector was then replaced with the averaged vector obtained from the neighboring interrogation windows if it had deviated by more than 5 times the rms root mean square value of the eight surrounding neighbours for the smoothing process the 3 3 average filter was chosen to establish the final vector maps for each case a set of 1050 frames of the instantaneous flow fields was acquired i e 70 s recordings 3 results and discussion 3 1 instantaneous flow patterns flow past a rotational oscillating cylinder was examined over a range of rotational angular amplitudes α 0 360 and special attention was paid on the instantaneous flow field during an oscillation period at a constant frequency ratio f n f v 1 0 details of the findings are discussed in the following sections the instantaneous vorticity contours ω ω z d u 0 behind the rotational oscillating cylinder at different rotational angular amplitudes are shown in fig 2 where the solid and dashed lines represent positive and negative values respectively the instantaneous vorticity fields clearly show that the rotational angular amplitude has significant effect on the wake flow structures different vortex shedding modes are observed for various rotational angular amplitudes α for all of the examined rotational angular amplitude α the starting point of the period is considered to be coincided with the moment at which the clockwise vortex begins to shed from the right shear layer comparisons of the flow structures behind the stationary and rotational oscillating cylinder are presented to illustrate the effects of rotational angular amplitude as can be seen in fig 2 for the stationary cylinder two vortex streets lie on the opposite side of the wake centerline y d 0 and vortex shedding is observed downstream at around x d 2 8 when the cylinder undergoes the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation with a forcing rotational angular amplitude of α 30 the shear layers from both sides of the cylinder appear to be elongated the vortices are shed along paths parallel to the free stream direction although the cylinder rotation has displaced the wake centerline right side where the positive shear layer detached from the left side of the cylinder appears to be slightly deflected from the free stream direction when α is increased to 60 at the starting of the period t 0 t n a clockwise negative vortex is beginning to be shed from the right side shear layer as time goes by at t t n 3 the right side shear layer appears to be rolling up while the left shear layer is split into anticlockwise vorticity concentrations when the cylinder is rotational oscillating backward at t 2 t n 3 the right shear layer is elongated and then split into multiple clockwise vorticity concentrations at t t n a 2s wake mode is observed using the nomenclature of williamson and roshko 1988 which consists of two single vortices of opposite sign shed over one cylinder oscillation cycle p s mode comprises a pair of vortices and a single vortex per cycle as α increases to 90 similar to the case of α 60 a vortex pair of two opposite signed vortices appears to be shed from the right and left side of the cylinder at t 0 t n and t t n respectively with an increase of α to 120 two rows of vortices are observed behind the cylinder when the shed vortices transvers to the downstream the splitting phenomenon of the large scale vortices to multiple small scale vortices is observed from the view of the nomenclature of williamson and roshko 1988 a switch of vortex shedding mode phenomenon behind the cylinder occurs as characterized by a vortex pair of two opposite signed vortices and a single negative vortex shed during one rotational oscillating period which refers to as p s wake mode increasing of α to 150 the vortex shedding becomes regularly a 2s mode is observed the foci of the vorticity contours moves towards the surface of the cylinder when α increases to 180 the vortex shedding becomes irregularly the scales of the shear layer separated from the cylinder surface increase multiple smaller vorticity concentrations are observed at the downstream wake at α 210 the flow wake appears to be deflected more to one side and the vorticty concentration moves nearer to the cylinder surface a pair of two opposite signed vortices is observed to shed from each side of the cylinder at t 0 t n and t 2 t n 3 respectively and the scale of vortices becomes smaller compared to those observed at α 180 while when α is increased to 240 different from the case of α 210 the shear layer in the left side of the cylinder is still in the developing process at t 2 t n 3 and the regenerated positive vortex is formed at t t n a 2s vortex shedding mode is observed with even larger α at 270 to 300 a 2s configuration is also observed compared to the case of α 240 the shear layers separated from the rotational oscillating cylinder appear to be deflected significantly due to increasing of the rotational oscillation amplitude as α increases to 330 similar to the case of α 210 a vortex pair of two opposite signed vortices appears to be shed from the right and left side of the cylinder at t 0 t n and t 2 t n 3 respectively increasing the rotational oscillation amplitude to α 360 causes a change in the near wake vortex shedding mode the shear layers separated from the rotational oscillating cylinder appear to be elongated and approximately parallel to the wake centerline axis y d 0 an asymmetrical vortex shedding mode can be discerned and comprises a pair of vortices with the same sign and a single vortex with the opposite sign multiple small scale vortices are observed at the downstream location from the results above it can be conclude that the instantaneous flow pattern is modified significantly by the rotational oscillatory motion of the cylinder with increasing of the rotational angular amplitude α different vortex shedding modes are observed i a 2s wake mode at α 30 90 150 240 270 300 ii a p s mode at α 120 180 iii a wake mode between 2s and p s mode at 60 210 and 330 iv double row vortex shedding mode at α 360 fig 3 shows the time histories of the streamwise and cross stream trajectories of negative vortex centers with respect to the rotational angular amplitude α during the first half period the peak position of the first primary negative vorticity is defined as the vortex center significant discrepancies in the locations of the vortex center x c d and y c d with variations of the rotational angular amplitudes are observed for all the tested rotationally angular amplitudes the streamwise trajectories of the first primary vorticity centers appear to have a linear relationship with time for the stationary cylinder the first primary vorticity center is located at x c d 2 8 y c d 0 95 at the starting point of the period when the rotational oscillatory motion is applied to the cylinder the locations of the first primary vorticity centers move towards to the cylinder surface in the range of 60 α 330 and move apart from the cylinder surface at α 30 180 and 330 among the rotational angular amplitudes tested in this study the first shed primary vortex center location for the case of α 180 is the farthest from the cylinder surface and closest to the cylinder surface for the case of α 90 3 2 spectra analysis for the rotationally oscillating cylinder the power spectral density function eu of the streamwise velocity extracted from the successive piv results at the downstream location x d 2 0 y d 0 5 with different rotational angular amplitudes from 30 360 are shown in fig 4 the corresponding non dimensional vortex shedding frequency s t f v d u is equal to 0 21 for the stationary cylinder gao et al 2017 which is in reasonable agreement with the strouhal number reported for the flow regime at the corresponding reynolds number re 300 sumer and fredsoe 1997 in terms of α different and distinct frequencies are observed as can be seen in fig 4 and at α 30 two peaks are observed in the power spectra where the prominent peak occurs at the vortex shedding frequency f v of 0 071 hz s t f v d u 0 0 21 and a smaller peak is observed at f 0 4 f v whereas at α 60 a single dominant frequency is observed at f 0 8 f v and at a value of 0 057 hz lower than that of the natural vortex shedding frequency at α 90 a pronounced peak is observed at f 0 6 f v similar to the case of α 60 a single dominant frequency at f 0 8 f v is also observed at α 120 for α 150 multiple peaks exist in the power spectra for α 180 the vortex shedding frequency f v is equal to the forcing rotational frequency f n with α 210 270 and 360 a pronounced peak is observed at f f v 0 071 h z while a smaller peak is also observed at f 0 4 f v 0 6 f v 0 2 f v for 210 270 and 360 respectively whereas for α 240 and 330 a single pronounced peak is observed at f 0 8 f v from the power spectra it is interesting to note that the dominant frequencies for all rotational angular amplitudes appear to be not larger than the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder 3 3 mean flow field the measurements of mean flow fields and turbulence are performed to obtain an insight into the spatial evolution of wake pattern and flow instability characteristics behind the rotationally oscillating cylinder for all the tested rotational angular amplitude α the time averaged flow field behind the rotationally oscillating cylinder is obtained by averaging all 1050 piv snapshots fig 5 shows the time averaged streamline topologies as a function of rotational angular amplitude α the forcing rotational angular amplitude α plays an important role in the mean flow characteristics different streamline topologies are observed when the cylinder undergoes a clockwise and counterclockwise rotation the flow induced by the motion of the cylinder is found to modify the shapes of the time averaged recirculation zones and the eddy patterns as can be seen in fig 5 and at small rotational amplitude α 30 well defined time averaged recirculation zones composed of two eddies are formed on either side of the rotational oscillating cylinder the size and strength of the two eddies are similar in magnitude when the rotational amplitude α increases to 60 and 90 the symmetry of the two eddies is destroyed and the rotational oscillating cylinder generates a skewed or asymmetric mean flow patterns where the time averaged recirculation zone on the upper side of the cylinder becomes less distinct and eventually disappeared at α 90 when α 120 and 150 the flow structures are still asymmetrical with two eddies and the scales of two eddies appear to be decreased unlike the case of α 180 when the rotational angular amplitude α increases to 180 to 330 a substantial transformation of the patterns is observed where the eddy formations are not closed on either side of the rotational oscillating cylinder this observation may be attributed to the synchronization of the vortex shedding and the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the cylinder when α 360 the patterns of streamline topology appear different and an asymmetrical flow structure is observed the upper anticlockwise eddy appears to dominate the flow field in the near wake region in summary it can be obtained that the rotational oscillation of the cylinder destroys the symmetry of the streamline structures and significantly affects both the velocity distribution and the trajectories of the eddy cores from observation of the streamline topologies above it can be deduced that the asymmetrical eddies will be formed behind the rotational oscillating cylinder with 180 α 330 the streamline depicts a pattern without separation very similar to that of ideal flow past a cylinder at α 360 a closed eddy formation is observed on the lower side of cylinder while a lobe is observed on the upper side of cylinder figs 6 and 7 show the profiles of the dimensionless mean streamwise velocity u u 0 and vertical velocity v u 0 as a function of the non dimesional vertical distance y d at different downstream locations x d 1 0 2 0 the streamwise locations are selected to include the important regions of interest such as that inside and the counterparts outside the time averaged recirculation zone it can be seen in figs 6 and 7 that the shapes of these velocity profiles are somewhat similar to those of a typical recirculation flow near a stationary cylinder as can be seen in fig 6 a close to the surface of the rotational oscillating cylinder at x d 1 0 the streamwise velocity profile u u 0 is negative with the minimum velocity at the center of the time averaged recirculation zone along the axis of symmetry at y d 0 when α 180 o as y d increases in both the positive and negative vertical directions the streamwise velocity u u 0 approaches zero and exceeds unity at a distance far away from the time averaged recirculation zone for most of the cases the maximum value of u u 0 approaches to 1 6 at α 360 for the cases of 180 o α 360 o no negative values of u u 0 are observed since there is the non existence of reverse flow in the lee of the rotational oscillating cylinder the values of u u 0 min are in the range of 0 24 to 0 28 for all α with an increase in the downstream distance x d 2 0 as shown in fig 6 b similar to the cases of 180 o α 360 o at x d 1 0 the streamwise velocity u u 0 is positive which indicates that there is no reverse flow in the lee of the rotational oscillating cylinder compared to the streamwise mean velocity the vertical mean velocity v u 0 shows greater variation with respect to the rotational angular amplitude α as can be seen in fig 7 the vertical mean velocity v u 0 distribution indicates that the distribution is antisymmetry about the wake axis y d 0 when the cylinder undergoes the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation the vertical mean velocity v u 0 becomes larger than that of the stationary cylinder it can be seen from fig 7 a that at the location near to the cylinder surface at x d 1 0 more rotational fluid will be involved as the rotational angular amplitude α increases therefore the vertical velocity v u 0 is increased the maximum value of v u 0 approaches 0 2 for α 180 at the location x d 1 0 and increases to 0 27 for α 360 at the downstream location x d 2 0 fig 8 shows the profiles of the dimensionless root mean square streamwise velocity u r m s u 0 as a function of the dimensionless vertical distance y d at different downstream locations x d 1 0 2 0 at a location close to the surface of rotational oscillating cylinder x d 1 0 the root mean square velocity u r m s u 0 exhibits an approximately m shaped profile with double peaks which are symmetrical about the wake centerline y d 0 for all the tested rotational angular amplitude α the double peak values of u r m s u 0 appear to be much larger for the cases of α 180 than those at α 180 and reaches a maximum value of 0 6 at α 180 which is in accordance with the largest scale of the instantaneous shear layers observed at α 180 the increase in u r m s u 0 with increasing α from 0 to 180 is probably due to the combined effect of rotational oscillation and lock in of the vortex shedding processes at the further downstream location x d 2 0 the irregular distributions of u r m s u 0 with respect to the rotational angular amplitudes α are observed which may be attributed to the complex interactions between the shed vortices and the entrainment fluids 3 4 turbulence characteristics as well known the reynolds stress is the component of the total stress tensor in a fluid to account for turbulent fluctuations in fluid momentum prandtl 1925 firstly gave a comprehensive explanation in the existence of reynolds stress where he proposed that reynolds stress reflects the net transport of momentum across a plane arising from the random movement of fluid particles in the presence of a mean shear due to the non constant of the mean velocity its difference between the initial and final locations of a particle correlates with the direction of travel a momentum flux and consequently reynolds stress is created bernard and handler 1990 bernard et al 1989a b explained the physics of reynolds stress from the analysis of particle paths in turbulent flow in the further study of bernard and handler 1990 the results showed that it is most natural to consider the reynolds stress as originating from two physical mechanisms encompassing the effects of displacement and acceleration of fluid particles however few investigations on the reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy tke have been carried out when the cylinder undergoes clockwise and anticlockwise rotation figs 9 and 10 present the contours of normalized reynolds shear stress u v u 0 2 and normalized turbulent kinetic energy k u 0 2 behind the rotational oscillating cylinder for different rotational oscillating angular amplitudes the solid and dashed lines represent positive and negative values respectively incremental values of the reynolds shear stress u v u 0 2 and tke is 0 005 and 0 03 respectively when the cylinder undergoes a clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating the reynolds shear stress contour appear different compared to the case of non rotational oscillating cylinder and accompanied by asymmetrical distribution with respect to the wake axis y d 0 and significant difference in magnitude of u v u 0 2 for most of the rotational angular amplitude α the maximum magnitude of the reynolds shear stresses u v u 0 2 are observed at the upper side of the cylinder except for the cases of α 90 270 where the maximum magnitude are observed at the lower side of the cylinder note that the magnitude of u v u 0 2 is significantly different at different rotational angular amplitudes the minimum magnitude of u v u 0 2 is about 0 02 at α 150 while the maximum magnitude of u v u 0 2 appears at α 180 with a value of 0 18 nine times of the observed minimum magnitude moreover the location of maximum value of u v u 0 2 appears to have moved towards the cylinder surface when α 180 with reference to the reynolds shear stress contours it can be seen that the width of positive and negative reynolds shear stress contours behind the rotational oscillating cylinder is enlarged as the angular amplitude increases in the tke contours as shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the maximum normalized tke value approaches to the value of 0 59 when α is increased to 180 and then decreases to the value of 0 23 on further increase of α to 360 it is interesting to note that both the maximum values and scales of the tke contours at 0 α 180 appear to be smaller than those at the range of 180 α 360 the smallest scale of the tke contour is occurred at small rotational angular amplitude α 30 the distribution of the tke contours behaves asymmetrically about the centerline where a larger value of the tke contour is almost appeared at the upper side of the rotational oscillating cylinder except for the cases of α 300 and 360 compared to the cases of 180 α 360 when α increases to 360 the scale of the tke contour decreases significantly 4 conclusions the wake structures behind a circular cylinder undergoing clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating have been investigated at the lock on frequency ratio f r 1 0 by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the effects of forcing rotational angular amplitude α on the near wake are observed and interpreted based on the patterns of instantaneous vorticity as well as the time average streamline topology mean velocity distributions and reynolds shear stress contours the conclusions are presented as followed 1 the forcing rotational angular amplitude α plays an important role in the instantaneous wake flow structures different vortex shedding modes are observed with variations of rotational angular amplitude i a 2s wake mode at α 30 90 150 240 270 300 ii a p s mode at α 120 180 iii a wake mode between 2s and p s mode at 60 210 and 330 iv double row vortex shedding mode at α 360 2 with α 0 the flow behavior behind the clockwise and counterclockwise rotational oscillating cylinder is significantly modified resulting in asymmetrical distribution of the streamline structures and shows significantly different in the magnitude of normalized reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy 3 the time averaged recirculation zone disappears when the rotational angular amplitude α increases to 180 for 180 α 330 the time averaged streamlines are characterized by depicting a pattern similar to that of ideal flow past a cylinder and without recirculation zone acknowledgements this research was

23381,maritime transportation poses risks regarding possible accidents resulting in damage to vessels crew members and to the ecosystem the safe navigation of ships especially in the arctic waters is a growing concern to maritime authorities this study proposes a new risk model applicable to the northern sea route nsr to investigate the possibility of marine accidents such as collision foundering and grounding the model is developed using bayesian network bn the proposed risk model has considered different operational and environmental factors that affect shipping operations historical data and expert judgments are used to estimate the base value prior values of various operational and environmental factors the application of the model is demonstrated through a case study of an oil tanker navigating the nsr the case study confirms the highest collision foundering and grounding probabilities in the east siberian sea however foundering probabilities are very low in all five regions by running uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the model a significant change in the likelihood of the occurrence of accidental events is identified the model suggests ice effect as a dominant factor in accident causation the case study illustrates the priority of the model in investigating the operational risk of accidents the estimated risk provides early warning to take appropriate preventive and mitigative measures to enhance the overall safety of shipping operations keywords accident modelling bayesian network arctic transportation northern sea route 1 introduction the vast seaborne trade has permitted an enormous variety of resources to be widely accessible around the world and has thus helped accelerate the world economy more than 90 of global trade is carried out via sea routes imo 2012 as it is cost effective the northern transport corridor known as the northern sea route nsr in the arctic region is one of the potential trade routes connecting major asian and european ports the opening of the nsr has reduced shipping distances and fuel consumption as well as emissions kitagawa 2008 according to schøyen and bråthen 2011 the distance between a northwest european port and the far east is reduced approximately 40 by using the nsr as an alternative route compared to the traditional route through the suez canal the presence of sea ice extremely low temperatures and drifting icebergs has made this region mostly inaccessible for marine transportation and poses threats to mariners and the current ship technologies ellis and brigham 2009 as the size and number of ships have increased significantly over time toffoli et al 2005 the possibility of shipping accidents in this region is expected to grow balto 2014 borgerson 2008 previous studies confirm that increasing traffic of oil tankers in the barents sea will result in a significant number of accidents if further maritime safety measures are not attained nme 2011 a combination of accidental events and processes are recognised as the leading contributors to ship accidents yang et al 2013 human factors such as human error and visibility are identified as significant contributors to vessel collisions fowler and sørgård 2000 khan et al 2017 macrae 2009 merrick et al 2000 van dorp et al 2001 zhang and thai 2016 additionally human fatigue lack of technical knowledge of ship systems poor communication faulty policies practices and standards are significant human related issues facing the maritime industry dhillon 2007 talley 2002 the safe navigation of ships especially in the arctic waters is of ultimate concern for researchers as well as maritime authorities risk assessment on maritime transportation and risk reduction measures are a part of ongoing studies however limited research has been conducted on the effect of both cold and harsh environmental conditions on shipping accidents in this region this paper proposes a new risk model applicable to the nsr considering the particular environmental and operational conditions to quantify the risk of transit on arctic routes 1 1 literature review regarding existing accident models in maritime risk and consequence assessment several methods have been applied to estimate the causation probability among the ship accidents collision has been the focus of many related studies in recent years fujii and shiobara 1971 introduced one of the most common approaches to estimate the number of ship collisions where the number of collisions is calculated as a product of the number of geometrical collision candidates and a causation probability macduff 1974 initially proposed a ship collision and grounding modelling based on available historical accident records however it lacked a clear understanding of accident causes risk analysis tools such as fault trees are developed to estimate the causation probability of collision event abbassi et al 2017 pedersen 1995 rosqvist et al 2002 marine accident risk calculation system marcs is also developed based on fault tree analysis while considering major shipping accidents such as collisions powered grounding drift grounding foundering and fire and explosions by fowler and sørgård 2000 danish institution cowi 2008 proposed formal safety assessment fsa methodology for sea traffic taking into account collisions and groundings martins and maturana 2010 applied fault tree analysis to assess the collision and grounding probability using fsa method zaman et al 2014 estimated the risk of collision in the malacca strait using the fsa approach merrick et al 2000 developed a probabilistic risk assessment pra technique considering expert judgment to assess the accident risk in the prince william sound van dorp et al 2001 developed maritime accident event chain which included collision grounding and fire explosion using the available data combining with expert judgment montewka et al 2010 proposed a geometrical model to assess the likelihood of ship collisions a collision probability model based on monte carlo simulation technique was developed by goerlandt and kujala 2011 later it was used in evaluating the risk of tanker collisions in the gulf of finland goerlandt et al 2011 a probabilistic approach was proposed to assess the risk and sustainability associated with ship collision by dong and frangopol 2014 goerlandt et al 2015 developed a ship collision alert system to measure ship collision risk based on fuzzy approach and expert elicitation banda et al 2015 visualised the accident risks through a hazard identification model in the finnish swedish winter navigation system sormunen et al 2015 investigated chemical tanker collision as a case study by taking into account data uncertainties montewka et al 2014 proposed bn framework for ship ship collisions in the open sea evaluated the probabilities of these events and finally determined the severity of a collision goerlandt and montewka 2015 developed a bayesian network model and applied it to a case study of the oil spill from a tanker to quantify the risk mazaheri et al 2016 proposed an evidence based and expert supported bayesian belief networks bbns for assessing the probability of ship grounding accidents fu et al 2016 developed a causal probabilistic model to predict the probability of a ship stuck in ice in the arctic waters using the bbns in this causal model a set of input parameters such as hydro meteorological conditions air temperature ice concentration ice thickness sea temperature wave height and wind speed along the analysed route were considered khan et al 2017 proposed an object oriented bayesian network oobn model to predict ship ice collision probability considering navigational operating and human factors 1 2 discussion on existing accident models most of the studies discussed above focused on a single accident dong and frangopol 2014 fu et al 2016 fujii and shiobara 1971 goerlandt and kujala 2011 goerlandt and montewka 2015 khan et al 2017 mazaheri et al 2016 montewka et al 2010 2014 pedersen 1995 rosqvist et al 2002 sormunen et al 2015 zaman et al 2014 or combined ship accidents banda et al 2015 cowi 2008 fowler and sørgård 2000 macduff 1974 martins and maturana 2010 merrick et al 2000 van dorp et al 2001 and modelling individual or integrated of different types of accidents in maritime traffic however integrated accident models based on different types of accidents for the nsr are quite limited recorded data of wave height and wind speed for the nsr are never considered in the literature or accident analysis thus conventional ship accident models developed for arctic regions may not address the integrated accident events such as ice ship collision foundering and grounding simultaneously considering recorded data of five sea states the conventional risk analysis approaches are commonly adopted to identify the propagation of primary causes that may lead to the potential accident consequences in the quantitative risk analysis fault tree is used to estimate the probabilities of possible causes of an event and event tree is used to model potential consequences of that event meel and seider 2006 additionally fault trees may be used to find the logical relationship between the primary causes and the potential consequences however in this study bns are favoured over fault tree analysis due to advantages such as conditional dependency between primary causes and consequences common cause issues between the linked nodes the addition of new accident prior probability as well as updating the real time posterior probability in the model the advantage of the integrated method is its capability to predict the particular accident considering the environmental and operational factors this helps to define the accident according to the existing conditions and to take the appropriate mitigative measures to decrease the consequences in advance which enhances overall reliability of the shipping operations in reality it is possible to have an ice ship or ship ship collision which may lead to a ship sinking ship grounding on the ice may lead to damage to the ship s hull and result in a capsizing accident however in the proposed model latter impact of collision or grounding is not considered with only the causes behind the collision foundering and grounding and the individual accident probabilities considered the aim is to show the likelihood of each accident considering most possible causes it is possible to connect arcs between accident events and show further impact due to those accidents the present study aims to develop a novel methodology by using the bn to represent different potential accident scenarios considering the particular environmental and operational conditions to quantify the risk of transit on arctic routes using bns the probabilities of three possible accident types on arctic routes are quantified based on primary causes and their associated probabilities the methodology relies on historical data and expert judgments in the estimation of the probability distributions of primary events the primary objective is to reduce the risk of environmental damage to a minimal level caused by ship collisions while continuously striving to further reduce the risk three different accident scenarios that are likely to occur during arctic transit are studied a case study which exemplifies the application of the developed methodology is also presented 2 bayesian networks a bn is a specific type of graphical model that is represented as a directed acyclic graph where the nodes represent random variables and directed arcs imply local conditional dependencies between parent and child nodes ghahramani 1998 jensen and nielsen 2007 mihajlovic and petkovic 2001 neapolitan 2003 pearl 1988 in bn the network structure the graph can be observed as a qualitative part of the model whereas the probability parameters add a quantitative extent to the model darwiche 2009 the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables u a 1 a n based on the conditional independence and the chain rule pearl 1988 is included in the network as 1 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where p u denotes the joint probability distribution of variables and pa a i as the parent set of variable a i accordingly the probability of a i is calculated as 2 p a i u a i p u where the summation is taken over all the variables except a i a simple bn with a set of dependent random variables a i is illustrated in fig 1 and the corresponding joint probability distribution as p a 1 a 2 a 3 p a 1 p a 2 a 1 p a 3 a 1 a 2 bayes theorem is used in the bn to update the occurrence probability prior of events given new observations called evidence e to yield the consequence probability posterior using the following equation 3 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e bns are favoured over conventional probabilistic techniques as they offer advantages such as i bn can be used to model accident scenarios and determine the probabilities of different scenarios using accident prior information ii bn considers the dependency and conditionality of the primary causes and consequences jensen and nielsen 2007 iii the accident information can be updated at any time using the real system data and iv adding a new piece of information in bn requires only a small number of directed edges in addition to a small number of probabilities pearl 1988 bn is a promising method for risk analysis of large and complex systems due to its flexible structure and probabilistic reasoning engine khakzad et al 2013 for example hänninen and kujala 2012 evaluated the ship ship collision causation model which consists of 100 nodes and 179 links the application of bn to quantitative risk analysis of offshore drilling operations and marine and offshore accident analysis has previously been discussed by researchers baksh et al 2015 2016 2017 hänninen and kujala 2012 khan et al 2017 li et al 2012 mazaheri et al 2016 montewka et al 2014 zhang and thai 2016 zhang et al 2016 bn model is established based on unwanted events by addressing potential primary causes leading to the unwanted events ship collision foundering and grounding in this study and exploring the possible consequences resulting from the unwanted event 3 proposed methodology for ship accidents in harsh environments in this study a bn reasoning process has been developed to provide a natural framework for maritime risk analysis in arctic transit a flowchart of the proposed approach is shown in fig 2 to ensure a step by step systematic process the entire methodology consists of four steps genie is used as the robust bn programming environment for the risk modelling and its probability calculations a brief explanation of each step of the modelling process is given in the following paragraphs step 1 this step heavily relies on historical data and subject matter experts smes judgments from the potential sources such as databases tests experiments simulations networks and analytical models fowler and sørgård 2000 fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 tabri et al 2009 any observed data that is available from a specific scenario can be used to update or refine the estimates of previous accident data in this way uncertainties and limitations can be reduced in respect of new data or smes judgement step 2 in this step of the process the potential accident scenarios e g collision foundering and grounding and associated consequences that can occur in a harsh environment are identified for example grounding may occur due to a failure of any of the sub events e g harsh weather effect the faults of vessels navigation failures visibility issues and tug assistance failure further sub events such as the fault of the vessel itself can be defined as anchor failure loss of power in the danger area or loss of propulsion of the vessel step 3 in this step in constructing the bn the graphical representation is crucial as it indicates the relevant variables nodes and dependencies arcs it helps to determine the level of detail that needs to be used in subsequent models also it provides the reasoning for analysing and communicating causal assumptions which is not easy to express using standard mathematical notation pearl 2000 for example if there are two events a and b a as a cause event and b as an effect event these two events can be labelled and mapped into the network an arc can be placed between an influencing node parent and an influenced node child to determine influence relationships between these nodes eleye datubo et al 2006 the terminating arrow of the arcs can be set to point to the child nodes step 4 in this step a set of input parameters based on environmental and operational conditions are assigned the bn is used to show the causal relationship between the linked nodes the bayesian inference consists of computing the conditional probabilities with the bn that is to specify the states for each child node and input values for parent nodes in a conditional probability table cpt prior evidence can be entered into the model by manually setting probabilities in the network the bayesian inference is enabled via the bayes formula once the prior information is provided in the directed graph the entered evidence propagates in both directions the updating belief is computed after prior evidence is entered to improve the prior knowledge and thus the prior probability values are updated by calculating posterior probabilities at any part of the analysis if it is required to see the contribution of different factors in the causation of an accident backward analysis can be considered regarding newly available data the calculated posterior probabilities can be considered as the new prior probabilities for future risk assessment bn simulation software genie is used to estimate the posterior probabilities as well as updating the prior knowledge 3 1 accident probability analysis scenario based modelling in this accident scenario modelling the collision of a ship with arctic ice during arctic transits has been taken into consideration the characteristics of arctic transits and environments are different and unique compared to local waterways therefore particular factors might have a significant influence on the risk associated with marine navigation in the arctic waters such as pack ice effect environmental obstacles the combined effect of wind and wave and emergency assistance however detailed investigations of arctic routes are out of the scope of the present study most vessels sailing through the nsr will require icebreaker escort abs 2014 in this accident scenario it is anticipated that an icebreaker escorts a ship by making channels in the ice the failure of the icebreaker to remove ice may lead to an ice ship collision as the traffic on the nsr may increase in future decades another marine vessel s fault can be considered in ship to ship collision scenarios different consequences can take place regarding a ship collision if it is an oil tanker the breach in the vessel s hull can propagate a massive spill of hydrocarbons into the sea with the impact being significant damage to the marine environment economic losses as well as a costly recovering process dave and ghaly 2011 goerlandt et al 2012 the release of hydrocarbons may subsequently lead to different credible accidents such as vapour cloud explosion vce and pool fire assael and kakosimos 2010 baksh et al 2016 2017 ccps 1994 crowl 2010 the consequences are inevitable and may cause many fatalities and the loss of the entire vessel if the release of hydrocarbons and fire cannot be controlled and extinguished promptly dave and ghaly 2011 in harsh and cold environments emergency responses and evacuation procedures are always challenging for rescue vessels and the crews as they may be delayed due to maneuvering through ice covered waters verny and grigentin 2009 these factors may also lead to severe consequences on arctic routes and need to be considered in the consequent analysis of ship accidents due to the potential consequences caused by the cold and harsh environment it is vital to identify the future risk of ship collision with regards to the increase in ship traffic in this region balto 2014 the geographical map of the northern transport corridor in the arctic region is taken from the arctic portal arctic portal 2017 with the route through five seas drawn with a dotted line as illustrated in fig 3 3 2 dynamic ice ship accident modelling on the nsr dynamic risk assessment method takes advantage of case scenario data and updating mechanisms to reassess the risk regarding new information khakzad et al 2012 in bayesian updating approach new data are employed in the form of likelihood functions to update prior probabilities using bayes theorem kalantarnia et al 2009 kanes et al 2017 kelly 2011 meel and seider 2006 in this present work a dynamic risk based model is developed to analyse shipping accidents on the nsr and reduce the risk of accidents the model is capable of updating the results whenever new evidence is available during the operation although the time slice is not considered within the model the observations e g new data however can be a function of time the proposed model will estimate the collision foundering and grounding probability considering harsh environmental conditions and would be suitable for arctic region transits in the proposed model a ship collision with ice in the arctic region plays a central role however it is recognised that accident type such as ship foundering and grounding also has the potential to take place therefore while the development of ship collision model is in progress two other accident types viz foundering and grounding are also taken into consideration a digital chart error leads the uss guardian to misplace the actual location of a reef by about eight nautical miles and resulted in grounding on that reef in the philippines couttie 2013 however no evidence has been found of ship grounding due to digital chart error in the arctic region this factor is considered due to the uss guardian tragedy quantitative risk analysis of a ship accident requires historical data or expert judgment in case of missing or limited historical data to estimate the probabilities of events the expert judgment is considered lindhe et al 2009 smes judgement is utilised where no data are available for a particular type of accident nor the causes of that accident in the developed model three random variables represent ship accidents such as collision foundering and grounding ship collision is directly indirectly influenced by twenty primary nodes and twelve intermediate nodes similarly foundering and grounding of a ship are also influenced by seventeen and twenty two primary nodes respectively these primary nodes are used as input information for the intermediate nodes where given probable causes for ship accident the likelihood of a collision foundering and grounding are modelled the impact of sea wave height wind speed and pack ice effect are highly seasonal affecting both navigation and ship transit this effect can differ in summer or winter in winter icebreakers prepare the narrow channels in arctic transit which helps the ship to navigate and hence icebreakers impact on ship collision frequency in the developed model twelve wave states e g s wv1 s wv2 s wv3 and s wv12 are considered which define the wave heights between 0 and 2 m and are profoundly influenced by the wind for the wind the first eleven states e g s wd1 s wd2 s wd3 and s wd11 are considered to be between 0 and 28 m s as per beaufort scale for example in the summer season if the wind speed is in state 6 8 0 10 7 m s which is considered as a fresh breeze the wave height can be in any state s wv1 s wv12 for that season similarly during winter december to february the nsr can be frozen and therefore high waves on the sea are very unusual the bmt argoss uk provided the recorded data for different wave height h s and wind state u 10 10 m above sea level for the period january 1979 to december 2015 at 3 hourly time intervals bmt argoss 1979 2015 different wind speed and pack ice together can make for dangerous icing conditions however in comparison to sea wave height and wind speed icing condition may require a longer time to change from its original state according to the meteorological institute icing from sea spray will occur at temperatures below 2 c and with wind speeds more than 11 m s due to the slower formation of sea spray icing and rare changing conditions different types of pack ice such as very close pack ice close pack ice open pack ice and very open pack ice respectively can be observed ocimf 2014 the detailed characteristics of the sea ice types have been discussed by previous researchers balto 2014 bourke and garrett 1987 kum and sahin 2015 ocimf 2014 thelma 2010 zakrzewski 1986 in this study bns are used to synthesise expert judgment and recorded data obtained from previous research to perform the integrated analysis the bn is constructed by primary and intermediate nodes with connected arcs these nodes have two states only each with some probability for instance ice breakers failure can be yes or no and the probability of the yes or no can be determined by historical statistical data the intermediate nodes are affected by associated primary causes for instance the intermediate node visibility issues can be affected by the node human factor failure radar failure and environmental obstacles taking advantage of the bn an unwanted event e g collision foundering or grounding is defined and then decomposed to determine its environmental and operational events the developed bns for ship collision foundering and grounding accident scenarios are illustrated in section 4 1 4 application of the methodology case study the application of the proposed method is applied to a case study of a ship collision navigating on the nsr to estimate the accident probability the extreme temperature pack ice and multi year sea ice effect and severe climate changes are some of the drawbacks of this region kassens 1994 melling 2002 ocimf 2014 thelma 2010 usa 1988 zakrzewski 1986 these areas are entirely covered with ice during winter and partly covered in summer according to johannessen et al 1997 the presence of multi year ice on the nsr creates a dangerous environment for marine operations which subsequently necessitates a more comprehensive method and study to investigate navigational risk and challenges in the harsh and cold environments through the nsr in the following sections the application of the proposed methodology is applied to a case study of a ship collision navigating through the nsr 4 1 the nsr economic viabilities and the associated risk the soviet union developed the nsr shipping route as a major national waterway which has a history of 1306 voyages completed by 331 vessels in 1987 ellis and brigham 2009 in recent years the arctic ocean has become the dominant hotspot due to its natural resources shorter navigational routes and pirate free zone fossil fuel is a major attraction in europe to manage the increasing demand for energy a combined initiative between the nsr and the european explorer is undergoing the extraction of fossil fuel in the barents sea the kara sea and the yamal peninsula pastusiak 2016 peresypkin and yakovlev 2008 another growing interest in the eastern region of the nsr for east asian countries such as japan and china is the transport of fossil fuel to meet its energy demand pastusiak 2016 an experimental voyage between yokohama and kirkenes in 1995 proved the nsr to be a cost effective route compared to the suez and panama canals shortening the travel time by 15 days and reducing transportation costs by up to 500 000 pastusiak 2016 the nsr would connect the ports of north asia japan south korea and china and north western europe hamburg bremen and rotterdam and shorten the journey length by about 2500 nautical miles verny and grigentin 2009 after opening a new container terminal for europe and asia cargo shipping increased on the nsr after 2010 exceeding 3 87 million tonnes of cargo in 2012 and expecting a future increase to more than 5 0 million tons by 2019 lammers 2010 pastusiak 2016 polovinkin and fomichev 2012 according to the arctic marine shipping assessment amsa 2009 report the estimated volume of oil and gas transportation on the nsr is expected to be about 40 million tons per year by 2020 ellis and brigham 2009 more economic aspects of arctic transportation can be found in the literature ellis and brigham 2009 hong 2012 lasserre and pelletier 2011 pastusiak 2016 the nsr consists of the ship sailing routes between the bering strait in the east and the barents sea in the west johannessen et al 2007 it connects north western europe and north eastern asia and is considered the shortest sailing route the nsr is divided into five regions identified as the chukchi sea east siberian sea laptev sea kara sea and the barents sea according to a 50 year series of data from polar stations in these regions and visual observations in open sea areas it has been observed that ice formation begins in late august in the northern east siberian sea whereas young ice formation starts in the first ten days of september north of the kara and laptev seas johannessen et al 2007 according to johannessen et al 2007 young ice appears at the end of the second 10 days of september north of the chukchi and the barents seas zakharov 1997 presents an estimate of the average ice area in the nsr regions during march and september as described in table 1 on average within 35 40 days the laptev and east siberian seas are entirely covered by young ice whereas it takes about 80 85 days for the kara and chukchi seas johannessen et al 2007 the chukchi sea has an area of 6 20e05 km2 with an average depth of 80 m and is considered as the only route from the pacific to the arctic according to table 1 an average area of 5 95e 01 million km2 of the chukchi sea is ice covered in march and 1 96e 01 million km2 in september according to anderson et al 2011 the east siberian sea has a surface area of 8 95e05 km2 with a mean depth of 52 m which is the shallowest amongst the seas on the nsr harsh environment remote areas and unexplored maritime areas are some of the characteristics of this region that create challenges for navigational purposes münchow et al 1999 during the winter season the mean temperature is 30 c mulherin et al 1994 and the entire area is ice covered however during summer 50 of the ice remains according to the amsa 2009 report the entire coastal region along the eastern nsr becomes shallow for all marine operations due to the average depth of the chukchi sea and east siberian sea ellis and brigham 2009 the laptev sea has an area of 6 50e05 km2 the average wind speed above the sea surface water is 5 m s and storms occur in the sea three to four times a month also fog is frequent in this region and the humidity varies between 95 and 98 fofonova 2012 the kara sea has the second highest surface area of 8 80e05 km2 along the nsr with a mean depth of 110 m galimov et al 2006 the barents sea has the smallest surface area of 1 40e06 km2 with a mean depth of 230 m sakshaug 1997 smedsrud et al 2010 the winter is considered to be december to february in the barents sea when sea ice is relatively thin compared to other regions of the arctic ocean according to a report by thelma 2010 in extreme conditions spray and mist can build up four centimetres of ice per hour on the surface of a device in the northern barents sea the summer season provides an excellent opportunity for marine transportation as the entire barents sea becomes ice free sakshaug 1997 maritime transportation poses risks regarding possible accidents resulting in loss of life and ship s cargo as well as detrimental impacts on the marine environment the accidents on the nsr are comparatively lower than some other regions the amsa 2009 report highlighted incidents and accidents which occurred in the arctic region between 1995 and 2004 according to the report 293 vessels of different categories were engaged in several accidents including 22 collisions 68 groundings and 54 damages to the vessel ellis and brigham 2009 marine accident investigation branch maib recorded 65 incidents accidents between 1993 and 2011 in the arctic region kum and sahin 2015 however only four collisions and four groundings were reported to the maib compared to 22 collisions and 68 groundings kum and sahin 2015 according to safety and shipping review 2014 there were about seven casualties groundings in the arctic region review 2014 another safety and shipping review in 2016 reported 71 shipping incidents in the arctic waters during 2015 review 2016 growing traffic in the arctic region may increase the risk of ship operations 4 2 accident scenario analysis the cold and harsh environmental conditions have made the arctic waters mostly inaccessible as a shipping route various factors that can affect the ship s navigation as well as human performance in emergency situations such as wave height wind speed sea current surrounding temperature harsh weather effect and different level of ice along the nsr route are taken into consideration however there are some variations between the values of the environmental factors being identified until today no particular factors have been considered to divide the nsr into different regions hence this route is divided based on the five different seas the chukchi sea east siberian sea laptev sea the kara sea and the barents sea respectively in this accident scenario analysis the collision foundering and grounding probabilities of an oil tanker and the primary causes of these consequences are adopted from previous literature antão and soares 2006 emsa 2009 noroozi et al 2014 trucco et al 2008 uğurlu et al 2015 yeo et al 2016 on ship accident modelling in normal conditions smes are being considered if the probability of primary causes specific to arctic environments is not available the severe climate in arctic regions requires experts to re evaluate the previous ship accident scenarios when defining the probabilities of the primary causes in this study the five experts who have more than ten years of research and industry experience in shipping operations on deck and are familiar with the arctic routes environment have been selected to assign the probabilities of the root causes these experts were male and aged between 35 and 65 the average age being 51 6 all the experts have their bachelor bsc and master msc degrees in maritime related fields two experts were working as a master two as chief officer and one as second officer in canadian transport agency with little or no knowledge of assessment of probabilities all experts were canadian and spoke fluent english these experts were engaged in defining the probability distributions of primary events for each region the average is the arithmetic mean value for the primary events the corresponding mean values of probabilities for each primary event for each specific region on the nsr are presented in table 2 in this study most of the input data for the bn analysis in each particular region is received from experts based on the prior event probabilities assigned by the smes human error effect on the detection failure is recognised as one of the recurrent causal factors for marine ship collision previous research suggests that about 80 or more of such accidents involve human error related factors rothblum et al 2002 the cold temperature in a freezing environment can challenge the mariners which in turn may affect surveillance reaction times awareness and memory recall and physical strength enander 1987 hoffman 2002 hse 2017 khan et al 2017 macrae 2009 musharraf et al 2013 noroozi et al 2014 human factor failure x1 consists of a variety of sub groups of errors which can be intended or unintended action of a human these sub groups are defined as human performance influencing factors pifs hse 2017 for example interpretation failure fatigue sleeplessness alcohol abuse can be combined with a human factor failure uğurlu et al 2015 on the otherhand human error x20 is considered as an action or decision which was not intended hse 2017 it should be noted that both of these factors are considered as human errors in many available literature however to differentiate these factors in the developed bn human error is considered as a single action on failure to detect ice and iceberg using conventional marine radars and thermal imaging cameras while navigating on the nsr however considering all the pifs would make the accident modelling network complex enough to show the general applicability for the mariners instead integrating too many sub factors contributors to the accidents into the main factor the human error and the human factor are considered in the proposed model vessel s collision with pack ice and non detected ice is also considered as another significant factor by the experts in developing the model the present study is based on sea wave measurements from the nsr the measurements were obtained from bmt argoss uk in bmt argoss global wind and wave hindcast dataset are available on a grid of spatial resolution 0 5 by 0 5 the wind and wave parameters were recorded at each grid point at 3 hourly time intervals for the period january 1979 to december 2015 the recorded data provided by bmt argoss uk consists of significant wave height h s m zero crossing wave period t z s and wind speed measured at 10 m above the surface a sample of recorded data is shown in table 3 a wave is defined as the fraction of a record between two successive zero up crossings mhl 2016 in practice a zero up crossing wave period is considered to occur when the surface passes through the mean line in an upward direction tann 1976 it is the portion of the record between adjacent zero up crossings its height h is equal to the vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the wave zero crossing wave presented in fig 4 is adapted from mhl 2016 wave data are usually collected for approx 20 min on each 3rd or 6th hours assuming stable sea states skjong et al 1995 wave data can be obtained by visual observations from lighthouses merchant ships and weather ships however instrumental observations can be used such as wave buoys radars shipborne wave recorders sbwr lasers satellites and surface piercing instruments skjong et al 1995 wang et al 2015 according to the world meteorological organization wmo 1983 wave data accuracy requirements are 20 for significant wave height and 1 0s for the average wave period according to tann 1976 significant wave height h s is defined as the mean height of the highest third of the waves given 3n zero up crossing wave period the significant height is 4 h s 1 n h 2 n 1 h 3 n where the heights h 1 h 3n are arranged in increasing order crest to trough heights were used in early research the period of a zero up crossing wave is defined as the time interval between the two zero up crossings which bound it given a record of duration t minutes the mean zero up crossing period is defined as 5 t z t 60 no of zero up crossing waves on the record sec a set of wind and wave data total 105128 observations for the years january 1979 to december 2015 has been obtained based on observations at each grid point for the area of interest from bmt argoss linear contour plot in fig 5 is plotted using the recorded data from the observations of wave height h s m against wave period t z s for each sea the wave data of the barents sea is presented as a scatter diagram in table 4 the wind speed measured at 10 m above sea level for the barents sea is also displayed as a scatter diagram in table 5 the following equation is used to calculate the probability of significant wave height p h s and wind speed p u 10 6 p h s number of wave height occurred in each level e g 0 1 total number of wave height that occurred 7 p u 10 number of wind occurred in each level e g 0 1 total number of wind that occurred the probability distribution of significant wave height h s and wind speed u 10 for five seas along the nsr are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the probability distribution of significant wave height h s and wind speed u 10 for five seas along the nsr are presented in table 6 and table 7 respectively through a carefully constructed bn probability data can be incorporated to model the visibility issues system navigation error anchor failure and assistance failure the combined effect of different kinds of ice in arctic water is recognised as one of the leading challenges for navigational purposes the bn diagram for the integrated model of ship collision foundering and grounding can be developed as illustrated in fig 8 4 3 accident probability analysis in this study the potential safety measures to mitigate accidents such as collision foundering and grounding and their consequences on the nsr are not considered the integrated model will help to predict the occurrence probability of any particular accident during ship navigation on the nsr different environmental and operational conditions based on case specific scenarios are identified and considered as primary causes by applying prior probabilities to these primary causes in the developed model it is possible to identify most probable accidents that may occur in that region the results presented in this section are obtained by using the bn model illustrated in fig 8 the bn analysis demonstrates the highest collision foundering and grounding probabilities to be in region 2 east siberian sea which are 3 31e 03 1 34e 05 and 1 37e 03 respectively table 8 similarly region 5 barents sea has the lowest probability regarding collision 1 30e 04 and foundering 3 11e 07 events region 1 chukchi sea represents the lowest probability 9 30e 04 regarding grounding event however due to extreme wind and wave effects collision probability is almost similar in all five seas and foundering probability is higher in region 1 chukchi sea likewise the likelihood of grounding event is higher in region 2 east siberian sea a comparison of collision probabilities in extreme and normal condition is presented in table 9 4 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity of the bn to some of the most critical variables from table 9 it can be seen that a significant change to collision probabilities on the nsr is noticed due to extreme weather condition severe wind and wave effect therefore any increase or decrease in probabilities of wind and wave effect are not considered in this sensitivity analysis the main purpose of this study is to determine the factors that mainly contribute to the collision foundering or grounding scenarios therefore for each of the accidental events a variation to each of the nodes that presented a higher contribution to the probability of the main event was changed systematically from the analysis it can be seen that a significant change in the probability of each node can make a difference to the probabilities of collision foundering and grounding a 10 increase in the initial probability of each node can make significant changes to the corresponding accident probability for collision events the changes take place for most of the nodes similar results occurred when each of the node probabilities is decreased by the same magnitude for example an increase of 10 in the probability of pack ice effect non detected multi layer ice and environmental obstacles made changes of 1 61 0 15 and 0 13 in collision probability respectively the results of the variation of the probabilities of the collision events when changing each of the initial node probabilities chukchi sea are presented in fig 9 based on the sensitivity analysis we have ranked the major causes of the collision events in the chukchi sea which is shown in table 10 from the table it has been shown that the failures of the pack ice effect non detected multi layer ice environmental obstacles digital chart error human factor failure radar failure and procedure failure impact significantly on ice ship collision in the chukchi sea the pack ice effect is more significant than the non detected multi layer ice in ice ship collision event 1 61 0 15 khan et al 2017 performed a sensitivity analysis for the risk factors involved in the ice oil tanker collision on the nsr and based on the analysis ranked environmental conditions at rank 3 severe environmental conditions are the result of high ice and rough weather states wu et al 2005 considered the logistics regression model to find determinants of the severity of fishing vessel incidents in the canadian water the sensitivity analysis from this model showed increasing severity due to wave height and ice concentration which can affect the stability and mobility of vessels adversely the above sensitivity analysis allows investigating causes of an ice ship collision in the chukchi sea by narrowing down major factors for the cases of foundering event the effect of pack ice is dominant compared to other accident causes with 0 011 besides increase or decrease of the initial probability of each node represents very little change in foundering probability in case of grounding if the probability of digital chart error is increased or decreased by 10 the probability of grounding will increase or decrease by 0 0035 for instance an increase from 9 30e 04 to 9 65e 04 besides digital chart error couttie 2013 other causes such as out of date map location navigator malfunction inappropriate route selection and procedure failure may play a more or less significant role in accident causation the above analysis leads to the conclusion that some of the nodes are highly dominant in all three types of accidents 5 conclusion the existing transportation accident models consider individual events and independent causation factors that may particularly lead to the accidents on the nsr however very often an accident is the outcome of non sequential events caused by combined effects of different factors usually accidents are time dependent concerning evolving environmental and operational factors this study focuses on developing a dynamic risk based model to analyse shipping accidents in the arctic waters to reduce the risk of accidents considering particular environmental and operational conditions the proposed method takes the advantages of case specific data and updating mechanisms to reassess the risk in the proposed model ship collisions with ice during navigation in arctic routes were considered other accident scenarios such as foundering and grounding were also considered due to the likelihood of their taking place application of the developed methodology is reliant on bn modelling due to the need for reassessing ship accident scenarios in arctic transits in different conditions the risk analysis revealed that the east siberian sea had the highest probabilities regarding collision foundering and grounding of the ship other regions such as chukchi laptev kara and the barents sea have almost similar probabilities regarding grounding however foundering probabilities are very low in all five areas the sensitivity analysis of collision foundering and grounding events also revealed that the developed model was sensitive to several environmental and operational conditions from the bn and subsequent sensitivity analysis it is clear that some of the root nodes are the dominant factors towards the accidental event this contribution is the highest for collision and foundering where an increase of the initial probability leads to a significant change in the probability of the occurrence of accidental events in the cases of grounding this effect is less significant the proposed approach can be helpful for decision makers and safety experts to estimate the probability of different types of marine ship accidents considering the factors most contributing to the existing environmental and operational conditions the developed methodology can be used to investigate the possibility of preventing and

23381,maritime transportation poses risks regarding possible accidents resulting in damage to vessels crew members and to the ecosystem the safe navigation of ships especially in the arctic waters is a growing concern to maritime authorities this study proposes a new risk model applicable to the northern sea route nsr to investigate the possibility of marine accidents such as collision foundering and grounding the model is developed using bayesian network bn the proposed risk model has considered different operational and environmental factors that affect shipping operations historical data and expert judgments are used to estimate the base value prior values of various operational and environmental factors the application of the model is demonstrated through a case study of an oil tanker navigating the nsr the case study confirms the highest collision foundering and grounding probabilities in the east siberian sea however foundering probabilities are very low in all five regions by running uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the model a significant change in the likelihood of the occurrence of accidental events is identified the model suggests ice effect as a dominant factor in accident causation the case study illustrates the priority of the model in investigating the operational risk of accidents the estimated risk provides early warning to take appropriate preventive and mitigative measures to enhance the overall safety of shipping operations keywords accident modelling bayesian network arctic transportation northern sea route 1 introduction the vast seaborne trade has permitted an enormous variety of resources to be widely accessible around the world and has thus helped accelerate the world economy more than 90 of global trade is carried out via sea routes imo 2012 as it is cost effective the northern transport corridor known as the northern sea route nsr in the arctic region is one of the potential trade routes connecting major asian and european ports the opening of the nsr has reduced shipping distances and fuel consumption as well as emissions kitagawa 2008 according to schøyen and bråthen 2011 the distance between a northwest european port and the far east is reduced approximately 40 by using the nsr as an alternative route compared to the traditional route through the suez canal the presence of sea ice extremely low temperatures and drifting icebergs has made this region mostly inaccessible for marine transportation and poses threats to mariners and the current ship technologies ellis and brigham 2009 as the size and number of ships have increased significantly over time toffoli et al 2005 the possibility of shipping accidents in this region is expected to grow balto 2014 borgerson 2008 previous studies confirm that increasing traffic of oil tankers in the barents sea will result in a significant number of accidents if further maritime safety measures are not attained nme 2011 a combination of accidental events and processes are recognised as the leading contributors to ship accidents yang et al 2013 human factors such as human error and visibility are identified as significant contributors to vessel collisions fowler and sørgård 2000 khan et al 2017 macrae 2009 merrick et al 2000 van dorp et al 2001 zhang and thai 2016 additionally human fatigue lack of technical knowledge of ship systems poor communication faulty policies practices and standards are significant human related issues facing the maritime industry dhillon 2007 talley 2002 the safe navigation of ships especially in the arctic waters is of ultimate concern for researchers as well as maritime authorities risk assessment on maritime transportation and risk reduction measures are a part of ongoing studies however limited research has been conducted on the effect of both cold and harsh environmental conditions on shipping accidents in this region this paper proposes a new risk model applicable to the nsr considering the particular environmental and operational conditions to quantify the risk of transit on arctic routes 1 1 literature review regarding existing accident models in maritime risk and consequence assessment several methods have been applied to estimate the causation probability among the ship accidents collision has been the focus of many related studies in recent years fujii and shiobara 1971 introduced one of the most common approaches to estimate the number of ship collisions where the number of collisions is calculated as a product of the number of geometrical collision candidates and a causation probability macduff 1974 initially proposed a ship collision and grounding modelling based on available historical accident records however it lacked a clear understanding of accident causes risk analysis tools such as fault trees are developed to estimate the causation probability of collision event abbassi et al 2017 pedersen 1995 rosqvist et al 2002 marine accident risk calculation system marcs is also developed based on fault tree analysis while considering major shipping accidents such as collisions powered grounding drift grounding foundering and fire and explosions by fowler and sørgård 2000 danish institution cowi 2008 proposed formal safety assessment fsa methodology for sea traffic taking into account collisions and groundings martins and maturana 2010 applied fault tree analysis to assess the collision and grounding probability using fsa method zaman et al 2014 estimated the risk of collision in the malacca strait using the fsa approach merrick et al 2000 developed a probabilistic risk assessment pra technique considering expert judgment to assess the accident risk in the prince william sound van dorp et al 2001 developed maritime accident event chain which included collision grounding and fire explosion using the available data combining with expert judgment montewka et al 2010 proposed a geometrical model to assess the likelihood of ship collisions a collision probability model based on monte carlo simulation technique was developed by goerlandt and kujala 2011 later it was used in evaluating the risk of tanker collisions in the gulf of finland goerlandt et al 2011 a probabilistic approach was proposed to assess the risk and sustainability associated with ship collision by dong and frangopol 2014 goerlandt et al 2015 developed a ship collision alert system to measure ship collision risk based on fuzzy approach and expert elicitation banda et al 2015 visualised the accident risks through a hazard identification model in the finnish swedish winter navigation system sormunen et al 2015 investigated chemical tanker collision as a case study by taking into account data uncertainties montewka et al 2014 proposed bn framework for ship ship collisions in the open sea evaluated the probabilities of these events and finally determined the severity of a collision goerlandt and montewka 2015 developed a bayesian network model and applied it to a case study of the oil spill from a tanker to quantify the risk mazaheri et al 2016 proposed an evidence based and expert supported bayesian belief networks bbns for assessing the probability of ship grounding accidents fu et al 2016 developed a causal probabilistic model to predict the probability of a ship stuck in ice in the arctic waters using the bbns in this causal model a set of input parameters such as hydro meteorological conditions air temperature ice concentration ice thickness sea temperature wave height and wind speed along the analysed route were considered khan et al 2017 proposed an object oriented bayesian network oobn model to predict ship ice collision probability considering navigational operating and human factors 1 2 discussion on existing accident models most of the studies discussed above focused on a single accident dong and frangopol 2014 fu et al 2016 fujii and shiobara 1971 goerlandt and kujala 2011 goerlandt and montewka 2015 khan et al 2017 mazaheri et al 2016 montewka et al 2010 2014 pedersen 1995 rosqvist et al 2002 sormunen et al 2015 zaman et al 2014 or combined ship accidents banda et al 2015 cowi 2008 fowler and sørgård 2000 macduff 1974 martins and maturana 2010 merrick et al 2000 van dorp et al 2001 and modelling individual or integrated of different types of accidents in maritime traffic however integrated accident models based on different types of accidents for the nsr are quite limited recorded data of wave height and wind speed for the nsr are never considered in the literature or accident analysis thus conventional ship accident models developed for arctic regions may not address the integrated accident events such as ice ship collision foundering and grounding simultaneously considering recorded data of five sea states the conventional risk analysis approaches are commonly adopted to identify the propagation of primary causes that may lead to the potential accident consequences in the quantitative risk analysis fault tree is used to estimate the probabilities of possible causes of an event and event tree is used to model potential consequences of that event meel and seider 2006 additionally fault trees may be used to find the logical relationship between the primary causes and the potential consequences however in this study bns are favoured over fault tree analysis due to advantages such as conditional dependency between primary causes and consequences common cause issues between the linked nodes the addition of new accident prior probability as well as updating the real time posterior probability in the model the advantage of the integrated method is its capability to predict the particular accident considering the environmental and operational factors this helps to define the accident according to the existing conditions and to take the appropriate mitigative measures to decrease the consequences in advance which enhances overall reliability of the shipping operations in reality it is possible to have an ice ship or ship ship collision which may lead to a ship sinking ship grounding on the ice may lead to damage to the ship s hull and result in a capsizing accident however in the proposed model latter impact of collision or grounding is not considered with only the causes behind the collision foundering and grounding and the individual accident probabilities considered the aim is to show the likelihood of each accident considering most possible causes it is possible to connect arcs between accident events and show further impact due to those accidents the present study aims to develop a novel methodology by using the bn to represent different potential accident scenarios considering the particular environmental and operational conditions to quantify the risk of transit on arctic routes using bns the probabilities of three possible accident types on arctic routes are quantified based on primary causes and their associated probabilities the methodology relies on historical data and expert judgments in the estimation of the probability distributions of primary events the primary objective is to reduce the risk of environmental damage to a minimal level caused by ship collisions while continuously striving to further reduce the risk three different accident scenarios that are likely to occur during arctic transit are studied a case study which exemplifies the application of the developed methodology is also presented 2 bayesian networks a bn is a specific type of graphical model that is represented as a directed acyclic graph where the nodes represent random variables and directed arcs imply local conditional dependencies between parent and child nodes ghahramani 1998 jensen and nielsen 2007 mihajlovic and petkovic 2001 neapolitan 2003 pearl 1988 in bn the network structure the graph can be observed as a qualitative part of the model whereas the probability parameters add a quantitative extent to the model darwiche 2009 the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables u a 1 a n based on the conditional independence and the chain rule pearl 1988 is included in the network as 1 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where p u denotes the joint probability distribution of variables and pa a i as the parent set of variable a i accordingly the probability of a i is calculated as 2 p a i u a i p u where the summation is taken over all the variables except a i a simple bn with a set of dependent random variables a i is illustrated in fig 1 and the corresponding joint probability distribution as p a 1 a 2 a 3 p a 1 p a 2 a 1 p a 3 a 1 a 2 bayes theorem is used in the bn to update the occurrence probability prior of events given new observations called evidence e to yield the consequence probability posterior using the following equation 3 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e bns are favoured over conventional probabilistic techniques as they offer advantages such as i bn can be used to model accident scenarios and determine the probabilities of different scenarios using accident prior information ii bn considers the dependency and conditionality of the primary causes and consequences jensen and nielsen 2007 iii the accident information can be updated at any time using the real system data and iv adding a new piece of information in bn requires only a small number of directed edges in addition to a small number of probabilities pearl 1988 bn is a promising method for risk analysis of large and complex systems due to its flexible structure and probabilistic reasoning engine khakzad et al 2013 for example hänninen and kujala 2012 evaluated the ship ship collision causation model which consists of 100 nodes and 179 links the application of bn to quantitative risk analysis of offshore drilling operations and marine and offshore accident analysis has previously been discussed by researchers baksh et al 2015 2016 2017 hänninen and kujala 2012 khan et al 2017 li et al 2012 mazaheri et al 2016 montewka et al 2014 zhang and thai 2016 zhang et al 2016 bn model is established based on unwanted events by addressing potential primary causes leading to the unwanted events ship collision foundering and grounding in this study and exploring the possible consequences resulting from the unwanted event 3 proposed methodology for ship accidents in harsh environments in this study a bn reasoning process has been developed to provide a natural framework for maritime risk analysis in arctic transit a flowchart of the proposed approach is shown in fig 2 to ensure a step by step systematic process the entire methodology consists of four steps genie is used as the robust bn programming environment for the risk modelling and its probability calculations a brief explanation of each step of the modelling process is given in the following paragraphs step 1 this step heavily relies on historical data and subject matter experts smes judgments from the potential sources such as databases tests experiments simulations networks and analytical models fowler and sørgård 2000 fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 tabri et al 2009 any observed data that is available from a specific scenario can be used to update or refine the estimates of previous accident data in this way uncertainties and limitations can be reduced in respect of new data or smes judgement step 2 in this step of the process the potential accident scenarios e g collision foundering and grounding and associated consequences that can occur in a harsh environment are identified for example grounding may occur due to a failure of any of the sub events e g harsh weather effect the faults of vessels navigation failures visibility issues and tug assistance failure further sub events such as the fault of the vessel itself can be defined as anchor failure loss of power in the danger area or loss of propulsion of the vessel step 3 in this step in constructing the bn the graphical representation is crucial as it indicates the relevant variables nodes and dependencies arcs it helps to determine the level of detail that needs to be used in subsequent models also it provides the reasoning for analysing and communicating causal assumptions which is not easy to express using standard mathematical notation pearl 2000 for example if there are two events a and b a as a cause event and b as an effect event these two events can be labelled and mapped into the network an arc can be placed between an influencing node parent and an influenced node child to determine influence relationships between these nodes eleye datubo et al 2006 the terminating arrow of the arcs can be set to point to the child nodes step 4 in this step a set of input parameters based on environmental and operational conditions are assigned the bn is used to show the causal relationship between the linked nodes the bayesian inference consists of computing the conditional probabilities with the bn that is to specify the states for each child node and input values for parent nodes in a conditional probability table cpt prior evidence can be entered into the model by manually setting probabilities in the network the bayesian inference is enabled via the bayes formula once the prior information is provided in the directed graph the entered evidence propagates in both directions the updating belief is computed after prior evidence is entered to improve the prior knowledge and thus the prior probability values are updated by calculating posterior probabilities at any part of the analysis if it is required to see the contribution of different factors in the causation of an accident backward analysis can be considered regarding newly available data the calculated posterior probabilities can be considered as the new prior probabilities for future risk assessment bn simulation software genie is used to estimate the posterior probabilities as well as updating the prior knowledge 3 1 accident probability analysis scenario based modelling in this accident scenario modelling the collision of a ship with arctic ice during arctic transits has been taken into consideration the characteristics of arctic transits and environments are different and unique compared to local waterways therefore particular factors might have a significant influence on the risk associated with marine navigation in the arctic waters such as pack ice effect environmental obstacles the combined effect of wind and wave and emergency assistance however detailed investigations of arctic routes are out of the scope of the present study most vessels sailing through the nsr will require icebreaker escort abs 2014 in this accident scenario it is anticipated that an icebreaker escorts a ship by making channels in the ice the failure of the icebreaker to remove ice may lead to an ice ship collision as the traffic on the nsr may increase in future decades another marine vessel s fault can be considered in ship to ship collision scenarios different consequences can take place regarding a ship collision if it is an oil tanker the breach in the vessel s hull can propagate a massive spill of hydrocarbons into the sea with the impact being significant damage to the marine environment economic losses as well as a costly recovering process dave and ghaly 2011 goerlandt et al 2012 the release of hydrocarbons may subsequently lead to different credible accidents such as vapour cloud explosion vce and pool fire assael and kakosimos 2010 baksh et al 2016 2017 ccps 1994 crowl 2010 the consequences are inevitable and may cause many fatalities and the loss of the entire vessel if the release of hydrocarbons and fire cannot be controlled and extinguished promptly dave and ghaly 2011 in harsh and cold environments emergency responses and evacuation procedures are always challenging for rescue vessels and the crews as they may be delayed due to maneuvering through ice covered waters verny and grigentin 2009 these factors may also lead to severe consequences on arctic routes and need to be considered in the consequent analysis of ship accidents due to the potential consequences caused by the cold and harsh environment it is vital to identify the future risk of ship collision with regards to the increase in ship traffic in this region balto 2014 the geographical map of the northern transport corridor in the arctic region is taken from the arctic portal arctic portal 2017 with the route through five seas drawn with a dotted line as illustrated in fig 3 3 2 dynamic ice ship accident modelling on the nsr dynamic risk assessment method takes advantage of case scenario data and updating mechanisms to reassess the risk regarding new information khakzad et al 2012 in bayesian updating approach new data are employed in the form of likelihood functions to update prior probabilities using bayes theorem kalantarnia et al 2009 kanes et al 2017 kelly 2011 meel and seider 2006 in this present work a dynamic risk based model is developed to analyse shipping accidents on the nsr and reduce the risk of accidents the model is capable of updating the results whenever new evidence is available during the operation although the time slice is not considered within the model the observations e g new data however can be a function of time the proposed model will estimate the collision foundering and grounding probability considering harsh environmental conditions and would be suitable for arctic region transits in the proposed model a ship collision with ice in the arctic region plays a central role however it is recognised that accident type such as ship foundering and grounding also has the potential to take place therefore while the development of ship collision model is in progress two other accident types viz foundering and grounding are also taken into consideration a digital chart error leads the uss guardian to misplace the actual location of a reef by about eight nautical miles and resulted in grounding on that reef in the philippines couttie 2013 however no evidence has been found of ship grounding due to digital chart error in the arctic region this factor is considered due to the uss guardian tragedy quantitative risk analysis of a ship accident requires historical data or expert judgment in case of missing or limited historical data to estimate the probabilities of events the expert judgment is considered lindhe et al 2009 smes judgement is utilised where no data are available for a particular type of accident nor the causes of that accident in the developed model three random variables represent ship accidents such as collision foundering and grounding ship collision is directly indirectly influenced by twenty primary nodes and twelve intermediate nodes similarly foundering and grounding of a ship are also influenced by seventeen and twenty two primary nodes respectively these primary nodes are used as input information for the intermediate nodes where given probable causes for ship accident the likelihood of a collision foundering and grounding are modelled the impact of sea wave height wind speed and pack ice effect are highly seasonal affecting both navigation and ship transit this effect can differ in summer or winter in winter icebreakers prepare the narrow channels in arctic transit which helps the ship to navigate and hence icebreakers impact on ship collision frequency in the developed model twelve wave states e g s wv1 s wv2 s wv3 and s wv12 are considered which define the wave heights between 0 and 2 m and are profoundly influenced by the wind for the wind the first eleven states e g s wd1 s wd2 s wd3 and s wd11 are considered to be between 0 and 28 m s as per beaufort scale for example in the summer season if the wind speed is in state 6 8 0 10 7 m s which is considered as a fresh breeze the wave height can be in any state s wv1 s wv12 for that season similarly during winter december to february the nsr can be frozen and therefore high waves on the sea are very unusual the bmt argoss uk provided the recorded data for different wave height h s and wind state u 10 10 m above sea level for the period january 1979 to december 2015 at 3 hourly time intervals bmt argoss 1979 2015 different wind speed and pack ice together can make for dangerous icing conditions however in comparison to sea wave height and wind speed icing condition may require a longer time to change from its original state according to the meteorological institute icing from sea spray will occur at temperatures below 2 c and with wind speeds more than 11 m s due to the slower formation of sea spray icing and rare changing conditions different types of pack ice such as very close pack ice close pack ice open pack ice and very open pack ice respectively can be observed ocimf 2014 the detailed characteristics of the sea ice types have been discussed by previous researchers balto 2014 bourke and garrett 1987 kum and sahin 2015 ocimf 2014 thelma 2010 zakrzewski 1986 in this study bns are used to synthesise expert judgment and recorded data obtained from previous research to perform the integrated analysis the bn is constructed by primary and intermediate nodes with connected arcs these nodes have two states only each with some probability for instance ice breakers failure can be yes or no and the probability of the yes or no can be determined by historical statistical data the intermediate nodes are affected by associated primary causes for instance the intermediate node visibility issues can be affected by the node human factor failure radar failure and environmental obstacles taking advantage of the bn an unwanted event e g collision foundering or grounding is defined and then decomposed to determine its environmental and operational events the developed bns for ship collision foundering and grounding accident scenarios are illustrated in section 4 1 4 application of the methodology case study the application of the proposed method is applied to a case study of a ship collision navigating on the nsr to estimate the accident probability the extreme temperature pack ice and multi year sea ice effect and severe climate changes are some of the drawbacks of this region kassens 1994 melling 2002 ocimf 2014 thelma 2010 usa 1988 zakrzewski 1986 these areas are entirely covered with ice during winter and partly covered in summer according to johannessen et al 1997 the presence of multi year ice on the nsr creates a dangerous environment for marine operations which subsequently necessitates a more comprehensive method and study to investigate navigational risk and challenges in the harsh and cold environments through the nsr in the following sections the application of the proposed methodology is applied to a case study of a ship collision navigating through the nsr 4 1 the nsr economic viabilities and the associated risk the soviet union developed the nsr shipping route as a major national waterway which has a history of 1306 voyages completed by 331 vessels in 1987 ellis and brigham 2009 in recent years the arctic ocean has become the dominant hotspot due to its natural resources shorter navigational routes and pirate free zone fossil fuel is a major attraction in europe to manage the increasing demand for energy a combined initiative between the nsr and the european explorer is undergoing the extraction of fossil fuel in the barents sea the kara sea and the yamal peninsula pastusiak 2016 peresypkin and yakovlev 2008 another growing interest in the eastern region of the nsr for east asian countries such as japan and china is the transport of fossil fuel to meet its energy demand pastusiak 2016 an experimental voyage between yokohama and kirkenes in 1995 proved the nsr to be a cost effective route compared to the suez and panama canals shortening the travel time by 15 days and reducing transportation costs by up to 500 000 pastusiak 2016 the nsr would connect the ports of north asia japan south korea and china and north western europe hamburg bremen and rotterdam and shorten the journey length by about 2500 nautical miles verny and grigentin 2009 after opening a new container terminal for europe and asia cargo shipping increased on the nsr after 2010 exceeding 3 87 million tonnes of cargo in 2012 and expecting a future increase to more than 5 0 million tons by 2019 lammers 2010 pastusiak 2016 polovinkin and fomichev 2012 according to the arctic marine shipping assessment amsa 2009 report the estimated volume of oil and gas transportation on the nsr is expected to be about 40 million tons per year by 2020 ellis and brigham 2009 more economic aspects of arctic transportation can be found in the literature ellis and brigham 2009 hong 2012 lasserre and pelletier 2011 pastusiak 2016 the nsr consists of the ship sailing routes between the bering strait in the east and the barents sea in the west johannessen et al 2007 it connects north western europe and north eastern asia and is considered the shortest sailing route the nsr is divided into five regions identified as the chukchi sea east siberian sea laptev sea kara sea and the barents sea according to a 50 year series of data from polar stations in these regions and visual observations in open sea areas it has been observed that ice formation begins in late august in the northern east siberian sea whereas young ice formation starts in the first ten days of september north of the kara and laptev seas johannessen et al 2007 according to johannessen et al 2007 young ice appears at the end of the second 10 days of september north of the chukchi and the barents seas zakharov 1997 presents an estimate of the average ice area in the nsr regions during march and september as described in table 1 on average within 35 40 days the laptev and east siberian seas are entirely covered by young ice whereas it takes about 80 85 days for the kara and chukchi seas johannessen et al 2007 the chukchi sea has an area of 6 20e05 km2 with an average depth of 80 m and is considered as the only route from the pacific to the arctic according to table 1 an average area of 5 95e 01 million km2 of the chukchi sea is ice covered in march and 1 96e 01 million km2 in september according to anderson et al 2011 the east siberian sea has a surface area of 8 95e05 km2 with a mean depth of 52 m which is the shallowest amongst the seas on the nsr harsh environment remote areas and unexplored maritime areas are some of the characteristics of this region that create challenges for navigational purposes münchow et al 1999 during the winter season the mean temperature is 30 c mulherin et al 1994 and the entire area is ice covered however during summer 50 of the ice remains according to the amsa 2009 report the entire coastal region along the eastern nsr becomes shallow for all marine operations due to the average depth of the chukchi sea and east siberian sea ellis and brigham 2009 the laptev sea has an area of 6 50e05 km2 the average wind speed above the sea surface water is 5 m s and storms occur in the sea three to four times a month also fog is frequent in this region and the humidity varies between 95 and 98 fofonova 2012 the kara sea has the second highest surface area of 8 80e05 km2 along the nsr with a mean depth of 110 m galimov et al 2006 the barents sea has the smallest surface area of 1 40e06 km2 with a mean depth of 230 m sakshaug 1997 smedsrud et al 2010 the winter is considered to be december to february in the barents sea when sea ice is relatively thin compared to other regions of the arctic ocean according to a report by thelma 2010 in extreme conditions spray and mist can build up four centimetres of ice per hour on the surface of a device in the northern barents sea the summer season provides an excellent opportunity for marine transportation as the entire barents sea becomes ice free sakshaug 1997 maritime transportation poses risks regarding possible accidents resulting in loss of life and ship s cargo as well as detrimental impacts on the marine environment the accidents on the nsr are comparatively lower than some other regions the amsa 2009 report highlighted incidents and accidents which occurred in the arctic region between 1995 and 2004 according to the report 293 vessels of different categories were engaged in several accidents including 22 collisions 68 groundings and 54 damages to the vessel ellis and brigham 2009 marine accident investigation branch maib recorded 65 incidents accidents between 1993 and 2011 in the arctic region kum and sahin 2015 however only four collisions and four groundings were reported to the maib compared to 22 collisions and 68 groundings kum and sahin 2015 according to safety and shipping review 2014 there were about seven casualties groundings in the arctic region review 2014 another safety and shipping review in 2016 reported 71 shipping incidents in the arctic waters during 2015 review 2016 growing traffic in the arctic region may increase the risk of ship operations 4 2 accident scenario analysis the cold and harsh environmental conditions have made the arctic waters mostly inaccessible as a shipping route various factors that can affect the ship s navigation as well as human performance in emergency situations such as wave height wind speed sea current surrounding temperature harsh weather effect and different level of ice along the nsr route are taken into consideration however there are some variations between the values of the environmental factors being identified until today no particular factors have been considered to divide the nsr into different regions hence this route is divided based on the five different seas the chukchi sea east siberian sea laptev sea the kara sea and the barents sea respectively in this accident scenario analysis the collision foundering and grounding probabilities of an oil tanker and the primary causes of these consequences are adopted from previous literature antão and soares 2006 emsa 2009 noroozi et al 2014 trucco et al 2008 uğurlu et al 2015 yeo et al 2016 on ship accident modelling in normal conditions smes are being considered if the probability of primary causes specific to arctic environments is not available the severe climate in arctic regions requires experts to re evaluate the previous ship accident scenarios when defining the probabilities of the primary causes in this study the five experts who have more than ten years of research and industry experience in shipping operations on deck and are familiar with the arctic routes environment have been selected to assign the probabilities of the root causes these experts were male and aged between 35 and 65 the average age being 51 6 all the experts have their bachelor bsc and master msc degrees in maritime related fields two experts were working as a master two as chief officer and one as second officer in canadian transport agency with little or no knowledge of assessment of probabilities all experts were canadian and spoke fluent english these experts were engaged in defining the probability distributions of primary events for each region the average is the arithmetic mean value for the primary events the corresponding mean values of probabilities for each primary event for each specific region on the nsr are presented in table 2 in this study most of the input data for the bn analysis in each particular region is received from experts based on the prior event probabilities assigned by the smes human error effect on the detection failure is recognised as one of the recurrent causal factors for marine ship collision previous research suggests that about 80 or more of such accidents involve human error related factors rothblum et al 2002 the cold temperature in a freezing environment can challenge the mariners which in turn may affect surveillance reaction times awareness and memory recall and physical strength enander 1987 hoffman 2002 hse 2017 khan et al 2017 macrae 2009 musharraf et al 2013 noroozi et al 2014 human factor failure x1 consists of a variety of sub groups of errors which can be intended or unintended action of a human these sub groups are defined as human performance influencing factors pifs hse 2017 for example interpretation failure fatigue sleeplessness alcohol abuse can be combined with a human factor failure uğurlu et al 2015 on the otherhand human error x20 is considered as an action or decision which was not intended hse 2017 it should be noted that both of these factors are considered as human errors in many available literature however to differentiate these factors in the developed bn human error is considered as a single action on failure to detect ice and iceberg using conventional marine radars and thermal imaging cameras while navigating on the nsr however considering all the pifs would make the accident modelling network complex enough to show the general applicability for the mariners instead integrating too many sub factors contributors to the accidents into the main factor the human error and the human factor are considered in the proposed model vessel s collision with pack ice and non detected ice is also considered as another significant factor by the experts in developing the model the present study is based on sea wave measurements from the nsr the measurements were obtained from bmt argoss uk in bmt argoss global wind and wave hindcast dataset are available on a grid of spatial resolution 0 5 by 0 5 the wind and wave parameters were recorded at each grid point at 3 hourly time intervals for the period january 1979 to december 2015 the recorded data provided by bmt argoss uk consists of significant wave height h s m zero crossing wave period t z s and wind speed measured at 10 m above the surface a sample of recorded data is shown in table 3 a wave is defined as the fraction of a record between two successive zero up crossings mhl 2016 in practice a zero up crossing wave period is considered to occur when the surface passes through the mean line in an upward direction tann 1976 it is the portion of the record between adjacent zero up crossings its height h is equal to the vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the wave zero crossing wave presented in fig 4 is adapted from mhl 2016 wave data are usually collected for approx 20 min on each 3rd or 6th hours assuming stable sea states skjong et al 1995 wave data can be obtained by visual observations from lighthouses merchant ships and weather ships however instrumental observations can be used such as wave buoys radars shipborne wave recorders sbwr lasers satellites and surface piercing instruments skjong et al 1995 wang et al 2015 according to the world meteorological organization wmo 1983 wave data accuracy requirements are 20 for significant wave height and 1 0s for the average wave period according to tann 1976 significant wave height h s is defined as the mean height of the highest third of the waves given 3n zero up crossing wave period the significant height is 4 h s 1 n h 2 n 1 h 3 n where the heights h 1 h 3n are arranged in increasing order crest to trough heights were used in early research the period of a zero up crossing wave is defined as the time interval between the two zero up crossings which bound it given a record of duration t minutes the mean zero up crossing period is defined as 5 t z t 60 no of zero up crossing waves on the record sec a set of wind and wave data total 105128 observations for the years january 1979 to december 2015 has been obtained based on observations at each grid point for the area of interest from bmt argoss linear contour plot in fig 5 is plotted using the recorded data from the observations of wave height h s m against wave period t z s for each sea the wave data of the barents sea is presented as a scatter diagram in table 4 the wind speed measured at 10 m above sea level for the barents sea is also displayed as a scatter diagram in table 5 the following equation is used to calculate the probability of significant wave height p h s and wind speed p u 10 6 p h s number of wave height occurred in each level e g 0 1 total number of wave height that occurred 7 p u 10 number of wind occurred in each level e g 0 1 total number of wind that occurred the probability distribution of significant wave height h s and wind speed u 10 for five seas along the nsr are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the probability distribution of significant wave height h s and wind speed u 10 for five seas along the nsr are presented in table 6 and table 7 respectively through a carefully constructed bn probability data can be incorporated to model the visibility issues system navigation error anchor failure and assistance failure the combined effect of different kinds of ice in arctic water is recognised as one of the leading challenges for navigational purposes the bn diagram for the integrated model of ship collision foundering and grounding can be developed as illustrated in fig 8 4 3 accident probability analysis in this study the potential safety measures to mitigate accidents such as collision foundering and grounding and their consequences on the nsr are not considered the integrated model will help to predict the occurrence probability of any particular accident during ship navigation on the nsr different environmental and operational conditions based on case specific scenarios are identified and considered as primary causes by applying prior probabilities to these primary causes in the developed model it is possible to identify most probable accidents that may occur in that region the results presented in this section are obtained by using the bn model illustrated in fig 8 the bn analysis demonstrates the highest collision foundering and grounding probabilities to be in region 2 east siberian sea which are 3 31e 03 1 34e 05 and 1 37e 03 respectively table 8 similarly region 5 barents sea has the lowest probability regarding collision 1 30e 04 and foundering 3 11e 07 events region 1 chukchi sea represents the lowest probability 9 30e 04 regarding grounding event however due to extreme wind and wave effects collision probability is almost similar in all five seas and foundering probability is higher in region 1 chukchi sea likewise the likelihood of grounding event is higher in region 2 east siberian sea a comparison of collision probabilities in extreme and normal condition is presented in table 9 4 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity of the bn to some of the most critical variables from table 9 it can be seen that a significant change to collision probabilities on the nsr is noticed due to extreme weather condition severe wind and wave effect therefore any increase or decrease in probabilities of wind and wave effect are not considered in this sensitivity analysis the main purpose of this study is to determine the factors that mainly contribute to the collision foundering or grounding scenarios therefore for each of the accidental events a variation to each of the nodes that presented a higher contribution to the probability of the main event was changed systematically from the analysis it can be seen that a significant change in the probability of each node can make a difference to the probabilities of collision foundering and grounding a 10 increase in the initial probability of each node can make significant changes to the corresponding accident probability for collision events the changes take place for most of the nodes similar results occurred when each of the node probabilities is decreased by the same magnitude for example an increase of 10 in the probability of pack ice effect non detected multi layer ice and environmental obstacles made changes of 1 61 0 15 and 0 13 in collision probability respectively the results of the variation of the probabilities of the collision events when changing each of the initial node probabilities chukchi sea are presented in fig 9 based on the sensitivity analysis we have ranked the major causes of the collision events in the chukchi sea which is shown in table 10 from the table it has been shown that the failures of the pack ice effect non detected multi layer ice environmental obstacles digital chart error human factor failure radar failure and procedure failure impact significantly on ice ship collision in the chukchi sea the pack ice effect is more significant than the non detected multi layer ice in ice ship collision event 1 61 0 15 khan et al 2017 performed a sensitivity analysis for the risk factors involved in the ice oil tanker collision on the nsr and based on the analysis ranked environmental conditions at rank 3 severe environmental conditions are the result of high ice and rough weather states wu et al 2005 considered the logistics regression model to find determinants of the severity of fishing vessel incidents in the canadian water the sensitivity analysis from this model showed increasing severity due to wave height and ice concentration which can affect the stability and mobility of vessels adversely the above sensitivity analysis allows investigating causes of an ice ship collision in the chukchi sea by narrowing down major factors for the cases of foundering event the effect of pack ice is dominant compared to other accident causes with 0 011 besides increase or decrease of the initial probability of each node represents very little change in foundering probability in case of grounding if the probability of digital chart error is increased or decreased by 10 the probability of grounding will increase or decrease by 0 0035 for instance an increase from 9 30e 04 to 9 65e 04 besides digital chart error couttie 2013 other causes such as out of date map location navigator malfunction inappropriate route selection and procedure failure may play a more or less significant role in accident causation the above analysis leads to the conclusion that some of the nodes are highly dominant in all three types of accidents 5 conclusion the existing transportation accident models consider individual events and independent causation factors that may particularly lead to the accidents on the nsr however very often an accident is the outcome of non sequential events caused by combined effects of different factors usually accidents are time dependent concerning evolving environmental and operational factors this study focuses on developing a dynamic risk based model to analyse shipping accidents in the arctic waters to reduce the risk of accidents considering particular environmental and operational conditions the proposed method takes the advantages of case specific data and updating mechanisms to reassess the risk in the proposed model ship collisions with ice during navigation in arctic routes were considered other accident scenarios such as foundering and grounding were also considered due to the likelihood of their taking place application of the developed methodology is reliant on bn modelling due to the need for reassessing ship accident scenarios in arctic transits in different conditions the risk analysis revealed that the east siberian sea had the highest probabilities regarding collision foundering and grounding of the ship other regions such as chukchi laptev kara and the barents sea have almost similar probabilities regarding grounding however foundering probabilities are very low in all five areas the sensitivity analysis of collision foundering and grounding events also revealed that the developed model was sensitive to several environmental and operational conditions from the bn and subsequent sensitivity analysis it is clear that some of the root nodes are the dominant factors towards the accidental event this contribution is the highest for collision and foundering where an increase of the initial probability leads to a significant change in the probability of the occurrence of accidental events in the cases of grounding this effect is less significant the proposed approach can be helpful for decision makers and safety experts to estimate the probability of different types of marine ship accidents considering the factors most contributing to the existing environmental and operational conditions the developed methodology can be used to investigate the possibility of preventing and mitigating ship accidents in harsh and cold environments acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by national centre for maritime engineering and

23382,micro hydrokinetic energy scheme presents an attractive environmentally friendly and efficient electric generation in rural remote and hilly areas however this scheme is yet to be fully discovered as researchers are still searching for solutions for the main problems of low velocity of current in the open flow channels and low efficiency of hydrokinetic turbines this research proposes a novel system configuration to capture as much kinetic energy as possible from stream water current this system known as bidirectional diffuser augmented bda channel functions by utilizing dual directed nozzles in the flow and is surrounded by dual cross flow banki turbines it is also important to obtain the efficient design parameters of the turbines to use in the current configuration the appropriate angle is important in order to guide the flow to touch the blades more perpendicularly to capture as much torque and power as possible hence experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out in this research paper to study the performance characteristics of the cft configuration applied in bda system and investigate the effects of blades inlet and outlet angles of cft runners on the internal flow characteristics and efficiency in this study four different runners with various inlet and outlet angles of two cft have been investigated the cfd results have been validated with the experimental work and proven acceptable with flow pattern and performance characteristics the results of the current study conclude that the maximum power coefficients cp of 0 612 and 0 473 for lower and upper turbines are recorded for best runner angles of case 3 keywords hydrokinetic energy cft inlet angle outlet angle performance flow characteristics power coefficient 1 introduction rural electrification of many developing countries is very costly especially in areas with economic problems elbatran et al 2015a using micro hydropower can be the perfect solution to overcome the economical and operational problems laghari et al 2013 micro hydropower plants can be used to produce suitable electrical power for homes plantations and farms in small villages elbatran et al 2015b they are more predictable when the supply of water is enough mohibullah et al and they also have positive environmental impacts teuteberg 2010 hydrokinetic is a new type of micro hydro power which extracts kinetic energy from the flow of water in open channels rivers or canals by deploying hydrokinetic turbines without any facilities like weirs barrages or falls this scheme is not deployed with any kind of reservoir okot 2013 yaakob et al 2014 herman jacobus et al 2014 kumar et al 2011 elbatran et al 2015c chamorro et al 2013 shabara et al 2015 this application attracts investments in hilly and isolated areas electrification due to its easy construction and low cost it also exploits small hydrological areas rojanamon and taweep 2009 many researches focus on studying the water stream technology from both flow and turbines systems perspectives by considering improvements on the open channel flow and suitable turbine systems utilized in these micro channels to be used in the micro power production the free stream flow systems normally need a higher amount of mass flow with low pressure to be able to extract energy but the conventional current turbines are more suitable for high pressure and flow rate ki pyoung et al 2012 hence many studies tried to develop unique and new technology designs and configurations to capture as much kinetic energy as possible using nozzles is the most efficient choice to accelerate the flow because it can increase the harnessed power nozzles can be utilized in streams of micro channel flow or ducted around turbines elbatran et al 2016 deploying nozzles in channels accelerates the flow and increases the water s kinetic energy khan et al 2013 conducted analytical and numerical investigations to enhance the flow by utilizing convergent nozzles for flow in open water channels the power extracted from channels mainly depends on the velocity of the in stream water flow thus geometrical parameters of the nozzles will have major effects on the flow patterns and velocity by focusing only on one parameter which was the inlet angle of the convergence nozzle khan et al 2013 studied the flow patterns through the velocity and pressure behavior contours the convergence nozzle succeeded in accelerating the water flow by increasing velocity at the nozzle plan it is important to investigate the effects of nozzle geometrical parameters such as diameter ratio nozzle configuration and nozzle edges shape on the flow characteristics in micro scale channels through parametric study consequently elbatran et al 2015d concentrated on determining the flow field pattern water velocity values pressure distribution turbulence effects volume flow rate and the amount of power that could be captured with respect to different geometrical parameters of the deploying nozzles these also included the effects of the free surface elbatran et al elbatran et al 2015 also studied the helical channel flow properties from the hydraulic perspective in order to utilize these channels in the renewable energy field moreover elbatran et al 2017 proposed a ducted nozzle configuration around savonius turbine in water channel to increase the efficiency of the turbine 1 1 cross flow turbines banki turbines the turbine is one of the most costly parts in the budget of micro power scheme it can even reach up to 30 of the total budget where the cost depends on the type of turbine elbatran et al 2015b cross flow or banki turbine is more preferable in micro hydropower scales compared with other turbines based on its performance and cost options olgun 1998 since it can be familiarized with various ranges of flow rate and lower head it is more proper for low head schemes ghosh and prelas 2011 ossberger gmbh co 2011 the cross flow turbine performance depends on geometrical parameters such as runner diameter ratio nozzle entry arc guide vanes number of blades angle of attack and the inlet and exit blade angles as a described in fig 1 α is the angle between the inlet velocity and the tangent direction of the turbine runner inlet and are the outer and inner diameters of the runner and are the inlet and outlet blade angles with respect to the tangent direction of the outer and the inner diameters z is the blade number and t is the blade thickness λ is the angle of the arc available for the discharge inlet along the runner outer circumference and δ is the central angle of the blade mockmore and merryfield 1949 study is one of the oldest and the most important studies on cross flow turbines they defined the hydraulic efficiency of the turbine and the relation between the angle of attack α and the inlet blade angle β their study also suggested a value of 16 for the angle of attack and the maximum efficiency of 68 was obtained in this study nakase et al 1982 studied the effects of the nozzle shape on the performance of cross flow turbines the maximum efficiency of this study was 82 with the recommended number of blades as 26 khosrowpanah et al shahram et al 1988 experimentally studied the cft performance through different geometrical parameters under various flow and head conditions their results demonstrated that the maximum efficiency of the cft increased as the nozzle entry arc increased or the aspect ratio of the runner decreased in their research the recommended number of blades diameter ratio and angle of attack were 15 0 68 and 16 respectively furthermore the peak value of efficiency occurred at 0 52 speed ratio moreover durgin and fay durgin 1984 hothersall 1985 and otto and chappel ott and chappel 1989 reported that the maximum efficiencies were 66 75 and 89 respectively fiuzat et al fiuzat and akerkar 1991 proved that the turbine s second stage contributes more significantly to the power production than reported in the analytic literature desai and aziz 1994 concluded that the maximum efficiency of cft decreased with the increase in the angle of attack in the range of 22 32 it also increased when the number of blades increased from 15 to 30 in their study the recommended diameter ratio was 0 6 and the exit angle was 55 the peak value of efficiency was also almost 88 at speed ratio of near 0 55 the results of hara et al totapally and aziz 1994 presented that the turbine was more efficient by using nozzles that were narrower than the runner it is possible when the angles of attack are between 22 and 24 the number of blades is 35 and the exit angle is smaller than 90 according to olgun 1998 study the highest efficiency of 72 was obtained at 0 67 runner diameter ratio moreover the study selected 30 and 90 for the blade inlet and outlet angles respectively kokubu et al 2013 proved that the cft efficiency was improved in the presence of guide vane with current plate kaunda et al 2014a experimentally investigated the performance of cft to enhance the design of a cross flow turbine as an appropriate technology for small scale power generation hence their study was depending on conditions other than the best efficiency point it also explored the influence of nozzle opening parameter as well as the characteristics of the torque transfer in the two stages of the turbine it was reported that the highest turbine efficiency was 79 recently the researchers paid more attention to the use of cfd which is becoming an important tool to investigate and design the cross flow turbines choi et al 2008 investigated the effect of the turbine s configuration on the cft performance and internal flow properties by using cfd analysis it was found that the maximum efficiency occurred with 25 angle of attack 87 blade exit angle and 26 as the number of blades the efficiency also leads to an increase in narrow nozzle passage andrade et al de andrade et al 2011 proved numerically by using ansys cfx that 68 5 percent of the energy transmission occurs in the 1st stage and the remaining 31 5 was transferred in the 2nd stage they concluded that there was a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results sammartano et al sammartano et al 2013 used cfd simulations in order to design the main geometrical parameters of the cross flow turbines in this study a turbine with 35 blades and an attack angle of 22 central angle of blade δ of 61 5 displayed at the design point a high efficiency equal to 86 meanwhile kaunda et al 2014b numerically studied the flow profile in the cft at different operating conditions by means of ansys cfx to calculate the turbine performance the cross flow turbine is more suitable for run of river and wave generation applications because its efficiency is mainly dependent on the flow rate compared to the other types of hydro power turbines choi et al 2009 choi et al 2010 and prasad et al prasad et al 2014 experimentally and numerically studied the performance of cross flow turbine as direct drive turbine ddt for wave power generation highest efficiencies of 51 7 51 6 and 55 were reported for the above mentioned works respectively recently kim et al 2015 integrated cft in a power take off pto system of new floating wave energy converter and the experimental maximum efficiency was nearly 40 in addition kim et al ki pyoung et al 2012 numerically proposed a new configuration of cross flow turbine for harnessing tidal energy by utilizing a larger area of the channel the maximum efficiency of 52 was obtained in this study elbatran et al 2015a proposed zero head cross flow turbine to extract the hydrokinetic power in micro scale channels hence cft is indeed suitable for other applications such as current and wave power generation besides hydropower applications from the current literature review results the following recommended runner main geometrical and effectiveness parameters are summarized in table 1 1 2 problem statement and objectives of the study in addition to hydropower applications cft is indeed suitable for other applications such as current and wave power generation however the application of cross flow turbines as tested in these studies still poses a question how can the cross flow runner design be further modified to optimize the turbine performance if special configuration of new channel design is given as in the present work it is noticed that many researchers use the recommended geometrical parameters as used in hydropower applications but with different configurations and arrangements accordingly ref elbatran et al 2015a numerically proposed surrounding the cft by directed nozzle diffuser system with recommended cft geometrical parameters as used in hydropower applications they however do not accurately signify appropriate parameters especially the inlet and outlet angles of the runner blades thus the concluded results in ref elbatran et al 2015a recommended that it was important to get the suitable inlet and outlet angles for using in the current configuration hence there is a lack of theoretical understanding on changing these angles to be suitable in the present hydrokinetic applications which is strongly manifested in all previous literature such outcome of the literature review has driven the objectives of the current step therefore this study intends to discover the effects of inlet and outlet angles of the cft runner blades on determining the performance characteristics of the dual cft banki turbines configuration and flow characteristics through system which is designed for application in hydrokinetic micro channel scheme numerical and experimental investigations had been performed in the present study this numerical work was conducted using a finite volume of ranse code ansys cfx the main objective of this research is to 1 improve the flow characteristics through cft runner by defining the appropriate inlet and outlet blade angles 2 assess the overall power coefficient of the turbine to extract as much energy as possible from flow in a channel 2 augmentation channel and cft cases model fig 2 shows models of two cft runners surrounded by augmentation channel composed of an inlet nozzle and a diffuser at the exit side of channels and cross flow turbine runner in this configuration the nozzle incoming water has a free surface at 0 4 m from the bottom the inlet of the channel occupies 0 25 m of the inlet water level with the clearance between the blade tip and casing set at 5 mm the free surface at the special system inlet enables the deployment of current arrangement in shallow water or at the surface of river applications as well as channels inlet nozzle is not necessarily symmetrical because one of the main purposes of the current study is to investigate the upper turbine efficiency under free surface effect the lower turbine also is in a normal mode of operation thus it is better if the lower region occupied more area of water than the upper part to fully exploit the system and achieve higher performance the use of cft runner in the present augmentation channel system is a newly designed concept proposed by the authors in ref elbatran et al 2015a 2 1 test cases fig 3 a presents the descriptions of the lower and upper parts of the turbine its length l was 0 38 m a total of 26 blades were formed with an arc camber having 2 7 mm thickness t four test cases with different inlet β 1 outlet β 2 angles and diameter ratio of turbine models were adopted in this study the blade inlet and outlet angles of the turbine models are summarized in table 2 and described in fig 3b 2 2 velocity diagrams the velocity diagram theoretically proposes the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the water in the two stages of cross flow turbine no flow losses through the inside of the runner were assumed which should give equal diagrams at the exit of the first stage and input of the second stage fig 4 shows the velocity triangles through the runner for four studied cases where v u and represent the absolute velocity the peripheral velocity and relative velocity respectively referring to fig 4 the increase of inlet and outlet angles of the runner β 1 β 2 decreased the angle of attack which theoretically led to the increase in the magnitude of the velocity in the first stage consequently the efficiency of this stage could be increased furthermore it resulted in the increase of the cross flow through the runner due to the increase of the direction of the exit velocity of the first stage as in cases 3 4 subsequently the efficiency of the second stage could be developed in conclusion based on the current configuration the efficiency of the turbine analytically tended to increase with the decrease of angle of attack and increase of the inlet and outlet angles 3 experimental apparatus the test rig consisted of water pump preference to variable speed pump loop channel system from and to water reservoir bidirectional diffuser augmented channel including two cross flow turbines with connection to the channel system the current channel had a total length of 3 2 m by which the present model system as shown in fig 1 was positioned in the middle of the channel plan and had a length of 1 2 m the overall length of the front and rear channels lc was 2 m with a width of the channel w 0 6 m and the channel depth h 0 6 m the water level at the channel inlet was 0 4 m as shown in fig 5 the main aim of the present study is to investigate the flow and performance characteristics of the proposed cft in the augmentation channels to improve the efficiency of the turbine in hydrokinetic mode by studying the influence of changing the inlet and outlet angles this was done through measuring the free flow water velocity mean inlet runner velocity turbine rpm tip speed ratio shaft torque output power torque coefficient and power coefficient power coefficient c p and torque coefficient c t of turbines were used to reflect the turbine performance and efficiency as presented in equations 1 and 2 1 c p t ω 0 5 ρ a u 0 3 2 c t t 0 5 ρ a r u 0 2 where t represents the output torque ω is the angular velocity of the turbine p c 0 5 ρ a u 0 3 is the maximum hydrokinetic power that can be extracted from the channel is the density of water a is the sectional area of the flow at the inlet of channel and indicates the flow stream velocity r represents the turbine radius it is important to determine the effects of tip speed ratio on the efficiency of the turbine runner tsr is the ratio of the peripheral velocity of the runner u to inflow jet speed v in order to get different values of tsr the angular velocity ω was varied whose tsr was calculated by using the equation below 3 t s r ω r v where v is the mean runner inlet velocity test measurement apparatus used in the current tests were a high speed camera digital torque sensor and rpm meters all of which had been calibrated the velocity of the flow of water through the channel system was measured by using a high speed 10 megapixel camera branded phantom v7 capable of taking 1 400 000 pictures per second with ultra fast 7 gpx second throughput 1280 800 at 7530 fps 300 ns digital exposure and is phantom cine mag compatible high speed camera was used to record videos at the plane of the channel system from the side view high speed camera was used as a particle tracking method where small lighter rings were used as tracking particles then the videos recorded by the high speed camera were imported to phantom camera control software to measure the velocities futek trs 605 torque meter was used to measure the turbine shaft torque and rotational speed torque sensors functioned to measure the torque with the aid of strain gages which were applied to the torsion section to undergo a change in impedance that depended on the torque this caused a voltage change that was proportional to the change in impedance and reached the evaluation instrument ibt 100 the load was changed by a brake system by which the rotational speed rpm of the turbine shaft was controlled the uncertainties for the experimental results in different parameters tsr torque coefficient and power coefficient were around 2 8 4 and 4 5 respectively 4 numerical approach in this research a finite volume method was used for discretizing the governing equations in ansys cfx the convective terms were discretized using second order upwind scheme and the pressure was interpolated using linear interpolation scheme while the central difference scheme was utilized for diffusion terms for the pressure velocity coupling simple semi implicit methods for pressure linked equation was utilized unsteady simulation was performed based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with sst k ω as introduced by menter kim et al 2015 for turbulence model this turbulence model combines k ω turbulence model and k ε model where k ω turbulence model is used in the near wall region and the k ε model is used in the free stream flow 4 1 governing equations the governing equations for the unsteady viscous and incompressible turbulent flow are the navier stokes equations which can be written in the following form menter 1994 4 u i x i 0 0 5 ρ u i t x i u i u

schemes and boundary conditions in this study 3d models of cft surrounding by bda system had been built and validated by current experimental tests the simulations were carried out in unsteady condition and ansys icem cfd software was used for meshing the models the computational grid was divided into three domains which are stationary domain main channel augmentation system and rotational domain cross flow turbines for the sliding mesh model banki turbines and augmentation channel were considered to be walls where the no slip condition was assigned to these walls in the different simulations the velocity had normal direction to the water model channel inlet the outlet boundary condition was specified according to the outflow and the reference pressure was set to atmospheric 1 bar the working fluid was water with density of 1000 and dynamic viscosity of 1x convergence was monitored through making dimensionless residual sum for all variables across the computational points time step t corresponded to 1 of rotation by the turbine interfaces of non conformal mesh were used with the stationary and rotating domains in this study sliding mesh model was used in the current study for predicting the flow properties and performance characteristics through cross flow turbines in the various cases the domains were meshed using hybrid structured hexahedron and unstructured tetrahedral grids as shown in fig 6 ultimately structured hexahedral mesh elements were used for the main channel while unstructured tetrahedral mesh elements were used for the cft and the augmentation channel in the present study four computational grids had been tested in this study to check the solution sensitivity table 3 describes four grid cells specifications for all domains power coefficients variations with tsr for lower turbine of case 3 which were determined for four grids are shown in fig 7 it was noticed that grid 3 and grid 4 gave acceptable and similar results while grid 4 required more time for solution hence grid 3 was chosen to carry out the investigations of this study 4 3 validation with experiment the present numerical study was validated with the experimental analysis of the current work to verify the numerical method used in the current study a good agreement between numerical and experimental results was reached for performance characteristics of lower turbine as presented in fig 8 the maximum range of error between experimental and numerical measurements for performance curve was within 6 5 9 the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results tends to minor experimental factors like channel and bda wall roughness wall gap at the channel connection and etc 5 results and discussions 5 1 numerical results and discussions the concluded results in ref elbatran et al 2015a recommended that it is important to get the most appropriate inlet and outlet angles to be used in the current configuration to increase the efficiency of the system the numerical simulation was carried out on the four different turbine angles and diameter ratio cases this study presents investigations on the effects of different runner inlet and outlet angles of banki turbines by measuring the performance and flow field characteristics of the turbines by different inlet and outlet angles 5 1 1 performance characteristics of four cases this section investigates the effects of different runner designs especially inlet and exit blade angles of the cft runner in the new current hydrokinetic flow stream in channel mode by measuring the performance characteristics of the cross flow at various blade angles the cft cases were tested at different tsr and various flow rates q figs 9 and 10 show the torque coefficient and power coefficient variations at different tsr for all cases of tested turbines from fig 9 it was noticed that the coefficient of torque increased with the decrease of tsr or with the decrease of rotational speed rpm on the other hand the power coefficient increased with increasing tsr until it reached a peak value at tsr of almost 0 44 for all cases of lower turbines and ranged from 0 62 to 0 68 for upper turbines it then decreased from the value onwards see fig 10 furthermore the power coefficient increased with increasing tsr until it reached a peak value at tsr of almost 0 46 for all cases of lower turbines and ranges from 0 62 to 0 7 for upper turbines it then decreased from here onwards see fig 10 the power coefficient increased with increasing tsr until it reached a peak value at tsr of almost 0 46 for all cases of lower turbines and ranges from 0 62 to 0 7 for upper turbines then decreasing from here onwards the highest power coefficient of the current cf turbines tends to increase with the increment of the inlet and outlet angle β 1 β 2 reached to 45 and 105 for β 1 a n d β 2 respectively after that the power coefficients were suddenly dropped in case 4 this was the effect of the inlet and outlet blade angles which lead to the perfect direction of the flow through the runner which resulted in increasing of the efficiency of the second stage in the present study regarding variations of inlet and outlet runner blade angles there has been a point by which the turbine case has peak output power and power coefficient efficiency the power coefficient of lower turbine which was recorded for case 3 was 0 575 at adequate values of tip speed ratio of around 0 42 these values were quite acceptable and agreed with the literature and theoretical study of balji balje 1981 this is while the upper runner achieved power coefficient efficiency of 0 48 at tsr 0 62 these values of the efficiency are very considerable in comparison to the original turbine efficiency used in hydrokinetic or current applications on the other hand the performance curves indicated that case 2 was the second perfect configuration for inlet and outlet angles which recorded power coefficients of 0 52 and 0 412 for lower and upper runners respectively this is while the cases 1 and 4 have shown very poor characteristics compared with case 2 and 3 the inlet runner flow rate q av is a very important factor for the input power of the current system because the input power is proportional to the flow rate p 0 5 ρqv 2 hence the inlet power will increase when the flow rate becomes larger meanwhile if the efficiency is constant the output power of the turbine will increase however this concept is not acceptable over time because the water at the nozzle inlet needs to be completely full so that the flow rate does not affect the peak efficiency of turbine fiuzat and akerkar 1991 the present study aims to get an appropriate flow rate at the intake of the system to define the maximum power and efficiency fig 11 illustrates the relation between the power coefficient and the inlet flow rate for all tested cases it was not necessary that the peak value of the efficiency occurs at the maximum flow rate every case had a different optimized flow rate according to its configurations the most efficient flow rates indicated for cases 1 2 3 and 4 of lower turbine were 0 051 0 0526 0 057 and 0 053 s respectively for upper case the appropriate flow rates were 0 034 0 044 0 045 and 0 042 s for cases 1 2 3 and 4 respectively moreover it was noticed that case 3 for upper and lower cases provided the best results for flow rate and efficiency the efficiency of the lower turbine was higher than that of the upper turbine this appeared for all cases of different angles this is seen in the increase of the inlet runner velocity v 1 of lower region and flow rate through lower turbine compared to the upper region this is due to the fact that the lower region occupied more area of water than the upper region the velocity through runner also increased due to the effects of gravity and extensively crossed flow through the lower runner in contrast it decreased in case of upper runner as described in the following sections of 5 2 and 5 3 5 2 flow field characteristics analysis the flow field characteristics through cft runner in the present configuration were studied to evaluate the turbine efficiency close views of velocity vectors at a central plane through the augmentation channel and the rotor blades are displayed in fig 12 entrained higher velocity flow of water between the turbine blade tips and casing was able to produce jet flow which contributed to added energy generation besides application of two main power stages hence the blades absorbed the energy through three stages causing them to rotate anticlockwise on the other hand the outlet velocity from the first stage was not the same with the inlet velocity from the second stage this shows a disagreement with the theoretical assumption v r 2 v r 3 but shows a good agreement with the current experimental results which is important to consider through the cft runner design the flow pattern here proves that there is a good agreement among the analytical experimental and numerical studies the cfd tool has been reached at this end enhancement of flow characteristics could be achieved using rectangular duct nozzle and naca nozzle surrounding the cf turbine runners fig 12 presents the importance of naca augmentation for increasing the mean inlet runner velocity of the water flowing the velocity indicated more values at the turbine inlet for lower regions than for the upper runner where the velocity increased due to the effects of gravity and crossed flow through the lower runner in contrast it decreased in the case of upper runner consequently the turbine indicated that the amount of kinetic energy harnessed by lower turbine was more than in the case of upper rotor this proves that the numerical and experimental results are comparable 5 2 1 the effects of the blades inlet and outlet angles on the flow characteristics a numerical simulation was carried out using four different turbine angles and diameter ratio cases vectors of water velocity for different runner blades inlet and outlet angles four cases for lower and upper turbines are shown in fig 13 velocity fields in the flow passage of the turbine are changed simultaneously with the variation of the inlet and outlet angles it was observed that the velocity flow vectors crossing the runner for case 3 and case 4 were different from those for case 1 and case 2 in these cases the blades angles made the flow more perpendicular on the blades leading to a decrease in the angle of attack and subsequently it results in an increase of the velocity in the first stage and improving the efficiency of this stage efficiency of the second stage has also increased due to the perfect direction of the cross flow through the runner making the cross flow more extensive than in the other two cases these angles configurations were also able to increase the area of the blades exposed to the incoming water so that the torque power and efficiency are increased in contrast the large values of inlet and outlet angles of case 3 and case 4 led to the shifting of the cross flow of water towards the shaft centre and increased flow recirculation especially for case 4 as shown in the black circle in fig 13 subsequently it was expected to reduce in the turning moment at the shaft centre due to water jet of the cross flow hence there is a slight reduction in the power output and efficiency nevertheless case 3 and 4 have the most effective internal flow characteristics for increasing of the efficiency of the two stages this result implies that one of these two cases is able to improve the turbine performance moreover the angles of case 2 gave a good internal flow pattern but they were not the most suitable degrees of the runner blades angles for the present configuration with respect to the flow fields the inlet runner velocity v 1 varied with the peripheral velocity u 1 ω r for the four cases as shown in fig 14 it was noticed that the mean intake rotor velocity for all cases considerably decreased with the increment of the peripheral velocity u 1 consequently the inlet velocity decreased with the increase of tsr in other words if the runner moved slowly the inlet runner velocity v 1 would increase besides the mean entrance velocity for the third case recorded higher values than did the other cases of the two turbines therefore the kinetic energy available in this case was more than those in the other cases consequently the power output was expected to increase as described in figs 9 and 10 regarding the turbine power characteristics moreover it was observed that there was a significant drop in the inlet water velocity in case 1 and case 4 due to the flow resistance caused by angle configuration in these cases an almost vertical angle caused some blockages at a lower flow rate regarding the flow analysis of the current section the second stage power played an important role in the output power of the turbines it was proven that the turbine s second stage contributed more than 30 of the total power the differences between the power of case 3 and case 1 signified the amount of power represented by the second stage this is because case 1 had little crossed flow to the second stage the effects of tsr on the flow field characteristics for case 3 are presented in fig 15 the increase in the tsr stems from the decrease in the inlet runner velocity v 1 in addition an increase in the peripheral velocity u 1 is due to the decrease of the cross flow intensity rate through the runner this leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the runner especially for the second stage although the flow in some cases such as tsr 0 44 has no perfect cross flow properties through the runner like in case of tsr 0 26 the cross flow of water in this case deflects away from the shaft centre therefore the recirculating flow of upper part of the runner decreased consequently the torque and power coefficients of the turbine improved water flow passed more extensively and quickly through the runner when the turbine rotated slowly or when the tsr decreased additionally the maximum efficiency occurs when the interaction of the flow and the runner is maximized at appropriate tsr the pressure variations in the augmentation channel and through upstream and downstream of the turbine are presented in fig 16 the pressure difference created in the runner by the lower pressure in the accelerating region upper surface and the higher pressure in the decelerating region lower surface was found able to generate energy 5 3 experimental results the bda system presented in the current study is planned to be utilized in micro open water channels and rivers with low velocity regions to enhance the water flow and increase the extracted hydrokinetic power the numerical results and discussion of this study have proven that a higher value of the inlet and outlet blade angles can cause the water flow to pass perfectly through the runner leading to a larger torque power and efficiency furthermore the angles of 45 and 105 for inlet and outlet with diameter ratio of 0 68 case 3 provide the effective results in a higher efficiency than do other angles this runner configuration for lower and upper regions was capable of producing maximum power output and peak efficiency therefore the most appropriate runner design that can be used for two turbines in the present channel configuration was in case 3 consequently case 3 results are presented here the velocity measured lines measured by using high speed cameras for lower and upper regions were positioned at y 0 3 z 0 22 and y 0 3 z 0 3 respectively the velocity ratio values tracking for lower and upper regions experimentally measured along a central plane through the bda system are shown in fig 17 it was noticed that the presented application is likely to increase the speed of fluid increasing the speed can be a significant factor in designing channels low speed current appearance in this study the water velocity increased with the decrease of the area of the contraction along the bda system due to the presence of two directed nozzles the velocity values for lower and upper regions increased to 2 1 and 1 3 times respectively than those of the free stream inlet velocity at the end of the first nozzle the naca nozzle had significantly increased the water velocity by about 3 2 times and 2 3 times than that of the system free stream inlet velocity for lower and upper regions respectively it was observed that the velocities ratio of lower region were more than the upper region because the lower region occupied more area of water than the upper part moreover the velocity indicated almost 3 2 u o and 2 3 u o at the turbine inlet for lower and upper turbines respectively and it started to decrease behind the turbine which recorded nearly 1 4 u o and 1 3 u o the differences between the values of velocities in front of and behind the turbine presented the amount of kinetic energy harnessed by turbines it was clearly seen that this difference through the lower turbine was more than the upper runner because the lower turbine was in a normal mode of operation and the crossed flow through the turbine was more extensive hence it is expected that by this design the kinetic power and efficiency of lower runner would be more than those of upper turbine the variations of the mean inlet runner velocity ratio v 1 u o and peripheral or circumferential velocity ratio u 1 u o ωr u o with tsr are shown in fig 18 it was noticed that the mean inlet of runner velocity for two turbines decreased with the increase of tsr while the peripheral or circumferential velocity increased with the increment of tsr in other words the inlet flow of water passed more quickly through the runner when the turbine rotated slowly furthermore the inlet runner velocity and circumferential velocity for the lower turbine reached higher values than those of upper turbine this is reasonable based on the reasons as in the previous section fig 19 illustrates the performance characteristics curves of two tested lower and upper turbines the torque coefficient decreased with the increase of tsr or with the increment of rotational speed rpm the maximum output torque coefficients values recorded for the lower and upper turbines were about 0 76 and 0 5 respectively these numbers were obtained at the lowest values of tsr and rpm it was also noticed that the torque coefficient c t for lower runner was more than that in upper case because the lower area of flow stream is more than the flow area available for upper region the power coefficient c p of the lower and upper turbines tended to increase with the increase of tsr until it reached the peak values and then decreased the maximum power coefficients were 0 612 and 0 473 for lower and upper turbines respectively these coefficients of power were obtained at tsr of 0 66 and 0 52 for lower and upper runner respectively the highest efficiency of overall system with the two cross flow turbines was 0 557 6 conclusion a new cross flow turbine based on the banki concept was developed and deployed in the present augmentation channel the cft runners in the present hydrokinetic system are utilized without the need for special casing nozzles entry arc and guide vanes hence the inlet and outlet runner blades angles and diameter ratio play an important role in the direction of the cross flow through the runner in overall efficiency of the system the most efficient runner design that can be used for the two turbines in the present channel configuration has the appropriate inlet and outlet angles of 45 and 105 respectively and the diameter ratio of 0 68 turbines operation and performance in the new channel arrangement have been analyzed and evaluated experiments were conducted to determine the power coefficients of the turbines which were found to be 0 612 and 0 473 for the lower and upper turbines respectively furthermore the maximum power coefficients were numerically obtained as 0 575 and 0 48 for lower and upper turbines respectively a good agreement was observed between the current numerical and experimental results for flow pattern through the bda system and performance characteristics of the two turbines the maximum final power coefficient of overall system which includes two cross flow turbines was 0 557 this system promises a sufficient performance and a higher efficiency compared to the conventional hydrokinetic turbines and cft systems utilized in the wave and tidal power generation scheme acknowledgment the authors would like to express sincere

23382,micro hydrokinetic energy scheme presents an attractive environmentally friendly and efficient electric generation in rural remote and hilly areas however this scheme is yet to be fully discovered as researchers are still searching for solutions for the main problems of low velocity of current in the open flow channels and low efficiency of hydrokinetic turbines this research proposes a novel system configuration to capture as much kinetic energy as possible from stream water current this system known as bidirectional diffuser augmented bda channel functions by utilizing dual directed nozzles in the flow and is surrounded by dual cross flow banki turbines it is also important to obtain the efficient design parameters of the turbines to use in the current configuration the appropriate angle is important in order to guide the flow to touch the blades more perpendicularly to capture as much torque and power as possible hence experimental and numerical investigations

cft runners on the internal flow characteristics and efficiency in this study four different runners with various inlet and outlet angles of two cft have been investigated the cfd results have been validated with the experimental work and proven acceptable with flow pattern and performance characteristics the results of the current study conclude that the maximum power coefficients cp of 0 612 and 0 473 for lower and upper turbines are recorded for best runner angles of case 3 keywords hydrokinetic energy cft inlet angle outlet angle performance flow characteristics power coefficient 1 introduction rural electrification of many developing countries is very costly especially in areas with economic problems elbatran et al 2015a using micro hydropower can be the perfect solution to overcome the economical and operational problems laghari et al 2013 micro hydropower plants can be used to produce suitable electrical power for homes plantations and farms in small villages elbatran et al 2015b they are more predictable when the supply of water is enough mohibullah et al and they also have positive environmental impacts teuteberg 2010 hydrokinetic is a new type of micro hydro power which extracts kinetic energy from the flow of water in open channels rivers or canals by deploying hydrokinetic turbines without any facilities like weirs barrages or falls this scheme is not deployed with any kind of reservoir okot 2013 yaakob et al 2014 herman jacobus et al 2014 kumar et al 2011 elbatran et al 2015c chamorro et al 2013 shabara et al 2015 this application attracts investments in hilly and isolated areas electrification due to its easy construction and low cost it also exploits small hydrological areas rojanamon and taweep 2009 many researches focus on studying the water stream technology from both flow and turbines systems perspectives by considering improvements on the open channel flow and suitable turbine systems utilized in these micro channels to be used in the micro power production the free stream flow systems normally need a higher amount of mass flow with low pressure to be able to extract energy but the conventional current turbines are more suitable for high pressure and flow rate ki pyoung et al 2012 hence many studies tried to develop unique and new technology designs and configurations to capture as much kinetic energy as possible using nozzles is the most efficient choice to accelerate the flow because it can increase the harnessed power nozzles can be utilized in streams of micro channel flow or ducted around turbines elbatran et al 2016 deploying nozzles in channels accelerates the flow and increases the water s kinetic energy khan et al 2013 conducted analytical and numerical investigations to enhance the flow by utilizing convergent nozzles for flow in open water channels the power extracted from channels mainly depends on the velocity of the in stream water flow thus geometrical parameters of the nozzles will have major effects on the flow patterns and velocity by focusing only on one parameter which was the inlet angle of the convergence nozzle khan et al 2013 studied the flow patterns through the velocity and pressure behavior contours the convergence nozzle succeeded in accelerating the water flow by increasing velocity at the nozzle plan it is important to investigate the effects of nozzle geometrical parameters such as diameter ratio nozzle configuration and nozzle edges shape on the flow characteristics in micro scale channels through parametric study consequently elbatran et al 2015d concentrated on determining the flow field pattern water velocity values pressure distribution turbulence effects volume flow rate and the amount of power that could be captured with respect to different geometrical parameters of the deploying nozzles these also included the effects of the free surface elbatran et al elbatran et al 2015 also studied the helical channel flow properties from the hydraulic perspective in order to utilize these channels in the renewable energy field moreover elbatran et al 2017 proposed a ducted nozzle configuration around savonius turbine in water channel to increase the efficiency of the turbine 1 1 cross flow turbines banki turbines the turbine is one of the most costly parts in the budget of micro power scheme it can even reach up to 30 of the total budget where the cost depends on the type of turbine elbatran et al 2015b cross flow or banki turbine is more preferable in micro hydropower scales compared with other turbines based on its performance and cost options olgun 1998 since it can be familiarized with various ranges of flow rate and lower head it is more proper for low head schemes ghosh and prelas 2011 ossberger gmbh co 2011 the cross flow turbine performance depends on geometrical parameters such as runner diameter ratio nozzle entry arc guide vanes number of blades angle of attack and the inlet and exit blade angles as a described in fig 1 α is the angle between the inlet velocity and the tangent direction of the turbine runner inlet and are the outer and inner diameters of the runner and are the inlet and outlet blade angles with respect to the tangent direction of the outer and the inner diameters z is the blade number and t is the blade thickness λ is the angle of the arc available for the discharge inlet along the runner outer circumference and δ is the central angle of the blade mockmore and merryfield 1949 study is one of the oldest and the most important studies on cross flow turbines they defined the hydraulic efficiency of the turbine and the relation between the angle of attack α and the inlet blade angle β their study also suggested a value of 16 for the angle of attack and the maximum efficiency of 68 was obtained in this study nakase et al 1982 studied the effects of the nozzle shape on the performance of cross flow turbines the maximum efficiency of this study was 82 with the recommended number of blades as 26 khosrowpanah et al shahram et al 1988 experimentally studied the cft performance through different geometrical parameters under various flow and head conditions their results demonstrated that the maximum efficiency of the cft increased as the nozzle entry arc increased or the aspect ratio of the runner decreased in their research the recommended number of blades diameter ratio and angle of attack were 15 0 68 and 16 respectively furthermore the peak value of efficiency occurred at 0 52 speed ratio moreover durgin and fay durgin 1984 hothersall 1985 and otto and chappel ott and chappel 1989 reported that the maximum efficiencies were 66 75 and 89 respectively fiuzat et al fiuzat and akerkar 1991 proved that the turbine s second stage contributes more significantly to the power production than reported in the analytic literature desai and aziz 1994 concluded that the maximum efficiency of cft decreased with the increase in the angle of attack in the range of 22 32 it also increased when the number of blades increased from 15 to 30 in their study the recommended diameter ratio was 0 6 and the exit angle was 55 the peak value of efficiency was also almost 88 at speed ratio of near 0 55 the results of hara et al totapally and aziz 1994 presented that the turbine was more efficient by using nozzles that were narrower than the runner it is possible when the angles of attack are between 22 and 24 the number of blades is 35 and the exit angle is smaller than 90 according to olgun 1998 study the highest efficiency of 72 was obtained at 0 67 runner diameter ratio moreover the study selected 30 and 90 for the blade inlet and outlet angles respectively kokubu et al 2013 proved that the cft efficiency was improved in the presence of guide vane with current plate kaunda et al 2014a experimentally investigated the performance of cft to enhance the design of a cross flow turbine as an appropriate technology for small scale power generation hence their study was depending on conditions other than the best efficiency point it also explored the influence of nozzle opening parameter as well as the characteristics of the torque transfer in the two stages of the turbine it was reported that the highest turbine efficiency was 79 recently the researchers paid more attention to the use of cfd which is becoming an important tool to investigate and design the cross flow turbines choi et al 2008 investigated the effect of the turbine s configuration on the cft performance and internal flow properties by using cfd analysis it was found that the maximum efficiency occurred with 25 angle of attack 87 blade exit angle and 26 as the number of blades the efficiency also leads to an increase in narrow nozzle passage andrade et al de andrade et al 2011 proved numerically by using ansys cfx that 68 5 percent of the energy transmission occurs in the 1st stage and the remaining 31 5 was transferred in the 2nd stage they concluded that there was a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results sammartano et al sammartano et al 2013 used cfd simulations in order to design the main geometrical parameters of the cross flow turbines in this study a turbine with 35 blades and an attack angle of 22 central angle of blade δ of 61 5 displayed at the design point a high efficiency equal to 86 meanwhile kaunda et al 2014b numerically studied the flow profile in the cft at different operating conditions by means of ansys cfx to calculate the turbine performance the cross flow turbine is more suitable for run of river and wave generation applications because its efficiency is mainly dependent on the flow rate compared to the other types of hydro power turbines choi et al 2009 choi et al 2010 and prasad et al prasad et al 2014 experimentally and numerically studied the performance of cross flow turbine as direct drive turbine ddt for wave power generation highest efficiencies of 51 7 51 6 and 55 were reported for the above mentioned works respectively recently kim et al 2015 integrated cft in a power take off pto system of new floating wave energy converter and the experimental maximum efficiency was nearly 40 in addition kim et al ki pyoung et al 2012 numerically proposed a new configuration of cross flow turbine for harnessing tidal energy by utilizing a larger area of the channel the maximum efficiency of 52 was obtained in this study elbatran et al 2015a proposed zero head cross flow turbine to extract the hydrokinetic power in micro scale channels hence cft is indeed suitable for other applications such as current and wave power generation besides hydropower applications from the current literature review results the following recommended runner main geometrical and effectiveness parameters are summarized in table 1 1 2 problem statement and objectives of the study in addition to hydropower applications cft is indeed suitable for other applications such as current and wave power generation however the application of cross flow turbines as tested in these studies still poses a question how can the cross flow runner design be further modified to optimize the turbine performance if special configuration of new channel design is given as in the present work it is noticed that many researchers use the recommended geometrical parameters as used in hydropower applications but with different configurations and arrangements accordingly ref elbatran et al 2015a numerically proposed surrounding the cft by directed nozzle diffuser system with recommended cft geometrical parameters as used in hydropower applications they however do not accurately signify appropriate parameters especially the inlet and outlet angles of the runner blades thus the concluded results in ref elbatran et al 2015a recommended that it was important to get the suitable inlet and outlet angles for using in the current configuration hence there is a lack of theoretical understanding on changing these angles to be suitable in the present hydrokinetic applications which is strongly manifested in all previous literature such outcome of the literature review has driven the objectives of the current step therefore this study intends to discover the effects of inlet and outlet angles of the cft runner blades on determining the performance characteristics of the dual cft banki turbines configuration and flow characteristics through system which is designed for application in hydrokinetic micro channel scheme numerical and experimental investigations had been performed in the present study this numerical work was conducted using a finite volume of ranse code ansys cfx the main objective of this research is to 1 improve the flow characteristics through cft runner by defining the appropriate inlet and outlet blade angles 2 assess the overall power coefficient of the turbine to extract as much energy as possible from flow in a channel 2 augmentation channel and cft cases model fig 2 shows models of two cft runners surrounded by augmentation channel composed of an inlet nozzle and a diffuser at the exit side of channels and cross flow turbine runner in this configuration the nozzle incoming water has a free surface at 0 4 m from the bottom the inlet of the channel occupies 0 25 m of the inlet water level with the clearance between the blade tip and casing set at 5 mm the free surface at the special system inlet enables the deployment of current arrangement in shallow water or at the surface of river applications as well as channels inlet nozzle is not necessarily symmetrical because one of the main purposes of the current study is to investigate the upper turbine efficiency under free surface effect the lower turbine also is in a normal mode of operation thus it is better if the lower region occupied more area of water than the upper part to fully exploit the system and achieve higher performance the use of cft runner in the present augmentation channel system is a newly designed concept proposed by the authors in ref elbatran et al 2015a 2 1 test cases fig 3 a presents the descriptions of the lower and upper parts of the turbine its length l was 0 38 m a total of 26 blades were formed with an arc camber having 2 7 mm thickness t four test cases with different inlet β 1 outlet β 2 angles and diameter ratio of turbine models were adopted in this study the blade inlet and outlet angles of the turbine models are summarized in table 2 and described in fig 3b 2 2 velocity diagrams the velocity diagram theoretically proposes the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the water in the two stages of cross flow turbine no flow losses through the inside of the runner were assumed which should give equal diagrams at the exit of the first stage and input of the second stage fig 4 shows the velocity triangles through the runner for four studied cases where v u and represent the absolute velocity the peripheral velocity and relative velocity respectively referring to fig 4 the increase of inlet and outlet angles of the runner β 1 β 2 decreased the angle of attack which theoretically led to the increase in the magnitude of the velocity in the first stage consequently the efficiency of this stage could be increased furthermore it resulted in the increase of the cross flow through the runner due to the increase of the direction of the exit velocity of the first stage as in cases 3 4 subsequently the efficiency of the second stage could be developed in conclusion based on the current configuration the efficiency of the turbine analytically tended to increase with the decrease of angle of attack and increase of the inlet and outlet angles 3 experimental apparatus the test rig consisted of water pump preference to variable speed pump loop channel system from and to water reservoir bidirectional diffuser augmented channel including two cross flow turbines with connection to the channel system the current channel had a total length of 3 2 m by which the present model system as shown in fig 1 was positioned in the middle of the channel plan and had a length of 1 2 m the overall length of the front and rear channels lc was 2 m with a width of the channel w 0 6 m and the channel depth h 0 6 m the water level at the channel inlet was 0 4 m as shown in fig 5 the main aim of the present study is to investigate the flow and performance characteristics of the proposed cft in the augmentation channels to improve the efficiency of the turbine in hydrokinetic mode by studying the influence of changing the inlet and outlet angles this was done through measuring the free flow water velocity mean inlet runner velocity turbine rpm tip speed ratio shaft torque output power torque coefficient and power coefficient power coefficient c p and torque coefficient c t of turbines were used to reflect the turbine performance and efficiency as presented in equations 1 and 2 1 c p t ω 0 5 ρ a u 0 3 2 c t t 0 5 ρ a r u 0 2 where t represents the output torque ω is the angular velocity of the turbine p c 0 5 ρ a u 0 3 is the maximum hydrokinetic power that can be extracted from the channel is the density of water a is the sectional area of the flow at the inlet of channel and indicates the flow stream velocity r represents the turbine radius it is important to determine the effects of tip speed ratio on the efficiency of the turbine runner tsr is the ratio of the peripheral velocity of the runner u to inflow jet speed v in order to get different values of tsr the angular velocity ω was varied whose tsr was calculated by using the equation below 3 t s r ω r v where v is the mean runner inlet velocity test measurement apparatus used in the current tests were a high speed camera digital torque sensor and rpm meters all of which had been calibrated the velocity of the flow of water through the channel system was measured by using a high speed 10 megapixel camera branded phantom v7 capable of taking 1 400 000 pictures per second with ultra fast 7 gpx second throughput 1280 800 at 7530 fps 300 ns digital exposure and is phantom cine mag compatible high speed camera was used to record videos at the plane of the channel system from the side view high speed camera was used as a particle tracking method where small lighter rings were used as tracking particles then the videos recorded by the high speed camera were imported to phantom camera control software to measure the velocities futek trs 605 torque meter was used to measure the turbine shaft torque and rotational speed torque sensors functioned to measure the torque with the aid of strain gages which were applied to the torsion section to undergo a change in impedance that depended on the torque this caused a voltage change that was proportional to the change in impedance and reached the evaluation instrument ibt 100 the load was changed by a brake system by which the rotational speed rpm of the turbine shaft was controlled the uncertainties for the experimental results in different parameters tsr torque coefficient and power coefficient were around 2 8 4 and 4 5 respectively 4 numerical approach in this research a finite volume method was used for discretizing the governing equations in ansys cfx the convective terms were discretized using second order upwind scheme and the pressure was interpolated using linear interpolation scheme while the central difference scheme was utilized for diffusion terms for the pressure velocity coupling simple semi implicit methods for pressure linked equation was utilized unsteady simulation was performed based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with sst k ω as introduced by menter kim et al 2015 for turbulence model this turbulence model combines k ω turbulence model and k ε model where k ω turbulence model is used in the near wall region and the k ε model is used in the free stream flow 4 1 governing equations the governing equations for the unsteady viscous and incompressible turbulent flow are the navier stokes equations which can be written in the following form menter 1994 4 u i x i 0 0 5 ρ u i t x i u i u

schemes and boundary conditions in this study 3d models of cft surrounding by bda system had been built and validated by current experimental tests the simulations were carried out in unsteady condition and ansys icem cfd software was used for meshing the models the computational grid was divided into three domains which are stationary domain main channel augmentation system and rotational domain cross flow turbines for the sliding mesh model banki turbines and augmentation channel were considered to be walls where the no slip condition was assigned to these walls in the different simulations the velocity had normal direction to the water model channel inlet the outlet boundary condition was specified according to the outflow and the reference pressure was set to atmospheric 1 bar the working fluid was water with density of 1000 and dynamic viscosity of 1x convergence was monitored through making dimensionless residual sum for all variables across the computational points time step t corresponded to 1 of rotation by the turbine interfaces of non conformal mesh were used with the stationary and rotating domains in this study sliding mesh model was used in the current study for predicting the flow properties and performance characteristics through cross flow turbines in the various cases the domains were meshed using hybrid structured hexahedron and unstructured tetrahedral grids as shown in fig 6 ultimately structured hexahedral mesh elements were used for the main channel while unstructured tetrahedral mesh elements were used for the cft and the augmentation channel in the present study four computational grids had been tested in this study to check the solution sensitivity table 3 describes four grid cells specifications for all domains power coefficients variations with tsr for lower turbine of case 3 which were determined for four grids are shown in fig 7 it was noticed that grid 3 and grid 4 gave acceptable and similar results while grid 4 required more time for solution hence grid 3 was chosen to carry out the investigations of this study 4 3 validation with experiment the present numerical study was validated with the experimental analysis of the current work to verify the numerical method used in the current study a good agreement between numerical and experimental results was reached for performance characteristics of lower turbine as presented in fig 8 the maximum range of error between experimental and numerical measurements for performance curve was within 6 5 9 the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results tends to minor experimental factors like channel and bda wall roughness wall gap at the channel connection and etc 5 results and discussions 5 1 numerical results and discussions the concluded results in ref elbatran et al 2015a recommended that it is important to get the most appropriate inlet and outlet angles to be used in the current configuration to increase the efficiency of the system the numerical simulation was carried out on the four different turbine angles and diameter ratio cases this study presents investigations on the effects of different runner inlet and outlet angles of banki turbines by measuring the performance and flow field characteristics of the turbines by different inlet and outlet angles 5 1 1 performance characteristics of four cases this section investigates the effects of different runner designs especially inlet and exit blade angles of the cft runner in the new current hydrokinetic flow stream in channel mode by measuring the performance characteristics of the cross flow at various blade angles the cft cases were tested at different tsr and various flow rates q figs 9 and 10 show the torque coefficient and power coefficient variations at different tsr for all cases of tested turbines from fig 9 it was noticed that the coefficient of torque increased with the decrease of tsr or with the decrease of rotational speed rpm on the other hand the power coefficient increased with increasing tsr until it reached a peak value at tsr of almost 0 44 for all cases of lower turbines and ranged from 0 62 to 0 68 for upper turbines it then decreased from the value onwards see fig 10 furthermore the power coefficient increased with increasing tsr until it reached a peak value at tsr of almost 0 46 for all cases of lower turbines and ranges from 0 62 to 0 7 for upper turbines it then decreased from here onwards see fig 10 the power coefficient increased with increasing tsr until it reached a peak value at tsr of almost 0 46 for all cases of lower turbines and ranges from 0 62 to 0 7 for upper turbines then decreasing from here onwards the highest power coefficient of the current cf turbines tends to increase with the increment of the inlet and outlet angle β 1 β 2 reached to 45 and 105 for β 1 a n d β 2 respectively after that the power coefficients were suddenly dropped in case 4 this was the effect of the inlet and outlet blade angles which lead to the perfect direction of the flow through the runner which resulted in increasing of the efficiency of the second stage in the present study regarding variations of inlet and outlet runner blade angles there has been a point by which the turbine case has peak output power and power coefficient efficiency the power coefficient of lower turbine which was recorded for case 3 was 0 575 at adequate values of tip speed ratio of around 0 42 these values were quite acceptable and agreed with the literature and theoretical study of balji balje 1981 this is while the upper runner achieved power coefficient efficiency of 0 48 at tsr 0 62 these values of the efficiency are very considerable in comparison to the original turbine efficiency used in hydrokinetic or current applications on the other hand the performance curves indicated that case 2 was the second perfect configuration for inlet and outlet angles which recorded power coefficients of 0 52 and 0 412 for lower and upper runners respectively this is while the cases 1 and 4 have shown very poor characteristics compared with case 2 and 3 the inlet runner flow rate q av is a very important factor for the input power of the current system because the input power is proportional to the flow rate p 0 5 ρqv 2 hence the inlet power will increase when the flow rate becomes larger meanwhile if the efficiency is constant the output power of the turbine will increase however this concept is not acceptable over time because the water at the nozzle inlet needs to be completely full so that the flow rate does not affect the peak efficiency of turbine fiuzat and akerkar 1991 the present study aims to get an appropriate flow rate at the intake of the system to define the maximum power and efficiency fig 11 illustrates the relation between the power coefficient and the inlet flow rate for all tested cases it was not necessary that the peak value of the efficiency occurs at the maximum flow rate every case had a different optimized flow rate according to its configurations the most efficient flow rates indicated for cases 1 2 3 and 4 of lower turbine were 0 051 0 0526 0 057 and 0 053 s respectively for upper case the appropriate flow rates were 0 034 0 044 0 045 and 0 042 s for cases 1 2 3 and 4 respectively moreover it was noticed that case 3 for upper and lower cases provided the best results for flow rate and efficiency the efficiency of the lower turbine was higher than that of the upper turbine this appeared for all cases of different angles this is seen in the increase of the inlet runner velocity v 1 of lower region and flow rate through lower turbine compared to the upper region this is due to the fact that the lower region occupied more area of water than the upper region the velocity through runner also increased due to the effects of gravity and extensively crossed flow through the lower runner in contrast it decreased in case of upper runner as described in the following sections of 5 2 and 5 3 5 2 flow field characteristics analysis the flow field characteristics through cft runner in the present configuration were studied to evaluate the turbine efficiency close views of velocity vectors at a central plane through the augmentation channel and the rotor blades are displayed in fig 12 entrained higher velocity flow of water between the turbine blade tips and casing was able to produce jet flow which contributed to added energy generation besides application of two main power stages hence the blades absorbed the energy through three stages causing them to rotate anticlockwise on the other hand the outlet velocity from the first stage was not the same with the inlet velocity from the second stage this shows a disagreement with the theoretical assumption v r 2 v r 3 but shows a good agreement with the current experimental results which is important to consider through the cft runner design the flow pattern here proves that there is a good agreement among the analytical experimental and numerical studies the cfd tool has been reached at this end enhancement of flow characteristics could be achieved using rectangular duct nozzle and naca nozzle surrounding the cf turbine runners fig 12 presents the importance of naca augmentation for increasing the mean inlet runner velocity of the water flowing the velocity indicated more values at the turbine inlet for lower regions than for the upper runner where the velocity increased due to the effects of gravity and crossed flow through the lower runner in contrast it decreased in the case of upper runner consequently the turbine indicated that the amount of kinetic energy harnessed by lower turbine was more than in the case of upper rotor this proves that the numerical and experimental results are comparable 5 2 1 the effects of the blades inlet and outlet angles on the flow characteristics a numerical simulation was carried out using four different turbine angles and diameter ratio cases vectors of water velocity for different runner blades inlet and outlet angles four cases for lower and upper turbines are shown in fig 13 velocity fields in the flow passage of the turbine are changed simultaneously with the variation of the inlet and outlet angles it was observed that the velocity flow vectors crossing the runner for case 3 and case 4 were different from those for case 1 and case 2 in these cases the blades angles made the flow more perpendicular on the blades leading to a decrease in the angle of attack and subsequently it results in an increase of the velocity in the first stage and improving the efficiency of this stage efficiency of the second stage has also increased due to the perfect direction of the cross flow through the runner making the cross flow more extensive than in the other two cases these angles configurations were also able to increase the area of the blades exposed to the incoming water so that the torque power and efficiency are increased in contrast the large values of inlet and outlet angles of case 3 and case 4 led to the shifting of the cross flow of water towards the shaft centre and increased flow recirculation especially for case 4 as shown in the black circle in fig 13 subsequently it was expected to reduce in the turning moment at the shaft centre due to water jet of the cross flow hence there is a slight reduction in the power output and efficiency nevertheless case 3 and 4 have the most effective internal flow characteristics for increasing of the efficiency of the two stages this result implies that one of these two cases is able to improve the turbine performance moreover the angles of case 2 gave a good internal flow pattern but they were not the most suitable degrees of the runner blades angles for the present configuration with respect to the flow fields the inlet runner velocity v 1 varied with the peripheral velocity u 1 ω r for the four cases as shown in fig 14 it was noticed that the mean intake rotor velocity for all cases considerably decreased with the increment of the peripheral velocity u 1 consequently the inlet velocity decreased with the increase of tsr in other words if the runner moved slowly the inlet runner velocity v 1 would increase besides the mean entrance velocity for the third case recorded higher values than did the other cases of the two turbines therefore the kinetic energy available in this case was more than those in the other cases consequently the power output was expected to increase as described in figs 9 and 10 regarding the turbine power characteristics moreover it was observed that there was a significant drop in the inlet water velocity in case 1 and case 4 due to the flow resistance caused by angle configuration in these cases an almost vertical angle caused some blockages at a lower flow rate regarding the flow analysis of the current section the second stage power played an important role in the output power of the turbines it was proven that the turbine s second stage contributed more than 30 of the total power the differences between the power of case 3 and case 1 signified the amount of power represented by the second stage this is because case 1 had little crossed flow to the second stage the effects of tsr on the flow field characteristics for case 3 are presented in fig 15 the increase in the tsr stems from the decrease in the inlet runner velocity v 1 in addition an increase in the peripheral velocity u 1 is due to the decrease of the cross flow intensity rate through the runner this leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the runner especially for the second stage although the flow in some cases such as tsr 0 44 has no perfect cross flow properties through the runner like in case of tsr 0 26 the cross flow of water in this case deflects away from the shaft centre therefore the recirculating flow of upper part of the runner decreased consequently the torque and power coefficients of the turbine improved water flow passed more extensively and quickly through the runner when the turbine rotated slowly or when the tsr decreased additionally the maximum efficiency occurs when the interaction of the flow and the runner is maximized at appropriate tsr the pressure variations in the augmentation channel and through upstream and downstream of the turbine are presented in fig 16 the pressure difference created in the runner by the lower pressure in the accelerating region upper surface and the higher pressure in the decelerating region lower surface was found able to generate energy 5 3 experimental results the bda system presented in the current study is planned to be utilized in micro open water channels and rivers with low velocity regions to enhance the water flow and increase the extracted hydrokinetic power the numerical results and discussion of this study have proven that a higher value of the inlet and outlet blade angles can cause the water flow to pass perfectly through the runner leading to a larger torque power and efficiency furthermore the angles of 45 and 105 for inlet and outlet with diameter ratio of 0 68 case 3 provide the effective results in a higher efficiency than do other angles this runner configuration for lower and upper regions was capable of producing maximum power output and peak efficiency therefore the most appropriate runner design that can be used for two turbines in the present channel configuration was in case 3 consequently case 3 results are presented here the velocity measured lines measured by using high speed cameras for lower and upper regions were positioned at y 0 3 z 0 22 and y 0 3 z 0 3 respectively the velocity ratio values tracking for lower and upper regions experimentally measured along a central plane through the bda system are shown in fig 17 it was noticed that the presented application is likely to increase the speed of fluid increasing the speed can be a significant factor in designing channels low speed current appearance in this study the water velocity increased with the decrease of the area of the contraction along the bda system due to the presence of two directed nozzles the velocity values for lower and upper regions increased to 2 1 and 1 3 times respectively than those of the free stream inlet velocity at the end of the first nozzle the naca nozzle had significantly increased the water velocity by about 3 2 times and 2 3 times than that of the system free stream inlet velocity for lower and upper regions respectively it was observed that the velocities ratio of lower region were more than the upper region because the lower region occupied more area of water than the upper part moreover the velocity indicated almost 3 2 u o and 2 3 u o at the turbine inlet for lower and upper turbines respectively and it started to decrease behind the turbine which recorded nearly 1 4 u o and 1 3 u o the differences between the values of velocities in front of and behind the turbine presented the amount of kinetic energy harnessed by turbines it was clearly seen that this difference through the lower turbine was more than the upper runner because the lower turbine was in a normal mode of operation and the crossed flow through the turbine was more extensive hence it is expected that by this design the kinetic power and efficiency of lower runner would be more than those of upper turbine the variations of the mean inlet runner velocity ratio v 1 u o and peripheral or circumferential velocity ratio u 1 u o ωr u o with tsr are shown in fig 18 it was noticed that the mean inlet of runner velocity for two turbines decreased with the increase of tsr while the peripheral or circumferential velocity increased with the increment of tsr in other words the inlet flow of water passed more quickly through the runner when the turbine rotated slowly furthermore the inlet runner velocity and circumferential velocity for the lower turbine reached higher values than those of upper turbine this is reasonable based on the reasons as in the previous section fig 19 illustrates the performance characteristics curves of two tested lower and upper turbines the torque coefficient decreased with the increase of tsr or with the increment of rotational speed rpm the maximum output torque coefficients values recorded for the lower and upper turbines were about 0 76 and 0 5 respectively these numbers were obtained at the lowest values of tsr and rpm it was also noticed that the torque coefficient c t for lower runner was more than that in upper case because the lower area of flow stream is more than the flow area available for upper region the power coefficient c p of the lower and upper turbines tended to increase with the increase of tsr until it reached the peak values and then decreased the maximum power coefficients were 0 612 and 0 473 for lower and upper turbines respectively these coefficients of power were obtained at tsr of 0 66 and 0 52 for lower and upper runner respectively the highest efficiency of overall system with the two cross flow turbines was 0 557 6 conclusion a new cross flow turbine based on the banki concept was developed and deployed in the present augmentation channel the cft runners in the present hydrokinetic system are utilized without the need for special casing nozzles entry arc and guide vanes hence the inlet and outlet runner blades angles and diameter ratio play an important role in the direction of the cross flow through the runner in overall efficiency of the system the most efficient runner design that can be used for the two turbines in the present channel configuration has the appropriate inlet and outlet angles of 45 and 105 respectively and the diameter ratio of 0 68 turbines operation and performance in the new channel arrangement have been analyzed and evaluated experiments were conducted to determine the power coefficients of the turbines which were found to be 0 612 and 0 473 for the lower and upper turbines respectively furthermore the maximum power coefficients were numerically obtained as 0 575 and 0 48 for lower and upper turbines respectively a good agreement was observed between the current numerical and experimental results for flow pattern through the bda system and performance characteristics of the two turbines the maximum final power coefficient of overall system which includes two cross flow turbines was 0 557 this system promises a sufficient performance and a higher efficiency compared to the conventional hydrokinetic turbines and cft systems utilized in the wave and tidal power generation scheme acknowledgment the authors would like to express sincere

23383,this paper investigates the finite time extended state observer based distributed formation control for marine surface vehicles with input saturation and external disturbances initially a novel finite time extended state observer is proposed to estimate the unavailable velocity measurements and external disturbances simultaneously no longer regarding the time derivative of external disturbances as zero the proposed finite time extended state observer is designed by transforming the disturbances as an extended state of the system to be estimated then based on the estimated values a distributed finite time formation controller is designed for a group of marine surface vehicles to track a time varying virtual leader the position state of virtual leader only can be accessed by a subset of the group members furthermore a saturation function is incorporated into the controller to solve the input saturation problem finally a rigorous proof demonstrates that the finite time stability of the proposed extended state observer and formation controller can be guaranteed by using homogeneous method and lyapunov theory numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control scheme keywords marine surface vehicles formation control finite time extended state observer homogeneous method input saturation disturbances 1 introduction in recent years with the rapid development of ocean engineering the motion control of marine surface vehicle msv has attracted significant attention skjetne et al 2002 dong and farrell 2008 do 2010 yi et al 2016 du et al 2016 especially the formation control of multiple msvs this is because of the fact that a group of networked vehicles can perform many complicated tasks more effectively than a single vehicle such as sea investigation exploration maritime rescue and surveillance børhaug et al 2011 among the various control strategies proposed to achieve the desired formation in the literature balch and arkin 1998 edwards et al 2004 fua et al 2007 ren and sorensen 2008 the leader follower scheme is preferred for formation control of msvs because of its reliability and simplicity breivik et al 2008 cui et al 2010 based on this some nonlinear control techniques by full state feedback for msvs have been proposed to obtain desirable performance and stability e g just to name a few backstepping control ghommam and mnif 2009 sliding mode control fahimi 2007 passivity control wang et al 2012 adaptive dynamic surface control peng et al 2013 note that the measurements of velocity cannot always be obtained in practice sometimes in order to reduce weight and cost or even because of sensor failures therefore the full state feedback formation control schemes cannot be directly applied to the msvs without velocity measurements in addition most of the existing formation control schemes assume that the actuator of each vehicle is able to generate arbitrary level of control signals in practice because of the actuators physical limitations the generated control signals may compel the actuators exceeding their capabilities this in turn may lead to deterioration of control performance especially in the transient response or even system instability meanwhile another fact cannot be ignored that is the dynamics of msv in 3 degree of freedom dof surge sway and yaw are strongly coupled and the motion of msv inevitably suffers from environmental disturbances induced by winds waves and ocean currents recently these problems mentioned above have been discussed separately for distributed control of msvs wang et al 2014a zheng and sun 2016 wang et al 2014b liu et al 2015 peng et al 2016 in wang et al 2014a and zheng and sun 2016 the cooperative path following problem for multiple msvs subject to input saturation and disturbances has been considered where the velocity measurements of the vehicles are assumed to be available wang et al 2014b has proposed a high gain observer based formation control scheme for msvs without measuring the velocity of each vehicle in liu et al 2015 the cooperative dynamic positioning of msvs with dynamical uncertainty and disturbances has been considered then in peng et al 2016 a modular design approach based cooperative control scheme has been presented for the dynamic positioning of multiple offshore vessels with ocean disturbances and has been extended to the output feedback case however in wang et al 2014b liu et al 2015 and peng et al 2016 the input saturation problem is not considered in shojaei 2015 and shojaei 2016 the observer based neural adaptive formation control has been addressed respectively for under actuated and fully actuated msvs with limited torque under environmental disturbances based on the above discussions it should be pointed out that all the aforementioned formation controllers can only obtain asymptotic convergence at best which implies that exact convergence cannot be guaranteed in finite time in contrast finite time controllers enable the system errors converge within finite time and thus obtain faster convergence speed and better disturbance rejection properties zou 2014 hu et al 2014 hu and zhang 2015 in li et al 2015 the finite time output feedback trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicle has been investigated in yan et al 2015 the globally finite time tracking control strategy for underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs with model parameter perturbation has been addressed in wang et al 2016 the finite time tracking control scheme for a single msv with unknown time varying disturbances has been studied liu et al 2017 have proposed the nonlinear disturbance observer based finite time control law for underwater vehicle with uncertainties and external disturbances however how to solve all the aforementioned problems i e input saturation unavailable velocity measurements external disturbances simultaneously for msvs to obtain the desired formation in finite time is still an open issue the main contribution of this paper is to propose the finite time extended state observer based distributed formation control scheme for fully actuated msvs subject to input saturation and time varying disturbances more specifically the extended state observer eso which was first proposed in han 1995 has the capability of state observation and can provide real time estimation of system uncertainties and disturbances does not dependent on accurate system model although a variety of eso based controllers have been developed and successfully verified by many applications talole et al 2010 yao et al 2014 cui et al 2016 the eso can only achieve asymptotic convergence in contrast the proposed finite time extended state observer fteso not only can estimate the velocity measurements and time varying disturbances simultaneously but also can achieve bounded estimated errors in finite time in addition the extension of the finite time control algorithms from the single one to the multiple vehicles is nontrivial especially that only a subset of followers can obtain the state information of the virtual leader under such a circumstance a distributed finite time formation controller ftfc is constructed based on the estimated values and a saturation function is incorporated into the controller such that the actual control signals can be constrained by using homogeneous method and lyapunov function all signals of the closed loop system can be guaranteed to be bounded in finite time this paper is organized as follows several preliminaries and problem formulation are presented in section 2 section 3 addresses the fteso and distributed ftfc for msvs with theoretical analysis on finite time convergence and section 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme by presenting numerical simulation results conclusions are provided in section 5 2 preliminaries and problem

the networked system consisting of a group of msvs described by 6 7 with unavailable velocity measurements and external disturbances and subject to input saturation suppose that assumptions 1 3 are

there exist appropriate parameters k m λ m m 1 2 3 such that all signals in the closed loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded uub and the bounded tracking errors can be achieved in finite time

actual formation trajectories under ftfc 31 in the plane are shown in fig 3 from which we can see that the proposed ftfc 31 can achieve fast transient response and high steady state accuracy despite the presence of external disturbances and input saturation and lack of velocity measurements the control input signals under the ftfc 31 are shown in fig 4 the actual control signals are saturated within τ i m 50 in order to better show the convergence speed and robustness of the proposed fteso 8 and ftfc 31 the following linear extend state observer leso cui et al 2016 and asymptotic formation

fteso 8 and leso 42 are presented in fig 5 a and b respectively it can be seen that the estimated errors of fteso converge to the small neighborhood of zero with considerable faster converge speed and higher accuracy than the estimated errors of leso as shown in fig 6 a in surge sway and yaw direction the position tracking errors under ftfc 31 are convergent to a small neighborhood contains zero in finite time respectively then the position tracking errors of afc 43 under the same actuator levels are presented in fig 6b as it can be observed that the position tracking errors converge to e 1 i m 5 10 3 within 30 s under ftfc whereas when using afc the position tracking errors drop to e 1 i m 5 10 3 more than 100 s and the tracking curves have the greater overshoot hence the ftfc remarkably accelerates the convergence speed the velocity tracking errors of ftfc 31 and afc 43 are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the response curves in fig 7a have a faster convergence speed than in fig 7b and achieve higher steady state accuracy at last it should be pointed out that the ftfc and fteso can achieve remarkable control performance in terms of both convergence speed and disturbance rejection properties 5 conclusions a finite time output feedback distributed formation control scheme for fully actuated msvs with input saturation and disturbances is investigated in this paper different from the existing works in the literature both the velocity free input saturation and external disturbances are simultaneously taken into account for the design of ftfc of msvs a fteso is constructed to estimate the velocity measurements and external disturbances simultaneously in finite time the position of virtual leader is accessible only to a subset of the group members and the communication topology graph between the vehicles is assumed to be undirected and connected detailed simulation results of the performance comparison between ftfc and afc are given it is shown that the proposed fteso and ftfc can provide faster convergence speed and better disturbance rejection ability with higher accuracy than the asymptotic ones in addition the scheme proposed in this paper can be extended to the under actuated msvs by taking proper adjustment which is open for the further investigation acknowledgement this work was supported by national technology momentous special

23383,this paper investigates the finite time extended state observer based distributed formation control for marine surface vehicles with input saturation and external disturbances initially a novel finite time extended state observer is proposed to estimate the unavailable velocity measurements and external disturbances simultaneously no longer regarding the time derivative of external disturbances as zero the proposed finite time extended state observer is designed by transforming the disturbances as an extended state of the system to be estimated then based on the estimated values a distributed finite time formation controller is designed for a group of marine surface vehicles to track a time varying virtual leader the position state of virtual leader only can be accessed by a subset of the group members furthermore a saturation function is incorporated into the controller to solve the input saturation problem finally a rigorous proof demonstrates that the finite time stability of the proposed extended state observer and formation controller can be guaranteed by using homogeneous method and lyapunov theory numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control scheme keywords marine surface vehicles formation control finite time extended state observer homogeneous method input saturation disturbances 1 introduction in recent years with the rapid development of ocean engineering the motion control of marine surface vehicle msv has attracted significant attention skjetne et al 2002 dong and farrell 2008 do 2010 yi et al 2016 du et al 2016 especially the formation control of multiple msvs this is because of the fact that a group of networked vehicles can perform many complicated tasks more effectively than a single vehicle such as sea investigation exploration maritime rescue and surveillance børhaug et al 2011 among the various control strategies proposed to achieve the desired formation in the literature balch and arkin 1998 edwards et al 2004 fua et al 2007 ren and sorensen 2008 the leader follower scheme is preferred for formation control of msvs because of its reliability and simplicity breivik et al 2008 cui et al 2010 based on this some nonlinear control techniques by full state feedback for msvs have been proposed to obtain desirable performance and stability e g just to name a few backstepping control ghommam and mnif 2009 sliding mode control fahimi 2007 passivity control wang et al 2012 adaptive dynamic surface control peng et al 2013 note that the measurements of velocity cannot always be obtained in practice sometimes in order to reduce weight and cost or even because of sensor failures therefore the full state feedback formation control schemes cannot be directly applied to the msvs without velocity measurements in addition most of the existing formation control schemes assume that the actuator of each vehicle is able to generate arbitrary level of control signals in practice because of the actuators physical limitations the generated control signals may compel the actuators exceeding their capabilities this in turn may lead to deterioration of control performance especially in the transient response or even system instability meanwhile another fact cannot be ignored that is the dynamics of msv in 3 degree of freedom dof surge sway and yaw are strongly coupled and the motion of msv inevitably suffers from environmental disturbances induced by winds waves and ocean currents recently these problems mentioned above have been discussed separately for distributed control of msvs wang et al 2014a zheng and sun 2016 wang et al 2014b liu et al 2015 peng et al 2016 in wang et al 2014a and zheng and sun 2016 the cooperative path following problem for multiple msvs subject to input saturation and disturbances has been considered where the velocity measurements of the vehicles are assumed to be available wang et al 2014b has proposed a high gain observer based formation control scheme for msvs without measuring the velocity of each vehicle in liu et al 2015 the cooperative dynamic positioning of msvs with dynamical uncertainty and disturbances has been considered then in peng et al 2016 a modular design approach based cooperative control scheme has been presented for the dynamic positioning of multiple offshore vessels with ocean disturbances and has been extended to the output feedback case however in wang et al 2014b liu et al 2015 and peng et al 2016 the input saturation problem is not considered in shojaei 2015 and shojaei 2016 the observer based neural adaptive formation control has been addressed respectively for under actuated and fully actuated msvs with limited torque under environmental disturbances based on the above discussions it should be pointed out that all the aforementioned formation controllers can only obtain asymptotic convergence at best which implies that exact convergence cannot be guaranteed in finite time in contrast finite time controllers enable the system errors converge within finite time and thus obtain faster convergence speed and better disturbance rejection properties zou 2014 hu et al 2014 hu and zhang 2015 in li et al 2015 the finite time output feedback trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicle has been investigated in yan et al 2015 the globally finite time tracking control strategy for underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs with model parameter perturbation has been addressed in wang et al 2016 the finite time tracking control scheme for a single msv with unknown time varying disturbances has been studied liu et al 2017 have proposed the nonlinear disturbance observer based finite time control law for underwater vehicle with uncertainties and external disturbances however how to solve all the aforementioned problems i e input saturation unavailable velocity measurements external disturbances simultaneously for msvs to obtain the desired formation in finite time is still an open issue the main contribution of this paper is to propose the finite time extended state observer based distributed formation control scheme for fully actuated msvs subject to input saturation and time varying disturbances more specifically the extended state observer eso which was first proposed in han 1995 has the capability of state observation and can provide real time estimation of system uncertainties and disturbances does not dependent on accurate system model although a variety of eso based controllers have been developed and successfully verified by many applications talole et al 2010 yao et al 2014 cui et al 2016 the eso can only achieve asymptotic convergence in contrast the proposed finite time extended state observer fteso not only can estimate the velocity measurements and time varying disturbances simultaneously but also can achieve bounded estimated errors in finite time in addition the extension of the finite time control algorithms from the single one to the multiple vehicles is nontrivial especially that only a subset of followers can obtain the state information of the virtual leader under such a circumstance a distributed finite time formation controller ftfc is constructed based on the estimated values and a saturation function is incorporated into the controller such that the actual control signals can be constrained by using homogeneous method and lyapunov function all signals of the closed loop system can be guaranteed to be bounded in finite time this paper is organized as follows several preliminaries and problem formulation are presented in section 2 section 3 addresses the fteso and distributed ftfc for msvs with theoretical analysis on finite time convergence and section 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme by presenting numerical simulation results conclusions are provided in section 5 2 preliminaries and problem

actual formation trajectories under ftfc 31 in the plane are shown in fig 3 from which we can see that the proposed ftfc 31 can achieve fast transient response and high steady state accuracy despite the presence of external disturbances and input saturation and lack of velocity measurements the control input signals under the ftfc 31 are shown in fig 4 the actual control signals are saturated within τ i m 50 in order to better show the convergence speed and robustness of the proposed fteso 8 and ftfc 31 the following linear extend state observer leso cui et al 2016 and asymptotic formation

fteso 8 and leso 42 are presented in fig 5 a and b respectively it can be seen that the estimated errors of fteso converge to the small neighborhood of zero with considerable faster converge speed and higher accuracy than the estimated errors of leso as shown in fig 6 a in surge sway and yaw direction the position tracking errors under ftfc 31 are convergent to a small neighborhood contains zero in finite time respectively then the position tracking errors of afc 43 under the same actuator levels are presented in fig 6b as it can be observed that the position tracking errors converge to e 1 i m 5 10 3 within 30 s under ftfc whereas when using afc the position tracking errors drop to e 1 i m 5 10 3 more than 100 s and the tracking curves have the greater overshoot hence the ftfc remarkably accelerates the convergence speed the velocity tracking errors of ftfc 31 and afc 43 are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the response curves in fig 7a have a faster convergence speed than in fig 7b and achieve higher steady state accuracy at last it should be pointed out that the ftfc and fteso can achieve remarkable control performance in terms of both convergence speed and disturbance rejection properties 5 conclusions a finite time output feedback distributed formation control scheme for fully actuated msvs with input saturation and disturbances is investigated in this paper different from the existing works in the literature both the velocity free input saturation and external disturbances are simultaneously taken into account for the design of ftfc of msvs a fteso is constructed to estimate the velocity measurements and external disturbances simultaneously in finite time the position of virtual leader is accessible only to a subset of the group members and the communication topology graph between the vehicles is assumed to be undirected and connected detailed simulation results of the performance comparison between ftfc and afc are given it is shown that the proposed fteso and ftfc can provide faster convergence speed and better disturbance rejection ability with higher accuracy than the asymptotic ones in addition the scheme proposed in this paper can be extended to the under actuated msvs by taking proper adjustment which is open for the further investigation acknowledgement this work was supported by national technology momentous special

23384,experiments on a strained cable excited by mean flow in a hydrodynamic tunnel have been performed in large cavitation tunnel gth from dga hydrodynamics measurements of cable displacement have been performed by high speed imaging system particular optical configuration around tunnel section has imposed the development of a new calibration model to take into account dioptric distortion preliminary tests have been conducted to ensure calibration efficiency with large windows moreover to track the cable displacement a technique called blind point tracking method has been developed this technique is presented and takes advantage of axi symmetry of cable and from epipolar geometry properties thanks to these several developments different behaviours of cable can be easily studied keywords vortex induced vibrations calibration model blind point tracking high speed imaging 1 introduction vortex induced vibrations viv on cable are critical problems for safety and reliability and remain a subject of great importance in many different domains as aeolian applications transmission lines conductors excited by wind or marine applications marine risers cable of ship towing body or hydrophone cables of seismic lines for example these viv are generally explained in literature by coupling effects between two natural phenomena natural mechanical vibration motion of a strained cable at a frequency f n and the vortex shedding frequency f s due to the flow around the cable the natural frequency f n can be calculated with the principal parameters the length and the strain of the cable and its linear mass this vibration is exactly the same as the vibration used in musical applications for instruments as piano or harpsichord the motion could be composed of several modes which are all harmonic of fundamental frequency f n considering the flow around the cable we define the reynolds number r e u d ν with u the flow velocity d the cable diameter and ν the kinematic viscosity of the surrounding fluid reynolds number is the governing parameter for the flow around a stationary circular cylinder different flow regimes could be observed in the wake downstream the cylinder depending of reynolds number value schlichting 2000 beyond a value around 50 vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder occurs flow instability produces vortices that grow alternately on each side of the cable the shedding of a vortex is produced when the shear layer of the next upcoming vortex interacts with the opposite side shear layer cancelling its vorticity because of its different sign the frequency f s can be expressed with the strouhal number s t f s u d strouhal number is practically constant in the sub critical regime r e 10 6 and its value is approximately 0 2 with a non static cylinder as a riser once the oscillations start the flow is modified and the excitation affecting the moving cable changes which again modifies the response and so on one of the fundamental features of viv is the ability of the cable oscillating at its natural frequency f n to synchronize the vortex shedding frequency f s when the cable oscillates laterally to the flow it can synchronize the vortex formation frequency with the cable natural frequency this phenomena is called lock in experimentally the force could reach a peak resonance phenomena at an excitation frequency slightly below the natural shedding frequency f s rather like the response of a simple oscillator to harmonic forcing williamson and roshko 1988 in the lock in range vortex shedding is not controlled by the strouhal law but by the cable motion at the upper end of the lock in range a sudden jump changes the frequency of vortex shedding to the value predicted by the strouhal relationship for a stationary cylinder experimentally a hysteresis behaviour occurs the amplitude is higher when increasing the flow velocity than when decreasing in water some differences are noticed due to the added mass term the fluid structure coupling is more important in marine applications than in aeolian ones the lock in range is not as close to the natural frequency of cable vibration and also that the range extends over a larger span of velocity different modes of vortex shedding along the span are reported in literature and found to be important in lock in process and particularly for mode transition yamamoto et al 2004 these different vortex structures in the wake of the cable have been identified by williamson and roshko 1988 and displayed in an amplitude flow velocity diagram the incidence angle of cable referenced to the flow direction is one of the other influencing parameters as the uniformity of flow hong et al 2011 as commented by vandiver 1998 the challenges are still the lack of understanding of the fluid structure interaction physics the need for adequate structural models the need for high quality multi mode full scale data the necessity to further develop data analysis techniques to better understand the results and the industrial need for effective suppression devices whilst the structural modelling has positively evolved together with the data analysis techniques in the past decade the mechanisms that rule the fluid structure interaction and the need for full scale or laboratory data are still a major concern as briefly explained the phenomenon is influenced by many parameters which have to be measured experimentally the main objective of the experiment described in this paper is to propose an optical technique for the measurement of the cable movement and to assess its availability the choice of an optical technique is governed by the desire to use a non intrusive method therefore dga hydrodynamics as conducted an academic experiment in its large cavitation tunnel gth the experimental set up is described in the section 2 different improvements of optical processing techniques have been developed these improvements involve firstly the optical calibration of a camera in our particular configuration and secondly a tracking process called blind point tracking method both are presented in section 3 the section 4 presents a first experiment dedicated to calibration tests these tests have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration model finally in section 5 experimental results of the strain cable in flow are reported and analysed focusing on accuracy provided by the developed technique just before concluding 2 experimental set up since its first use in 1988 the large cavitation tunnel gth remains a performing experimental facility to conduct innovative experiments to improve the design of ship propulsors especially with regard to cavitation but also in hydroacoustic domain gth is a close circuit tunnel of demineralized water fully comparable to wind tunnel in aerodynamic domain it is mainly composed by two test sections as shown by fig 1 each test section is equipped with large perspex windows allowing high visibility on model and also laser or high speed video measurements while one test section is in use model preparation can be done on the other one as each test section can be isolated using closing doors located downstream and upstream the two test sections the small test section dimensions 1 14 m x 1 14 m x 6 m is more dedicated to studies at very high speed up to 20 m s 1 while the large test section dimensions 2 m x 1 35 m x 10 m is more dedicated to propeller tests with complete hull apparatus the water velocity and pressure are continuously variable 0 v 20 m s 1 5 k p a p 500 k p a for the small test section and 0 v 12 m s 1 5 k p a p 200 k p a for the large test section see lecoffre et al 1987 for more information on gth moreover air content is controlled and can be adjusted as the nuclei content necessary for cavitation testing for example gth is equipped with an efficient de aeration process for its 3600 m 3 of water as shown by fig 2 an experiment has been conducted in the gth from dga hydrodynamics this experiment consisted of a strained cable surrounded by water and excited by a mean flow at different velocities the cable has an incidence angle of 15 as schematically shown by fig 3 to perform the image capture two synchronized phantom cameras v211 sensor of 1280 800 pixels have been set up to catch approximately the half of cable length each camera was equipped with an optical zoom focal length between 24 and 85 mm adjusted near 40 mm in order to fit the measuring plane with the cable the lens aperture was reduced to f 8 0 in order to increase the depth of field thanks to this particular optical set up no scheimpflug apparatus was needed moreover the sampling frequency of camera has been adjusted at 1 khz this high frequency allows reaching a sufficient time resolution to catch modal movement of cable expected lower than 100 hz high light density was provided by two 1 2 kw spotlights allowing short aperture times down to 100μs without blur fig 4 presents a view and a zoom from the rear of right camera the alternative black and white circlets painted on the cable can be seen the distances between two consecutive circlets of same colour are not regular the average distance is estimated around 5 cm in our application the challenges were to overcome the effect of different dioptres to look on the 3d object from the optic of camera four optical index changes happen for optical rays to run across measurement volume in addition to classical distortions by optics these several dioptres can be at the origin of discrepancies which can disturb measurements to prevent from such distortions a calibration model has been developed and is presented in the following section 3 image processing developments 3 1 main principle of stereo vision the stereo imaging technique is based on the use of at least 2 cameras that record stereo images of the object of interest as shown on fig 5 a relationship between the camera ccd pixel coordinates u v and the actual physical point of the object x y z can be found using a distortion free pinhole camera model and expressed for each camera as u l 1 x l 2 y l 3 z l 4 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 v l 5 x l 6 y l 7 z l 8 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 the coordinates of the real point p could be computed from the coordinates u v on each camera which is generally called the triangulation method according to x y z f u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 the coefficients of the model l i are found using a calibration procedure that uses a grid of points and which is described further in the paper the first problem to be solved in the stereo imaging measurement technique is matching two corresponding images points p 1 u 1 v 1 and p 2 u 2 v 2 from camera 1 and camera 2 basically the task is to find which point p 2 from camera 2 is corresponding to a point p 1 of camera 1 taking into account the fact that both points p 1 and p 2 are related to the same physical point p this matching research begins by using a so called epipolar property which reduces the number of points to look at for finding this property is telling that the potential corresponding points of p 1 of camera 1 are the points on camera 2 that are aligned on the epipolar line see fig 6 then a normalized cross correlation of intensity values of window around point p 1 and of window around point p 2 is used to measure the likelihood of a match the central pixel of the search window around p 2 where the highest normalized cross correlation value occurs is stored as the corresponding point to p 1 in order to make the matching analysis working the surface of the object requires to have a pattern or to look rough to achieve a high level of accuracy of the position of the object of interest the simplified model is not sufficient optical distortion of cameras as well as optical distortion of the test section dioptres the cameras are looking through have to be taken into account this is presented in the following paragraph 3 2 calibration the optical arrangement used in our experimental apparatus is presented in fig 7 from a top view for each camera we can see the presence of a water box composed by a thin perspex window and water filled just after the water box optical path goes through a 12 cm thick window in perspex in back of this window the measurement domain is filled with demineralized water classical calibration model used for a camera is the pinhole model all distortions that can be taken into account are different from one model to another one the calibration procedure consists of positioning a calibrated target with dots having controlled distances between them and computing the different parameters of the model which are minimizing errors the particular optical paths geometry of our configuration can be decomposed into several steps which are the entrance of optical path through the first window of water box in the water domain of the water box see paragraph 3 2 1 the way through the large window of tunnel to come out into the measurement domain in the channel described in paragraph 3 2 2 these two steps are described in the following paragraphs 3 2 1 entrance in water domain of water box the effect of the two direction modifications from the water box window is described in this paragraph consider the real principal point of the camera to be c the real world like schematically explained by fig 8 an optical ray from c is deflected to another direction by the two dioptres air window and window water it s the same to consider the real but complex configuration air window water as a configuration where the camera is dived into the water medium with different parameters like position and focal length the position c is defined by the direction θ 2 in the water domain simple optical geometric relations with the small angle hypothesis gauss approximation could show that the imaginary position of the camera c is distant from the real position c of an algebraic distance δ d equals to δ d d 1 n 2 n 1 h 1 n 2 n 3 with d the distance between the point c and the window h the thickness of the window and n 1 n 2 and n 3 the refractive index of air water and perspex respectively it could also be shown in gauss approximation that the equivalent focal length f 2 can be computed from the following equation f 2 f 1 n 2 n 1 with f 1 the focal length in air f 2 the focal length in water thanks to these two equations the optical configuration for one camera can be advantageously replaced by an equivalent camera as if it was immerged in water like schematically presented in fig 9 3 2 2 entrance in water domain of the channel via large window from the equivalent configuration right picture of fig 9 it can be seen that a dioptric effect is present between the camera and the measurement domain in channel if we focus on one optical ray going through a perspex window as shown by fig 10 we can see that the ray is simply shifted the ray direction is not disturbed as long as the faces of window are perfectly parallels that means that a ray with an incident angle θ 1 maintains its direction θ 1 after going through the window moreover we can express the spatial lag d as a function of the thickness h and the incidence angle θ 1 1 d h sin θ 1 1 cos θ 1 r n 2 sin 2 θ 1 with the index ratio r n n 1 n 2 in most of configurations windows are crossed over with a normal angle this means that generally incident angles are close to zero equation 1 shows that for such small θ 1 the spatial lag will be very tiny moreover it will be symmetrical and could be taken into account by classical calibration distortion model as long as distortions are considered in our configuration the angle θ 1 is typically around 45 fig 11 presents the optical way through a window with an angle α 0 around 45 we can appreciate that the dioptric effect imposes a spatial shift d α which depends on incident angle α moreover this spatial shift is not symmetrical evolution of image from the measurement volume will be distorted by the window dioptre because the shift d will depend on angle α that is on position of the point in the sensor in y direction fig 12 on the left part shows the evolution of d α from equation 1 projected on camera sensor with arbitrary unity against the angle β which represents the collected angle of sensor the right part of the fig 12 presents the error made by using the different models expressed in percent the simulation has been conducted in our configuration that is for α 0 equals to 45 therefore effect on the sensor was estimated to be in a square effect and the error less than 1 considered low enough refinement by increasing fitting order was not found to improve considerably accuracy of the model besides as discussed later increasing order of calibration model leads to more complex calibration methods that are then tricky to develop with sufficient confidence on convergence process then a new model for distortions adapted to our configuration has been developed and is presented in the following paragraph 3 3 new calibration model classical calibration model uses pinhole model for the geometrical aspect of a sensor mc glone et al 2004 represented by a rotation matrix a translation vector called extrinsic parameters and intrinsic parameters which are focal length linked to the real size of each pixel of sensor and principal point the center of the optical sensor several authors give different methods to have an estimate of all these parameters faugeras and toscani 1986 weng et al 1992 tsai 1987 salvi et al 2002 we have chosen the method of faugeras for a non distortion calibration in addition different distortions must be taken into account when particular optical configurations like radial tangential prismatic distortions among all models we have tested a radial distortion model by faugeras and the weng model which take into account all these three distortions the calibration model from weng et al 1992 can be expressed for the distortion part by δ u k 1 u u 2 v 2 g 1 v 2 g 1 g 3 u 2 g 4 u v δ v k 1 v u 2 v 2 g 2 v 2 g 2 g 4 u 2 g 3 u v with u and v being the normalized coordinates on sensor δ u and δ v the distortions on x and y axis respectively that have to be added on triangulation process k 1 g i are the different model distortion parameters the faugeras model with radial distortion consider only the k 1 parameter following the conclusion of paragraph 3 2 2 we add two other terms in linear and square form to this model in order to take into account dioptric distortion we obtain a whole model which can be expressed as 2 δ u k 1 u u 2 v 2 g 1 v 2 g 1 g 3 g 7 u 2 g 4 u v g 5 u δ v k 1 v u 2 v 2 g 2 v 2 g 2 g 4 g 8 u 2 g 3 u v g 6 u like all these models the non linear terms inhibit from developing direct method for calibration process an iterative method in two steps has been designed to converge on a least mean square sense solution the first step is to consider no distortion a method as faugeras one allows to compute extrinsic and intrinsic parameters a second step consists of fixing these parameters and to compute with for example a newton raphson method parameters for distortions iterative steps then start fixing alternatively extrinsic and intrinsic parameters or distortions parameters the procedure stops when the number of maximum iteration is reached or when the accuracy of parameters is less than a given value table 1 resumes the different model tested and all parameters used for each calibration model 3 4 normalized stereo calibration error historically weng et al 1992 has proposed the normalized stereo calibration error nsce criterion in order to compare efficiency of calibration model in different configurations this criterion is very helpful for calibration comparison because the normalization done in z plane allows getting absolute values independently of size of measurement volume for example nsce must have the lowest value as possible because it computes an average of discrepancies between all the real 3d points used for calibration x i y i z i supposed to be exact and back projection of coordinates of these points in z plane the back projection uses calibration parameters and produces coordinates x i ˆ y i ˆ the formulation of nsce is then defined by weng et al 1992 3 n s c e 1 n i 1 n x i ˆ x i 2 y i ˆ y i 2 z i ˆ 2 1 12 1 f x 2 1 f y 2 with f x and f y the focal length for x and y axes obviously for the same data set of images this criterion could be used easily to compare whatever the value obtained so long they are low 3 5 blind point tracking technique in our experiment the aim of the measurement device is to be able to track the movement of a cable the cable is defined by the line including all the center of each circular cross section saying the axi symmetric axis of the cable these points are not visible by cameras but with the help of epipolar geometry mc glone et al 2004 which principle is presented by fig 6 we have imagined a technique which allows tracking the center of a cross section the principle is based that for such a point lying on cable axis the projection to a direction is viewed whatever seeing direction at the middle of the two sides fig 13 presents this principle the effective tracked point in green is for left camera projected to a real viewed point red located perfectly at the middle of the two sides viewed by the camera the same analysis can be conducted for the right camera with the blue point the procedure consists finally of defining the first point within the left camera sensor at the middle between two sides of the cable this point defines an epipolar line in the second camera which is crossing a point the blue one which is also in the middle of the cable sides viewed by right camera picking these two points on each camera allows tracking by classical 2d tracking methods the effective tracked point indeed triangulation of these two points are then defining the green point because coordinates of green point in each camera sensor are the same as the red blue point on left respectively right camera two experiments were conducted the first one described in the following paragraph is dedicated to the assessment of the new calibration model performances in the last paragraph of the present section results obtained in the case of the strained cable in flow are shown 4 evaluation of calibration effectiveness the model developed has been tested in a simple configuration in air we have chosen this configuration because dioptric distortion is expected to be higher than in water domain due to lower optical index of air and value of optical index ratio r n we have proceeded to systematic calibration on a same measurement volume with a camera and have introduced on the optical path a 11 cm thick perspex plate with different angle α 0 by rotating the perspex plate see fig 14 nsce results obtained by each model are confined in the following fig 15 curves for the four calibration models are shown with different incidence angles α 0 the hierarchy of efficiency is constant over the whole incidence angle domain models with more kind of distortion are more efficient than others the present model gets good results and presents a quasi flat curve up to 40 it could be noticed that the weng model green curves gets quite good results for angle up to 30 this result could be explained by the fact that tangential and prismatic distortions introduce different corrections see equation 2 and in least mean square sense discrepancies are shared over all parameters easier than for the second calibration model the benefit of the complete present model compared to weng model is evaluated between 6 around 0 up to around 20 around 30 50 in terms of nsce improvements it must be noticed that after 45 nsce increase drastically for all calibration models this could be explained by the fact that the square model is probably not sufficient to well define the dioptric distortion which is more important with these angles and also by the fact that less 3d points are taken into account in calibration making evaluation more difficult this last effect produces probably the non regular symmetry around 0 axe which could be observed for all models an illustration of the point density used for the calibration is presented by fig 16 showing all black circles regularly spaced in the real world the picture was generated simply by taking the minimum value of all the calibration images high density can be seen at the left of sensor which can explain the fact that with positive incidence angle this density is right shifted to the center of the camera distortions being defined by reduced coordinates are then proportional to eccentricity of points and better estimated if these points are located close to the side of the camera sensor this could explain the non symmetrical behaviour of the four curves obtained for the nsce criterion fig 15 another illustration is presented in fig 17 the dioptric distortion associated with the spatial shift d α could be appreciated for all incidence angles tested d α forward projected on camera sensor equation 1 the figure presents a view of all circles of the target at the z 0 plane for all angles the displacement of points on the camera sensor can be observed especially for the zero circle the bigger one which area is mentioned in red 5 cable movement in mean flow the technique presented in the previous paragraphs allows to track the cable motion and to describe different regimes of vibration a calibration using a flat target located at eight different transverse positions has been proceeded complete model proposed in equation 2 has been used the global field of view used for calibration is around 900 670 500 m m 3 in the plane containing the cable movement the real size of a pixel is estimated to have an average value of 750 μ m an evaluation of accuracy reveals a global deviation value down to 60 μ m average over the field that is to say an accuracy down to 1 10 pixel size this result is classical in stereo vision see nobach et al 2005 for example without distortion but this experiment is an example that such small values can be reached even if high distortion happen as long as calibration model is adapted to the optical configuration in the following the first paragraph deals with classical image processing techniques which can be employed to estimate the global cable movement the second paragraph presents results provided by the blind tracking method and different analysis 5 1 visualization of movement of cable following analysis done in morphology domain as explained in boucheron and blaisot 2008 and improved in boucheron et al 2016 shannon entropy and probability images are computed for the left camera the entropy process is a powerful technique to evaluate the dispersion of a whole image data set like standard deviation the probability image process appears generally as a more useful way to estimate the mean image especially when grey level gradients are involved gradients due to movement or to a light gradient results are presented in colour green channel for the entropy and pink channel for the probability consequently the mean position of the cable position at rest is evaluated by the pink colour and the movement of the cable by the green channel fig 18 presents three result images at a flow velocity of 0 3 and 7 m s 1 and an example of a typical acquisition image for the left camera these pictures show that no movement is seen without flow no green in second image different behaviours of cable movement can be observed with the tow velocities for a 3 m s 1 velocity the movement is more important at the middle of the cable mentioned by the yellow dashed line whereas for the 7 m s 1 velocity the middle of the cable is almost at rest the movement is more important at approximately the quarter of length this behaviour indicates that the movement is modal first mode is observed for the 3 m s 1 case with an antinode at the middle of the cable length and second mode for the 7 m s 1 case with a node at the middle and an antinode at the quarter of length the same analyses should be done for the right camera with the same results these analyses are not sufficient to understand the physics time resolved measurements are needed to describe the cable movement and to understand relationship between the cable and the flow the technique described in the previous paragraph is used results are given in the following 5 2 mean distorted shape due to the hydrodynamic force of the flow on the cable the mean position of the cable is strongly dependant on the mean flow velocity this average position can be evaluated with the blind point tracking technique by introducing an image of the cable at rest into the whole image set of measurement image processing parameters have to be relaxed in order to be able to track the cable even if the displacement is very high more than 100 pixels have been observed for the highest velocity fig 19 presents the result of the mean distorted shape of the cable measured in our tunnel the results are presented in a non dimensional way for the deflection dividing by cable diameter each curve corresponds to a given velocity low velocities are represented with hot colours and high velocity with cold colours it can be observed that the shape is more deflected with high velocity flows these results can be compared with good agreement with literature bourguet et al 2011 for example the technique proposed is then able to estimate the mean distorted shape with great accuracy 5 3 visualization of movement of cable statistical results are not sufficient to describe the whole behaviour of the cable in particular different movement regimes are described in literature and are needed to understand the whole physics vandiver 1998 to achieve such diagnostic with an optical technique the experiments have been performed with high sampling frequency 1 khz in our application consequently the temporal displacement of the cable can be followed with quite high precision in time using the blind point tracking technique after making a spatial sampling of the cable with the help of circlets we can represent for one 3d point the evolution of normalized position in the three axes displacement divided by the d as proposed in literature williamson and roshko 1988 fig 20 shows such a curve and its spatial fourier transform for a z displacement transverse displacement a well defined sine shape can be observed for the 3 m s 1 case in the transverse axis related to a thin peak around 30 hz besides the measurement of frequency which can be easily linked to previous study guedes and matt 2009 vandiver and jong 1987 williamson and roshko 1988 modal trajectories can be plotted indeed the spatial fourier transform in the flow direction x axis shows that for 7 m s 1 the second harmonic could be observed see fig 21 with a noticeable magnitude trajectories of the cable movement in a xz plane transverse plane could also be performed they are presented by fig 22 for both the 3 m s 1 and 7 m s 1 configurations the time trajectories are plotted in black in addition to these trajectories the mean trajectory related to the main frequency picked on fourier transform is plotted in red the effect of second harmonic could be appreciated viewing the deformation of the circle to a thinner ellipse shape for the 7 m s 1 case this result can be also compared with literature and linked to a different flow regime in the wake of the cable it has to be noticed here that for point close to a node the cable displacement could be lower than the projected pixel size of a camera higher accuracy than pixel size is then required to achieve such measurement in our case thanks to the tracking performed with around 1 10 pixel accuracy it was possible to estimate this displacement such accuracy is also required only because we need measuring small displacements in a large field of view a representation of trajectories can be done in space along the cable length fig 23 shows such representations for the 3 and 7 m s 1 configurations mean trajectories are computed red curves of fig 22 and represented along the cable with a colour coded function of displacement magnitude from blue low magnitude by purple to red high magnitude a scale factor for displacement has been applied for viewing convenience the modal shape observed in entropy images fig 18 is retrieved and the mean trajectories could be compared between themselves all results exhibited here show the capability of the developed technique to track the cable movement in time due to the large field of view coupled with the small displacement a sub pixel technique is required this has been achieved through the development of the so called blind point tracking technique results obtained in the academic experiment presented in this paper show the capability of the technique and also the need of an accurate calibration model for camera taking into account distortions especially the dioptric ones in our configuration 6 conclusion a new calibration model adapted to our particular optical configuration has been developed its calibration performances have been evaluated thanks to the nsce criterion and an accuracy improvement has been observed in air these developments enable is to measure the flow induced dynamical trajectories of a strained cable with a high speed imaging system using the blind point tracking image processing this technique uses the epipolar geometry and cylinder geometry properties moreover the modal displacement of the cable has been observed and analysed by a 3d representation of the mean trajectories blind point technique appears as a powerful technique for this application sub pixel tracking method associated with the appropriated distortion model truncated at order two allows in our configuration an accuracy of 60 μm over the measurement area estimated to 900 670 m m 2 that is to say the 1 10 th pixel this great accuracy can be employed to analyse in time and in space the whole 3d movement of the cable further studies associating such a dynamic analysis of the cable movement and hydrodynamic measurements should be of particular interest for a better understanding of vortex shedding patterns like explained by guedes and matt 2009 and williamson and govardham 2004 even if the most important cable displacement is measured for most configuration in transverse direction the axis displacement in the flow direction is sometimes important and often richer in harmonics than the transverse displacement which can be if great interest for viv diagnostic 
23384,experiments on a strained cable excited by mean flow in a hydrodynamic tunnel have been performed in large cavitation tunnel gth from dga hydrodynamics measurements of cable displacement have been performed by high speed imaging system particular optical configuration around tunnel section has imposed the development of a new calibration model to take into account dioptric distortion preliminary tests have been conducted to ensure calibration efficiency with large windows moreover to track the cable displacement a technique called blind point tracking method has been developed this technique is presented and takes advantage of axi symmetry of cable and from epipolar geometry properties thanks to these several developments different behaviours of cable can be easily studied keywords vortex induced vibrations calibration model blind point tracking high speed imaging 1 introduction vortex induced vibrations viv on cable are critical problems for safety and reliability and remain a subject of great importance in many different domains as aeolian applications transmission lines conductors excited by wind or marine applications marine risers cable of ship towing body or hydrophone cables of seismic lines for example these viv are generally explained in literature by coupling effects between two natural phenomena natural mechanical vibration motion of a strained cable at a frequency f n and the vortex shedding frequency f s due to the flow around the cable the natural frequency f n can be calculated with the principal parameters the length and the strain of the cable and its linear mass this vibration is exactly the same as the vibration used in musical applications for instruments as piano or harpsichord the motion could be composed of several modes which are all harmonic of fundamental frequency f n considering the flow around the cable we define the reynolds number r e u d ν with u the flow velocity d the cable diameter and ν the kinematic viscosity of the surrounding fluid reynolds number is the governing parameter for the flow around a stationary circular cylinder different flow regimes could be observed in the wake downstream the cylinder depending of reynolds number value schlichting 2000 beyond a value around 50 vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder occurs flow instability produces vortices that grow alternately on each side of the cable the shedding of a vortex is produced when the shear layer of the next upcoming vortex interacts with the opposite side shear layer cancelling its vorticity because of its different sign the frequency f s can be expressed with the strouhal number s t f s u d strouhal number is practically constant in the sub critical regime r e 10 6 and its value is approximately 0 2 with a non static cylinder as a riser once the oscillations start the flow is modified and the excitation affecting the moving cable changes which again modifies the response and so on one of the fundamental features of viv is the ability of the cable oscillating at its natural frequency f n to synchronize the vortex shedding frequency f s when the cable oscillates laterally to the flow it can synchronize the vortex formation frequency with the cable natural frequency this phenomena is called lock in experimentally the force could reach a peak resonance phenomena at an excitation frequency slightly below the natural shedding frequency f s rather like the response of a simple oscillator to harmonic forcing williamson and roshko 1988 in the lock in range vortex shedding is not controlled by the strouhal law but by the cable motion at the upper end of the lock in range a sudden jump changes the frequency of vortex shedding to the value predicted by the strouhal relationship for a stationary cylinder experimentally a hysteresis behaviour occurs the amplitude is higher when increasing the flow velocity than when decreasing in water some differences are noticed due to the added mass term the fluid structure coupling is more important in marine applications than in aeolian ones the lock in range is not as close to the natural frequency of cable vibration and also that the range extends over a larger span of velocity different modes of vortex shedding along the span are reported in literature and found to be important in lock in process and particularly for mode transition yamamoto et al 2004 these different vortex structures in the wake of the cable have been identified by williamson and roshko 1988 and displayed in an amplitude flow velocity diagram the incidence angle of cable referenced to the flow direction is one of the other influencing parameters as the uniformity of flow hong et al 2011 as commented by vandiver 1998 the challenges are still the lack of understanding of the fluid structure interaction physics the need for adequate structural models the need for high quality multi mode full scale data the necessity to further develop data analysis techniques to better understand the results and the industrial need for effective suppression devices whilst the structural modelling has positively evolved together with the data analysis techniques in the past decade the mechanisms that rule the fluid structure interaction and the need for full scale or laboratory data are still a major concern as briefly explained the phenomenon is influenced by many parameters which have to be measured experimentally the main objective of the experiment described in this paper is to propose an optical technique for the measurement of the cable movement and to assess its availability the choice of an optical technique is governed by the desire to use a non intrusive method therefore dga hydrodynamics as conducted an academic experiment in its large cavitation tunnel gth the experimental set up is described in the section 2 different improvements of optical processing techniques have been developed these improvements involve firstly the optical calibration of a camera in our particular configuration and secondly a tracking process called blind point tracking method both are presented in section 3 the section 4 presents a first experiment dedicated to calibration tests these tests have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration model finally in section 5 experimental results of the strain cable in flow are reported and analysed focusing on accuracy provided by the developed technique just before concluding 2 experimental set up since its first use in 1988 the large cavitation tunnel gth remains a performing experimental facility to conduct innovative experiments to improve the design of ship propulsors especially with regard to cavitation but also in hydroacoustic domain gth is a close circuit tunnel of demineralized water fully comparable to wind tunnel in aerodynamic domain it is mainly composed by two test sections as shown by fig 1 each test section is equipped with large perspex windows allowing high visibility on model and also laser or high speed video measurements while one test section is in use model preparation can be done on the other one as each test section can be isolated using closing doors located downstream and upstream the two test sections the small test section dimensions 1 14 m x 1 14 m x 6 m is more dedicated to studies at very high speed up to 20 m s 1 while the large test section dimensions 2 m x 1 35 m x 10 m is more dedicated to propeller tests with complete hull apparatus the water velocity and pressure are continuously variable 0 v 20 m s 1 5 k p a p 500 k p a for the small test section and 0 v 12 m s 1 5 k p a p 200 k p a for the large test section see lecoffre et al 1987 for more information on gth moreover air content is controlled and can be adjusted as the nuclei content necessary for cavitation testing for example gth is equipped with an efficient de aeration process for its 3600 m 3 of water as shown by fig 2 an experiment has been conducted in the gth from dga hydrodynamics this experiment consisted of a strained cable surrounded by water and excited by a mean flow at different velocities the cable has an incidence angle of 15 as schematically shown by fig 3 to perform the image capture two synchronized phantom cameras v211 sensor of 1280 800 pixels have been set up to catch approximately the half of cable length each camera was equipped with an optical zoom focal length between 24 and 85 mm adjusted near 40 mm in order to fit the measuring plane with the cable the lens aperture was reduced to f 8 0 in order to increase the depth of field thanks to this particular optical set up no scheimpflug apparatus was needed moreover the sampling frequency of camera has been adjusted at 1 khz this high frequency allows reaching a sufficient time resolution to catch modal movement of cable expected lower than 100 hz high light density was provided by two 1 2 kw spotlights allowing short aperture times down to 100μs without blur fig 4 presents a view and a zoom from the rear of right camera the alternative black and white circlets painted on the cable can be seen the distances between two consecutive circlets of same colour are not regular the average distance is estimated around 5 cm in our application the challenges were to overcome the effect of different dioptres to look on the 3d object from the optic of camera four optical index changes happen for optical rays to run across measurement volume in addition to classical distortions by optics these several dioptres can be at the origin of discrepancies which can disturb measurements to prevent from such distortions a calibration model has been developed and is presented in the following section 3 image processing developments 3 1 main principle of stereo vision the stereo imaging technique is based on the use of at least 2 cameras that record stereo images of the object of interest as shown on fig 5 a relationship between the camera ccd pixel coordinates u v and the actual physical point of the object x y z can be found using a distortion free pinhole camera model and expressed for each camera as u l 1 x l 2 y l 3 z l 4 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 v l 5 x l 6 y l 7 z l 8 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 the coordinates of the real point p could be computed from the coordinates u v on each camera which is generally called the triangulation method according to x y z f u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 the coefficients of the model l i are found using a calibration procedure that uses a grid of points and which is described further in the paper the first problem to be solved in the stereo imaging measurement technique is matching two corresponding images points p 1 u 1 v 1 and p 2 u 2 v 2 from camera 1 and camera 2 basically the task is to find which point p 2 from camera 2 is corresponding to a point p 1 of camera 1 taking into account the fact that both points p 1 and p 2 are related to the same physical point p this matching research begins by using a so called epipolar property which reduces the number of points to look at for finding this property is telling that the potential corresponding points of p 1 of camera 1 are the points on camera 2 that are aligned on the epipolar line see fig 6 then a normalized cross correlation of intensity values of window around point p 1 and of window around point p 2 is used to measure the likelihood of a match the central pixel of the search window around p 2 where the highest normalized cross correlation value occurs is stored as the corresponding point to p 1 in order to make the matching analysis working the surface of the object requires to have a pattern or to look rough to achieve a high level of accuracy of the position of the object of interest the simplified model is not sufficient optical distortion of cameras as well as optical distortion of the test section dioptres the cameras are looking through have to be taken into account this is presented in the following paragraph 3 2 calibration the optical arrangement used in our experimental apparatus is presented in fig 7 from a top view for each camera we can see the presence of a water box composed by a thin perspex window and water filled just after the water box optical path goes through a 12 cm thick window in perspex in back of this window the measurement domain is filled with demineralized water classical calibration model used for a camera is the pinhole model all distortions that can be taken into account are different from one model to another one the calibration procedure consists of positioning a calibrated target with dots having controlled distances between them and computing the different parameters of the model which are minimizing errors the particular optical paths geometry of our configuration can be decomposed into several steps which are the entrance of optical path through the first window of water box in the water domain of the water box see paragraph 3 2 1 the way through the large window of tunnel to come out into the measurement domain in the channel described in paragraph 3 2 2 these two steps are described in the following paragraphs 3 2 1 entrance in water domain of water box the effect of the two direction modifications from the water box window is described in this paragraph consider the real principal point of the camera to be c the real world like schematically explained by fig 8 an optical ray from c is deflected to another direction by the two dioptres air window and window water it s the same to consider the real but complex configuration air window water as a configuration where the camera is dived into the water medium with different parameters like position and focal length the position c is defined by the direction θ 2 in the water domain simple optical geometric relations with the small angle hypothesis gauss approximation could show that the imaginary position of the camera c is distant from the real position c of an algebraic distance δ d equals to δ d d 1 n 2 n 1 h 1 n 2 n 3 with d the distance between the point c and the window h the thickness of the window and n 1 n 2 and n 3 the refractive index of air water and perspex respectively it could also be shown in gauss approximation that the equivalent focal length f 2 can be computed from the following equation f 2 f 1 n 2 n 1 with f 1 the focal length in air f 2 the focal length in water thanks to these two equations the optical configuration for one camera can be advantageously replaced by an equivalent camera as if it was immerged in water like schematically presented in fig 9 3 2 2 entrance in water domain of the channel via large window from the equivalent configuration right picture of fig 9 it can be seen that a dioptric effect is present between the camera and the measurement domain in channel if we focus on one optical ray going through a perspex window as shown by fig 10 we can see that the ray is simply shifted the ray direction is not disturbed as long as the faces of window are perfectly parallels that means that a ray with an incident angle θ 1 maintains its direction θ 1 after going through the window moreover we can express the spatial lag d as a function of the thickness h and the incidence angle θ 1 1 d h sin θ 1 1 cos θ 1 r n 2 sin 2 θ 1 with the index ratio r n n 1 n 2 in most of configurations windows are crossed over with a normal angle this means that generally incident angles are close to zero equation 1 shows that for such small θ 1 the spatial lag will be very tiny moreover it will be symmetrical and could be taken into account by classical calibration distortion model as long as distortions are considered in our configuration the angle θ 1 is typically around 45 fig 11 presents the optical way through a window with an angle α 0 around 45 we can appreciate that the dioptric effect imposes a spatial shift d α which depends on incident angle α moreover this spatial shift is not symmetrical evolution of image from the measurement volume will be distorted by the window dioptre because the shift d will depend on angle α that is on position of the point in the sensor in y direction fig 12 on the left part shows the evolution of d α from equation 1 projected on camera sensor with arbitrary unity against the angle β which represents the collected angle of sensor the right part of the fig 12 presents the error made by using the different models expressed in percent the simulation has been conducted in our configuration that is for α 0 equals to 45 therefore effect on the sensor was estimated to be in a square effect and the error less than 1 considered low enough refinement by increasing fitting order was not found to improve considerably accuracy of the model besides as discussed later increasing order of calibration model leads to more complex calibration methods that are then tricky to develop with sufficient confidence on convergence process then a new model for distortions adapted to our configuration has been developed and is presented in the following paragraph 3 3 new calibration model classical calibration model uses pinhole model for the geometrical aspect of a sensor mc glone et al 2004 represented by a rotation matrix a translation vector called extrinsic parameters and intrinsic parameters which are focal length linked to the real size of each pixel of sensor and principal point the center of the optical sensor several authors give different methods to have an estimate of all these parameters faugeras and toscani 1986 weng et al 1992 tsai 1987 salvi et al 2002 we have chosen the method of faugeras for a non distortion calibration in addition different distortions must be taken into account when particular optical configurations like radial tangential prismatic distortions among all models we have tested a radial distortion model by faugeras and the weng model which take into account all these three distortions the calibration model from weng et al 1992 can be expressed for the distortion part by δ u k 1 u u 2 v 2 g 1 v 2 g 1 g 3 u 2 g 4 u v δ v k 1 v u 2 v 2 g 2 v 2 g 2 g 4 u 2 g 3 u v with u and v being the normalized coordinates on sensor δ u and δ v the distortions on x and y axis respectively that have to be added on triangulation process k 1 g i are the different model distortion parameters the faugeras model with radial distortion consider only the k 1 parameter following the conclusion of paragraph 3 2 2 we add two other terms in linear and square form to this model in order to take into account dioptric distortion we obtain a whole model which can be expressed as 2 δ u k 1 u u 2 v 2 g 1 v 2 g 1 g 3 g 7 u 2 g 4 u v g 5 u δ v k 1 v u 2 v 2 g 2 v 2 g 2 g 4 g 8 u 2 g 3 u v g 6 u like all these models the non linear terms inhibit from developing direct method for calibration process an iterative method in two steps has been designed to converge on a least mean square sense solution the first step is to consider no distortion a method as faugeras one allows to compute extrinsic and intrinsic parameters a second step consists of fixing these parameters and to compute with for example a newton raphson method parameters for distortions iterative steps then start fixing alternatively extrinsic and intrinsic parameters or distortions parameters the procedure stops when the number of maximum iteration is reached or when the accuracy of parameters is less than a given value table 1 resumes the different model tested and all parameters used for each calibration model 3 4 normalized stereo calibration error historically weng et al 1992 has proposed the normalized stereo calibration error nsce criterion in order to compare efficiency of calibration model in different configurations this criterion is very helpful for calibration comparison because the normalization done in z plane allows getting absolute values independently of size of measurement volume for example nsce must have the lowest value as possible because it computes an average of discrepancies between all the real 3d points used for calibration x i y i z i supposed to be exact and back projection of coordinates of these points in z plane the back projection uses calibration parameters and produces coordinates x i ˆ y i ˆ the formulation of nsce is then defined by weng et al 1992 3 n s c e 1 n i 1 n x i ˆ x i 2 y i ˆ y i 2 z i ˆ 2 1 12 1 f x 2 1 f y 2 with f x and f y the focal length for x and y axes obviously for the same data set of images this criterion could be used easily to compare whatever the value obtained so long they are low 3 5 blind point tracking technique in our experiment the aim of the measurement device is to be able to track the movement of a cable the cable is defined by the line including all the center of each circular cross section saying the axi symmetric axis of the cable these points are not visible by cameras but with the help of epipolar geometry mc glone et al 2004 which principle is presented by fig 6 we have imagined a technique which allows tracking the center of a cross section the principle is based that for such a point lying on cable axis the projection to a direction is viewed whatever seeing direction at the middle of the two sides fig 13 presents this principle the effective tracked point in green is for left camera projected to a real viewed point red located perfectly at the middle of the two sides viewed by the camera the same analysis can be conducted for the right camera with the blue point the procedure consists finally of defining the first point within the left camera sensor at the middle between two sides of the cable this point defines an epipolar line in the second camera which is crossing a point the blue one which is also in the middle of the cable sides viewed by right camera picking these two points on each camera allows tracking by classical 2d tracking methods the effective tracked point indeed triangulation of these two points are then defining the green point because coordinates of green point in each camera sensor are the same as the red blue point on left respectively right camera two experiments were conducted the first one described in the following paragraph is dedicated to the assessment of the new calibration model performances in the last paragraph of the present section results obtained in the case of the strained cable in flow are shown 4 evaluation of calibration effectiveness the model developed has been tested in a simple configuration in air we have chosen this configuration because dioptric distortion is expected to be higher than in water domain due to lower optical index of air and value of optical index ratio r n we have proceeded to systematic calibration on a same measurement volume with a camera and have introduced on the optical path a 11 cm thick perspex plate with different angle α 0 by rotating the perspex plate see fig 14 nsce results obtained by each model are confined in the following fig 15 curves for the four calibration models are shown with different incidence angles α 0 the hierarchy of efficiency is constant over the whole incidence angle domain models with more kind of distortion are more efficient than others the present model gets good results and presents a quasi flat curve up to 40 it could be noticed that the weng model green curves gets quite good results for angle up to 30 this result could be explained by the fact that tangential and prismatic distortions introduce different corrections see equation 2 and in least mean square sense discrepancies are shared over all parameters easier than for the second calibration model the benefit of the complete present model compared to weng model is evaluated between 6 around 0 up to around 20 around 30 50 in terms of nsce improvements it must be noticed that after 45 nsce increase drastically for all calibration models this could be explained by the fact that the square model is probably not sufficient to well define the dioptric distortion which is more important with these angles and also by the fact that less 3d points are taken into account in calibration making evaluation more difficult this last effect produces probably the non regular symmetry around 0 axe which could be observed for all models an illustration of the point density used for the calibration is presented by fig 16 showing all black circles regularly spaced in the real world the picture was generated simply by taking the minimum value of all the calibration images high density can be seen at the left of sensor which can explain the fact that with positive incidence angle this density is right shifted to the center of the camera distortions being defined by reduced coordinates are then proportional to eccentricity of points and better estimated if these points are located close to the side of the camera sensor this could explain the non symmetrical behaviour of the four curves obtained for the nsce criterion fig 15 another illustration is presented in fig 17 the dioptric distortion associated with the spatial shift d α could be appreciated for all incidence angles tested d α forward projected on camera sensor equation 1 the figure presents a view of all circles of the target at the z 0 plane for all angles the displacement of points on the camera sensor can be observed especially for the zero circle the bigger one which area is mentioned in red 5 cable movement in mean flow the technique presented in the previous paragraphs allows to track the cable motion and to describe different regimes of vibration a calibration using a flat target located at eight different transverse positions has been proceeded complete model proposed in equation 2 has been used the global field of view used for calibration is around 900 670 500 m m 3 in the plane containing the cable movement the real size of a pixel is estimated to have an average value of 750 μ m an evaluation of accuracy reveals a global deviation value down to 60 μ m average over the field that is to say an accuracy down to 1 10 pixel size this result is classical in stereo vision see nobach et al 2005 for example without distortion but this experiment is an example that such small values can be reached even if high distortion happen as long as calibration model is adapted to the optical configuration in the following the first paragraph deals with classical image processing techniques which can be employed to estimate the global cable movement the second paragraph presents results provided by the blind tracking method and different analysis 5 1 visualization of movement of cable following analysis done in morphology domain as explained in boucheron and blaisot 2008 and improved in boucheron et al 2016 shannon entropy and probability images are computed for the left camera the entropy process is a powerful technique to evaluate the dispersion of a whole image data set like standard deviation the probability image process appears generally as a more useful way to estimate the mean image especially when grey level gradients are involved gradients due to movement or to a light gradient results are presented in colour green channel for the entropy and pink channel for the probability consequently the mean position of the cable position at rest is evaluated by the pink colour and the movement of the cable by the green channel fig 18 presents three result images at a flow velocity of 0 3 and 7 m s 1 and an example of a typical acquisition image for the left camera these pictures show that no movement is seen without flow no green in second image different behaviours of cable movement can be observed with the tow velocities for a 3 m s 1 velocity the movement is more important at the middle of the cable mentioned by the yellow dashed line whereas for the 7 m s 1 velocity the middle of the cable is almost at rest the movement is more important at approximately the quarter of length this behaviour indicates that the movement is modal first mode is observed for the 3 m s 1 case with an antinode at the middle of the cable length and second mode for the 7 m s 1 case with a node at the middle and an antinode at the quarter of length the same analyses should be done for the right camera with the same results these analyses are not sufficient to understand the physics time resolved measurements are needed to describe the cable movement and to understand relationship between the cable and the flow the technique described in the previous paragraph is used results are given in the following 5 2 mean distorted shape due to the hydrodynamic force of the flow on the cable the mean position of the cable is strongly dependant on the mean flow velocity this average position can be evaluated with the blind point tracking technique by introducing an image of the cable at rest into the whole image set of measurement image processing parameters have to be relaxed in order to be able to track the cable even if the displacement is very high more than 100 pixels have been observed for the highest velocity fig 19 presents the result of the mean distorted shape of the cable measured in our tunnel the results are presented in a non dimensional way for the deflection dividing by cable diameter each curve corresponds to a given velocity low velocities are represented with hot colours and high velocity with cold colours it can be observed that the shape is more deflected with high velocity flows these results can be compared with good agreement with literature bourguet et al 2011 for example the technique proposed is then able to estimate the mean distorted shape with great accuracy 5 3 visualization of movement of cable statistical results are not sufficient to describe the whole behaviour of the cable in particular different movement regimes are described in literature and are needed to understand the whole physics vandiver 1998 to achieve such diagnostic with an optical technique the experiments have been performed with high sampling frequency 1 khz in our application consequently the temporal displacement of the cable can be followed with quite high precision in time using the blind point tracking technique after making a spatial sampling of the cable with the help of circlets we can represent for one 3d point the evolution of normalized position in the three axes displacement divided by the d as proposed in literature williamson and roshko 1988 fig 20 shows such a curve and its spatial fourier transform for a z displacement transverse displacement a well defined sine shape can be observed for the 3 m s 1 case in the transverse axis related to a thin peak around 30 hz besides the measurement of frequency which can be easily linked to previous study guedes and matt 2009 vandiver and jong 1987 williamson and roshko 1988 modal trajectories can be plotted indeed the spatial fourier transform in the flow direction x axis shows that for 7 m s 1 the second harmonic could be observed see fig 21 with a noticeable magnitude trajectories of the cable movement in a xz plane transverse plane could also be performed they are presented by fig 22 for both the 3 m s 1 and 7 m s 1 configurations the time trajectories are plotted in black in addition to these trajectories the mean trajectory related to the main frequency picked on fourier transform is plotted in red the effect of second harmonic could be appreciated viewing the deformation of the circle to a thinner ellipse shape for the 7 m s 1 case this result can be also compared with literature and linked to a different flow regime in the wake of the cable it has to be noticed here that for point close to a node the cable displacement could be lower than the projected pixel size of a camera higher accuracy than pixel size is then required to achieve such measurement in our case thanks to the tracking performed with around 1 10 pixel accuracy it was possible to estimate this displacement such accuracy is also required only because we need measuring small displacements in a large field of view a representation of trajectories can be done in space along the cable length fig 23 shows such representations for the 3 and 7 m s 1 configurations mean trajectories are computed red curves of fig 22 and represented along the cable with a colour coded function of displacement magnitude from blue low magnitude by purple to red high magnitude a scale factor for displacement has been applied for viewing convenience the modal shape observed in entropy images fig 18 is retrieved and the mean trajectories could be compared between themselves all results exhibited here show the capability of the developed technique to track the cable movement in time due to the large field of view coupled with the small displacement a sub pixel technique is required this has been achieved through the development of the so called blind point tracking technique results obtained in the academic experiment presented in this paper show the capability of the technique and also the need of an accurate calibration model for camera taking into account distortions especially the dioptric ones in our configuration 6 conclusion a new calibration model adapted to our particular optical configuration has been developed its calibration performances have been evaluated thanks to the nsce criterion and an accuracy improvement has been observed in air these developments enable is to measure the flow induced dynamical trajectories of a strained cable with a high speed imaging system using the blind point tracking image processing this technique uses the epipolar geometry and cylinder geometry properties moreover the modal displacement of the cable has been observed and analysed by a 3d representation of the mean trajectories blind point technique appears as a powerful technique for this application sub pixel tracking method associated with the appropriated distortion model truncated at order two allows in our configuration an accuracy of 60 μm over the measurement area estimated to 900 670 m m 2 that is to say the 1 10 th pixel this great accuracy can be employed to analyse in time and in space the whole 3d movement of the cable further studies associating such a dynamic analysis of the cable movement and hydrodynamic measurements should be of particular interest for a better understanding of vortex shedding patterns like explained by guedes and matt 2009 and williamson and govardham 2004 even if the most important cable displacement is measured for most configuration in transverse direction the axis displacement in the flow direction is sometimes important and often richer in harmonics than the transverse displacement which can be if great interest for viv diagnostic
