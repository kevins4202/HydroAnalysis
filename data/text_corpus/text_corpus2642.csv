13210,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas persistent organic pollutants have been found in landfill leachate ll and can lead to environmental contamination recently more stringent global regulations to control the maximum levels of pfas have forced landfill authorities to improve treatment technologies to meet higher effluent quality standards this study analyzed the additional cost of the treatment process to remediate pfas contamination from ll in thailand using a two pass reverse osmosis ro system including pretreatment and the use of evaporation ponds the total estimated ll volume from 111 sites of sanitary landfills was ascertained using the water balance method and then the overall project cost in the form of the net present cost npc was evaluated the capital investment expense and related operating and maintenance costs over the project lifetime were taken into account the results showed that the total estimated ll volume was 17 5 m3 yr to handle this amount of ll the npcs of the ro system were found to be 577 9 mil usd for the system with an evaporation pond and 391 9 mil usd for the system without an evaporation pond the treatment unit costs ranged from 1 72 2 71 usd m3 for the system with an evaporation pond and ranged from 1 06 to 2 09 usd m3 for the system without an evaporation pond depending on the size of the landfills based on these results technological operational financial and regulatory policy recommendations are presented graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords landfill leachate reverse osmosis economic assessment 1 introduction chemical production and use have been distributed in various areas around the world to meet the needs of economic growth this has led to environmental problems especially contamination of water resources with emerging contaminants of concern per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of chemicals that are hydrophobic lipophobic and have low surface tension acid resistance alkali resistance and heat resistance due to their unique properties pfas are used widely in industry for example pfas are used in textiles and leather paper packaging for food and other materials that are resistant to water grease or stains firefighting foam metal plating and etching industrial surfactants resins molds plastics and the photolithography and semiconductor industry 1 3 some pfas compounds are very resistant in general environments which makes them more likely to accumulate in the blood and serum of humans and animals pfas accumulation can damage the liver kidneys and affect thyroid hormones causing cancer over the long term 4 6 in response to the rising health and environmental problems of pfas in some countries the industry was limited to producing specific pfas compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the early 2000s 3 7 in 2009 pfos and pfoa were listed on the stockholm convention of which thailand became a party to the stockholm convention in 2005 citing persistent organic pollutants 8 additionally pfas has been found in drinking water tap water surface water groundwater and industrial effluents in many countries including thailand 9 13 these findings have resulted in the development of environmental quality standards and recommendations for pfas in groundwater drinking water and surface water effluent wastewater in many countries for example us epa regulatory action in 2016 set a drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l for combined concentrations of pfoa and pfos 14 15 to achieve environmental quality control in accordance with these standards preventing the release of pfas from pollution sources into the environment is necessary especially for the release of pfas from landfills landfills are the final life stage for pfas in products and wastes derived from industrial commercial and residential sources which can be released in many countries such as america europe china and australia pfas in landfill leachate ll have been detected in the ng l to mg l range in several form and at various orders of magnitude for example in the u s the total perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid pfca and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid pfsa concentrations in ll were reported to range from 10 8 900ng l to 50 3200 ng l 16 17 the total pfas concentrations in leachates from canada and china were found to range from 27 21 300 ng l to 7280 290 000 ng l respectively 18 20 these data illustrate that landfill leachates can be a significant source of pfas environmental contamination and that pfas should be treated before being discharged to recipients typically ll is treated through conventional biological processes in wastewater treatment plants which are ineffective at reducing pfas concentrations 16 21 23 therefore additional cost effective treatment methods are necessary to treat pfas in landfill leachate there are approximately three existing advanced options to remove pfas from contaminated water granular activated carbon ion exchange resins high pressure membrane filtration of nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 24 however membrane separation technology is the most widely used technique for the advanced treatment of ll because it effectively removes more contaminants than other advanced processes 25 ro membranes are effective in removing most organic and inorganic compounds from contaminated solution recently new polymer chemistry and ro production processes have improved efficiency lowering operating pressures and reducing costs 3 according to ramazan k et al 26 ll treatment by the ro process helped achieve a pollutant removal efficiency of higher than 95 with a low capital cost investment for a large leachate volume therefore the ro membrane is an alternative cost effective treatment that has been investigated and commercialized for removing pfas from contaminated water it has been shown to be successful for the removal of both long chain and short chain pfas including per and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids pfeas which have been produced to replace pfos and pfoa 15 27 29 ro is a physical separation technology that does not destroy pfas but only separates pfas from contaminated water in the form of rejected water or concentrated brine this concentrated brine needs further treatment to permanently degrade pfas such as high temperature incineration or advanced oxidation there have been several studies on the efficiency of ro systems for removing pfas in wastewater and leachate for example thompson et al 30 reported that to produce high quality recycled water from wwtps in australia a ro system was implemented which was able to remove pfcas and pfsas to below the detection and reporting limits 0 4 1 5 ng l from initial concentrations of 3 39 ng l the removal of pfos from semiconductor manufacturing wastewater by four models of ro membranes thin film composite polyamide type espa3 lfc3 bw30 and sg was more than 99 efficient over a wide range of pfos concentrations 0 5 1500 mg l 31 soriano et al 32 showed that the ro system using xle and bw30 membranes achieved 99 separation of pfhxa at initial concentrations 100 mg l relevant to the effluents of the production of fluorinated polymers jan busch et al 33 reported a comparison of pfc concentrations in treated leachates from 22 landfill sites in germany effluent samples from the ro treatment process showed the lowest polyfluoroalkyl compound pfc concentration 15 2 129 ng l followed by activated carbon 9 26 4079 ng l and nanofiltration 621 1257 ng l additionally from the study of conceptual leachate treatment for pfas removal at the new england landfill the ro system was the preferred on site treatment approach for treating the leachate to achieve or nearly achieve the applicable and anticipated surface water quality standards 34 in addition to these studies commercial wastewater treatment companies have recently offered pfas removal systems by ro technology with containerized modular ro units that can be conveniently distributed for onsite ll treatment 35 39 these studies indicate that ro technology can be effective for treating a wide range of pfas compounds both short chain and long chain pfas with widespread uses on commercial scales in thailand there is no pfas production facility however pfas are imported as chemicals for production processing or as coatings on finished goods products for pfas within products both domestic and imported after the product end of life they are normally disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills msw landfills which can cause pfas contamination ranging from product wastes to landfill leachates in 2019 thailand had a total of 2654 waste disposal sites and 111 sanitary landfills were built around the country to dispose of municipal solid waste as shown in fig 1 40 the figure shows that more small landfills were constructed than large landfills probably due to the urban distribution in each region of thailand sanitary landfills were designed with leachate collection systems that transfer the leachate to be treated in biological wastewater treatment systems stabilization ponds usually used for ll treatment consist of a series of anaerobic facultative and aeration maturation ponds as a result this biological process could improve the leachate quality to meet national water quality standards 41 not including pfas limitations however pfas in the effluent are likely to be high due to ineffective removal by biological treatment 3 22 42 43 therefore in order to comply with the increasingly stringent global regulations on discharged leachate an additional advanced treatment process is necessary to ensure that the contamination of pfas in the effluent from landfills will not affect the local environment the ro system has been a proven treatment technology being able to remove a wide range of pfas target contaminant which has not been established by regulation in thailand so far thus ro technology is suitable for such an unclear situation ro technology is not only the most robust technology for protection against the unidentified pfas and other emerging contaminants in the future 44 but also classified as field implemented technologies demonstrated under full scale conditions by multiple sites practitioners and applications to remove a large majority of contaminants including pfas 15 so far thailand has not had investment in ro system for treating ll to implement the ro systems for all sanitary landfills the budget for overall costs including investment cost operation and maintenance cost and disposal cost of concentrates throughout the project life must be evaluated however in previous studies only information regarding running costs are available 25 while the information of the overall costs are scarce therefore this study focuses on evaluating in depth the budget for the overall costs of the ro system for ll treatment based on the total ll volume calculated by water balance model from all sanitary landfills in thailand the paper is structured as follows the methodology including the technical system design general process of ro membrane system and ll volume forecasting and the cost analysis assumptions of operation and equipment and the project cost analysis are described in section 2 in section 3 the results discussion and policy implications based on the results are presented the conclusions of the study are presented in section 4 2 methodology the methodology was divided into two main steps first the technical system design in which the ro membrane system was used in this research and the method for estimation of ll volume were described then cost analysis was detailed based on assumptions of operation and equipment costs which reflected the estimated ll volume and the project cost 2 1 technical system design 2 1 1 the ro membrane system in this research advanced leachate treatment by a two pass ro system was selected as an addition to the biological treatment system to reduce pfas in effluent before release to the environment fig 2 the two pass ro system has been proven in practice to effectively remove pfas from ll during more than 2 years of operation at the public landfill in new hanover county north carolina 45 46 from fig 2 the wastewater that passes through the ro membrane was divided into two parts a permeate water which was clean water and b concentrate water which had a high concentration of salt or impurities including pfas that needed to be further treatment there are several methods of concentrated water treatment surface water discharge sewer discharge land application deep well injection evaporation ponds and landfill disposal zero liquid discharge which depend on the typical permit requirements of each area 26 for thailand the evaporation pond method is appropriate due to the characteristics of warm dry areas with flat terrain and the cost of land near the landfill is inexpensive and easy to maintain 47 the basic components of the two pass ro system fig 3 consist of three parts described below 1 a pretreatment system installed before the ro membrane unit is a required process which improves effluent properties to meet guidelines for feedwater quality according to the membrane manufacturer 48 this additional process will lead to maximizing the ro operation capacity conventional pretreatment was selected in this study due to a cheaper replacement cost compared to uf membranes which are more commonly applied to pretreatment for ro desalination 49 the system consisted of a a sand filter tank to remove large sediment and silt b an activated carbon filter ac filter to remove color chlorine and organic compounds c antiscalant feeding to reduce the formation of scaling and fouling and d a 5 μm polypropylene cartridge filter pp filter to remove residual suspended solids in addition there was a circulation tank to store the permeate water and to regularly clean the sand and ac filter by backwashing 2 the ro process consists of a the two pass ro system with a spiral wound ro membrane polyamide thin film composite type and b the clean in place system cip system the acid and alkali agents recommended by the membrane manufacturer 48 were used to remove organic and inorganic clogging on the ro membrane 3 an evaporation pond is used to reduce the concentrate volume once the concentrate has evaporated the minerals and pollutants are precipitated into residual sediments these sediments are periodically disposed of off site by the hazardous waste hzw incinerator at a high temperature above 1400 c at which point pfas can be chemically broken down 50 based on the net evaporation rate of thailand fig 5 we assumed that the concentrate is treated by the evaporation pond only during the dry season dec apr which has a negative net evaporation rate alternatively during the wet season may nov which has a positive net evaporation rate it is difficult to reduce the concentrate volume by evaporation ponds instead it was recommended to return the concentrate back to the landfill for a second biodegradation in this season 2 1 2 estimation of leachate volume the total leachate volume for ro treatment was predicted from 111 sanitary landfills and the water balance method 24 51 52 was applied to evaluate the leachate volume generated from each size of sanitary landfill as shown in fig 4 and the equation below 1 q i e a lf 10 3 s i g w δc w δr w s o where q is the volume of leachate generation i is the rainfall intensity e is the landfill surface evaporation si is the volume of surface infiltration g is the volume of ground water infiltration into landfill w is the volume of leachate from waste entering the landfill δcw is the change of landfill cover soil moisture δrw is the change of soil moisture in waste alf is the landfill area and so is the volume of surface runoff according to the sanitary landfill design with a well protected lining system si and g were negligible during the rainy season the volume of leachate from waste w was negligible compared with the total volume of leachate entering the landfill q the change in soil moisture in waste mass δcw and δrw was negligible in long period calculations 24 therefore the equation to estimate the leachate volume needing treatment in this study can be simplified as 2 q i e a lf 10 3 s o rainfall i and evaporation e were the absolute factors affecting leachate generation this data was obtained from the national meteorological departments the surface runoff volume so was the rainwater discharged out of the trench before entering the waste layer and was estimated by the rational method equation as follows 3 s o cia lf 10 3 4 a lf c lf h lf 5 c lf v w v dc v c v s where c the fraction of rainfall in the watershed that becomes surface runoff is the runoff coefficient and depends on the soil group land use and slope of the watershed 53 alf the landfill area was estimated by the landfill capacity clf and landfill height hlf with the assumptions in table 1 2 2 cost analysis of additional leachate treatment by the ro membrane system 2 2 1 equipment and operation assumptions to estimate the equipment costs required for the ro system the feed water flow rate of the ro system was calculated from the hourly average ll volume with a safety factor of 1 2 and assuming 300 workdays yr and 24 h day this hourly volume was calculated from the monthly cumulative amount of ll with the assumption that there was a previously installed stabilization pond for biological wwt which would reduce the impact of monthly inconsistencies in leachate volume the design values for the permeate flow of the ro system of each landfill size waste input 50 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 ton day table 4 were calculated with an assumed recovery rate of 70 48 permeate flow feed water flow x recovery rate the size of the equipment was selected to sufficiently handle the calculated feed water flow and permeate flow generated from landfills table 2 shows the details of the equipment and the assumptions made to calculate the characteristic property of ro equipment which were used for cost analyses of the ro treatment system the leachate effluent was pumped directly from the last stabilization pond into the pretreatment system due to the low variability of feedwater from there water flows through the sand filter tanks activated carbon ac filter tanks and pp cartridge to improve the water quality before entering the ro unit the pretreatment system is periodically cleaned with back pulsing to maintain the flow balance after ro some permeate was collected in the circulation tank for backwashing of the pretreatment filter and cip system detailed information regarding the sizes and numbers of equipment is shown in the supplementary document the average price of required equipment was estimated from the actual equipment price list available on 13 commercial websites table s1 in supplementary document and the land price for evaporation ponds was assumed to be 26 usd m2 averaged from the minimum land appraisal of thailand the investment costs and operating expenses of the two pass ro system were estimated based on the chemical plant design economics 61 and the surveyed prices of the chemical agents in the commercial market the operation assumptions are shown in table 3 the system boundary for the cost analysis in this study consisted of the treatment of effluent from the biological wwtp by an ro system installed in mobile containers the treatment of ro concentrate by an evaporation pond and the treatment of pond residual sediment by a high temperature incinerator 2 2 2 project cost analysis the project cost investment operating expenses over the project lifetime was estimated and presented in net present cost npc which was calculated as follows 6 procost t 1 n cost t 1 i 100 t 7 procost total n 1 n n j procost j where procosttotal is the total project cost presented in npc procostj is the project cost for landfill capacity category j presented in npc nj is the number of the

details in table 3 during year t usd and et is the expenses including operating and maintenance costs see details in table 3 during year t usd the project may obtain compensation revenue from selling the permeate water as reclaimed water however for the conservative approach rt was assumed to be zero in this study 2 2 3 treatment unit cost the leachate treatment unit cost usd m3 was estimated by finding the price of permeate water setting procost equal to zero and calculated by trial and error from the equation below 9 procost 0 t 1 n e t inv t r t price volume 1 i 100 t where rt usd is the unit price of permeate water usd m3 multiplied by the permeate water volume per year m3 given in usd 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of landfill leachate volumes the leachate volume calculated from the landfill area designed to handle the 20 year msw volume is shown in table 4 the ll volume ranged between 21 112 and 4 222 395 m3 yr site depending on the landfill capacity the total estimated leachate volume table 4 was calculated by multiplying the amount of leachate by the number of sanitary landfills the results show that the total ll volume was approximately 17 5 mil m3 yr the landfills with a capacity of 101 500 ton day covering 21 6 of the total landfill site were the size that generated the most total leachate 5 066 874 m3 yr or 29 of the total leachate volume landfills with lower capacities of 50 ton day and covering 45 of the total landfill site were of the size that generated the least total leachate 1 055 599 m3 yr or 6 of the total leachate volume considering the large sizes of landfills with capacities of 1001 5000 ton day and 5001 10 000 ton day they accounted for only 2 7 of the total landfill sites and they generated leachate volumes up to 8 44 790 m3 yr or 48 of the total leachate volume fig 6 shows the estimated leachate volume generated from each landfill during january december the data show that the monthly leachate volume differed depending on both the rainfall and the evaporation rate the accumulated leachate volume in the wet season the period with a positive net evaporation rate may nov fig 5 was much greater than that during the dry season dec apr which is the month with a negative net evaporation rate fig 5 it accounted for 90 3 of the annual cumulative amount based on the estimated ll volume the ro system in this study was designed at permeate flow rates of 3 5 25 250 and 500 m3 h the permeate flow rates of the landfills were calculated in the range of 3 25 m3 h 72 600 m3 day which were similar to the leachate treatment capacity in china according to weiming chen et al 25 during 2004 2018 the main technologies used in leachate membrane treatment in china were nanofiltration nf and ro most of which had a capacity of 100 500 m3 day and were typically in medium sized cities only a few landfills in large cities have leachate treatment capacities greater than 1000 m3 day which is similar to landfills in thailand 3 2 cost analysis 3 2 1 project net present cost the npcs of additional leachate treatment by the ro system for a project period of 30 years and the associated cost structure are shown in fig 7 the npcs for each landfill capacity 10 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 ton day were 1 25 1 77 7 39 13 84 57 47 and 114 93 mil usd respectively and their cost structures were similar direct and indirect investment costs accounted for approximately 16 27 of the npc the remainder is the operating costs including the replacement of filters and ro membranes electricity costs labor costs cip chemicals incineration cost maintenance cost and insurance fig 8 shows the direct investment cost breakdown for each landfill size and the operating cost structure since the operating cost structures for each landfill size were similar only the cost structures of 500 ton day operations permeate flow rate 25 m3 h are shown in the direct investment cost the evaporation pond including land cost excavation cost and plastic lining cost accounted for up to 62 86 of costs for the operating costs the incineration cost a cost for treatment of residual sediments in the evaporation pond accounted for approximately 28 these data suggest that the concentrate disposal method by evaporation ponds and incineration of residual sediments significantly increased the project npc of leachate treatment by the ro system there are also other alternative technologies for concentrate treatment that effectively destroy pfas compounds 26 63 however they are not cost effective enough for use on a commercial basis therefore in this study the project cost was evaluated in two scenarios 1 with evaporation ponds and 2 without evaporation ponds the concentrate is recirculated in landfills instead as shown in figs 8 11 fig 9 presents the npc of the ro systems for all sanitary landfills 111 sites with 8 2 mil ton yr of total msw 40 for policy planning purposes the total investment costs were approximately 578 mil usd and 383 mil usd for the treatment systems with and without the evaporation ponds respectfully these costs accounted for approximately 0 11 and 0 07 of the 2019 thailand gdp 544 billion usd 64 compared with cities in beijing and shanghai 25 gdp and msw amount similar to thailand they implemented nf ro ll treatment at 46 sites with a treatment capacity of 125 330 m3 h the number of ro systems proposed in this study was 111 with a capacity of 3 500 m3 h showing potential implementation benefits moreover the npc of the system without an evaporation pond was approximately 34 lower than that of the system with an evaporation pond from studying the leachate characteristics before and after recirculation of ro concentrate in italy for the past 15 years it was found that the changes in leachate composition did not affect the quality of ro plant effluent 65 at the beginning of the project the ro treatment without the evaporation pond was an attractive alternative because it had a significantly lower investment cost and npc the evaporation pond could then be part of later investments fig 9 shows that the npc for the smallest landfill capacity 50 ton day accounted for approximately 11 13 of the total npc while the number of small landfills accounted for 45 of the total number of landfills in the country and the treated leachate volume accounted for only 6 of the total leachate volume in contrast the npc for the large landfills 5000 and 10 000 ton day accounted for 38 40 of the total npc with the treated leachate volume accounting for up to 48 of the total leachate volume and only 3 of the total number of landfills this information was used to prioritize the implementation of the ro treatment system to cover the country as further discussed in section 3 3 2 3 2 2 unit cost of ll treatment the unit cost of ll treatment by the ro system is shown in fig 10 the costs of leachate treatment for landfill capacities of 50 100 500 1000 and 5000 ton day permeate flow rate 3 250 m3 h were 3 69 3 14 2 63 2 47 and 2 05 usd m3 with the evaporation pond and were 2 90 2 33 1 80 1 63 and 1 21 usd m3 without evaporation ponds respectively the unit cost of the system without an evaporation pond was approximately 22 41 cheaper than that of the system with an evaporation pond compared with ro treatment unit costs reported by giraldo e 66 in 2001 approximately 9 1 usd m3 and jesus m et al 67 in 2017 approximately 5 8 usd m3 treatment by solar evaporation and forward osmosis for capacity 15 m3 day this could be due to the unit cost that has decreased over time the unit cost in this research was in line with the average cost of water production from seawater by 32 ro plants capacity range of 200 25 000 m3 h reported by the world bank group in 2019 which ranged between 0 64 and 2 86 usd m3 68 the operating cost of ll treatment in this study was between 1 72 and 2 71 usd m3 and 1 06 2 09 usd m3 for ro systems with and without evaporation ponds which is lower than the operating cost of ll treatment by biological processes combined with pretreatment and membrane separation technology nf ro in china during 2018 which ranged between 2 07 and 4 43 usd m3 25 this may be due to excluding the operating cost of biological treatment in this study compared with the costs of the smallest size treatment system landfill capacity at 50 ton day the proportion of cost reduction was approximately 15 29 33 and 44 respectively these results showed that the treatment cost tended to decrease as the size of the treatment system increased economies of scale the electrical consumption of the ro system in this study was in the range of 3 1 4 1 kwh m3 which is within the range of the electrical energy consumption of desalination 3 7 kwh m3 by 32 ro desalination plants constructed between 2001 and 2017 as reported by the world bank group in 2019 68 this is also close to the ro electrical energy consumption 2 4 5 kwh m3 in the effective operation of the desalination industry as reported by v gude 69 additionally since the price of ac tends to increase 70 and the permeate flow rate of the ro membrane might be lower than the designed value sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the cost variation under changes in the percent recovery of the ro system and prices of ac fig 11 shows the unit cost and the percent change of the npc results indicate that the unit cost was more sensitive to the percent recovery of the ro system than to the prices of activated carbon the change in ac price does not significantly affect the unit cost or the npc as the percent recovery decreased to 40 the unit cost increased by 115 and 75 of the unit cost at 70 recovery base case for the ro system with and without the evaporation pond respectively therefore preventive maintenance of the ro membrane is an essential activity to maintain treatment costs the npc for the ro system with evaporation ponds was more sensitive to percent recovery than that for the ro system without evaporation since the incineration cost for residual sediment from evaporation ponds increases with decreasing percent recovery 3 3 policy implications according to the increasing stringent regulation on ll to pfas discharge globally thailand needs to implement practical and advanced technology to treat pfas pollutants in landfill leachate if not handled properly leachate could lead to pfas contamination in environmental resources and result in human health problems therefore management plans to implement advanced leachate treatment technology in existing sanitary landfills around the country are essential to implement the ro system to treat pfas in ll in thailand the following issues need to be carefully considered 3 3 1 technological issues for thailand ro technology has been used for water and wastewater treatment in both government and private sectors but it has not yet been implemented for ll treatment there is no private entity that has expertise in operating ro systems for leachate treatment at msw landfill sites therefore the government should pioneer implementing the ro system in government owned landfills and then transfer the knowledge and lessons learned to the private sector considering the operational skills needed in the ro process to treat pfas in landfill leachate the proposed ro system should be built by private wastewater treatment companies with ro operating experience and should verify the pfas removal efficiency a crucial success factor of the project by a third party laboratory in addition the government should play the role of facilitator and regulator including accelerating stricter regulation on ll quality to encourage private landfill owners to comply to regulations as described in the next section 3 3 2 implementation planning in practice a consideration of the sequence of implementation covering the entire sanitary landfill is quite challenging most of the landfills are small 1000 ton day and located throughout the country and only 3 large landfills 1000 ton day are located in the central and eastern regions since a small landfill requires a lower investment and operating cost we propose implementing the ro treatment system starting with small landfills first to gain expertise before equipping larger landfills the implementation should be carried out across the country within 10 years with an annual increase in proportion of 10 of the total number of landfills with this strategy the project investments for the ro system will gradually increase and do not burden the government budget the npc required for each year during 2021 2030 is shown in fig 12 for more details see supplementary document the figure shows that during 2021 2026 the project npc to implement the ro system for small landfills 50 100 500 ton day was 22 mil usd year and 16 mil usd year for the system with and without evaporation ponds this investment covers up to 60 of the total number of landfills in the country with treated leachate volume accounting for 18 of the total leachate volume then during 2027 2028 ro systems for larger landfills 1000 ton day will be implemented with an annual project npc of 57 mil usd and 39 mil usd for the system with and without evaporation ponds this investment will cover up to 80 of the total number of landfills with the treated leachate volume accounting for 36 of the total leachate volume for the last 2 years 2029 2030 the investment cost will increase approximately twice a year for implementing large treatment systems at landfills of 5000 and 10 000 ton day totaling approximately 330 mil usd and 204 mil usd for the systems with and without the evaporation pond to cover the remaining landfills 3 3 3 financial issues since this kind of project is a public benefit project protection of the environment from pfas contamination and there is no financial return in the form of income although the permeate water may be sold as reclaimed water the government should be the investor funding can be allocated from households through additional municipal solid waste msw collection and disposal fees the financial mechanism was proposed as shown in fig 13 the fees are paid to the government as the msw collection and disposal for additional ll treatment before it passes through the landfill owners responsible for procuring ro wwt companies to construct and install the ro system and who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the ro this financial mechanism can support the implementation of the project which will help reduce pfas contamination from ll in thailand under public health act b e 2535 1992 71 and act on the maintenance of the cleanliness and orderliness of the country b e 2560 2017 72 in order to provide efficient and self reliant waste management in the long run thailand has applied the polluter pays principle where polluters or general publics are responsible for msw management costs separating into categories of collection transfer and disposal fees according to this fee structure the additional fee for ll treatment by the ro system can be collected by local government organization without law amendment at present the collection and disposal fees in thailand are approximately 7 9 usd ton 73 which is low compared to other middle income countries 74 for this reason the reasonable disposal fees adjustment is possible in addition law enforcement measures should be considered along with social measures and public relations to make the people responsible for producing msw understanding the needs and responsible for paying the additional disposal fees of managing it to prevent the damage to human health and environment in addition for effective law enforcement some proper measures may be taken to compel performance for instance specifying the garbage bags used for msw disposal which must be purchased from government agencies or licensed entities 75 3 3 4 regulatory issues thailand has been a party of the stockholm convention sc on persistent organic pollutants since 2005 and the sc has already added pfos and pfoa to its global restriction list consequently thailand needs to prepare the national implementation plan nip in partial fulfilment of its obligations under the sc one of which is the implementation of advanced treatment for ll to decrease pfas in effluent as a regulator the government should accelerate improving both leachate and sludge quality control legislation to include pfas if the government does so it will accelerate the investment of advanced leachate treatments in both government owned landfills and privately owned landfills 4 conclusions per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas persistent organic pollutants have been found in landfill leachate ll and can lead to environmental contamination recently more stringent global regulations to control the maximum levels of pfas in effluent from wastewater treatment plants have forced landfill authorities to improve their treatment technology to meet higher effluent quality standards the ro system is a commercialized advanced technology for effectively removing pfas from wastewater and can be added to a conventional wwt system for ll treatment in many countries in this study a cost analysis of the additional leachate treatment by a two pass spiral wound ro system was conducted for policy planning in thailand the study estimated the total ll volume from 111 sites of sanitary landfills by the water balance method and then evaluated the overall project cost in a form net present cost npc while considering the capital investment expense and related operating and maintenance costs over the project lifetime the results showed that the total estimated ll volume was 17 5 m3 yr to handle this amount of ll the npcs of the ro system were found to be 577 9 mil usd for the case of a system with an evaporation pond and 391 9 mil usd for a case of system without an evaporation pond the treatment unit costs ranged from 1 72 2 71 usd m3 for the system with an evaporation pond and ranged from 1 06 2 09 usd m3 for the system without an evaporation pond depending on the size of the landfills implementation should start with small landfills to gain expertise before implementing ro systems in larger landfills we proposed implementing the ro system across the country within 10 years assuming 2021 2030 with an annual increase proportion of 10 of the total number of landfills based on this scenario the project npc will be approximately 22 57 329 mil usd year for the system with an evaporation pond and 17 39 205 mil usd year for the system without evaporation ponds during the three implementation periods of 2021 2026 2027 2028 and 2029 2030 respectively to promote the implementation of this ro system the government should play the roles of facilitator and regulator and the following issues need to be considered from a technological perspective ro systems for ll treatment should be built by private wastewater treatment companies with ro operating experience and the pfas removal efficiency a crucial factor in the success of the project should be verified by a third party laboratory operational skills for ro systems should be developed and transferred to landfill owners financially since this kind of project is a public benefit project and there is no financial return in the form of income the government should be the investor funding can be allocated from households through additional municipal solid waste msw collection and disposal fees the landfill owner should be responsible for system installation operation and maintenance facilitated by the collected fees lastly from a regulatory perspective leachate and residual sediment quality control legislation should be accelerated to include pfas in the control list to comply with the stockholm convention declaration of competing interest the authors

13210,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas persistent organic pollutants have been found in landfill leachate ll and can lead to environmental contamination recently more stringent global regulations to control the maximum levels of pfas have forced landfill authorities to improve treatment technologies to meet higher effluent quality standards this study analyzed the additional cost of the treatment process to remediate pfas contamination from ll in thailand using a two pass reverse osmosis ro system including pretreatment and the use of evaporation ponds the total estimated ll volume from 111 sites of sanitary landfills was ascertained using the water balance method and then the overall project cost in the form of the net present cost npc was evaluated the capital investment expense and related operating and maintenance costs over the project lifetime were taken into account the results showed that the total estimated ll volume was 17 5 m3 yr to handle this amount of ll the npcs of the ro system were found to be 577 9 mil usd for the system with an evaporation pond and 391 9 mil usd for the system without an evaporation pond the treatment unit costs ranged from 1 72 2 71 usd m3 for the system with an evaporation pond and ranged from 1 06 to 2 09 usd m3 for the system without an evaporation pond depending on the size of the landfills based on these results technological operational financial and regulatory policy recommendations are presented graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords landfill leachate reverse osmosis economic assessment 1 introduction chemical production and use have been distributed in various areas around the world to meet the needs of economic growth this has led to environmental problems especially contamination of water resources with emerging contaminants of concern per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of chemicals that are hydrophobic lipophobic and have low surface tension acid resistance alkali resistance and heat resistance due to their unique properties pfas are used widely in industry for example pfas are used in textiles and leather paper packaging for food and other materials that are resistant to water grease or stains firefighting foam metal plating and etching industrial surfactants resins molds plastics and the photolithography and semiconductor industry 1 3 some pfas compounds are very resistant in general environments which makes them more likely to accumulate in the blood and serum of humans and animals pfas accumulation can damage the liver kidneys and affect thyroid hormones causing cancer over the long term 4 6 in response to the rising health and environmental problems of pfas in some countries the industry was limited to producing specific pfas compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the early 2000s 3 7 in 2009 pfos and pfoa were listed on the stockholm convention of which thailand became a party to the stockholm convention in 2005 citing persistent organic pollutants 8 additionally pfas has been found in drinking water tap water surface water groundwater and industrial effluents in many countries including thailand 9 13 these findings have resulted in the development of environmental quality standards and recommendations for pfas in groundwater drinking water and surface water effluent wastewater in many countries for example us epa regulatory action in 2016 set a drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l for combined concentrations of pfoa and pfos 14 15 to achieve environmental quality control in accordance with these standards preventing the release of pfas from pollution sources into the environment is necessary especially for the release of pfas from landfills landfills are the final life stage for pfas in products and wastes derived from industrial commercial and residential sources which can be released in many countries such as america europe china and australia pfas in landfill leachate ll have been detected in the ng l to mg l range in several form and at various orders of magnitude for example in the u s the total perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid pfca and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid pfsa concentrations in ll were reported to range from 10 8 900ng l to 50 3200 ng l 16 17 the total pfas concentrations in leachates from canada and china were found to range from 27 21 300 ng l to 7280 290 000 ng l respectively 18 20 these data illustrate that landfill leachates can be a significant source of pfas environmental contamination and that pfas should be treated before being discharged to recipients typically ll is treated through conventional biological processes in wastewater treatment plants which are ineffective at reducing pfas concentrations 16 21 23 therefore additional cost effective treatment methods are necessary to treat pfas in landfill leachate there are approximately three existing advanced options to remove pfas from contaminated water granular activated carbon ion exchange resins high pressure membrane filtration of nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 24 however membrane separation technology is the most widely used technique for the advanced treatment of ll because it effectively removes more contaminants than other advanced processes 25 ro membranes are effective in removing most organic and inorganic compounds from contaminated solution recently new polymer chemistry and ro production processes have improved efficiency lowering operating pressures and reducing costs 3 according to ramazan k et al 26 ll treatment by the ro process helped achieve a pollutant removal efficiency of higher than 95 with a low capital cost investment for a large leachate volume therefore the ro membrane is an alternative cost effective treatment that has been investigated and commercialized for removing pfas from contaminated water it has been shown to be successful for the removal of both long chain and short chain pfas including per and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids pfeas which have been produced to replace pfos and pfoa 15 27 29 ro is a physical separation technology that does not destroy pfas but only separates pfas from contaminated water in the form of rejected water or concentrated brine this concentrated brine needs further treatment to permanently degrade pfas such as high temperature incineration or advanced oxidation there have been several studies on the efficiency of ro systems for removing pfas in wastewater and leachate for example thompson et al 30 reported that to produce high quality recycled water from wwtps in australia a ro system was implemented which was able to remove pfcas and pfsas to below the detection and reporting limits 0 4 1 5 ng l from initial concentrations of 3 39 ng l the removal of pfos from semiconductor manufacturing wastewater by four models of ro membranes thin film composite polyamide type espa3 lfc3 bw30 and sg was more than 99 efficient over a wide range of pfos concentrations 0 5 1500 mg l 31 soriano et al 32 showed that the ro system using xle and bw30 membranes achieved 99 separation of pfhxa at initial concentrations 100 mg l relevant to the effluents of the production of fluorinated polymers jan busch et al 33 reported a comparison of pfc concentrations in treated leachates from 22 landfill sites in germany effluent samples from the ro treatment process showed the lowest polyfluoroalkyl compound pfc concentration 15 2 129 ng l followed by activated carbon 9 26 4079 ng l and nanofiltration 621 1257 ng l additionally from the study of conceptual leachate treatment for pfas removal at the new england landfill the ro system was the preferred on site treatment approach for treating the leachate to achieve or nearly achieve the applicable and anticipated surface water quality standards 34 in addition to these studies commercial wastewater treatment companies have recently offered pfas removal systems by ro technology with containerized modular ro units that can be conveniently distributed for onsite ll treatment 35 39 these studies indicate that ro technology can be effective for treating a wide range of pfas compounds both short chain and long chain pfas with widespread uses on commercial scales in thailand there is no pfas production facility however pfas are imported as chemicals for production processing or as coatings on finished goods products for pfas within products both domestic and imported after the product end of life they are normally disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills msw landfills which can cause pfas contamination ranging from product wastes to landfill leachates in 2019 thailand had a total of 2654 waste disposal sites and 111 sanitary landfills were built around the country to dispose of municipal solid waste as shown in fig 1 40 the figure shows that more small landfills were constructed than large landfills probably due to the urban distribution in each region of thailand sanitary landfills were designed with leachate collection systems that transfer the leachate to be treated in biological wastewater treatment systems stabilization ponds usually used for ll treatment consist of a series of anaerobic facultative and aeration maturation ponds as a result this biological process could improve the leachate quality to meet national water quality standards 41 not including pfas limitations however pfas in the effluent are likely to be high due to ineffective removal by biological treatment 3 22 42 43 therefore in order to comply with the increasingly stringent global regulations on discharged leachate an additional advanced treatment process is necessary to ensure that the contamination of pfas in the effluent from landfills will not affect the local environment the ro system has been a proven treatment technology being able to remove a wide range of pfas target contaminant which has not been established by regulation in thailand so far thus ro technology is suitable for such an unclear situation ro technology is not only the most robust technology for protection against the unidentified pfas and other emerging contaminants in the future 44 but also classified as field implemented technologies demonstrated under full scale conditions by multiple sites practitioners and applications to remove a large majority of contaminants including pfas 15 so far thailand has not had investment in ro system for treating ll to implement the ro systems for all sanitary landfills the budget for overall costs including investment cost operation and maintenance cost and disposal cost of concentrates throughout the project life must be evaluated however in previous studies only information regarding running costs are available 25 while the information of the overall costs are scarce therefore this study focuses on evaluating in depth the budget for the overall costs of the ro system for ll treatment based on the total ll volume calculated by water balance model from all sanitary landfills in thailand the paper is structured as follows the methodology including the technical system design general process of ro membrane system and ll volume forecasting and the cost analysis assumptions of operation and equipment and the project cost analysis are described in section 2 in section 3 the results discussion and policy implications based on the results are presented the conclusions of the study are presented in section 4 2 methodology the methodology was divided into two main steps first the technical system design in which the ro membrane system was used in this research and the method for estimation of ll volume were described then cost analysis was detailed based on assumptions of operation and equipment costs which reflected the estimated ll volume and the project cost 2 1 technical system design 2 1 1 the ro membrane system in this research advanced leachate treatment by a two pass ro system was selected as an addition to the biological treatment system to reduce pfas in effluent before release to the environment fig 2 the two pass ro system has been proven in practice to effectively remove pfas from ll during more than 2 years of operation at the public landfill in new hanover county north carolina 45 46 from fig 2 the wastewater that passes through the ro membrane was divided into two parts a permeate water which was clean water and b concentrate water which had a high concentration of salt or impurities including pfas that needed to be further treatment there are several methods of concentrated water treatment surface water discharge sewer discharge land application deep well injection evaporation ponds and landfill disposal zero liquid discharge which depend on the typical permit requirements of each area 26 for thailand the evaporation pond method is appropriate due to the characteristics of warm dry areas with flat terrain and the cost of land near the landfill is inexpensive and easy to maintain 47 the basic components of the two pass ro system fig 3 consist of three parts described below 1 a pretreatment system installed before the ro membrane unit is a required process which improves effluent properties to meet guidelines for feedwater quality according to the membrane manufacturer 48 this additional process will lead to maximizing the ro operation capacity conventional pretreatment was selected in this study due to a cheaper replacement cost compared to uf membranes which are more commonly applied to pretreatment for ro desalination 49 the system consisted of a a sand filter tank to remove large sediment and silt b an activated carbon filter ac filter to remove color chlorine and organic compounds c antiscalant feeding to reduce the formation of scaling and fouling and d a 5 μm polypropylene cartridge filter pp filter to remove residual suspended solids in addition there was a circulation tank to store the permeate water and to regularly clean the sand and ac filter by backwashing 2 the ro process consists of a the two pass ro system with a spiral wound ro membrane polyamide thin film composite type and b the clean in place system cip system the acid and alkali agents recommended by the membrane manufacturer 48 were used to remove organic and inorganic clogging on the ro membrane 3 an evaporation pond is used to reduce the concentrate volume once the concentrate has evaporated the minerals and pollutants are precipitated into residual sediments these sediments are periodically disposed of off site by the hazardous waste hzw incinerator at a high temperature above 1400 c at which point pfas can be chemically broken down 50 based on the net evaporation rate of thailand fig 5 we assumed that the concentrate is treated by the evaporation pond only during the dry season dec apr which has a negative net evaporation rate alternatively during the wet season may nov which has a positive net evaporation rate it is difficult to reduce the concentrate volume by evaporation ponds instead it was recommended to return the concentrate back to the landfill for a second biodegradation in this season 2 1 2 estimation of leachate volume the total leachate volume for ro treatment was predicted from 111 sanitary landfills and the water balance method 24 51 52 was applied to evaluate the leachate volume generated from each size of sanitary landfill as shown in fig 4 and the equation below 1 q i e a lf 10 3 s i g w δc w δr w s o where q is the volume of leachate generation i is the rainfall intensity e is the landfill surface evaporation si is the volume of surface infiltration g is the volume of ground water infiltration into landfill w is the volume of leachate from waste entering the landfill δcw is the change of landfill cover soil moisture δrw is the change of soil moisture in waste alf is the landfill area and so is the volume of surface runoff according to the sanitary landfill design with a well protected lining system si and g were negligible during the rainy season the volume of leachate from waste w was negligible compared with the total volume of leachate entering the landfill q the change in soil moisture in waste mass δcw and δrw was negligible in long period calculations 24 therefore the equation to estimate the leachate volume needing treatment in this study can be simplified as 2 q i e a lf 10 3 s o rainfall i and evaporation e were the absolute factors affecting leachate generation this data was obtained from the national meteorological departments the surface runoff volume so was the rainwater discharged out of the trench before entering the waste layer and was estimated by the rational method equation as follows 3 s o cia lf 10 3 4 a lf c lf h lf 5 c lf v w v dc v c v s where c the fraction of rainfall in the watershed that becomes surface runoff is the runoff coefficient and depends on the soil group land use and slope of the watershed 53 alf the landfill area was estimated by the landfill capacity clf and landfill height hlf with the assumptions in table 1 2 2 cost analysis of additional leachate treatment by the ro membrane system 2 2 1 equipment and operation assumptions to estimate the equipment costs required for the ro system the feed water flow rate of the ro system was calculated from the hourly average ll volume with a safety factor of 1 2 and assuming 300 workdays yr and 24 h day this hourly volume was calculated from the monthly cumulative amount of ll with the assumption that there was a previously installed stabilization pond for biological wwt which would reduce the impact of monthly inconsistencies in leachate volume the design values for the permeate flow of the ro system of each landfill size waste input 50 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 ton day table 4 were calculated with an assumed recovery rate of 70 48 permeate flow feed water flow x recovery rate the size of the equipment was selected to sufficiently handle the calculated feed water flow and permeate flow generated from landfills table 2 shows the details of the equipment and the assumptions made to calculate the characteristic property of ro equipment which were used for cost analyses of the ro treatment system the leachate effluent was pumped directly from the last stabilization pond into the pretreatment system due to the low variability of feedwater from there water flows through the sand filter tanks activated carbon ac filter tanks and pp cartridge to improve the water quality before entering the ro unit the pretreatment system is periodically cleaned with back pulsing to maintain the flow balance after ro some permeate was collected in the circulation tank for backwashing of the pretreatment filter and cip system detailed information regarding the sizes and numbers of equipment is shown in the supplementary document the average price of required equipment was estimated from the actual equipment price list available on 13 commercial websites table s1 in supplementary document and the land price for evaporation ponds was assumed to be 26 usd m2 averaged from the minimum land appraisal of thailand the investment costs and operating expenses of the two pass ro system were estimated based on the chemical plant design economics 61 and the surveyed prices of the chemical agents in the commercial market the operation assumptions are shown in table 3 the system boundary for the cost analysis in this study consisted of the treatment of effluent from the biological wwtp by an ro system installed in mobile containers the treatment of ro concentrate by an evaporation pond and the treatment of pond residual sediment by a high temperature incinerator 2 2 2 project cost analysis the project cost investment operating expenses over the project lifetime was estimated and presented in net present cost npc which was calculated as follows 6 procost t 1 n cost t 1 i 100 t 7 procost total n 1 n n j procost j where procosttotal is the total project cost presented in npc procostj is the project cost for landfill capacity category j presented in npc nj is the number of the

details in table 3 during year t usd and et is the expenses including operating and maintenance costs see details in table 3 during year t usd the project may obtain compensation revenue from selling the permeate water as reclaimed water however for the conservative approach rt was assumed to be zero in this study 2 2 3 treatment unit cost the leachate treatment unit cost usd m3 was estimated by finding the price of permeate water setting procost equal to zero and calculated by trial and error from the equation below 9 procost 0 t 1 n e t inv t r t price volume 1 i 100 t where rt usd is the unit price of permeate water usd m3 multiplied by the permeate water volume per year m3 given in usd 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of landfill leachate volumes the leachate volume calculated from the landfill area designed to handle the 20 year msw volume is shown in table 4 the ll volume ranged between 21 112 and 4 222 395 m3 yr site depending on the landfill capacity the total estimated leachate volume table 4 was calculated by multiplying the amount of leachate by the number of sanitary landfills the results show that the total ll volume was approximately 17 5 mil m3 yr the landfills with a capacity of 101 500 ton day covering 21 6 of the total landfill site were the size that generated the most total leachate 5 066 874 m3 yr or 29 of the total leachate volume landfills with lower capacities of 50 ton day and covering 45 of the total landfill site were of the size that generated the least total leachate 1 055 599 m3 yr or 6 of the total leachate volume considering the large sizes of landfills with capacities of 1001 5000 ton day and 5001 10 000 ton day they accounted for only 2 7 of the total landfill sites and they generated leachate volumes up to 8 44 790 m3 yr or 48 of the total leachate volume fig 6 shows the estimated leachate volume generated from each landfill during january december the data show that the monthly leachate volume differed depending on both the rainfall and the evaporation rate the accumulated leachate volume in the wet season the period with a positive net evaporation rate may nov fig 5 was much greater than that during the dry season dec apr which is the month with a negative net evaporation rate fig 5 it accounted for 90 3 of the annual cumulative amount based on the estimated ll volume the ro system in this study was designed at permeate flow rates of 3 5 25 250 and 500 m3 h the permeate flow rates of the landfills were calculated in the range of 3 25 m3 h 72 600 m3 day which were similar to the leachate treatment capacity in china according to weiming chen et al 25 during 2004 2018 the main technologies used in leachate membrane treatment in china were nanofiltration nf and ro most of which had a capacity of 100 500 m3 day and were typically in medium sized cities only a few landfills in large cities have leachate treatment capacities greater than 1000 m3 day which is similar to landfills in thailand 3 2 cost analysis 3 2 1 project net present cost the npcs of additional leachate treatment by the ro system for a project period of 30 years and the associated cost structure are shown in fig 7 the npcs for each landfill capacity 10 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 ton day were 1 25 1 77 7 39 13 84 57 47 and 114 93 mil usd respectively and their cost structures were similar direct and indirect investment costs accounted for approximately 16 27 of the npc the remainder is the operating costs including the replacement of filters and ro membranes electricity costs labor costs cip chemicals incineration cost maintenance cost and insurance fig 8 shows the direct investment cost breakdown for each landfill size and the operating cost structure since the operating cost structures for each landfill size were similar only the cost structures of 500 ton day operations permeate flow rate 25 m3 h are shown in the direct investment cost the evaporation pond including land cost excavation cost and plastic lining cost accounted for up to 62 86 of costs for the operating costs the incineration cost a cost for treatment of residual sediments in the evaporation pond accounted for approximately 28 these data suggest that the concentrate disposal method by evaporation ponds and incineration of residual sediments significantly increased the project npc of leachate treatment by the ro system there are also other alternative technologies for concentrate treatment that effectively destroy pfas compounds 26 63 however they are not cost effective enough for use on a commercial basis therefore in this study the project cost was evaluated in two scenarios 1 with evaporation ponds and 2 without evaporation ponds the concentrate is recirculated in landfills instead as shown in figs 8 11 fig 9 presents the npc of the ro systems for all sanitary landfills 111 sites with 8 2 mil ton yr of total msw 40 for policy planning purposes the total investment costs were approximately 578 mil usd and 383 mil usd for the treatment systems with and without the evaporation ponds respectfully these costs accounted for approximately 0 11 and 0 07 of the 2019 thailand gdp 544 billion usd 64 compared with cities in beijing and shanghai 25 gdp and msw amount similar to thailand they implemented nf ro ll treatment at 46 sites with a treatment capacity of 125 330 m3 h the number of ro systems proposed in this study was 111 with a capacity of 3 500 m3 h showing potential implementation benefits moreover the npc of the system without an evaporation pond was approximately 34 lower than that of the system with an evaporation pond from studying the leachate characteristics before and after recirculation of ro concentrate in italy for the past 15 years it was found that the changes in leachate composition did not affect the quality of ro plant effluent 65 at the beginning of the project the ro treatment without the evaporation pond was an attractive alternative because it had a significantly lower investment cost and npc the evaporation pond could then be part of later investments fig 9 shows that the npc for the smallest landfill capacity 50 ton day accounted for approximately 11 13 of the total npc while the number of small landfills accounted for 45 of the total number of landfills in the country and the treated leachate volume accounted for only 6 of the total leachate volume in contrast the npc for the large landfills 5000 and 10 000 ton day accounted for 38 40 of the total npc with the treated leachate volume accounting for up to 48 of the total leachate volume and only 3 of the total number of landfills this information was used to prioritize the implementation of the ro treatment system to cover the country as further discussed in section 3 3 2 3 2 2 unit cost of ll treatment the unit cost of ll treatment by the ro system is shown in fig 10 the costs of leachate treatment for landfill capacities of 50 100 500 1000 and 5000 ton day permeate flow rate 3 250 m3 h were 3 69 3 14 2 63 2 47 and 2 05 usd m3 with the evaporation pond and were 2 90 2 33 1 80 1 63 and 1 21 usd m3 without evaporation ponds respectively the unit cost of the system without an evaporation pond was approximately 22 41 cheaper than that of the system with an evaporation pond compared with ro treatment unit costs reported by giraldo e 66 in 2001 approximately 9 1 usd m3 and jesus m et al 67 in 2017 approximately 5 8 usd m3 treatment by solar evaporation and forward osmosis for capacity 15 m3 day this could be due to the unit cost that has decreased over time the unit cost in this research was in line with the average cost of water production from seawater by 32 ro plants capacity range of 200 25 000 m3 h reported by the world bank group in 2019 which ranged between 0 64 and 2 86 usd m3 68 the operating cost of ll treatment in this study was between 1 72 and 2 71 usd m3 and 1 06 2 09 usd m3 for ro systems with and without evaporation ponds which is lower than the operating cost of ll treatment by biological processes combined with pretreatment and membrane separation technology nf ro in china during 2018 which ranged between 2 07 and 4 43 usd m3 25 this may be due to excluding the operating cost of biological treatment in this study compared with the costs of the smallest size treatment system landfill capacity at 50 ton day the proportion of cost reduction was approximately 15 29 33 and 44 respectively these results showed that the treatment cost tended to decrease as the size of the treatment system increased economies of scale the electrical consumption of the ro system in this study was in the range of 3 1 4 1 kwh m3 which is within the range of the electrical energy consumption of desalination 3 7 kwh m3 by 32 ro desalination plants constructed between 2001 and 2017 as reported by the world bank group in 2019 68 this is also close to the ro electrical energy consumption 2 4 5 kwh m3 in the effective operation of the desalination industry as reported by v gude 69 additionally since the price of ac tends to increase 70 and the permeate flow rate of the ro membrane might be lower than the designed value sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the cost variation under changes in the percent recovery of the ro system and prices of ac fig 11 shows the unit cost and the percent change of the npc results indicate that the unit cost was more sensitive to the percent recovery of the ro system than to the prices of activated carbon the change in ac price does not significantly affect the unit cost or the npc as the percent recovery decreased to 40 the unit cost increased by 115 and 75 of the unit cost at 70 recovery base case for the ro system with and without the evaporation pond respectively therefore preventive maintenance of the ro membrane is an essential activity to maintain treatment costs the npc for the ro system with evaporation ponds was more sensitive to percent recovery than that for the ro system without evaporation since the incineration cost for residual sediment from evaporation ponds increases with decreasing percent recovery 3 3 policy implications according to the increasing stringent regulation on ll to pfas discharge globally thailand needs to implement practical and advanced technology to treat pfas pollutants in landfill leachate if not handled properly leachate could lead to pfas contamination in environmental resources and result in human health problems therefore management plans to implement advanced leachate treatment technology in existing sanitary landfills around the country are essential to implement the ro system to treat pfas in ll in thailand the following issues need to be carefully considered 3 3 1 technological issues for thailand ro technology has been used for water and wastewater treatment in both government and private sectors but it has not yet been implemented for ll treatment there is no private entity that has expertise in operating ro systems for leachate treatment at msw landfill sites therefore the government should pioneer implementing the ro system in government owned landfills and then transfer the knowledge and lessons learned to the private sector considering the operational skills needed in the ro process to treat pfas in landfill leachate the proposed ro system should be built by private wastewater treatment companies with ro operating experience and should verify the pfas removal efficiency a crucial success factor of the project by a third party laboratory in addition the government should play the role of facilitator and regulator including accelerating stricter regulation on ll quality to encourage private landfill owners to comply to regulations as described in the next section 3 3 2 implementation planning in practice a consideration of the sequence of implementation covering the entire sanitary landfill is quite challenging most of the landfills are small 1000 ton day and located throughout the country and only 3 large landfills 1000 ton day are located in the central and eastern regions since a small landfill requires a lower investment and operating cost we propose implementing the ro treatment system starting with small landfills first to gain expertise before equipping larger landfills the implementation should be carried out across the country within 10 years with an annual increase in proportion of 10 of the total number of landfills with this strategy the project investments for the ro system will gradually increase and do not burden the government budget the npc required for each year during 2021 2030 is shown in fig 12 for more details see supplementary document the figure shows that during 2021 2026 the project npc to implement the ro system for small landfills 50 100 500 ton day was 22 mil usd year and 16 mil usd year for the system with and without evaporation ponds this investment covers up to 60 of the total number of landfills in the country with treated leachate volume accounting for 18 of the total leachate volume then during 2027 2028 ro systems for larger landfills 1000 ton day will be implemented with an annual project npc of 57 mil usd and 39 mil usd for the system with and without evaporation ponds this investment will cover up to 80 of the total number of landfills with the treated leachate volume accounting for 36 of the total leachate volume for the last 2 years 2029 2030 the investment cost will increase approximately twice a year for implementing large treatment systems at landfills of 5000 and 10 000 ton day totaling approximately 330 mil usd and 204 mil usd for the systems with and without the evaporation pond to cover the remaining landfills 3 3 3 financial issues since this kind of project is a public benefit project protection of the environment from pfas contamination and there is no financial return in the form of income although the permeate water may be sold as reclaimed water the government should be the investor funding can be allocated from households through additional municipal solid waste msw collection and disposal fees the financial mechanism was proposed as shown in fig 13 the fees are paid to the government as the msw collection and disposal for additional ll treatment before it passes through the landfill owners responsible for procuring ro wwt companies to construct and install the ro system and who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the ro this financial mechanism can support the implementation of the project which will help reduce pfas contamination from ll in thailand under public health act b e 2535 1992 71 and act on the maintenance of the cleanliness and orderliness of the country b e 2560 2017 72 in order to provide efficient and self reliant waste management in the long run thailand has applied the polluter pays principle where polluters or general publics are responsible for msw management costs separating into categories of collection transfer and disposal fees according to this fee structure the additional fee for ll treatment by the ro system can be collected by local government organization without law amendment at present the collection and disposal fees in thailand are approximately 7 9 usd ton 73 which is low compared to other middle income countries 74 for this reason the reasonable disposal fees adjustment is possible in addition law enforcement measures should be considered along with social measures and public relations to make the people responsible for producing msw understanding the needs and responsible for paying the additional disposal fees of managing it to prevent the damage to human health and environment in addition for effective law enforcement some proper measures may be taken to compel performance for instance specifying the garbage bags used for msw disposal which must be purchased from government agencies or licensed entities 75 3 3 4 regulatory issues thailand has been a party of the stockholm convention sc on persistent organic pollutants since 2005 and the sc has already added pfos and pfoa to its global restriction list consequently thailand needs to prepare the national implementation plan nip in partial fulfilment of its obligations under the sc one of which is the implementation of advanced treatment for ll to decrease pfas in effluent as a regulator the government should accelerate improving both leachate and sludge quality control legislation to include pfas if the government does so it will accelerate the investment of advanced leachate treatments in both government owned landfills and privately owned landfills 4 conclusions per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas persistent organic pollutants have been found in landfill leachate ll and can lead to environmental contamination recently more stringent global regulations to control the maximum levels of pfas in effluent from wastewater treatment plants have forced landfill authorities to improve their treatment technology to meet higher effluent quality standards the ro system is a commercialized advanced technology for effectively removing pfas from wastewater and can be added to a conventional wwt system for ll treatment in many countries in this study a cost analysis of the additional leachate treatment by a two pass spiral wound ro system was conducted for policy planning in thailand the study estimated the total ll volume from 111 sites of sanitary landfills by the water balance method and then evaluated the overall project cost in a form net present cost npc while considering the capital investment expense and related operating and maintenance costs over the project lifetime the results showed that the total estimated ll volume was 17 5 m3 yr to handle this amount of ll the npcs of the ro system were found to be 577 9 mil usd for the case of a system with an evaporation pond and 391 9 mil usd for a case of system without an evaporation pond the treatment unit costs ranged from 1 72 2 71 usd m3 for the system with an evaporation pond and ranged from 1 06 2 09 usd m3 for the system without an evaporation pond depending on the size of the landfills implementation should start with small landfills to gain expertise before implementing ro systems in larger landfills we proposed implementing the ro system across the country within 10 years assuming 2021 2030 with an annual increase proportion of 10 of the total number of landfills based on this scenario the project npc will be approximately 22 57 329 mil usd year for the system with an evaporation pond and 17 39 205 mil usd year for the system without evaporation ponds during the three implementation periods of 2021 2026 2027 2028 and 2029 2030 respectively to promote the implementation of this ro system the government should play the roles of facilitator and regulator and the following issues need to be considered from a technological perspective ro systems for ll treatment should be built by private wastewater treatment companies with ro operating experience and the pfas removal efficiency a crucial factor in the success of the project should be verified by a third party laboratory operational skills for ro systems should be developed and transferred to landfill owners financially since this kind of project is a public benefit project and there is no financial return in the form of income the government should be the investor funding can be allocated from households through additional municipal solid waste msw collection and disposal fees the landfill owner should be responsible for system installation operation and maintenance facilitated by the collected fees lastly from a regulatory perspective leachate and residual sediment quality control legislation should be accelerated to include pfas in the control list to comply with the stockholm convention declaration of competing interest the authors

13211,adsorption process is widely used for the removal of wastewater contaminants classic adsorption units are fixed beds and membrane filtration systems in this work a novel configuration of a bench scale spinning adsorber submerged filter is proposed different prototypes of cylindric truncated cone or prismatic spinning adsorbers were studied using activated carbon of different particle sizes gac 1 5 mm granulated μgac 0 475 mm microgranulated and cpac 0 237 mm coarse powder as adsorbent and azorubine as model adsorbate high maximum azorubine adsorptions per unit mass of adsorbent of 214 225 and 275 mg g for gac μgac and cpac respectively were obtained using the langmuir isotherm adsorption model batch adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics and adsorbate uptake rate increased with decreasing adsorbent particle size best adsorption unit was a tank equipped with a spinning rectangular prism adsorber prototype all made of stainless steel woven wire filter of 180 mesh size running at 600 rpm and filled with a high cpac concentration 25 g l adsorber can remove azorubine at similar rates that the use of free moving cpac adsorber unit can run in continuous mode and works even better as a novel spinning submerged filter where filtered flow exits from a central pipe axis this integrated adsorption submerged filtration operation mode offer the possibility of adding a high initial dose or a continuous dosing of adsorbent in the tank increasing the adsorbent concentration of the unit this system can also offer novel opportunities for wastewater contaminants removal using different adsorbent materials located separately graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords spinning adsorber submerged filter active carbon azorubine wastewater contaminants wastewater treatment 1 introduction water cleaning is a key objective and challenge essential to human health social and economic development presence in aquatic environments of contaminants and nowadays emerging contaminants is receiving increasing interest in governments due to their undesirable effects on ecosystems and humans an example of contaminants are industrial dyes and their by products that are carcinogenic and toxic 1 other water soluble contaminants of high concern include pharmaceuticals daily personal care products endocrine disrupting chemicals hormones pesticides biocides organic chemicals or heavy metals 2 3 wastewater treatments plants should act as primary barriers against the spread of contaminants because wastewaters can be considered as a central source of this pollution it must be done an effort in treatments to remove all the contaminants present both in industrial and domestic wastewaters where contaminant concentrations may vary from mg l to ng l conventional physico chemical and biological procedures have poor removal efficiency for recalcitrant compounds so additional techniques after conventional wastewater treatments plants are needed to avoid its discharge to the aquatic environment 4 5 important removal technologies applicable for dye or micropollutants removal from wastewaters are adsorption or membrane processes followed by biological treatments or advanced oxidation processes 6 8 sometimes hybrid systems combining different technologies can enhance removal efficiency for many types of contaminants 9 10 the most extended and well known treatment technology at full scale plants for contaminants removal is adsorption 11 this technique can use a broad range of materials to adsorb the high variety of contaminants present in wastewaters the great assortment of adsorbent materials includes not only classic activated carbon from mineral or vegetal sources but also bioadsorbents from biomass residues inorganic materials nanoadsorbents or novel multifunctional materials that combine adsorption with photocatalysis or antibacterial properties 12 15 activated carbon ac is the most extensively used adsorbent because its structure offers very high surface areas 3000 m2 g high porosity and high degree of surface interactions the available ac forms vary on average particle diameter sizes from 0 25 mm of granulated activated carbon gac to 0 25 mm for powder activated carbon pac furthermore according with pore diameters ac is classified as macroporous 50 nm mesoporous 50 2 nm and microporous 2 nm mesopores are suitable for large to medium organic molecules colour taste and odour and micropores for smaller micropollutants 16 advantages of adsorption treatments are that no toxic compounds are formed it has high effectiveness also at low contaminant concentrations good cost efficiency flexibility in design and operation and feasible regeneration however special attention should be paid for reusability or proper disposal of saturated adsorbents and the competitive adsorption in presence of dissolved organic matter 17 classic adsorption units for contaminants removal are gac adsorbers of the fixed bed type and can be conventional rapid gravity or more commonly pressure filters empty bed contact times ebct varies for different micropollutants and it is usually in the range 5 30 min 18 although pac has a larger available specific surface area resulting in faster adsorption kinetics its use in fixed beds is limited because of its high compaction the use of pac can be extended as a tertiary treatment by the implementation of an additional separation process like sedimentation or filtration thus pac can be directly feed as a powdered slurry at the inlet to the treatment plant and later removed with clarifier sludge selection between gac and pac competes because of the advantages of both 19 continuous submerged membrane filtration coupled with pac has been also applied for micropollutants removal from wastewaters 20 another possibility not applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants is the use of rotating adsorbers a first option is rotating packed bed contactors where liquid enters through the centre of a doughnut shaped packed bed adsorber that rotate at high speeds generating high gravity centrifugal forces 21 a second option is rotating adsorbers built with spinning baskets filled with adsorbent which works as impellers inside the adsorption tank up to known diverse designs has been tested with different cylindrical perforated baskets dispositions and cfd models have been implemented for descriptions of internal mixing 22 23 these configurations facilitate an efficient adsorption process by particle movement minimizing external and intraparticular adsorbate diffusional problems and improving the use of porous activated carbons if we compare continuous operation of these rotating basket adsorbers with packed beds it must be considered that rotating adsorbers work with lower adsorbent concentrations because volume located outside rotating baskets has no adsorbent it means that continuous spinning adsorbers should use adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and fast kinetics to be viable in full scale plants an advantage of these adsorber units versus packed beds is its easy ph control this study explores a novel versatile prototype of spinning adsorber for wastewater contaminants removal the new prototype proposal can work both with the standard adsorbent inside of the spinning basket adsorber and as a spinning submerged filter with the adsorbent located outside this second continuous operation mode as a submerged filter can take advantage of a higher adsorbent concentration with the possibility of fresh adsorbent addition with time different spinning adsorber geometric configurations were studied within a variety of cylindric truncated cone or prismatic baskets prototypes made with mesh of different sizes impeller configurations tested generate different axial or radial flows in the tank adsorption was studied using activated carbon of different particle sizes gac μgac and pac to estimate the best particle size for operation it is expected that small particles will offer higher specific surface areas and faster adsorption kinetics but favour compaction a high micropore volume activated carbon was selected as adsorbent to evaluate a condition with high mass transfer limitations the adsorbate used in this study was azorubine an azo acid dye contaminant from textile industry azorubine is also present at high concentrations in pharmaceutical and mouthwash compositions as excipient and it is a potential emerging contaminant azorubine was selected as adsorbate because it is high water soluble stable to ph heat and light and has well known adsorption kinetics in activated carbon experiments evaluate the effect of activated carbon concentration particle size and rotation speed on adsorption kinetics in batch spinning adsorbers finally continuous adsorption studies compare the operation mode where flow exits directly from the tank and a novel adsorption submerged filtration operation mode where flow exits from the central tube axis once filtered this unit is a new proposal that could be used in wastewater treatment plants for contaminants removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the adsorbent used in this study was extrapure granular activated carbon gac 1 5 mm particle diameter from merck ref 102514 darmstadt germany the adsorbate was azorubine acid

germany inside the glass beaker rotate an impeller shaft built with two baskets hold to a metallic bar two different basket designs are used plastic baskets with frontal filter mesh or metallic

usa this technology print from the 3d solid model generated in the cad system plastic material was abs plus metallic baskets were made of stainless steel woven wire filter from the development of its surface and glued with cyanoacrylate adhesive in all cases activated carbon was weight placed inside the baskets and two circular lids made with filters of the different mesh sizes studied were located at both ends to avoid adsorbent lost stainless steel woven wire filters were supplied with different mesh sizes mesh 35 100 comercial garcía molina del segura spain and 180 giih amazon spain of 0 50 0 15 and 0 085 mm mesh hole size respectively basket volumes ranged between 8 and 12 ml the second prototype option b is shown in fig 2 and offers an axial flow pattern instead it is like the first option but use a 0 25 l glass beaker with a water jacket and a configuration with only one rectangular prismatic plastic basket covered with stainless steel filters tank was equipped with four equally spaced baffles necessary to work with rotational speeds higher than 200 rpm in all cases impellers were placed at a height of one third of the diameter of the tank from the bottom and rotated with an overhead stirrer microstar 7 5 digital ika werke gmbh co staufen germany 2 3 mixing time experiments studies were done with all designed prototypes made with stainless steel woven wire filter of mesh 35 and empty results were compared with the stirring of a flat blade impeller fig 1 mixing time was measured as the time it takes for the disappearance of the pink colour of the phenolphthalein indicator in a dilute sodium hydroxide solution by adding an excess of hydrochloric acid 24 tests were carried out filling the tank with deionized water 1 ml of 2 m naoh solution and 1 ml of phenolphthalein solution 0 5 in ethanol the stirrer device is then turned on at the speed to be tested and pink colour is evenly distributed then 1 ml of 3 m hydrochloric acid is added by means of a micropipette at a fixed point in the upper part of the tank a mobile phone is placed in front of the tank and a video is started at the same time as the acid is added the mixing time is determined when no colour is observed after viewing the video a jar test and leaching test type fc 6s with six agitation units was used to study rotation speeds from 10 to 200 rpm velp scientifica srl usmate italia tests were carried out in triplicate 2 4 obtention of activated carbons with different granulometry μgac cpac and pac different granulometries were obtained from commercial 1 5 mm gac after different dry grinding techniques and sieving gac granular activated carbon was milled with a grinder using the customized grinding option at the minimum value gvx242 krups seb group spain fraction of particles collected between stainless steel 0 85 0 25 mm sieves filtravibración s l barcelona spain were labelled as μgac microgranular activated carbon and those between 0 25 and 0 100 mm sieves were labelled as cpac coarse powder activated carbon gac was also milled with an ika mf 10 basic mill equipped with mf 10 1 cut grinding head and a 0 25 mm curved separation screen ika werke staufen germany then particles were sieved with a stainless steel 0 1 mm sieve and filtered fraction was labelled as pac powder activated carbon 2 5 physical characterization of activated carbons particle size characterization of activated carbons was carried out by laser diffraction with a mastersizer 2000 s equipped with a hydro 2000g unit malvern instruments ltd uk samples were added to reach the proper obscuration range and then measurements made in triplicate specific surface area of the activated carbons was measured using adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 at 77 k and co2 at 273 k using an autosorb iq xr 2 automated gas sorption analyzer quantachrome instruments boynton beach florida prior to the gas adsorption measurements samples were degassed at 250 c for 4 h total surface areas were determined from desorption isotherms of n2 using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method total pore volume obtained as p p0 0 95 and micro 2 nm and ultramicropores 0 7 nm volume according with dubinin radushkevic model from desorption isotherms of n2 and co2 respectively 25 true density of activated carbon was measured with a pycnometer vidrafoc s a barcelona spain apparent density was quantified as the weight of activated carbon that filled a 10 ml cylinder measured with a 4 digit precision electronic balance ax224 sartorius ag goettingen germany in the case of compact or tapped density the weight of activated carbon that filled a 10 ml cylinder was compacted with small strokes until the volume remained constant after approximately 1500 taps autotap quantachrome usa in all cases the density values were calculated as the weight in grams divided by the volume occupied by the sample measurements were made in triplicate the ph at the point zero charge phpzc was determined according with the mass titration method putting into contact activated carbons within the concentration range 5 100 g l with 50 ml of a 0 03 m kno3 solution flasks were agitated for 24 h in a shaker at 250 rpm until equilibrium ph was reached the phpzc was calculated as the ph at which a plateau is achieved when plotting equilibrium ph versus activated carbon concentrations 26 2 6 batch adsorption isotherm studies adsorption isotherms of azorubine on activated carbon were obtained mixing in 100 ml flasks 25 ml of different azorubine concentrations 50 500 mg l and 12 5 mg of an activated carbon gac μgac cpac ph of azorubine solutions were fixed to 7 0 simulating ph of wastewater effluents that are neutralized during pretreatment flasks were thermostated at 25 c in a dark chamber and orbitally shaken at 200 rpm after 5 days equilibrium was reached then 2 ml samples were withdrawn and filtered with 0 45 μm disposable syringe filters of regenerated cellulose agilent germany to remove any carbon particle finally azorubine samples were diluted with deionized water and its absorbance measured at 516 nm versus a blank cell filled with distilled water using an agilent 8453 waldbronn germany azorubine concentrations were calculated from absorbance values bellow 1 au through the calibration curve of absorbance versus azorubine concentration mg l which slope was 0 0492 coefficient of determination r2 of simple linear regression was 0 9992 the amount of azorubine adsorbed per mass of adsorbent mg g was quantified by 1 q e c o

0 025 l and w is the adsorbent dosage 0 0125 g adsorbent concentration is 0 5 g l values of qe versus ce were adjusted to different models of adsorption isotherms such as langmuir eqs 2 3 and freundlich eq 4 27 2 q e q max k l 1 k l c e 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 4 q e k f c e 1 n an excel sheet and the solver function were used to perform a non linear regression fit of the data error function

data 27 28 2 7 batch adsorption kinetic studies kinetic adsorption of azorubine were studied at 25 c both with activated carbons in free form or with the spinning adsorbers prototypes filled with activated carbons gac μgac or cpac using concentrations from 2 to 25 g l rotation speeds of spinning adsorbers were studied in the range from 200 to 600 rpm tanks were filled with azorubine concentrations ranging from 34 to 510 mg l ph 7 0 depending on activated carbon concentration used in all cases samples were withdrawn of the tanks at the necessary time intervals to follow the adsorption process filtered if needed with 0 45 μm disposable syringe filters its absorbance at 516 nm determined and finally the azorubine concentration calculated the amount of azorubine adsorbed

fit of the data using coefficient of determination r2 1 as error function to study which is the rate limiting step film diffusion or intraparticle diffusion the adsorption diffusion model of boyd applying the approximations given by reichenberg was used 30 according to boyd s diffusion model intraparticle diffusion is the adsorption rate controlling step when values of bt plotted versus experimental values of time gives a straight line passing through origin and of b slope the boyd number bt was obtained by applying the correspondent equation whether f t 0 85 or f t 0 85 10 bt ln π 2

azorubine desorption on activated carbon were done with cpac in a dark chamber thermostated at 25 c initially 100 mg of cpac were saturated mixing in 500 ml flasks 100 ml of a 500 mg l azorubine concentration ph 7 0 after 5 days agitation at 200 rpm a sample was withdrawn to calculate final azorubine concentration of supernatant and the amount of azorubine adsorbed quantified as explained previously with eq 1 after saturation supernatant liquid was removed and cpac used for desorption experiments desorption experiments were done in closed vials adding to the 100 mg of saturated cpac 4 ml of different test solutions deionized water 0 1 m hcl ph 1 0 1 m naoh ph 13 ethanol 96 or acetone 2 10 50 and 90 cpac concentration used during desorption was 25 g l the maximum concentration than can be achieved in prototype b fig 2 after 2 h of agitation samples were withdrawn azorubine concentration of supernatant calculated and the mg of azorubine desorbed quantified multiplying calculated azorubine concentration by added volume 4 ml percentage of desorption was calculated as 13 desorption mg az desorbed mg az adsorbed 100 this desorption experiment was repeated different times to achieve a high desorption percentage finally to study the feasibility of adsorbent reuse desorbed cpac was saturated once again using 100 ml of a 500 mg l azorubine concentration ph 7 0 and the amount of azorubine adsorbed per mass of adsorbent mg g quantified with eq 1 2 9 operation in continuous mode with spinning adsorbers studies in continuous mode were done using the spinning adsorber prototype option b described in fig 2 in all cases 4 g of gac μgac or cpac were added to the adsorber basket which means a maximum concentration of 25 g l in the tank experiments were run with a hydraulic retention time of 20 min using an azorubine concentration of 500 mg l ph 7 0 volume level of the tank was kept constant at 160 ml controlling inlet and outlet flows with two peristaltic pumps pumpdrive 5001 heidolph instruments schwabach germany outlet flow port was located inside the tank but when the unit run as a spinning submerged filter outlet flow run through the central axis pipe adsorption tank was thermostated at 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 obtention and characterization of activated carbons commercial granular activated carbon gac of 1 5 mm particle diameter was dry milled to obtain microgranular activated carbon μgac coarse powder activated carbon cpac and powder activated carbon pac fig 3 shows measurements of particle size distributions obtained by laser diffraction of μgac cpac and pac curves of μgac and cpac are unimodal and quite symmetric the average particle diameter for μgac expressed as d 4 3 was 0 475 mm span 0 95 uniformity 0 298 for cpac was 0 237 mm span 0 94 uniformity 0 29 pac particles has a less uniform distribution a broader span and the average particle diameter for pac expressed as d 4 3 was 0 021 mm span 5 13 uniformity 1 67 according to the measured average particle sizes a filter mesh hole size of 0 5 mm was selected to retain gac inside spinning adsorbers during experimentation 0 15 mm to retain μgac and 0 085 mm to retain cpac inserts of fig 3 shows the visual difference in sizes for μgac and cpac particles versus filter mesh hole size it is used a three times lower filter mesh hole size than particle size activated carbons were physically characterized for surface area porosity and density table 1 gac commercial activated carbon studied shows high bet surface value 942 m2 g and total pore volume 0 492 cm3 g these values increase up to 1206 m2 g and 0 669 cm3 g for the lower particle size pac activated carbon is mainly microporous as evidenced by the steep adsorption increase at low pressures however bet adsorption desorption isotherms showed hysteresis which indicates the presence of mesopores the percentage of micropore fraction is quite high with respect to the mesopore amount with values ranging from 68 to 86 the higher percentages correspond to the lower particle size activated carbons cpac and pac activated carbons have also a high ultramicroporosity that decrease slightly with reducing particle size obtained values agree with previous characterization of gac 31 32 true density values of all activated carbons are higher than apparent density as expected of the porous structure of activated carbons apparent density of gac and μgac do not change however cpac and pac values are lower because small pac particles have difficulties to settle values of gac μgac and cpac packed density show a minor increase related with the decrease in particle size while pac value is clearly higher which reflect the high compaction degree it can reach pac was not studied further because its high compaction level would minimize liquid flow inside spinning adsorbers and its small particle size do not allow its total retention within the studied adsorbers made of stainless steel woven wire filter of 0 085 mm mesh hole size the ph of zero charge phpzc obtained in this work is 9 7 so surface is positively charged at the ph 7 0 used in this experimentation this value agrees with surface chemical characterizations found in literature that also evaluate presence of acid and basic functional groups acid substituents are carboxyl lactone or phenol groups while typical basic surface groups are oxygen containing carbonyls pyrone and chromene type structures and oxygen free lewis basic sites on the graphene layer total acidic and basic surface groups are 0 21 and 0 46 mmol g gac respectively 33 a correlation of basicity of activated carbon and azorubine adsorption is expected previous studies showed that sorption capacity of azorubine although dependent of ph vary slightly between ph 2 to 6 34 or ph 5 to 8 37 in this work azorubine adsorption was studied in deionized water without buffer addition so ionic strength is only related to azorubine concentration the ph of azorubine solutions were adjusted to 7 0 and it was stable during experiments gac has the presence of ionizable groups and a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface properties the electrostatic mechanism is not the only mechanism for dye adsorption gac has a high affinity for sorbates with phenyl and naphthalene containing groups activated carbon can also interact with dye molecules via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic hydrophobic mechanisms 34 3 2 modelling adsorption isotherms of azorubine on activated carbons adsorption isotherms provide a convenient mathematical description to assess the differences in adsorptive capacity of azorubine in gac μgac and cpac in this work azorubine adsorption at equilibrium was evaluated with the well known isotherm models of langmuir and freundlich table 2 shows the isotherm constants and correlation coefficients r2 obtained with the studied models and fig 4 the results fitted with langmuir model although both models describe reasonably well the experimental values langmuir offered the best description for gac and μgac previous research with acid dyes showed that langmuir model fits well experimental values 35 36 the rl value indicates favourability of the adsorption process it is irreversible rl 0 favourable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavourable rl 1 it can be assumed that azorubine shows a high and favourable adsorption according to the low values of rl 0 02 0 28 of langmuir model values of n greater than unity obtained with the model of freundlich also corroborate favourable adsorption of the dye 0 1 n 1 the magnitude of freundlich constant kf also indicates a high adsorption capacity which is suitable for the highly heterogeneous surface of activated carbon high adsorption capacity values qmax from 214 to 275 mg g were obtained in this study higher than previous results of 30 mg g 34 or 16 21 mg g 37 for azorubine adsorption in activated carbon cpac showed the maximum adsorption capacity related with its higher adsorption area this effect of adsorption capacity with particle size is well documented 38 3 3 modelling adsorption kinetics of azorubine on activated carbons adsorption kinetics plots of qt vs time for free gac μgac and cpac using an adsorbent concentration of 2 g l and an azorubine concentration of 34 mg l ph 7 0 were modelled with pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models table 3 shows the kinetic constants obtained with these models although pseudo first order and pseudo second order models describe well data for gac and μgac fig 5a shows the results of pseudo second order model because its better fit for cpac elovich model gives the lowest cpac showed the higher adsorption rate versus μgac and gac so it was selected for next experiments correlation with all activated carbons azorubine adsorption was fast at the beginning of the process due to the availability of active sites on the exterior surface and after the saturation of those active sites azorubine was adsorbed with a slower rate adsorption rate was strongly dependent on particle size and while gac took more than 720 min to adsorb all azorubine μgac needs about 180 min and cpac around 90 min values of kinetic constants increase following the order gac μgac cpac prior studies of dyes adsorption on gac showed also good fits of adsorption kinetics with these models but pseudo second order was always better 34 35 39 40 the effect of increased adsorbate uptake rate of dyes in activated carbons with decreasing adsorbent particle size is also reported 41 boyd s model was applied to kinetic data to analyse which is the main rate limiting step intraparticle diffusion or film diffusion fig 5b shows that the plot of boyd number versus time is linear for gac μgac and cpac passing close to origin it can be concluded that pore diffusion is the rate controlling step during experiments as could be expected from the high microporous structure of the activated carbon employed effective diffusion coefficient di cm2 min calculated from slopes were 1 60 10 6 1 09 10 6 and 8 55 10 7 cm2 s for gac μgac and cpac respectively it means that higher pore diffusional problems are found with gac that are minimized in case of the smaller cpac particles a different diffusion model is the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm that use a surface diffusion coefficient ds it assumes that internal mass transfer is only due to surface diffusion and that pore volume diffusion resistance is negligible boyd s effective intraparticle diffusion coefficient di can be considered similar to the hsdm surface diffusion coefficient ds whenever boyd plot intercept the origin 30 it can be concluded that adsorption is mainly controlled by the presence of micropores in the surface 3 4 reuse of activated carbon adsorption desorption studies desorption of azorubine is important to allow activated carbon reuse in the prototypes of spinning adsorber submerged filters that are studied afterwards experiments were done with cpac at the highest concentration than can be achieved in prototypes of 25 g l initial studies showed the effect of ph and solvents on desorption using 0 1 m hcl ph 1 deionized water ph 6 5 0 1 m naoh ph 13 ethanol 96 and acetone 10 final desorption reached were 0 3 9 4 2 8 and 12 2 respectively at ph 13 the anionic acid dye azorubine is desorbed because ph is higher than phpzc 9 7 and surface sites of cpac are charged negatively at ph 1 0 no desorption is observed as expected the interaction of the dye molecule and activated carbon is partially electrostatic as the best desorption was obtained with acetone 10 a new experiment studied a sequential desorption process with different acetone concentrations fig 6 a high desorption of 91 3 was reached after five desorption processes once azorubine was desorbed 94 a new adsorption was done to evaluate cpac reuse a 65 of maximum adsorption was reached 175 mg g which means that a high azorubine amount can be adsorbed after cpac reuse spinning adsorber submerged filters have cpac confined helping for successive desorption adsorption steps 3 5 prototyping spinning adsorbers mixing time studies with empty baskets fig 7 shows the effect of rotational speed of the different prototypes proposed in this study on mixing times all spinning adsorbers showed higher mixing times in comparison with the flat blade impeller in case of prototypes of spinning adsorbers type a that offers a radial flow pattern the cylindrical basket configuration gives lower mixing times in comparison with the trunk conical basket configuration in addition plastic basket configuration offers lower mixing times than metallic basket configuration spinning adsorber type b with an axial flow pattern offered mixing times between cylindrical and trunk conical baskets and it is an intermediate option from the mixing time point of view running at the higher rotational speed of 200 rpm mixing times are in the range from 7 to 12 s typical mixing times of stirred tanks using improved impeller designs are in the range from 3 to 6 s 42 flow regimes in mixing tanks depends on reynolds number of impellers and as an example the flat blade impeller of this study using rotational speeds higher than 30 rpm run in a turbulent mixing regime with reynolds numbers above 5000 24 spinning adsorbers had to be run with a high rotational speed close to or higher than 200 rpm to reduce mixing times minimize mass transfer limitations and then optimize adsorption rate 3 6 prototyping spinning adsorbers selection of best basket geometry with gac once studied the effect of rotational speed the proposed spinning adsorbers prototypes were compared studying batch adsorption of an initial azorubine concentration of 34 mg l ph 7 0 gac as adsorbent with a maximum load of 4 g l and a fixed rotational speed of 200 rpm results were compared with free gac stirred with a flat bade impeller fig 8 shows the adsorption kinetic plots obtained that fitted properly with the pseudo second order kinetic model of ho table 4 gives data of the calculated adsorption kinetic parameters as expected experiment with free gac at 4 g l gives faster adsorption kinetics than previous results with a lower adsorbent concentration of 2 g l metallic prototypes with open mesh in all directions had faster adsorption kinetics than plastic ones so it is essential to use this open mesh basket configuration to minimize mass transfer problems in the spinning adsorbers cylindrical geometry was preferred versus trunk conical and this effect is mainly observed with plastic prototypes in case of metallic prototypes adsorption kinetics were faster than obtained with free gac which means that the rotation of adsorbers minimize external mass transport and pore diffusion due to the internal flow inside the adsorbers the best spinning adsorber prototype was the metallic open mesh rectangular prismatic configuration with axial flow pattern and it was selected for further studies in addition this prototype can work with a higher adsorbent concentration of 25 g l the rectangular prismatic basket configuration type b offers an axial flow where flow enters mainly through the bottom side of the rectangular prism and then flow radially by the effect of centrifugal force in contrast spinning adsorbers type a offers a radial pattern flow where flows enter mainly through the side in contact with rotation and exits by the opposite direction 43 these results are consistent with scientific literature that explore batch adsorption kinetics with different rotating basket geometries a study with a rotating basket adsorber made with two cylindrical baskets of stainless steel and filled with bone char of particle diameters higher than 0 79 mm reveals that external mass transport does not control adsorption rate at rotating speeds higher than 200 rpm 44 a similar cylindrical basket adsorber that rotates with an additional impeller using activated carbon particles of 0 822 mm was operated at 700 rpm to minimize mass transport phenomena 45 another work uses a rotating cylindrical basket adsorber for zinc removal with a cation exchange resin of 0 3 1 2 mm particle size and concludes that maximum adsorption kinetics were obtained at 400 rpm 46 in reviewed cases open wired baskets were used with rotation speeds higher than 200 rpm and adsorbent particles of sizes higher than 0 3 mm no data of mesh hole size of metallic baskets are found in reference papers 3 7 optimizing rotating speed of rectangular prismatic spinning adsorbers once selected the rectangular prismatic adsorber as the best prototype new batch adsorption studies were done to evaluate the use of μgac or cpac using rotating speeds higher than 200 rpm fig 9 compares the adsorption kinetics of spinning adsorbers filled with gac μgac and cpac that rotates at speeds from 200 to 600 rpm versus free gac at 200 rpm the used activated carbon dose was the maximum amount that avoid activated carbon compaction inside the adsorption unit activated carbon and azorubine concentrations studied were 25 g l and 510 mg l respectively fig 9a shows that spinning adsorber filled with gac has adsorption kinetics similar or faster than free gac even at the lower rotation speed of 200 rpm however in case of μgac rotation speeds should be equal or higher than 400 rpm to get over kinetics of free μgac fig 9b when cpac is used only the higher rotating speed of 600 rpm offers adsorption kinetics as fast as free cpac fig 9c the cpac particles go from being compact to improving fluidization within the adsorber basket as stirring speed increases the high rotation speed allows a good wetting efficiency of particles and mixing inside the spinning adsorbers table 5 shows the kinetic parameters obtained modelling with pseudo second order adsorption kinetics the initial adsorption rate of azorubine calculated as k2 qt 2 for cpac at 600 rpm was 29 9 mg g min the prismatic rectangular adsorber prototype rotating at 600 rpm and filled with cpac 25 g l is the best prototype studied and can remove totally 99 8 of azorubine in 15 min with no need of activated carbon separation 3 8 continuous flow operation of rectangular prismatic spinning adsorber as submerged filter the prismatic rectangular prototype was selected to study continuous operation of spinning adsorbers rotating at 600 rpm with a 25 g l activated carbon concentration a high inlet azorubine concentration of 500 mg l ph 7 0 and a low hydraulic retention time of 20 min were selected to achieve maximum adsorption capacity of activated carbons in a short time fig 10 shows initial continuous experiments done with outlet flow port located inside the tank adsorption rate of azorubine on gac μgac and cpac is compared with the use of no adsorbent maximum adsorption capacity of all activated carbons was achieved after 8 h lowering considerably inlet azorubine concentration during operation cpac showed the higher adsorption rate versus μgac and gac so it was selected for next experiments there was no adsorbent loss during 8 h of continuous operation final studies were done with cpac using previous continuous operation conditions but with the spinning adsorber running as a submerged filter it means that flow exits from the central axis see fig 2 once filtered through the stainless steel woven wire of 85 μm of mesh hole size when the spinning adsorber run as a submerged filter filled with cpac azorubine is always in contact with activated carbon before leaving the adsorber unit a second option is to run the spinning adsorber submerged filter with free cpac located inside the tank instead of being confined in the spinning adsorber fig 11 compares with previous experiments the evolution of azorubine concentration in the outlet flow using both configuration proposals of spinning adsorber submerged filter results shows faster adsorption rates running as a spinning adsorber submerged filter so this configuration was chosen as the best values of adsorption rates with confined or free cpac were similar which means that confined cpac adsorbs azorubine as fast as free cpac the high rotation speed allows a fast adsorption rate of azorubine when activated carbon is confined and internal flow contributes to minimize diffusional problems rotation of the spinning adsorber also promotes a good mixture of the free cpac located in tank decrease the diffusion layer thickness that surrounds the particles and minimize clogging problems that could arise during filtration thus adsorption unit can run both with confined and free cpac just as effectively visual observation proved that confined cpac was fluidized within the filter and do not aggregate during experiment the high adsorption rates of azorubine obtained with the spinning adsorber unit confirm adsorption as one of the preferred techniques that can be used to purify industrial wastewater or to clean drinking water versus other physical methods as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis 47 the combination of low pressure membrane processes as mf uf with pac adsorption is a recent trend to adsorb trace dissolved contaminants in wastewaters 48 different pac dossing protocols and continuous pac membrane systems are proposed 49 50 the adsorption unit proposed offer a novel opportunity for its application in wastewater treatments plants for removal of anionic azo dyes as azorubine or other micropollutans an advantage is that the filters used in this work minimize clogging because of the high mesh hole size used 85 μm selection of best operation conditions for a specific configuration and water contaminant concentration requires further experimentation to optimize important variables of the adsorption unit as activated carbon concentration and hydraulic retention time 4 conclusions a rectangular prismatic spinning submerged filter protype is proposed as the best adsorption unit for wastewater contaminants removal using azorubine as model contaminant it reached the highest removal efficiency of all studied prototypes cpac was selected as the best adsorbent versus gac or μgac because its lower particle size 0 237 mm increases adsorption area and minimize pore blocking a high rotation speed of 600 rpm is needed to increase internal flow inside the adsorbent unit and minimize external and intraparticular diffusional problems the rectangular prismatic spinning submerged filter protype with confined cpac can be operated both in batch and continuous mode in continuous mode it must be operated as a submerged filter with interesting advantages a it allows increasing the concentration of activated carbon in the adsorption unit since the entire volume of the tank can be filled with new adsorbent material b the adsorbent can be progressively added by adjusting the dosage to the presence and concentration of adsorbate c it is possible to combine two types of adsorbent materials of different nature one inside the tank and the other in the basket which can be replaced independently d the fast rotation of the submerged filter allows a good mixing of the adsorbent but also minimize filter clogging e it could be used as a hybrid unit combining for example an advanced oxidation treatment with adsorption f it can be used to remove all kind of contaminants selecting a good adsorbent with particle sizes ranging between 80 and 250 μm and g saturated adsorbent can be regenerated in situ under batch operation using adequate solvents acid basic or saline solutions that favour contaminants desorption to get the best potential of this adsorber unit it is necessary to study applications on a large scale with real wastewaters from industrial or domestic effluents adjusting the adsorbent dose and residence time needed to remove the concentration of contaminants present in wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors

13211,adsorption process is widely used for the removal of wastewater contaminants classic adsorption units are fixed beds and membrane filtration systems in this work a novel configuration of a bench scale spinning adsorber submerged filter is proposed different prototypes of cylindric truncated cone or prismatic spinning adsorbers were studied using activated carbon of different particle sizes gac 1 5 mm granulated μgac 0 475 mm microgranulated and cpac 0 237 mm coarse powder as adsorbent and azorubine as model adsorbate high maximum azorubine adsorptions per unit mass of adsorbent of 214 225 and 275 mg g for gac μgac and cpac respectively were obtained using the langmuir isotherm adsorption model batch adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics and adsorbate uptake rate increased with decreasing adsorbent particle size best adsorption unit was a tank equipped with a spinning rectangular prism adsorber prototype all made of stainless steel woven wire filter of 180 mesh size running at 600 rpm and filled with a high cpac concentration 25 g l adsorber can remove azorubine at similar rates that the use of free moving cpac adsorber unit can run in continuous mode and works even better as a novel spinning submerged filter where filtered flow exits from a central pipe axis this integrated adsorption submerged filtration operation mode offer the possibility of adding a high initial dose or a continuous dosing of adsorbent in the tank increasing the adsorbent concentration of the unit this system can also offer novel opportunities for wastewater contaminants removal using different adsorbent materials located separately graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords spinning adsorber submerged filter active carbon azorubine wastewater contaminants wastewater treatment 1 introduction water cleaning is a key objective and challenge essential to human health social and economic development presence in aquatic environments of contaminants and nowadays emerging contaminants is receiving increasing interest in governments due to their undesirable effects on ecosystems and humans an example of contaminants are industrial dyes and their by products that are carcinogenic and toxic 1 other water soluble contaminants of high concern include pharmaceuticals daily personal care products endocrine disrupting chemicals hormones pesticides biocides organic chemicals or heavy metals 2 3 wastewater treatments plants should act as primary barriers against the spread of contaminants because wastewaters can be considered as a central source of this pollution it must be done an effort in treatments to remove all the contaminants present both in industrial and domestic wastewaters where contaminant concentrations may vary from mg l to ng l conventional physico chemical and biological procedures have poor removal efficiency for recalcitrant compounds so additional techniques after conventional wastewater treatments plants are needed to avoid its discharge to the aquatic environment 4 5 important removal technologies applicable for dye or micropollutants removal from wastewaters are adsorption or membrane processes followed by biological treatments or advanced oxidation processes 6 8 sometimes hybrid systems combining different technologies can enhance removal efficiency for many types of contaminants 9 10 the most extended and well known treatment technology at full scale plants for contaminants removal is adsorption 11 this technique can use a broad range of materials to adsorb the high variety of contaminants present in wastewaters the great assortment of adsorbent materials includes not only classic activated carbon from mineral or vegetal sources but also bioadsorbents from biomass residues inorganic materials nanoadsorbents or novel multifunctional materials that combine adsorption with photocatalysis or antibacterial properties 12 15 activated carbon ac is the most extensively used adsorbent because its structure offers very high surface areas 3000 m2 g high porosity and high degree of surface interactions the available ac forms vary on average particle diameter sizes from 0 25 mm of granulated activated carbon gac to 0 25 mm for powder activated carbon pac furthermore according with pore diameters ac is classified as macroporous 50 nm mesoporous 50 2 nm and microporous 2 nm mesopores are suitable for large to medium organic molecules colour taste and odour and micropores for smaller micropollutants 16 advantages of adsorption treatments are that no toxic compounds are formed it has high effectiveness also at low contaminant concentrations good cost efficiency flexibility in design and operation and feasible regeneration however special attention should be paid for reusability or proper disposal of saturated adsorbents and the competitive adsorption in presence of dissolved organic matter 17 classic adsorption units for contaminants removal are gac adsorbers of the fixed bed type and can be conventional rapid gravity or more commonly pressure filters empty bed contact times ebct varies for different micropollutants and it is usually in the range 5 30 min 18 although pac has a larger available specific surface area resulting in faster adsorption kinetics its use in fixed beds is limited because of its high compaction the use of pac can be extended as a tertiary treatment by the implementation of an additional separation process like sedimentation or filtration thus pac can be directly feed as a powdered slurry at the inlet to the treatment plant and later removed with clarifier sludge selection between gac and pac competes because of the advantages of both 19 continuous submerged membrane filtration coupled with pac has been also applied for micropollutants removal from wastewaters 20 another possibility not applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants is the use of rotating adsorbers a first option is rotating packed bed contactors where liquid enters through the centre of a doughnut shaped packed bed adsorber that rotate at high speeds generating high gravity centrifugal forces 21 a second option is rotating adsorbers built with spinning baskets filled with adsorbent which works as impellers inside the adsorption tank up to known diverse designs has been tested with different cylindrical perforated baskets dispositions and cfd models have been implemented for descriptions of internal mixing 22 23 these configurations facilitate an efficient adsorption process by particle movement minimizing external and intraparticular adsorbate diffusional problems and improving the use of porous activated carbons if we compare continuous operation of these rotating basket adsorbers with packed beds it must be considered that rotating adsorbers work with lower adsorbent concentrations because volume located outside rotating baskets has no adsorbent it means that continuous spinning adsorbers should use adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and fast kinetics to be viable in full scale plants an advantage of these adsorber units versus packed beds is its easy ph control this study explores a novel versatile prototype of spinning adsorber for wastewater contaminants removal the new prototype proposal can work both with the standard adsorbent inside of the spinning basket adsorber and as a spinning submerged filter with the adsorbent located outside this second continuous operation mode as a submerged filter can take advantage of a higher adsorbent concentration with the possibility of fresh adsorbent addition with time different spinning adsorber geometric configurations were studied within a variety of cylindric truncated cone or prismatic baskets prototypes made with mesh of different sizes impeller configurations tested generate different axial or radial flows in the tank adsorption was studied using activated carbon of different particle sizes gac μgac and pac to estimate the best particle size for operation it is expected that small particles will offer higher specific surface areas and faster adsorption kinetics but favour compaction a high micropore volume activated carbon was selected as adsorbent to evaluate a condition with high mass transfer limitations the adsorbate used in this study was azorubine an azo acid dye contaminant from textile industry azorubine is also present at high concentrations in pharmaceutical and mouthwash compositions as excipient and it is a potential emerging contaminant azorubine was selected as adsorbate because it is high water soluble stable to ph heat and light and has well known adsorption kinetics in activated carbon experiments evaluate the effect of activated carbon concentration particle size and rotation speed on adsorption kinetics in batch spinning adsorbers finally continuous adsorption studies compare the operation mode where flow exits directly from the tank and a novel adsorption submerged filtration operation mode where flow exits from the central tube axis once filtered this unit is a new proposal that could be used in wastewater treatment plants for contaminants removal 2 materials

germany inside the glass beaker rotate an impeller shaft built with two baskets hold to a metallic bar two different basket designs are used plastic baskets with frontal filter mesh or metallic baskets all made of filter mesh in addition studied baskets have two geometries cylindric or truncated cone plastic baskets were made with a rapid prototyping 3d printer dimension bst 1200es stratasys usa this technology print from the 3d solid model generated in the cad system plastic material was abs plus metallic baskets were made of stainless steel woven wire filter from the development of its surface and glued with cyanoacrylate adhesive in all cases activated carbon was weight placed inside the baskets and two circular lids made with filters of the different mesh sizes studied were located at both ends to avoid adsorbent lost stainless steel woven wire filters were supplied with different mesh sizes mesh 35 100 comercial garcía molina del segura spain and 180 giih amazon spain of 0 50 0 15 and 0 085 mm mesh hole size respectively basket volumes ranged between 8 and 12 ml the second prototype option b is shown in fig 2 and offers an axial flow pattern instead it is like the first option but use a 0 25 l glass beaker with a water jacket and a configuration with only one rectangular prismatic plastic basket covered with stainless steel filters tank was equipped with four equally spaced baffles necessary to work with rotational speeds higher than 200 rpm in all cases impellers were placed at a height of one third of the diameter of the tank from the bottom and rotated with an overhead stirrer microstar 7 5 digital ika werke gmbh co staufen germany 2 3 mixing time experiments studies were done with all designed prototypes made with stainless steel woven wire filter of mesh 35 and empty results were compared with the stirring of a flat blade impeller fig 1 mixing time was measured as the time it takes for the disappearance of the pink colour of the phenolphthalein indicator in a dilute sodium hydroxide solution by adding an excess of hydrochloric acid 24 tests were carried out filling the tank with deionized water 1 ml of 2 m naoh solution and 1 ml of phenolphthalein solution 0 5 in ethanol the stirrer device is then turned on at the speed to be tested and pink colour is evenly distributed then 1 ml of 3 m hydrochloric acid is added by means of a micropipette at a fixed point in the upper part of the tank a mobile phone is placed in front of the tank and a video is started at the same time as the acid is added the mixing time is determined when no colour is observed after viewing the video a jar test and leaching test type fc 6s with six agitation units was used to study rotation speeds from 10 to 200 rpm velp scientifica srl usmate italia tests were carried out in triplicate 2 4 obtention of activated carbons with different granulometry μgac cpac and pac different granulometries were obtained from commercial 1 5 mm gac after different dry grinding techniques and sieving gac granular activated carbon was milled with a grinder using the customized grinding option at the minimum value gvx242 krups seb group spain fraction of particles collected between stainless steel 0 85 0 25 mm sieves filtravibración s l barcelona spain were labelled as μgac microgranular activated carbon and those between 0 25 and 0 100 mm sieves were labelled as cpac coarse powder activated carbon gac was also milled with an ika mf 10 basic mill equipped with mf 10 1 cut grinding head and a 0 25 mm curved separation screen ika werke staufen germany then particles were sieved with a stainless steel 0 1 mm sieve and filtered fraction was labelled as pac powder activated carbon 2 5 physical characterization of activated carbons particle size characterization of activated carbons was carried out by laser diffraction with a mastersizer 2000 s equipped with a hydro 2000g unit malvern instruments ltd uk samples were added to reach the proper obscuration range and then measurements made in triplicate specific surface area of the activated carbons was measured using adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 at 77 k and co2 at 273 k using an autosorb iq xr 2 automated gas sorption analyzer quantachrome instruments boynton beach florida prior to the gas adsorption measurements samples were degassed at 250 c for 4 h total surface areas were determined from desorption isotherms of n2 using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method total pore volume obtained as p p0 0 95 and micro 2 nm and ultramicropores 0 7 nm volume according with dubinin radushkevic model from desorption isotherms of n2 and co2 respectively 25 true density of activated carbon was measured with a pycnometer vidrafoc s a barcelona spain apparent density was quantified as the weight of activated carbon that filled a 10 ml cylinder measured with a 4 digit precision electronic balance ax224 sartorius ag goettingen germany in the case of compact or tapped density the weight of activated carbon that filled a 10 ml cylinder was compacted with small strokes until the volume remained constant after approximately 1500 taps autotap quantachrome usa in all cases the density values were calculated as the weight in grams divided by the volume occupied by the sample measurements were made in triplicate the ph at the point zero charge phpzc was determined according with the mass titration method putting into contact activated carbons within the concentration range 5 100 g l with 50 ml of a 0 03 m kno3 solution flasks were agitated for 24 h in a shaker at 250 rpm until equilibrium ph was reached the phpzc was calculated as the ph at which a plateau is achieved when plotting equilibrium ph versus activated carbon concentrations 26 2 6 batch adsorption isotherm studies adsorption isotherms of azorubine on activated carbon were obtained mixing in 100 ml flasks 25 ml of different azorubine concentrations 50 500 mg l and 12 5 mg of an activated carbon gac μgac cpac ph of azorubine solutions were fixed to 7 0 simulating ph of wastewater effluents that are neutralized during pretreatment flasks were thermostated at 25 c in a dark chamber and orbitally shaken at 200 rpm after 5 days equilibrium was reached then 2 ml samples were withdrawn and filtered with 0 45 μm disposable syringe filters of regenerated cellulose agilent germany to remove any carbon particle finally azorubine samples were diluted with deionized water and its absorbance measured at 516 nm versus a blank cell filled with distilled water using an agilent 8453 waldbronn germany azorubine concentrations were calculated from absorbance values bellow 1 au through the calibration curve of absorbance versus azorubine concentration mg l which slope was 0 0492 coefficient of determination r2 of simple linear regression was 0 9992 the amount of azorubine adsorbed per mass of adsorbent mg g was quantified by 1 q e c o

activated carbons gac μgac or cpac using concentrations from 2 to 25 g l rotation speeds of spinning adsorbers were studied in the range from 200 to 600 rpm tanks were filled with azorubine concentrations ranging from 34 to 510 mg l ph 7 0 depending on activated carbon concentration used in all cases samples were withdrawn of the tanks at the necessary time intervals to follow the adsorption process filtered if needed with 0 45 μm disposable syringe filters its absorbance at 516 nm determined and finally the azorubine concentration calculated the amount of azorubine adsorbed

fit of the data using coefficient of determination r2 1 as error function to study which is the rate limiting step film diffusion or intraparticle diffusion the adsorption diffusion model of boyd applying the approximations given by reichenberg was used 30 according to boyd s diffusion model intraparticle diffusion is the adsorption rate controlling step when values of bt plotted versus

azorubine desorption on activated carbon were done with cpac in a dark chamber thermostated at 25 c initially 100 mg of cpac were saturated mixing in 500 ml flasks 100 ml of a 500 mg l azorubine concentration ph 7 0 after 5 days agitation at 200 rpm a sample was withdrawn to calculate final azorubine concentration of supernatant and the amount of azorubine adsorbed quantified as explained previously with eq 1 after saturation supernatant liquid was removed and cpac used for desorption experiments desorption experiments were done in closed vials adding to the 100 mg of saturated cpac 4

can be achieved in prototype b fig 2 after 2 h of agitation samples were withdrawn azorubine concentration of supernatant calculated and the mg of azorubine desorbed quantified multiplying calculated azorubine concentration by added volume 4 ml percentage of desorption was calculated as 13 desorption mg az desorbed mg az adsorbed 100 this desorption experiment was repeated different times to achieve a high desorption percentage finally to study the feasibility of adsorbent reuse desorbed cpac was saturated once again using 100 ml of a 500 mg l azorubine concentration ph 7 0 and the amount of azorubine adsorbed per mass of adsorbent mg g quantified with eq 1 2 9 operation in continuous mode with spinning adsorbers studies in continuous mode were done using the spinning adsorber prototype option b described in fig 2 in all cases 4 g of gac μgac or cpac were added to the adsorber basket which means a maximum concentration of 25 g l in the tank experiments were run with a hydraulic retention time of 20 min using an azorubine concentration of 500 mg l ph 7 0 volume level of the tank was kept constant at 160 ml controlling inlet and outlet flows with two peristaltic pumps pumpdrive 5001 heidolph instruments schwabach germany outlet flow port was located inside the tank but when the unit run as a spinning submerged filter outlet flow run through the central axis pipe adsorption tank was thermostated at 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 obtention and characterization of activated carbons commercial granular activated carbon gac of 1 5 mm particle diameter was dry milled to obtain microgranular activated carbon μgac coarse powder activated carbon cpac and powder activated carbon pac fig 3 shows measurements of particle size distributions obtained by laser diffraction of μgac cpac and pac curves of μgac and cpac are unimodal and quite symmetric the average particle diameter for μgac expressed as d 4 3 was 0 475 mm span 0 95 uniformity 0 298 for cpac was 0 237 mm span 0 94 uniformity 0 29 pac particles has a less uniform distribution a broader span and the average particle diameter for pac expressed as d 4 3 was 0 021 mm span 5 13 uniformity 1 67 according to the measured average particle sizes a filter mesh hole size of 0 5 mm was selected to retain gac inside spinning adsorbers during experimentation 0 15 mm to retain μgac and 0 085 mm to retain cpac inserts of fig 3 shows the visual difference in sizes for μgac and cpac particles versus filter mesh hole size it is used a three times lower filter mesh hole size than particle size activated carbons were physically characterized for surface area porosity and density table 1 gac commercial activated carbon studied shows high bet surface value 942 m2 g and total pore volume 0 492 cm3 g these values increase up to 1206 m2 g and 0 669 cm3 g for the lower particle size pac activated carbon is mainly microporous as evidenced by the steep adsorption increase at low pressures however bet adsorption desorption isotherms showed hysteresis which indicates the presence of mesopores the percentage of micropore fraction is quite high with respect to the mesopore amount with values ranging from 68 to 86 the higher percentages correspond to the lower particle size activated carbons cpac and pac activated carbons have also a high ultramicroporosity that decrease slightly with reducing particle size obtained values agree with previous characterization of gac 31 32 true density values of all activated carbons are higher than apparent density as expected of the porous structure of activated carbons apparent density of gac and μgac do not change however cpac and pac values are lower because small pac particles have difficulties to settle values of gac μgac and cpac packed density show a minor increase related with the decrease in particle size while pac value is clearly higher which reflect the high compaction degree it can reach pac was not studied further because its high compaction level would minimize liquid flow inside spinning adsorbers and its small particle size do not allow its total retention within the studied adsorbers made of stainless steel woven wire filter of 0 085 mm mesh hole size the ph of zero charge phpzc obtained in this work is 9 7 so surface is positively charged at the ph 7 0 used in this experimentation this value agrees with surface chemical characterizations found in literature that also evaluate presence of acid and basic functional groups acid substituents are carboxyl lactone or phenol groups while typical basic surface groups are oxygen containing carbonyls pyrone and chromene type structures and oxygen free lewis basic sites on the graphene layer total acidic and basic surface groups are 0 21 and 0 46 mmol g gac respectively 33 a correlation of basicity of activated carbon and azorubine adsorption is expected previous studies showed that sorption capacity of azorubine although dependent of ph vary slightly between ph 2 to 6 34 or ph 5 to 8 37 in this work azorubine adsorption was studied in deionized water without buffer addition so ionic strength is only related to azorubine concentration the ph of azorubine solutions were adjusted to 7 0 and it was stable during experiments gac has the presence of ionizable groups and a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface properties the electrostatic mechanism is not the only mechanism for dye adsorption gac has a high affinity for sorbates with phenyl and naphthalene containing groups activated carbon can also interact with dye molecules via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic hydrophobic mechanisms 34 3 2 modelling adsorption isotherms of azorubine on activated carbons adsorption isotherms provide a convenient mathematical description to assess the differences in adsorptive capacity of azorubine in gac μgac and cpac in this work azorubine adsorption at equilibrium was evaluated with the well known isotherm models of langmuir and freundlich table 2 shows the isotherm constants and correlation coefficients r2 obtained with the studied models and fig 4 the results fitted with langmuir model although both models describe reasonably well the experimental values langmuir offered the best description for gac and μgac previous research with acid dyes showed that langmuir model fits well experimental values 35 36 the rl value indicates favourability of the adsorption process it is irreversible rl 0 favourable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavourable rl 1 it can be assumed that azorubine shows a high and favourable adsorption according to the low values of rl 0 02 0 28 of langmuir model values of n greater than unity obtained with the model of freundlich also corroborate favourable adsorption of the dye 0 1 n 1 the magnitude of freundlich constant kf also indicates a high adsorption capacity which is suitable for the highly heterogeneous surface of activated carbon high adsorption capacity values qmax from 214 to 275 mg g were obtained in this study higher than previous results of 30 mg g 34 or 16 21 mg g 37 for azorubine adsorption in activated carbon cpac showed the maximum adsorption capacity related with its higher adsorption area this effect of adsorption capacity with particle size is well documented 38 3 3 modelling adsorption kinetics of azorubine on activated carbons adsorption kinetics plots of qt vs time for free gac μgac and cpac using an adsorbent concentration of 2 g l and an azorubine concentration of 34 mg l ph 7 0 were modelled with pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models table 3 shows the kinetic constants obtained with these models although pseudo first order and pseudo second order models describe well data for gac and μgac fig 5a shows the results of pseudo second order model because its better fit for cpac elovich model gives the lowest cpac showed the higher adsorption rate versus μgac and gac so it was selected for next experiments correlation with all activated carbons azorubine adsorption was fast at the beginning of the process due to the availability of active sites on the exterior surface and after the saturation of those active sites azorubine was adsorbed with a slower rate adsorption rate was strongly dependent on particle size and while gac took more than 720 min to adsorb all azorubine μgac needs about 180 min and cpac around 90 min values of kinetic constants increase following the order gac μgac cpac prior studies of dyes adsorption on gac showed also good fits of adsorption kinetics with these models but pseudo second order was always better 34 35 39 40 the effect of increased adsorbate uptake rate of dyes in activated carbons with decreasing adsorbent particle size is also reported 41 boyd s model was applied to kinetic data to analyse which is the main rate limiting step intraparticle diffusion or film diffusion fig 5b shows that the plot of boyd number versus time is linear for gac μgac and cpac passing close to origin it can be concluded that pore diffusion is the rate controlling step during experiments as could be expected from the high microporous structure of the activated carbon employed effective diffusion coefficient di cm2 min calculated from slopes were 1 60 10 6 1 09 10 6 and 8 55 10 7 cm2 s for gac μgac and cpac respectively it means that higher pore diffusional problems are found with gac that are minimized in case of the smaller cpac particles a different diffusion model is the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm that use a surface diffusion coefficient ds it assumes that internal mass transfer is only due to surface diffusion and that pore volume diffusion resistance is negligible boyd s effective intraparticle diffusion coefficient di can be considered similar to the hsdm surface diffusion coefficient ds whenever boyd plot intercept the origin 30 it can be concluded that adsorption is mainly controlled by the presence of micropores in the surface 3 4 reuse of activated carbon adsorption desorption studies desorption of azorubine is important to allow activated carbon reuse in the prototypes of spinning adsorber submerged filters that are studied afterwards experiments were done with cpac at the highest concentration than can be achieved in prototypes of 25 g l initial studies showed the effect of ph and solvents on desorption using 0 1 m hcl ph 1 deionized water ph 6 5 0 1 m naoh ph 13 ethanol 96 and acetone 10 final desorption reached were 0 3 9 4 2 8 and 12 2 respectively at ph 13 the anionic acid dye azorubine is desorbed because ph is higher than phpzc 9 7 and surface sites of cpac are charged negatively at ph 1 0 no desorption is observed as expected the interaction of the dye molecule and activated carbon is partially electrostatic as the best desorption was obtained with acetone 10 a new experiment studied a sequential desorption process with different acetone concentrations fig 6 a high desorption of 91 3 was reached after five desorption processes once azorubine was desorbed 94 a new adsorption was done to evaluate cpac reuse a 65 of maximum adsorption was reached 175 mg g which means that a high azorubine amount can be adsorbed after cpac reuse spinning adsorber submerged filters have cpac confined helping for successive desorption adsorption steps 3 5 prototyping spinning adsorbers mixing time studies with empty baskets fig 7 shows the effect of rotational speed of the different prototypes proposed in this study on mixing times all spinning adsorbers showed higher mixing times in comparison with the flat blade impeller in case of prototypes of spinning adsorbers type a that offers a radial flow pattern the cylindrical basket configuration gives lower mixing times in comparison with the trunk conical basket configuration in addition plastic basket configuration offers lower mixing times than metallic basket configuration spinning adsorber type b with an axial flow pattern offered mixing times between cylindrical and trunk conical baskets and it is an intermediate option from the mixing time point of view running at the higher rotational speed of 200 rpm mixing times are in the range from 7 to 12 s typical mixing times of stirred tanks using improved impeller designs are in the range from 3 to 6 s 42 flow regimes in mixing tanks depends on reynolds number of impellers and as an example the flat blade impeller of this study using rotational speeds higher than 30 rpm run in a turbulent mixing regime with reynolds numbers above 5000 24 spinning adsorbers had to be run with a high rotational speed close to or higher than 200 rpm to reduce mixing times minimize mass transfer limitations and then optimize adsorption rate 3 6 prototyping spinning adsorbers selection of best basket geometry with gac once studied the effect of rotational speed the proposed spinning adsorbers prototypes were compared studying batch adsorption of an initial azorubine concentration of 34 mg l ph 7 0 gac as adsorbent with a maximum load of 4 g l and a fixed rotational speed of 200 rpm results were compared with free gac stirred with a flat bade impeller fig 8 shows the adsorption kinetic plots obtained that fitted properly with the pseudo second order kinetic model of ho table 4 gives data of the calculated adsorption kinetic parameters as expected experiment with free gac at 4 g l gives faster adsorption kinetics than previous results with a lower adsorbent concentration of 2 g l metallic prototypes with open mesh in all directions had faster adsorption kinetics than plastic ones so it is essential to use this open mesh basket configuration to minimize mass transfer problems in the spinning adsorbers cylindrical geometry was preferred versus trunk conical and this effect is mainly observed with plastic prototypes in case of metallic prototypes adsorption kinetics were faster than obtained with free gac which means that the rotation of adsorbers minimize external mass transport and pore diffusion due to the internal flow inside the adsorbers the best spinning adsorber prototype was the metallic open mesh rectangular prismatic configuration with axial flow pattern and it was selected for further studies in addition this prototype can work with a higher adsorbent concentration of 25 g l the rectangular prismatic basket configuration type b offers an axial flow where flow enters mainly through the bottom side of the rectangular prism and then flow radially by the effect of centrifugal force in contrast spinning adsorbers type a offers a radial pattern flow where flows enter mainly through the side in contact with rotation and exits by the opposite direction 43 these results are consistent with scientific literature that explore batch adsorption kinetics with different rotating basket geometries a study with a rotating basket adsorber made with two cylindrical baskets of stainless steel and filled with bone char of particle diameters higher than 0 79 mm reveals that external mass transport does not control adsorption rate at rotating speeds higher than 200 rpm 44 a similar cylindrical basket adsorber that rotates with an additional impeller using activated carbon particles of 0 822 mm was operated at 700 rpm to minimize mass transport phenomena 45 another work uses a rotating cylindrical basket adsorber for zinc removal with a cation exchange resin of 0 3 1 2 mm particle size and concludes that maximum adsorption kinetics were obtained at 400 rpm 46 in reviewed cases open wired baskets were used with rotation speeds higher than 200 rpm and adsorbent particles of sizes higher than 0 3 mm no data of mesh hole size of metallic baskets are found in reference papers 3 7 optimizing rotating speed of rectangular prismatic spinning adsorbers once selected the rectangular prismatic adsorber as the best prototype new batch adsorption studies were done to evaluate the use of μgac or cpac using rotating speeds higher than 200 rpm fig 9 compares the adsorption kinetics of spinning adsorbers filled with gac μgac and cpac that rotates at speeds from 200 to 600 rpm versus free gac at 200 rpm the used activated carbon dose was the maximum amount that avoid activated carbon compaction inside the adsorption unit activated carbon and azorubine concentrations studied were 25 g l and 510 mg l respectively fig 9a shows that spinning adsorber filled with gac has adsorption kinetics similar or faster than free gac even at the lower rotation speed of 200 rpm however in case of μgac rotation speeds should be equal or higher than 400 rpm to get over kinetics of free μgac fig 9b when cpac is used only the higher rotating speed of 600 rpm offers adsorption kinetics as fast as free cpac fig 9c the cpac particles go from being compact to improving fluidization within the adsorber basket as stirring speed increases the high rotation speed allows a good wetting efficiency of particles and mixing inside the spinning adsorbers table 5 shows the kinetic parameters obtained modelling with pseudo second order adsorption kinetics the initial adsorption rate of azorubine calculated as k2 qt 2 for cpac at 600 rpm was 29 9 mg g min the prismatic rectangular adsorber prototype rotating at 600 rpm and filled with cpac 25 g l is the best prototype studied and can remove totally 99 8 of azorubine in 15 min with no need of activated carbon separation 3 8 continuous flow operation of rectangular prismatic spinning adsorber as submerged filter the prismatic rectangular prototype was selected to study continuous operation of spinning adsorbers rotating at 600 rpm with a 25 g l activated carbon concentration a high inlet azorubine concentration of 500 mg l ph 7 0 and a low hydraulic retention time of 20 min were selected to achieve maximum adsorption capacity of activated carbons in a short time fig 10 shows initial continuous experiments done with outlet flow port located inside the tank adsorption rate of azorubine on gac μgac and cpac is compared with the use of no adsorbent maximum adsorption capacity of all activated carbons was achieved after 8 h lowering considerably inlet azorubine concentration during operation cpac showed the higher adsorption rate versus μgac and gac so it was selected for next experiments there was no adsorbent loss during 8 h of continuous operation final studies were done with cpac using previous continuous operation conditions but with the spinning adsorber running as a submerged filter it means that flow exits from the central axis see fig 2 once filtered through the stainless steel woven wire of 85 μm of mesh hole size when the spinning adsorber run as a submerged filter filled with cpac azorubine is always in contact with activated carbon before leaving the adsorber unit a second option is to run the spinning adsorber submerged filter with free cpac located inside the tank instead of being confined in the spinning adsorber fig 11 compares with previous experiments the evolution of azorubine concentration in the outlet flow using both configuration proposals of spinning adsorber submerged filter results shows faster adsorption rates running as a spinning adsorber submerged filter so this configuration was chosen as the best values of adsorption rates with confined or free cpac were similar which means that confined cpac adsorbs azorubine as fast as free cpac the high rotation speed allows a fast adsorption rate of azorubine when activated carbon is confined and internal flow contributes to minimize diffusional problems rotation of the spinning adsorber also promotes a good mixture of the free cpac located in tank decrease the diffusion layer thickness that surrounds the particles and minimize clogging problems that could arise during filtration thus adsorption unit can run both with confined and free cpac just as effectively visual observation proved that confined cpac was fluidized within the filter and do not aggregate during experiment the high adsorption rates of azorubine obtained with the spinning adsorber unit confirm adsorption as one of the preferred techniques that can be used to purify industrial wastewater or to clean drinking water versus other physical methods as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis 47 the combination of low pressure membrane processes as mf uf with pac adsorption is a recent trend to adsorb trace dissolved contaminants in wastewaters 48 different pac dossing protocols and continuous pac membrane systems are proposed 49 50 the adsorption unit proposed offer a novel opportunity for its application in wastewater treatments plants for removal of anionic azo dyes as azorubine or other micropollutans an advantage is that the filters used in this work minimize clogging because of the high mesh hole size used 85 μm selection of best operation conditions for a specific configuration and water contaminant concentration requires further experimentation to optimize important variables of the adsorption unit as activated carbon concentration and hydraulic retention time 4 conclusions a rectangular prismatic spinning submerged filter protype is proposed as the best adsorption unit for wastewater contaminants removal using azorubine as model contaminant it reached the highest removal efficiency of all studied prototypes cpac was selected as the best adsorbent versus gac or μgac because its lower particle size 0 237 mm increases adsorption area and minimize pore blocking a high rotation speed of 600 rpm is needed to increase internal flow inside the adsorbent unit and minimize external and intraparticular diffusional problems the rectangular prismatic spinning submerged filter protype with confined cpac can be operated both in batch and continuous mode in continuous mode it must be operated as a submerged filter with interesting advantages a it allows increasing the concentration of activated carbon in the adsorption unit since the entire volume of the tank can be filled with new adsorbent material b the adsorbent can be progressively added by adjusting the dosage to the presence and concentration of adsorbate c it is possible to combine two types of adsorbent materials of different nature one inside the tank and the other in the basket which can be replaced independently d the fast rotation of the submerged filter allows a good mixing of the adsorbent but also minimize filter clogging e it could be used as a hybrid unit combining for example an advanced oxidation treatment with adsorption f it can be used to remove all kind of contaminants selecting a good adsorbent with particle sizes ranging between 80 and 250 μm and g saturated adsorbent can be regenerated in situ under batch operation using adequate solvents acid basic or saline solutions that favour contaminants desorption to get the best potential of this adsorber unit it is necessary to study applications on a large scale with real wastewaters from industrial or domestic effluents adjusting the adsorbent dose and residence time needed to remove the concentration of contaminants present in wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors

13212,two stage partial nitritation anammox pn amx processes have been pointed out as a feasible configuration for achieving mainstream anammox for two stage configurations stable partial nitritation has been reported feasible in granular sludge reactors this study aimed to explore the operating conditions involved in the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge using floccular sludge as inoculum the influence of different parameters such as free ammonia concentration settling time superficial gas flow velocity and ammonium oxidation rate was investigated enhancing ammonium oxidation activity since the early phase of the operation i e using conventional activated sludge as inoculum enriched with a fraction of a floccular nitrifying biomass promoted a fast development ca 30 days of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge performing stable nitritation when the seeded sludge presented a low nitrifying activity lower than 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 the increase of the air flow rate triggered the formation of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge since ammonium oxidation activity was promoted contrarily imposing low settling times 10 min or strong free ammonia inhibitory conditions fa concentrations higher than 50 mg n l 1 were shown to negatively influence the achievement of high ammonium oxidation rates hampering the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge this study demonstrated the importance of ensuring high ammonium oxidation rates higher than 0 2 g n l 1 d 1 for the proper development of an autotrophic partial nitritation granular sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords operational start up strategy superficial gas flow velocity conventional activated sludge autotrophic aerobic granular sludge ammonium oxidation rate 1 introduction the partial nitritation anammox pn amx process has been proposed as an efficient and cost effective technology for nitrogen removal in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 under this scenario two stage pn amx systems have been pointed out as a feasible configuration due to the reported successful results at temperatures as low as 11 c 2 3 one of the main challenges of the partial nitritation stage is the repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob during long term operation this is currently limiting the full scale implementation of pn amx in the mainstream of wwtps however successful partial nitritation stability has been reported in granular sludge reactors at lab scale for long term mainstream conditions 2 3 granule morphology allows to stablish oxygen and substrate gradients which enhances stratification of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob over nob 4 by operating at certain residual ammonium concentrations aob increase their oxygen consumption rate meaning that less oxygen is available for nob relegating them to deeper layers 4 5 accordingly a modelling study revealed that aob presented a better oxygen affinity compared to nob simply because the position of cell clusters within a stratified granule 6 most of lab and pilot scale studies that attained stable partial nitritation in granular sludge reactors at mainstream conditions used a pre formed granular sludge 2 4 or supplied a substratum i e activated carbon with the inoculum 7 8 designing a start up phase to form a nitrifying granular sludge in which conventional activated sludge cas is used as inoculum seems to be an appealing strategy for the scale up of this technology however seeding cas as inoculum prevents the initial suppression of nitrite oxidation activity through the same strategy designed for autotrophic aerobic granular sludge described and applied in 2 7 the nitrite oxidation can be reduced or even suppressed through inhibition of nob by free nitrous acid however this technology requests the availability of a nitrite concentrated wastewater 31 an alternative start up strategy i e in the short term is to avoid nitrite oxidation by transient inhibition of nob by free ammonia fa within floccular biomass 9 10 and simultaneously develop a granular sludge to this end a nitrogen concentrated wastewater such as that coming from the digested sludge dewatering system i e reject water could be used once the granular sludge has been developed fa inhibition will not be longer required and thus operation at mainstream conditions after the start up phase could be safely imposed by maintaining suitable dissolved oxygen total ammonia nitrogen do tan concentration ratio in the bulk reactor liquid 2 3 despite some studies focused on the achievement of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitritation 11 12 the particular set of operating conditions leading to an effective start up of this reactor type remains to date not well defined in contrast the development of heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge for the simultaneously removal of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen nitrification and denitrification and phosphorus has been widely studied e g nereda 13 heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge has been mostly cultivated from cas in sequential batch reactor sbr operations 14 the heterotrophic aerobic granulation process is known to be enhanced under short settling times high shear stress and feast famine conditions whereas the exposure to insoluble and particulate cod can comprise the granulation process as filamentous bacteria tend to proliferate 14 15 nevertheless it is unknown whether these conditions could also favour autotrophic aerobic granulation indeed although autotrophic nitrifying granules for nitrification have been developed the information on the nitrifying bacteria granulation mechanisms remains limited 16 17 the aim of this study is to investigate the operating conditions that can contribute into the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge achieving stable nitritation for this purpose an air lift reactor seeded with cas was used by working under a sbr mode among the different operational parameters that can influence the formation of a granular biomass performing partial nitritation this study has focused in the following i fa concentrations in the bulk liquid ii settling time iii shear stress forces in terms of superficial gas flow velocity and iv ammonium oxidation activity in terms of ammonium oxidation rates aors four operational strategies with different combinations of the above mentioned parameters have been planned and executed to determine which of these parameters present more influence on the autotrophic granulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation an air lift reactor with a working volume of 16 3 l operated in a sbr mode was used fig 1 the reactor presented a downcomer to separator diameter ratio of 0 36 a total length to downcomer diameter ratio of 11 and a riser height to diameter hr dr ratio of 19 4 the riser diameter was of 0 05 m and it was located at ca 10 cm above the reactor bottom the sbr operation consisted of four phases a static feeding phase 16 min an aeration phase with variable time length and a settling phase with variable time length see table 1 and a discharge phase 16 min cycle length phase was automatically regulated by using the on line measurement of the total ammonia nitrogen tan n nh4 n nh3 concentration in the bulk liquid fig 1 the aeration phase lasted until tan decreased to the given tan set point experiments were classified in numbered strategies as detailed in section 2 5 table 1 limited research effort has been given to the importance of the volumetric exchange ratio in the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge as most studies focused on the development of a heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge 18 indeed most of the studies that focused on the development of an aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitration set the volume exchange ratio at 40 50 11 12 in this study the volumetric exchange ratio was set at 40 except for strategy iii where it was correspondingly adjusted according to the operational needs table 1 the feeding was directly supplied from the bottom of the reactor during the aeration phase air and nitrogen gas if applicable were supplied through a porous membrane diffusor located at 30 mm above of the reactor bottom air and nitrogen flow rates were controlled by two different rotameters do was measured on line by a means of a do electrode do 60 50 crison instruments spain the ph was measured on line with a ph electrode ph 53 33 crison instruments spain with a variable set point by adding dissolved nahco3 ammonium concentrations and temperature in the bulk liquid were measured by using an on line probe aise sc with a cartrical cartridge hach lange germany temperature was maintained at 20 1 c by means of a cooling system connected to the reactor jacket all sensors and actuators were monitored and connected to the plc system 2 2 inoculum and wastewater characteristics the air lift reactor was inoculated with cas from a municipal wwtp in each start up strategy for the last experiment strategy iv the air lift reactor was also inoculated with flocculent sludge coming from a pilot scale reactor treating a sidestream water successfully performing partial nitritation the inoculated ratio of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss was 0 8 for all strategies the air lift reactor was fed in all operational strategies with a sidestream water coming from the dewatering of the digested sludge of a municipal wwtp i e reject water the used reject water was stored in a tank at 13 1 c during strategy i the reactor was fed with a sidestream water coming from the manresa wwtp catalonia spain the composition of the sidestream presented the following characteristics tan 238 309 mg n l 1 total nitrite nitrogen tnn n no 2 hno2 1 to 28 mg n l 1 nitrate 0 5 17 mg n l 1 ph 7 9 0 1 to work at higher fa concentrations a sidestream water coming from a different municipal

1 0 1 the wide range of tan concentrations depended on the anaerobic digester performance the variability of tnn and nitrate concentrations were because nitrification occurred within the stored wastewater tank 2 3 analytical methods influent and effluent samples of the air lift reactor were regularly analysed to determine tan tnn and nitrate concentrations samples were previously filtered 0 22 μm before analysis tan concentrations were analysed off line by means of a gas selective electrode gse amtax sc hach lange germany or by using colorimetric hach lange kits lck303 or lck302 hach lange germany tnn and nitrate concentrations were analysed off line with ionic chromatography using ics 2000 integrated reagent free ic system dionex corporation usa tss and vss concentrations and sludge volume index svi were analysed according to standard methods 19 average biomass particle size was measured by a laser diffraction analysis system malvern mastersizer series 2600 malvern instruments ltd uk the percentage of granular sludge was determined as the volumetric fraction of particles with a diameter higher than 200 μm 20 2 4 calculations the nitrogen loading rate nlr and ammonium oxidation rate aor were calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 respectively using nitrite and nitrate concentrations when treating reject water to estimate the aor it is not very precise since the high concentrations of nitrite and or nitrate together with potential interferences in the analysis would result in a low accuracy measurement therefore aor was calculated based on influent and effluent tan concentrations additionally mass balances were periodically checked to evaluate the degree of denitrification which was minimal as there was no biodegradable cod in the inflow and because no anammox was inoculated since tan tnn and nitrate concentrations in the effluent were precisely monitored no specific respirometric assays were performed as they would only provide and indirect measurement of activity and they could affect the granulation process since they should be performed in a mechanical stirred respirometer 1 nlr tan inf hrt 2 aor tan inf tan eff hrt where 3 hrt v r v

effective reactor volume l and to the volume exchange ratio respectively by using the corresponding tan concentrations fa concentrations at the beginning of the cycle fabc and at the end of the cycle

q air q n 2 a where qair and qn2 correspond to the air and nitrogen gas flow rates cm3 s 1 respectively and a corresponds to the area of the riser cm2 the superficial gas flow velocity was used as an indirect form of quantifying the shear stress conditions applied to the biomass of the airlift reactor 2 5 operational strategies the following parameters i fa concentrations in the bulk liquid ii settling time iii shear stress forces in terms of superficial gas flow velocity and iv ammonium oxidation activity in terms of aor were combined in four different operational start up strategies to achieve an autotrophic granular sludge performing partial nitritation table 1 each one of the experiments listed below as strategies lasted the period of time required to i develop a granular sludge and ii achieve a stable end product either nitrite i e partial nitritation or nitrate i e nitrification the nlr and thus the hrt were regulated in each strategy as the cycle length was automatically controlled by the on line tan measurement see section 2 1 and fig 1 for details detailed information of each strategy can be found below strategy i the aim of strategy i was to operate at moderate fa concentrations with a fast decrease of settling time and a low initial superficial gas flow velocity the applied fa concentrations were 7 2 mg n l 1 table 1 in the range reported for an effectively nob repression within floccular sludge 22 23 settling time was decreased from 30 to 10 min table 1 superficial gas flow velocity was maintained constant in the first part of the experiment by exclusively supplying air then superficial gas velocity was stepwise increased table 1 when the granulation process was still not detected after decreasing settling time below 20 min the reactor was seeded with cas with an initial biomass concentration of 1 g vss l 1 strategy ii during strategy ii high initial fa concentrations were imposed with a progressive decrease of settling time and a low initial superficial gas flow velocity during the first 8 days of operation fa concentrations were maintained at 57 mg n l 1 table 1 from day 8 onwards fa concentrations were maintained at 17 4 mg n l 1 until the end of the operation settling time was decreased from 30 to 10 min at slower pace than in strategy i table 1 superficial gas flow velocity was controlled by exclusively supplying air as in strategy i table 1 the reactor was seeded with cas with an initial biomass concentration of 2 g vss l 1 strategy iii the objective of strategy iii was to start the operation at low fa concentrations followed by a sharp increase during a short period to try to knock down nob when granule development was still incipient table 1 after this initial marked increase fa concentrations were decreased and maintained at 21 7 mg n l 1 until the end of the operation table 1 settling time was decreased as in strategy ii table 1 additionally nitrogen gas was supplied together with air to operate at higher superficial gas flow velocity compared to strategies i and ii and thus to explore the effects of shear stress on granulation see fig si 2 in supporting information for details the reactor was seeded with cas with an initial biomass concentration of 1 g vss l 1 strategy iv the aim of strategy iv was to enhance ammonium oxidation activity since the early phase of the operation the airlift reactor was seeded with cas 26 1 g vss but also with a fraction of floccular biomass performing partial nitritation 12 1 g vss ratio ca 2 1 respectively to reduce the influence of other parameters fabc concentrations were maintained similar as in strategy i settling time was not decreased but maintained high and roughly constant throughout the operation table 1 the superficial gas flow velocity was kept at the same initial value than in strategy iii though by exclusively supplying air 3 results the time course concentrations of tan tnn and nitrate in the effluent as well as tan influent concentrations for each operational strategy can be found in fig 2 particle size together with settling time and superficial gas flow velocity as well as aors have been plotted in fig 3 the time course concentrations of fa nitrate influent and effluent and solids can be found in fig 4 nlr together with aor and the do concentrations are depicted in supporting information figs si 1 and si 3 respectively 3 1 strategy i operating at moderate fa concentrations with a fast decrease of settling time and low initial superficial gas flow velocity initial inoculum size was 93 5 μm and slightly increased to 139 15 μm after 17 days of operation with a settling time decrease from 30 to 15 min fig 3 imposing a fa concentration 7 2 mg n l 1 table 1 in the reactor bulk liquid resulted in a fast achievement of partial nitritation as observed by the gradually nitrate depletion from 28 to 1 1 mg n l 1 in 13 days of operation fig 2 around day 20 particle size increased up to 200 μm fig 3 a threshold usually utilized to identify the achievement of granular sludge some days before reaching this milestone both superficial gas flow velocity and aor increased thereafter particle size gradually increased reaching a diameter of 270 21 μm after 38 days of operation fig 3 at the end of the operation i e day 38 58 of particles were greater than 200 μm with good settleability properties svi5 svi30 1 indicating a shift towards granular sludge fig 5 however from day 22 onwards partial nitritation was progressively deteriorated achieving up to a maximum nitrate concentration of 121 mg n l 1 in only 11 days fig 2 despite fa concentrations remained stable throughout the operation table 1 in the next experiment strategy ii high fa inhibitory concentrations were applied in the early stage of the operation to ensure a proper nob inhibition after the initial inhibitory period fa concentrations were subsequently maintained at higher levels compared to strategy i see fig 4a to strengthen nob inhibition throughout the operation settling time decrease and superficial gas flow velocity followed the same pattern than in strategy i 3 2 strategy ii operating at initial inhibitory fa concentrations with a progressive decrease of settling time and low initial superficial gas flow velocity initial particle size was 98 4 μm and only increased to 149 25 μm in the first 51 days of operation fig 3 despite decreasing settling time from 30 to 20 min to avoid nitrate production throughout the operation as occurred in strategy i high inhibitory fa conditions were applied 57 mg n l 1 table 1 however during the first 8 days of operation neither nitrite nor nitrate concentrations were detected indicating an inhibition of both aob and nob fig 3 to reduce the fa inhibitory conditions a cycle was manually performed at day 8 by filling the 40 of the reactor volume with tap water this operation resulted into a decrease of fa concentrations from 57 to 9 mg n l 1 after alleviating the imposed conditions fa concentrations were maintained roughly constant throughout the operation 17 4 mg n l 1 table 1 consequently nitrifying activity was detected as observed by the gradual production of tnn and nitrate up to 12 mg n l 1 nevertheless due to the low initial nitrifying activity the system completed its first cycle after 13 days of operation despite the initial nitrate production partial nitritation was successfully achieved and maintained for 44 days as nitrate concentrations were maintained at 1 9 1 1 mg n l 1 fig 2 on day 56 particle size increased up to ca 300 μm just before reaching this goal the superficial gas flow velocity incremented while the aor experienced a threefold increase fig 3 a size of 535 25 μm was reached at the end of the operation fig 3 further 60 of sludge particles surpassed the 200 μm threshold μm and the svi5 svi30 ratio was 1 the difference in size distribution at the initial and at the end of the operation confirmed the achievement of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge more developed than in strategy i fig 5 however after attaining a granular sludge nitrite built up became compromised after 60 days of operation as observed for the unceasing nitrate production resulting into a complete failure of the partial nitritation process based on the obtained results in previous strategies strategy iii was designed to evaluate the effect of shear stress forces on the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge on this sense nitrogen gas was supplied together with air to work at higher initial shear stress conditions than those of previous strategies higher air flow rates were required compared to previous strategies to maintain adequate bulk oxygen concentrations i e as oxygen mass transfer rate was reduced because nitrogen gas addition figs si 2 and si 3 in supporting information to reduce the influence of other parameters settling time was decreased as in strategy ii while initial fa concentrations were maintained to guarantee an initial ammonium oxidation activity they were subsequently increased to high inhibitory levels to ensure a proper nob inhibition and they were finally maintained at those levels of strategy ii to strengthen nob inhibition throughout the operation see fig 4a 3 3 strategy iii progressive increase of fa concentration from moderate to high inhibitory concentrations with a progressive decrease of settling time and higher initial superficial gas flow velocity the main difference of strategy iii compared to previous strategies was the higher superficial gas flow velocity applied from the beginning of the experiment as settling time was decreased at the same pace than in strategy ii fig 3 initial particle size of cas inoculum was 129 3 μm and progressively increased reaching an average particle size of 257 15 μm after 50 days of operation fig 3 nevertheless it decreased to 155 47 μm from day 50 to 79 fig 3 with a simultaneous biomass loss fig 4c fa concentrations were initially maintained at 15 4 mg n l 1 table 1 full nitrification was detected during the first 4 days of the operation as observed by the increasing nitrate production to reverse nitrate production fa concentrations were gradually increased to avoid aob inhibition until reaching a maximum of 113 mg n l 1 table 1 this resulted into a progressive nitrate rate depletion to avoid negative effects within aob activity fa concentrations were progressively decreased and maintained at 21 7 mg n l 1 until the end of the operation table 1 after this nitrite built up took place while nitrate concentration maintained low 3 2 mg n l 1 resulting into stable partial nitritation fig 2 from day 78 onwards nitrogen gas supply was almost zero fig si 2 in supporting information this change affected the oxygen transfer in the bulk liquid increasing the do concentration fig si 3 in supporting information and causing a momentary increase of the aor fig 3 from then on granule sludge size increased up to 409 76 μm presenting good settleability properties svi5 svi30 1 fig 3 the concentration of granular sludge increased in a 30 within the last 30 days of operation confirming the achievement of a significant amount of granular sludge at the end of the operation ca 60 of particles with size above 200 μm fig 5 in contrast to previous strategies stable partial nitritation was successfully maintained until the end of the operation fig 2 according to the obtained results a last experiment i e strategy iv was planned to work at higher aors compared to previous experiments and to assess its effects on the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge the reactor was inoculated with cas but also with a fraction of an enriched aob floccular biomass fa concentrations and settling time were maintained roughly constant throughout the operation the superficial gas flow velocity was set to maintain the same shear stress forces as in strategy iii but supplying only air 3 4 strategy iv enhancing ammonium oxidation activity by working at moderate fa concentrations and constant settling time and superficial gas flow velocity initial particle size was 107 1 μm and rapidly increased up to 465 11 μm in 27 days of operation crossing the threshold of 200 μm in less than 20 days fig 3 during this period settling time was maintained high 30 min while the initial superficial gas flow velocity was in the range of strategy iii table 1 superficial gas flow velocity unintentionally decreased during the operation as reactor diffusor became progressively clogged the main difference compared to other strategies was that the achieved aor was at least one order of magnitude higher since the beginning of the operation fig 3 nevertheless aor decreased during reactor operation along with a progressive biomass loss yet it remained higher than in previous strategies figs 3 and 4c respectively particle size was maintained at 470 61 μm svi5 svi30 1 with essentially 50 of aggregates surpassing the 200 μm threshold figs 3 and 5 respectively partial nitritation was attained since the early stage of the operation as nitrate concentrations remained low 2 1 mg n l 1 fig 2 it should be stressed that nitrate gradually increased to 7 mg n l 1 from day 27 to 42 though it was properly reversed within next days fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 effect of free ammonia and settling time decrease in the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitritation during the first 13 days of strategy i nitrate was produced fig 2 despite working at the reported inhibitory fa concentrations for nob inhibition within cas 7 2 mg n l 1 22 23 the initial nob persistence was reduced in strategy ii by applying a higher fa inhibitory concentration i e 57 mg n l 1 fig 4a however these fa concentrations severely reduced ammonium oxidation activity i e null aors fig 3 indeed ammonium oxidation activity was only detected some days after alleviating the applied fa inhibitory conditions fig 3 regardless of the applied fa concentrations partial nitritation destabilization occurred at the end of both strategies i and ii as observed by the unceasing nitrate production see section 4 4 for a detailed explanation during the initial phase of strategy iii fa concentrations in the airlift reactor were maintained at values ensuring that the ammonium oxidation activity was not inhibited in spite of nitrate production see fig 4a and table 1 these fa concentrations were regulated through the tan concentration imposed at the beginning of the cycle and the duration of each cycle then fa was progressively increased up to high inhibitory conditions i e 113 mg n l 1 which resulted into a consecutively nitrite built up fig 2 however as cas was not adapted to tolerate high fa concentrations these were relaxed to avoid negative effects on aob metabolism 10 24 fig 4a along with the suppression of nob within the seeding sludge settling time was simultaneously decreased in strategies i ii and iii the reduction of settling time has been described as a mechanism contributing to the achievement of heterotrophic aerobic granulation mainly due to the selection of slow growing heterotrophic bacterial species 14 however no granule development was observed when settling time was progressively decreased from 30 to 15 min for strategies i ii and iii fig 3 indeed the reduction of settling time acting as a selection pressure was not beneficial for the obtention of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge as it resulted into a progressively biomass wash out ca 0 5 g vss l 1 fig 4c this wash out required a long time to be compensated due to the low nitrifying growth rate and thus hindered the possibility of attaining high ammonium oxidization activities fig 3 a fast decrease in settling time negatively influenced the ability of retaining a sufficient concentration of nitrifying bacteria also applying high fa shocks to a non acclimated sludge showed to present disadvantages in terms of attaining a high ammonium oxidation activity consequently the inhibitory fa concentrations with the concomitant reduction of settling time resulted into low aors which were not beneficial for the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge 4 2 is the enhancement of superficial gas flow velocity promoting autotrophic aerobic granulation operating at high superficial gas flow velocities allows for higher shear stress conditions which can promote eps secretion contributing to the attachment and self immobilization process of bacteria 25 26 this mechanism is well established for heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge but it is unclear for autotrophic aerobic biomass also working at high air flow rates grants for greater bulk oxygen concentrations allowing aob to increase their activity the obtained results showed that granule development was achieved in first strategies i and ii just after increasing the air flow rate in turn resulting in an increase of the aor fig 3 to evaluate which mechanisms derived from incrementing the air flow rate triggered the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge i e shear stress conditions vs ammonium oxidation activity a third experiment strategy iii was performed in strategy iii a higher superficial gas flow velocity was applied since the early stage of the operation by supplying both air and nitrogen gas during this strategy a faster increase of particle size was detected from 128 3 μm to 257 15 μm in 50 days in accordance with the higher superficial gas flow velocity fig 3 however particle size subsequently decreased from day 50 to 79 fig 3 due to detachment as a significant increase in the effluent vss concentration was measured see fig 4 c iii the high detachment rates declined after day 80 consistent with the interruption of nitrogen gas supply when only air was supplied day 78 fig si 2 in supporting information an increase in granule size was measured from 155 47 μm on day 79 to 339 46 μm on day 85 see fig 3 this change also resulted into a marked increase in the ammonium oxidation activity i e aor fig 3 and higher bulk do concentrations fig si 3 in supporting information likewise granular sludge development of previous strategies i and ii occurred just after incrementing the superficial gas flow velocity and consequently observing an increase in the aors figs 3 and si 3 respectively experiments indicate that the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge was promoted by the higher ammonium oxidation activity derived from boosting air flow rate i e higher do whereas the effects of shear stress forces alone were not enough because they could also trigger significant detachment events indeed high shear stress conditions caused aob detachment and derived into a failure of the nitritation process in a stratified nitrifying granule structure the high detachment rates resulted into a thinner aob layer and into a smaller granular sludge size incrementing oxygen availability to the inner layers and thus allowing nitrite oxidation 27 4 3 linking the effects of ammonium oxidation activity to the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge for partial nitritation the role of ammonium oxidation activity on the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge from cas was further investigated in strategy iv compared to previous strategies higher aors were obtained since the beginning of strategy iv as the inoculum was enriched with a fraction of nitrifying biomass fig 3 the high ammonium oxidation activity derived into a high oxygen consumption i e low bulk do concentrations fig si 3 in supporting information under higher aors compared to previous strategies granular sludge was rapidly developed while partial nitritation was successfully achieved and maintained stable throughout the operation figs 3 and 2 respectively this is consistent with a study that allowed for a fast start up of the nitritation process within an aerobic granular sludge by enhancing aob at high do concentrations 3 5 mg o2 l 1 resulting into even higher and more compact granules 28 as the applied shear stress conditions were maintained similar than in strategy iii and settling time remained high the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge was shown to be promoted by the enhancement of ammonium oxidation activity in the early phase of the operation a period of nitrate production up to 7 mg n l 1 was detected from day 27 to 42 fig 2 related to an increase in bulk do concentrations up to 8 mg o2 l 1 which could not be monitored due to a failure of the bulk do monitoring system that lasted for 15 days fig si 3 in supporting information the higher oxygen availability derived into a transient nitrite oxidation as nitrate production successfully decreased 2 mg n l 1 fig 2 once bulk do concentration was lowered to 1 5 mg o2 l 1 and further maintained at ca 6 mg o2 l 1 day 40 onwards see fig si 3 in supporting information the bulk do concentration affects the oxygen penetration depth since when bulk do concentration increases oxygen can reach deeper layers of the granule this fast shift from nitrification to partial nitritation when do is manipulated has been identified as a strong indication of the stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge 4 6 the first three strategies tested in this study strategies i ii and iii demonstrated that the reduction of settling time was not promoting the development of an autotrophic granular sludge also the effects of shear stress forces derived from incrementing the superficial gas flow velocity by adding nitrogen gas showed to be not fully determinant if a high ammonium oxidation activity was not simultaneously promoted the obtained results in strategy iv showed that the high initial ammonium oxidation activity measured as aor accounted for the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge successfully performing partial nitritation the representative fraction corresponding to nitrifiers in cas is rather low i e 3 12 29 thus promoting high aors in the early stage of the operation can be challenging under these conditions the positive effects derived from increasing air flow rate were demonstrated to be effective in promoting autotrophic aerobic granular sludge formation as ammonium oxidation activity was enhanced however the increase of the air flow rate in a full scale reactor presents several challenges i the increase in energy demand and ii the potential limitation of aeration devices these challenges would require assessment in future research plus development studies 4 4 nob influent inoculation deteriorates partial nitritation stability partial nitritation was not successfully maintained in strategies i and ii fig 2 even after attaining a significant fraction of granular sludge at the end of reactor operation ca 50 60 in contrast nitrite oxidation was almost completely suppressed in strategy iii fig 2 the difference among these strategies was not the fa concentrations maintained throughout the operation fig 4a neither the do tan ratio 0 014 0 006 indeed this last parameter was lower than the reported to maintain a successfully stable nitritation in a granular sludge reactor 7 the reason that could explain the recovery of nitrite oxidation activity in strategies i and ii is the continuous nob reinoculation with the inflow the existence of this reinoculation can be inferred from the presence or absence of nitrate influent concentrations fig 4b the used reject water was stored in a tank several weeks and part of the tan concentration was progressively oxidized to nitrite and further to nitrate fig 4b hence the continuous tan oxidation clearly indicated the existence of aob and nob populations within the storage wastewater and consequently both were continuously seeded to the reactor in contrast the presence of nitrate in the influent of strategy iii was almost not detected fig 4b the nob population developed in the storing tank probably possessed a high tolerance to fa which resulted in failure of the partial nitritation process 30 interestingly in strategy iv there was a significant amount of nitrate in the influent from day 40 onwards fig 4b yet this did not result into nitrate production within the reactor compared to previous strategies the achieved aors were at least one order of magnitude higher fig 3 when nob inoculation took place in strategy iv a significant fraction of granular sludge was already obtained ca 50 of particles being greater than 200 μm which decreased the impact of the nob seeding because the number of cycles per day was higher at higher aors i e shorter hrt and higher washout of the reinoculated nob the wastewater storage during the development of a granular sludge performing partial nitritation should be done in conditions to avoid nob proliferation for eventual full scale applications of the partial nitritation process wastewater storage is not required therefore this issue would not require particular attention 5 conclusions in this study a specific operational start up strategy based on enhancing ammonium oxidation activity was shown to promote the development of an autotrophic partial nitritation granular sludge by using conventional activated sludge as inoculum in a short period of time ca 30 days when the inoculum presented a low activity the ammonium oxidation activity of the seeding sludge was enhanced by increasing the air flow rate which allowed for a higher bulk oxygen concentration against expectation and based on the reported conditions for granulation of heterotrophic aerobic sludge settling time decrease was not linked to autotrophic aerobic granulation in contrast high settling times allowed to retain a suitable biomass concentration beneficial for attaining higher ammonium oxidation activities finally applying strong free ammonia inhibitory conditions in the early start up phase i e seeding sludge resulted into low ammonium oxidation rates which also hindered the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge when starting up the cultivation of aerobic granular sludge for partial nitritation for two stage pn amx in mainstream the findings highlighted that it is possible to inoculate activated sludge and use reject water in an sbr configuration by applying the following set of experimental conditions high aeration flow rates long settling times and applying a loading rate that avoids fa inhibitory conditions once enough biomass concentration is achieved with this experimental start up strategy the reactor operation could be switched to continuous mode of

13212,two stage partial nitritation anammox pn amx processes have been pointed out as a feasible configuration for achieving mainstream anammox for two stage configurations stable partial nitritation has been reported feasible in granular sludge reactors this study aimed to explore the operating conditions involved in the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge using floccular sludge as inoculum the influence of different parameters such as free ammonia concentration settling time superficial gas flow velocity and ammonium oxidation rate was investigated enhancing ammonium oxidation activity since the early phase of the operation i e using conventional activated sludge as inoculum enriched with a fraction of a floccular nitrifying biomass promoted a fast development ca 30 days of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge performing stable nitritation when the seeded sludge presented a low nitrifying activity lower than 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 the increase of the air flow rate triggered the formation of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge since ammonium oxidation activity was promoted contrarily imposing low settling times 10 min or strong free ammonia inhibitory conditions fa concentrations higher than 50 mg n l 1 were shown to negatively influence the achievement of high ammonium oxidation rates hampering the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge this study demonstrated the importance of ensuring high ammonium oxidation rates higher than 0 2 g n l 1 d 1 for the proper development of an autotrophic partial nitritation granular sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords operational start up strategy superficial gas flow velocity conventional activated sludge autotrophic aerobic granular sludge ammonium oxidation rate 1 introduction the partial nitritation anammox pn amx process has been proposed as an efficient and cost effective technology for nitrogen removal in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 under this scenario two stage pn amx systems have been pointed out as a feasible configuration due to the reported successful results at temperatures as low as 11 c 2 3 one of the main challenges of the partial nitritation stage is the repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob during long term operation this is currently limiting the full scale implementation of pn amx in the mainstream of wwtps however successful partial nitritation stability has been reported in granular sludge reactors at lab scale for long term mainstream conditions 2 3 granule morphology allows to stablish oxygen and substrate gradients which enhances stratification of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob over nob 4 by operating at certain residual ammonium concentrations aob increase their oxygen consumption rate meaning that less oxygen is available for nob relegating them to deeper layers 4 5 accordingly a modelling study revealed that aob presented a better oxygen affinity compared to nob simply because the position of cell clusters within a stratified granule 6 most of lab and pilot scale studies that attained stable partial nitritation in granular sludge reactors at mainstream conditions used a pre formed granular sludge 2 4 or supplied a substratum i e activated carbon with the inoculum 7 8 designing a start up phase to form a nitrifying granular sludge in which conventional activated sludge cas is used as inoculum seems to be an appealing strategy for the scale up of this technology however seeding cas as inoculum prevents the initial suppression of nitrite oxidation activity through the same strategy designed for autotrophic aerobic granular sludge described and applied in 2 7 the nitrite oxidation can be reduced or even suppressed through inhibition of nob by free nitrous acid however this technology requests the availability of a nitrite concentrated wastewater 31 an alternative start up strategy i e in the short term is to avoid nitrite oxidation by transient inhibition of nob by free ammonia fa within floccular biomass 9 10 and simultaneously develop a granular sludge to this end a nitrogen concentrated wastewater such as that coming from the digested sludge dewatering system i e reject water could be used once the granular sludge has been developed fa inhibition will not be longer required and thus operation at mainstream conditions after the start up phase could be safely imposed by maintaining suitable dissolved oxygen total ammonia nitrogen do tan concentration ratio in the bulk reactor liquid 2 3 despite some studies focused on the achievement of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitritation 11 12 the particular set of operating conditions leading to an effective start up of this reactor type remains to date not well defined in contrast the development of heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge for the simultaneously removal of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen nitrification and denitrification and phosphorus has been widely studied e g nereda 13 heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge has been mostly cultivated from cas in sequential batch reactor sbr operations 14 the heterotrophic aerobic granulation process is known to be enhanced under short settling times high shear stress and feast famine conditions whereas the exposure to insoluble and particulate cod can comprise the granulation process as filamentous bacteria tend to proliferate 14 15 nevertheless it is unknown whether these conditions could also favour autotrophic aerobic granulation indeed although autotrophic nitrifying granules for nitrification have been developed the information on the nitrifying bacteria granulation mechanisms remains limited 16 17 the aim of this study is to investigate the operating conditions that can contribute into the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge achieving stable nitritation for this purpose an air lift reactor seeded with cas was used by working under a sbr mode among the different operational parameters that can influence the formation of a granular biomass performing partial nitritation this study has focused in the following i fa concentrations in the bulk liquid ii settling time iii shear stress forces in terms of superficial gas flow velocity and iv ammonium oxidation activity in terms of ammonium oxidation rates aors four operational strategies with different combinations of the above mentioned parameters have been planned and executed to determine which of these parameters present more influence on the autotrophic granulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation an air lift reactor with a working volume of 16 3 l operated in a sbr mode was used fig 1 the reactor presented a downcomer to separator diameter ratio of 0 36 a total length to downcomer diameter ratio of 11 and a riser height to diameter hr dr ratio of 19 4 the riser diameter was of 0 05 m and it was located at ca 10 cm above the reactor bottom the sbr operation consisted of four phases a static feeding phase 16 min an aeration phase with variable time length and a settling phase with variable time length see table 1 and a discharge phase 16 min cycle length phase was automatically regulated by using the on line measurement of the total ammonia nitrogen tan n nh4 n nh3 concentration in the bulk liquid fig 1 the aeration phase lasted until tan decreased to the given tan set point experiments were classified in numbered strategies as detailed in section 2 5 table 1 limited research effort has been given to the importance of the volumetric exchange ratio in the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge as most studies focused on the development of a heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge 18 indeed most of the studies that focused on the development of an aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitration set the volume exchange ratio at 40 50 11 12 in this study the volumetric exchange ratio was set at 40 except for strategy iii where it was correspondingly adjusted according to the operational needs table 1 the feeding was directly supplied from the bottom of the reactor during the aeration phase air and nitrogen gas if applicable were supplied through a porous membrane diffusor located at 30 mm above of the reactor bottom air and nitrogen flow rates were controlled by two different rotameters do was

reactor was inoculated with cas from a municipal wwtp in each start up strategy for the last experiment strategy iv the air lift reactor was also inoculated with flocculent sludge coming from a pilot scale reactor treating a sidestream water successfully performing partial nitritation the inoculated ratio of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss was 0 8 for all strategies the air lift reactor was fed in all operational strategies with a sidestream water coming from the dewatering of the digested sludge of a municipal wwtp i e reject water the used reject water was stored in a tank at 13 1 c during strategy i the reactor was fed with a sidestream water coming from the manresa wwtp catalonia spain the composition of the sidestream presented the following characteristics

instruments ltd uk the percentage of granular sludge was determined as the volumetric fraction of particles with a diameter higher than 200 μm 20 2 4 calculations the nitrogen loading rate nlr and ammonium oxidation rate aor were calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 respectively using nitrite and nitrate concentrations when treating reject water to estimate the aor it is not very precise since the high concentrations of nitrite and or nitrate together with potential interferences in the analysis would result in a low accuracy measurement therefore aor was calculated based on influent and effluent tan concentrations additionally mass balances were periodically checked to evaluate the degree of denitrification which was minimal as there was no biodegradable cod in the inflow and because no anammox was inoculated since tan tnn and nitrate concentrations in the effluent were precisely monitored no specific respirometric assays were performed as they would only provide and indirect measurement of activity and they could affect the granulation process since they should be performed in a mechanical stirred respirometer 1 nlr tan inf hrt 2 aor tan inf tan eff hrt where 3 hrt v r v

indirect form of quantifying the shear stress conditions applied to the biomass of the airlift reactor 2 5 operational strategies the following parameters i fa concentrations in the bulk liquid ii settling time iii shear stress forces in terms of superficial gas flow velocity and iv ammonium oxidation activity in terms of aor were combined in four different operational start up strategies to achieve an autotrophic granular sludge performing partial nitritation table 1 each one of the experiments listed below as strategies lasted the period of time required to i develop a granular sludge and ii achieve a stable end product either nitrite i e partial nitritation or nitrate i e nitrification the nlr and thus the hrt were regulated in each strategy as the cycle length was automatically controlled by the on line tan measurement see section 2 1 and fig 1 for details detailed information of each strategy can be found below strategy i the aim of strategy i was to operate at moderate fa concentrations with a fast decrease of settling time and a low initial superficial gas flow velocity the applied fa concentrations were 7 2 mg n l 1 table 1 in the range reported for an effectively nob repression within floccular sludge 22 23 settling time was decreased from 30 to 10 min table 1 superficial gas flow velocity was maintained constant in the first part of the experiment by exclusively supplying air then superficial gas velocity was stepwise increased table 1 when the granulation process was still not detected after decreasing settling time below 20 min the reactor was seeded with cas with an initial biomass concentration of 1 g vss l 1 strategy ii during strategy ii high initial fa concentrations were imposed with a progressive decrease of settling time and a low initial superficial gas flow velocity during the first 8 days of operation fa concentrations were maintained at 57 mg n l 1 table 1 from day 8 onwards fa concentrations were maintained at 17 4 mg n l 1 until the end of the operation settling time was decreased from 30 to 10 min at slower pace than in strategy i table 1 superficial gas flow velocity was controlled by exclusively supplying air as in strategy i table 1 the reactor was seeded with cas with an initial biomass concentration of 2 g vss l 1 strategy iii the objective of strategy iii was to start the operation at low fa concentrations followed by a sharp increase during a short period to try to knock down nob when granule development was still incipient table 1 after this initial marked increase fa concentrations were decreased and maintained at 21 7 mg n l 1 until the end of the operation table 1 settling time was decreased as in strategy ii table 1 additionally nitrogen gas was supplied together with air to operate at higher superficial gas flow velocity compared to strategies i and ii and thus to explore the effects of shear stress on granulation see fig si 2 in supporting information for details the reactor was seeded with cas with an initial biomass concentration of 1 g vss l 1 strategy iv the aim of strategy iv was to enhance ammonium oxidation activity since the early phase of the operation the airlift reactor was seeded with cas 26 1 g vss but also with a fraction of floccular biomass performing partial nitritation 12 1 g vss ratio ca 2 1 respectively to reduce the influence of other parameters fabc concentrations were maintained similar as in strategy i settling time was not decreased but maintained high and roughly constant throughout the operation table 1 the superficial gas flow velocity was kept at the same initial value than in strategy iii though by exclusively supplying air 3 results the time course concentrations of tan tnn and nitrate in the effluent as well as tan influent concentrations for each operational strategy can be found in fig 2 particle size together with settling time and superficial gas flow velocity as well as aors have been plotted in fig 3 the time course concentrations of fa nitrate influent and effluent and solids can be found in fig 4 nlr together with aor and the do concentrations are depicted in supporting information figs si 1 and si 3 respectively 3 1 strategy i operating at moderate fa concentrations with a fast decrease of settling time and low initial superficial gas flow velocity initial inoculum size was 93 5 μm and slightly increased to 139 15 μm after 17 days of operation with a settling time decrease from 30 to 15 min fig 3 imposing a fa concentration 7 2 mg n l 1 table 1 in the reactor bulk liquid resulted in a fast achievement of partial nitritation as observed by the gradually nitrate depletion from 28 to 1 1 mg n l 1 in 13 days of operation fig 2 around day 20 particle size increased up to 200 μm fig 3 a threshold usually utilized to identify the achievement of granular sludge some days before reaching this milestone both superficial gas flow velocity and aor increased thereafter particle size gradually increased reaching a diameter of 270 21 μm after 38 days of operation fig 3 at the end of the operation i e day 38 58 of particles were greater than 200 μm with good settleability properties svi5 svi30 1 indicating a shift towards granular sludge fig 5 however from day 22 onwards partial nitritation was progressively deteriorated achieving up to a maximum nitrate concentration of 121 mg n l 1 in only 11 days fig 2 despite fa concentrations remained stable throughout the operation table 1 in the next experiment strategy ii high fa inhibitory concentrations were applied in the early stage of the operation to ensure a proper nob inhibition after the initial inhibitory period fa concentrations were subsequently maintained at higher levels compared to strategy i see fig 4a to strengthen nob inhibition throughout the operation settling time decrease and superficial gas flow velocity followed the same pattern than in strategy i 3 2 strategy ii operating at initial inhibitory fa concentrations with a progressive decrease of settling time and low initial superficial gas flow velocity initial particle size was 98 4 μm and only increased to 149 25 μm in the first 51 days of operation fig 3 despite decreasing settling time from 30 to 20 min to avoid nitrate production throughout the operation as occurred in strategy i high inhibitory fa conditions were applied 57 mg n l 1 table 1 however during the first 8 days of operation neither nitrite nor nitrate concentrations were detected indicating an inhibition of both aob and nob fig 3 to reduce the fa inhibitory conditions a cycle was manually performed at day 8 by filling the 40 of the reactor volume with tap water this operation resulted into a decrease of fa concentrations from 57 to 9 mg n l 1 after alleviating the imposed conditions fa concentrations were maintained roughly constant throughout the operation 17 4 mg n l 1 table 1 consequently nitrifying activity was detected as observed by the gradual production of tnn and nitrate up to 12 mg n l 1 nevertheless due to the low initial nitrifying activity the system completed its first cycle after 13 days of operation despite the initial nitrate production partial nitritation was successfully achieved and maintained for 44 days as nitrate concentrations were maintained at 1 9 1 1 mg n l 1 fig 2 on day 56 particle size increased up to ca 300 μm just before reaching this goal the superficial gas flow velocity incremented while the aor experienced a threefold increase fig 3 a size of 535 25 μm was reached at the end of the operation fig 3 further 60 of sludge particles surpassed the 200 μm threshold μm and the svi5 svi30 ratio was 1 the difference in size distribution at the initial and at the end of the operation confirmed the achievement of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge more developed than in strategy i fig 5 however after attaining a granular sludge nitrite built up became compromised after 60 days of operation as observed for the unceasing nitrate production resulting into a complete failure of the partial nitritation process based on the obtained results in previous strategies strategy iii was designed to evaluate the effect of shear stress forces on the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge on this sense nitrogen gas was supplied together with air to work at higher initial shear stress conditions than those of previous strategies higher air flow rates were required compared to previous strategies to maintain adequate bulk oxygen concentrations i e as oxygen mass transfer rate was reduced because nitrogen gas addition figs si 2 and si 3 in supporting information to reduce the influence of other parameters settling time was decreased as in strategy ii while initial fa concentrations were maintained to guarantee an initial ammonium oxidation activity they were subsequently increased to high inhibitory levels to ensure a proper nob inhibition and they were finally maintained at those levels of strategy ii to strengthen nob inhibition throughout the operation see fig 4a 3 3 strategy iii progressive increase of fa concentration from moderate to high inhibitory concentrations with a progressive decrease of settling time and higher initial superficial gas flow velocity the main difference of strategy iii compared to previous strategies was the higher superficial gas flow velocity applied from the beginning of the experiment as settling time was decreased at the same pace than in strategy ii fig 3 initial particle size of cas inoculum was 129 3 μm and progressively increased reaching an average particle size of 257 15 μm after 50 days of operation fig 3 nevertheless it decreased to 155 47 μm from day 50 to 79 fig 3 with a simultaneous biomass loss fig 4c fa concentrations were initially maintained at 15 4 mg n l 1 table 1 full nitrification was detected during the first 4 days of the operation as observed by the increasing nitrate production to reverse nitrate production fa concentrations were gradually increased to avoid aob inhibition until reaching a maximum of 113 mg n l 1 table 1 this resulted into a progressive nitrate rate depletion to avoid negative effects within aob activity fa concentrations were progressively decreased and maintained at 21 7 mg n l 1 until the end of the operation table 1 after this nitrite built up took place while nitrate concentration maintained low 3 2 mg n l 1 resulting into stable partial nitritation fig 2 from day 78 onwards nitrogen gas supply was almost zero fig si 2 in supporting information this change affected the oxygen transfer in the bulk liquid increasing the do concentration fig si 3 in supporting information and causing a momentary increase of the aor fig 3 from then on granule sludge size increased up to 409 76 μm presenting good settleability properties svi5 svi30 1 fig 3 the concentration of granular sludge increased in a 30 within the last 30 days of operation confirming the achievement of a significant amount of granular sludge at the end of the operation ca 60 of particles with size above 200 μm fig 5 in contrast to previous strategies stable partial nitritation was successfully maintained until the end of the operation fig 2 according to the obtained results a last experiment i e strategy iv was planned to work at higher aors compared to previous experiments and to assess its effects on the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge the reactor was inoculated with cas but also with a fraction of an enriched aob floccular biomass fa concentrations and settling time were maintained roughly constant throughout the operation the superficial gas flow velocity was set to maintain the same shear stress forces as in strategy iii but supplying only air 3 4 strategy iv enhancing ammonium oxidation activity by working at moderate fa concentrations and constant settling time and superficial gas flow velocity initial particle size was 107 1 μm and rapidly increased up to 465 11 μm in 27 days of operation crossing the threshold of 200 μm in less than 20 days fig 3 during this period settling time was maintained high 30 min while the initial superficial gas flow velocity was in the range of strategy iii table 1 superficial gas flow velocity unintentionally decreased during the operation as reactor diffusor became progressively clogged the main difference compared to other strategies was that the achieved aor was at least one order of magnitude higher since the beginning of the operation fig 3 nevertheless aor decreased during reactor operation along with a progressive biomass loss yet it remained higher than in previous strategies figs 3 and 4c respectively particle size was maintained at 470 61 μm svi5 svi30 1 with essentially 50 of aggregates surpassing the 200 μm threshold figs 3 and 5 respectively partial nitritation was attained since the early stage of the operation as nitrate concentrations remained low 2 1 mg n l 1 fig 2 it should be stressed that nitrate gradually increased to 7 mg n l 1 from day 27 to 42 though it was properly reversed within next days fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 effect of free ammonia and settling time decrease in the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitritation during the first 13 days of strategy i nitrate was produced fig 2 despite working at the reported inhibitory fa concentrations for nob inhibition within cas 7 2 mg n l 1 22 23 the initial nob persistence was reduced in strategy ii by applying a higher fa inhibitory concentration i e 57 mg n l 1 fig 4a however these fa concentrations severely reduced ammonium oxidation activity i e null aors fig 3 indeed ammonium oxidation activity was only detected some days after alleviating the applied fa inhibitory conditions fig 3 regardless of the applied fa concentrations partial nitritation destabilization occurred at the end of both strategies i and ii as observed by the unceasing nitrate production see section 4 4 for a detailed explanation during the initial phase of strategy iii fa concentrations in the airlift reactor were maintained at values ensuring that the ammonium oxidation activity was not inhibited in spite of nitrate production see fig 4a and table 1 these fa concentrations were regulated through the tan concentration imposed at the beginning of the cycle and the duration of each cycle then fa was progressively increased up to high inhibitory conditions i e 113 mg n l 1 which resulted into a consecutively nitrite built up fig 2 however as cas was not adapted to tolerate high fa concentrations these were relaxed to avoid negative effects on aob metabolism 10 24 fig 4a along with the suppression of nob within the seeding sludge settling time was simultaneously decreased in strategies i ii and iii the reduction of settling time has been described as a mechanism contributing to the achievement of heterotrophic aerobic granulation mainly due to the selection of slow growing heterotrophic bacterial species 14 however no granule development was observed when settling time was progressively decreased from 30 to 15 min for strategies i ii and iii fig 3 indeed the reduction of settling time acting as a selection pressure was not beneficial for the obtention of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge as it resulted into a progressively biomass wash out ca 0 5 g vss l 1 fig 4c this wash out required a long time to be compensated due to the low nitrifying growth rate and thus hindered the possibility of attaining high ammonium oxidization activities fig 3 a fast decrease in settling time negatively influenced the ability of retaining a sufficient concentration of nitrifying bacteria also applying high fa shocks to a non acclimated sludge showed to present disadvantages in terms of attaining a high ammonium oxidation activity consequently the inhibitory fa concentrations with the concomitant reduction of settling time resulted into low aors which were not beneficial for the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge 4 2 is the enhancement of superficial gas flow velocity promoting autotrophic aerobic granulation operating at high superficial gas flow velocities allows for higher shear stress conditions which can promote eps secretion contributing to the attachment and self immobilization process of bacteria 25 26 this mechanism is well established for heterotrophic aerobic granular sludge but it is unclear for autotrophic aerobic biomass also working at high air flow rates grants for greater bulk oxygen concentrations allowing aob to increase their activity the obtained results showed that granule development was achieved in first strategies i and ii just after increasing the air flow rate in turn resulting in an increase of the aor fig 3 to evaluate which mechanisms derived from incrementing the air flow rate triggered the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge i e shear stress conditions vs ammonium oxidation activity a third experiment strategy iii was performed in strategy iii a higher superficial gas flow velocity was applied since the early stage of the operation by supplying both air and nitrogen gas during this strategy a faster increase of particle size was detected from 128 3 μm to 257 15 μm in 50 days in accordance with the higher superficial gas flow velocity fig 3 however particle size subsequently decreased from day 50 to 79 fig 3 due to detachment as a significant increase in the effluent vss concentration was measured see fig 4 c iii the high detachment rates declined after day 80 consistent with the interruption of nitrogen gas supply when only air was supplied day 78 fig si 2 in supporting information an increase in granule size was measured from 155 47 μm on day 79 to 339 46 μm on day 85 see fig 3 this change also resulted into a marked increase in the ammonium oxidation activity i e aor fig 3 and higher bulk do concentrations fig si 3 in supporting information likewise granular sludge development of previous strategies i and ii occurred just after incrementing the superficial gas flow velocity and consequently observing an increase in the aors figs 3 and si 3 respectively experiments indicate that the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge was promoted by the higher ammonium oxidation activity derived from boosting air flow rate i e higher do whereas the effects of shear stress forces alone were not enough because they could also trigger significant detachment events indeed high shear stress conditions caused aob detachment and derived into a failure of the nitritation process in a stratified nitrifying granule structure the high detachment rates resulted into a thinner aob layer and into a smaller granular sludge size incrementing oxygen availability to the inner layers and thus allowing nitrite oxidation 27 4 3 linking the effects of ammonium oxidation activity to the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge for partial nitritation the role of ammonium oxidation activity on the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge from cas was further investigated in strategy iv compared to previous strategies higher aors were obtained since the beginning of strategy iv as the inoculum was enriched with a fraction of nitrifying biomass fig 3 the high ammonium oxidation activity derived into a high oxygen consumption i e low bulk do concentrations fig si 3 in supporting information under higher aors compared to previous strategies granular sludge was rapidly developed while partial nitritation was successfully achieved and maintained stable throughout the operation figs 3 and 2 respectively this is consistent with a study that allowed for a fast start up of the nitritation process within an aerobic granular sludge by enhancing aob at high do concentrations 3 5 mg o2 l 1 resulting into even higher and more compact granules 28 as the applied shear stress conditions were maintained similar than in strategy iii and settling time remained high the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge was shown to be promoted by the enhancement of ammonium oxidation activity in the early phase of the operation a period of nitrate production up to 7 mg n l 1 was detected from day 27 to 42 fig 2 related to an increase in bulk do concentrations up to 8 mg o2 l 1 which could not be monitored due to a failure of the bulk do monitoring system that lasted for 15 days fig si 3 in supporting information the higher oxygen availability derived into a transient nitrite oxidation as nitrate production successfully decreased 2 mg n l 1 fig 2 once bulk do concentration was lowered to 1 5 mg o2 l 1 and further maintained at ca 6 mg o2 l 1 day 40 onwards see fig si 3 in supporting information the bulk do concentration affects the oxygen penetration depth since when bulk do concentration increases oxygen can reach deeper layers of the granule this fast shift from nitrification to partial nitritation when do is manipulated has been identified as a strong indication of the stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge 4 6 the first three strategies tested in this study strategies i ii and iii demonstrated that the reduction of settling time was not promoting the development of an autotrophic granular sludge also the effects of shear stress forces derived from incrementing the superficial gas flow velocity by adding nitrogen gas showed to be not fully determinant if a high ammonium oxidation activity was not simultaneously promoted the obtained results in strategy iv showed that the high initial ammonium oxidation activity measured as aor accounted for the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge successfully performing partial nitritation the representative fraction corresponding to nitrifiers in cas is rather low i e 3 12 29 thus promoting high aors in the early stage of the operation can be challenging under these conditions the positive effects derived from increasing air flow rate were demonstrated to be effective in promoting autotrophic aerobic granular sludge formation as ammonium oxidation activity was enhanced however the increase of the air flow rate in a full scale reactor presents several challenges i the increase in energy demand and ii the potential limitation of aeration devices these challenges would require assessment in future research plus development studies 4 4 nob influent inoculation deteriorates partial nitritation stability partial nitritation was not successfully maintained in strategies i and ii fig 2 even after attaining a significant fraction of granular sludge at the end of reactor operation ca 50 60 in contrast nitrite oxidation was almost completely suppressed in strategy iii fig 2 the difference among these strategies was not the fa concentrations maintained throughout the operation fig 4a neither the do tan ratio 0 014 0 006 indeed this last parameter was lower than the reported to maintain a successfully stable nitritation in a granular sludge reactor 7 the reason that could explain the recovery of nitrite oxidation activity in strategies i and ii is the continuous nob reinoculation with the inflow the existence of this reinoculation can be inferred from the presence or absence of nitrate influent concentrations fig 4b the used reject water was stored in a tank several weeks and part of the tan concentration was progressively oxidized to nitrite and further to nitrate fig 4b hence the continuous tan oxidation clearly indicated the existence of aob and nob populations within the storage wastewater and consequently both were continuously seeded to the reactor in contrast the presence of nitrate in the influent of strategy iii was almost not detected fig 4b the nob population developed in the storing tank probably possessed a high tolerance to fa which resulted in failure of the partial nitritation process 30 interestingly in strategy iv there was a significant amount of nitrate in the influent from day 40 onwards fig 4b yet this did not result into nitrate production within the reactor compared to previous strategies the achieved aors were at least one order of magnitude higher fig 3 when nob inoculation took place in strategy iv a significant fraction of granular sludge was already obtained ca 50 of particles being greater than 200 μm which decreased the impact of the nob seeding because the number of cycles per day was higher at higher aors i e shorter hrt and higher washout of the reinoculated nob the wastewater storage during the development of a granular sludge performing partial nitritation should be done in conditions to avoid nob proliferation for eventual full scale applications of the partial nitritation process wastewater storage is not required therefore this issue would not require particular attention 5 conclusions in this study a specific operational start up strategy based on enhancing ammonium oxidation activity was shown to promote the development of an autotrophic partial nitritation granular sludge by using conventional activated sludge as inoculum in a short period of time ca 30 days when the inoculum presented a low activity the ammonium oxidation activity of the seeding sludge was enhanced by increasing the air flow rate which allowed for a higher bulk oxygen concentration against expectation and based on the reported conditions for granulation of heterotrophic aerobic sludge settling time decrease was not linked to autotrophic aerobic granulation in contrast high settling times allowed to retain a suitable biomass concentration beneficial for attaining higher ammonium oxidation activities finally applying strong free ammonia inhibitory conditions in the early start up phase i e seeding sludge resulted into low ammonium oxidation rates which also hindered the development of an autotrophic aerobic granular sludge when starting up the cultivation of aerobic granular sludge for partial nitritation for two stage pn amx in mainstream the findings highlighted that it is possible to inoculate activated sludge and use reject water in an sbr configuration by applying the following set of experimental conditions high aeration flow rates long settling times and applying a loading rate that avoids fa inhibitory conditions once enough biomass concentration is achieved with this experimental start up strategy the reactor operation could be switched to continuous mode of

bioelectricity 1 introduction india is one among the larger producers of milk and dairy products according to an estimate annual milk production in india has now increased multi fold from 17 million tonnes mts 1950 51 to 176 4 mts 2017 18 besides being major power consumers the indian dairy industry as a whole discharges approximately 300 mts of wastewater annually 1 3 dairy wastewater dww produces a very persistent unpleasant foul smell apart from having higher organic load complex carbohydrates proteins vitamins and lipids and elevated concentrations of fermentable substrates 4 its improper disposal imposes severe ill impact on terrestrial and aquatic environments 3 this voluminous discharge of dww can be used for the production of energy electrical exploiting its organic load for onsite usage with simultaneous treatment of it microbial fuel cell mfc an attractive renewable and sustainable green energy technology can spontaneously convert the organic biomass into the electricity by exploiting microorganisms as natural biocatalysts 2 the anode is one of the most important components of the mfc production of power in the mfc depends on the exoelectrogenic microorganisms that adhere on the surface of anode and catalyses the oxidation of organic matter into carbon dioxide water and electrons 4 carbon based various anode materials have been employed as conventional electrodes in the mfcs 5 8 but were suffered from a severe drawback of having lower galvanic potential 9 on the other hand nanostructured carbonaceous anodes and fine structured metal anodes require substantially complicated procedures for their preparation hence these were classified as relatively unsuitable for large scale applications such as wastewater treatment therefore greater attention has now been paid over electrodes that are actual current collectors in this regard metals are considered as suitable anode materials for the mfcs 10 various metal electrodes such as cu ii ag i mo vi zn ii etc has been reported as a suitable surfaces for growth of microbial films 9 12 wastewaters are known to harbour rich diversity of microorganism that can be used as an inoculum for the mfc analyses of the anodic biofilms of the mfcs revealed a great bacterial diversity however did not divulged any specific trend in dominant members of anodophilic communities 13 a large number of non exoelectrogens are directly competing with exoelectrogens by propagating simultaneously with them thus decreasing the power output 4 several researchers have evaluated the performances of the mfcs using microbial consortium 1 14 15 but were failed to identify the roles of individual microorganisms and mechanisms involved in power production in order to enhance the power output proper selection of active exoelectrogenic microorganisms is critical which can be achieved following the repeated transfer of inoculum obtained from the anode compartment of a mfc 16 pure cultures of a number of bacterial strains have been used to examine their power production capacities in the mfcs utilizing wastewaters of various sources 5 8 12 17 it is prerequisite to identify whether the bacterial strain has the potential to be used as an inoculum in the mfc which can be done following standard screening procedures methylene blue mb dye reduction based electron transfer activity

canstein 21 for detection of extracellular mediators either endogenous or exogenous in the mfc media enterococcus faecalis a metabolically versatile non spore forming commensal gut bacterium has been considered as an excellent model for electron transfer studies because of its relatively simple respiratory chain this chemo organo heterotrophic organism has been demonstrated to transfer electrons generated through fermentative metabolism by extracellular mode either directly or indirectly by taking the help of secreted mediators 22 27 studies have also revealed that the reduction of dmk dimethylmenaquinone via nadh quinoneoxidoreductase in the respiratory chain of bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is prerequisite for transfer of electrons 23 this study was designed to capture bacterial strains from the current producing anodic biofilm of a dual chambered mfc flooded with dww following an enrichment method which were then subjected to the dream assay for identification of most potent

chambered mfc flooded with dww was allowed to operate for seven consecutive days at room temperature thereafter 100 ml of the inoculum comprising suspended microorganisms and the biofilm harbouring anode of it were taken out and then transferred under aseptic conditions to another set of mfc containing fresh medium and this setup was allowed to operate at pre decided conditions for next seven days such transfer was repeated two more times in order to obtain significant amount of the microbial biomass after four rounds of transfer i e on 29th day a small section of the anode 1cm2 was cut aseptically washed thrice with phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 and transferred into a flask consisting sterile nutrient broth and mrs de man rogosa and sharpe broth and was then incubated at 37 c for 24 h these suspensions were serially diluted by plating 100 μl of the 10 fold serial dilutions of the cultures on agar plates so as to obtain pure cultures of the organisms following the spread plate

multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustalw the evolutionary history of the isolate was inferred following the maximum likelihood method and kimura 2 parameter model 32 evolutionary analysis was done in the mega x based on 1000 bootstrap analysis 33 to have an accession number the 16 s rrna sequence of the isolate was deposited to ncbi genbank 2 6 assessment of electrochemical activity using dream assay in vivo decolourization assay in which mb dye was used as an electron sink was performed to identify the possible candidate electroactive bacterial strain s in order to determine absorption maxima of mb its solution was scanned in between 350 nm to 800 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa during isolation of organism an aliquot of inoculum was withdrawn on every second day after each transfer and was then subjected to dream assay by taking 2 ml of sample 0 5 μl of mb 12 μm and 0 2 μl sodium sulphite 12 mm an oxygen scavenger in a quartz cuvette 18 20 likewise the isolates obtained from enrichment process were subjected to dream assay as per the procedure described by vishwanathan et al 18 nutrient broth 95 ml ph 7 was inoculated with 5 ml od 1 2 at 660 nm of culture of individual isolate and incubated at 37 c now 2 ml of microbial cultures were drawn after every 1 h and subjected to dream assay absorbances of the samples were measured at 660 nm and the extent of dye reduction was calculated 20 autoclaved dww added with mb and sodium sulphite was served as control 2 7 electrochemical measurements and calculation the voltage generation by microorganisms was determined using a digital multimeter mastech ms8050 true rms rs 232 pclik usa at 1 h interval on day time across 220 ω resistor and then voltage across the resistor was determined the average voltage generated per day is reported in this paper the current i in ampere is calculated from measured voltage drop across the resistor as i v r where v volts is voltage generated across the resistance connected to the electrodes and r ω is external resistance polarization data was obtained by connecting resistance which ranged in between 47 ω to 6 8 kω the voltage readings were taken only after 30 min of voltage stabilization the power density pd mw m2 and corresponding current density cd ma m2 of the mfc were calculated as pd v i a and cd v r i a where a m2 is projected surface area of the anode the polarization curve was obtained by plotting pd vs cd the cod removal efficiency was calculated by following eq 1 1 cod cod inlet cod outlet cod inlet here

voltammetry keithley source meter 2450 usa was carried out to characterize the oxidation and reduction reactions of the mediator either present in the dww or is being secreted by bacteria itself a conventional three electrode system with 25 ml capacity was employed with platinum as working electrode a platinum wire as counter electrode and an ag agcl as reference electrode the scan rate of 25 mv s was employed using a potentiostat over the range from 0 6 mv to 0 1 mv 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical analysis of dww physico chemical data of dww was depicted in table 1 characteristics of wastewater play a very significant role in the bioenergy production higher the organic load of a substrate more will be its potential to be used as a base media for the bioenergy production 15 34 3 2 isolation of electrogenic bacteria in the present study a total of seven distinct bacterial strains were isolated from a slimy layer biofilm deposited over the anode of the mfc these organisms were seen to be quite different from one another based on their morphological and biochemical characters and were designated as dww1 dww2 dww3 dww4 dww5 dww6 and dww7 spectroscopic scanning of mb 12 μm revealed a peak at 660 nm fig 2a inset on every second day of each successive transfer the dream assay coefficient of the inoculum was determined the extent of mb dye reduction directly relates to the microbial electron transfer activity higher the metabolic activity of the microbes greater will be the number of electrons available for dye reduction and consequently higher would be the dream assay coefficient 19 analysis revealed an increase in the dream coefficient from 0 04 to 0 32 which suggested that during the enrichment process the anodic communities may have possibly shifted towards the more electrochemically active strain fig 2a the enrichment culture technique has been proven to eliminate the non electrochemically active bacteria which could otherwise inhabit over the electrode during initial days of inoculation 16 3 3 morphological and biochemical characterization of the bacteria on the basis of phenotypic characteristics all the seven isolates varied in their shape cocci to coccobacilli gram staining positive or negative and ability to utilize oxygen among the seven isolates dww1 and dww4 were seen to be facultative anaerobes dww5 and dww7 were obligate aerobes and dww2 dww3 and dww6 were found to be microaerophilic in nature the possible reason for the growth of both aerobic and microaerophilic bacteria may be the presence of a low nonzero level of oxygen in the mfc which could have been reintroduced during the sampling process however these microaerophiles were helpful in maintaining the anaerobic condition by quenching the oxygen present in the mfc thus assisting electrogenesis 35 the morphological microscopic and biochemical characteristics of the bacterial colonies were depicted in supplementary data table s1 and s2 respectively 3 4 screening of potent electrogenic bacteria using dream assay an absorption maxima of mb was determined to be at 660 nm fig 2a inset among the seven isolates only dww1 and dww4 were seen to turn oxidized form of mb mediator blue into its reduced form colourless fig s1 complete decolourization was observed after 8 h and 10 h of incubation by the isolates dww1 and dww4 respectively fig s2 data of dream coefficient 0 39 did not revealed significant difference in the dye reduction capacities of two isolates however dww4 was found to be metabolically relatively less active fig 2b it has also been observed that at the top of the tube where a little amount of oxygen was present the decolourization process was incomplete which suggested that the oxygen was competing with the mb for sinking of electrons 18 in order to eliminate the negative effect of dissolved oxygen sodium sulphite was added simultaneously while measuring the absorbance the mb a redox mediator and acting as an electron sink is analogous to anode of the mfc 20 thus reduction of mb dye is achieved via redox proteins components of respiratory chain that transfers electrons to mb which in this case behaved as terminal electron acceptor the autoclaved dww containing sodium sulphite was unable to reduce mb dye 18 3 4 1 power generation through potential isolates the dream assay positive isolates dww1 and dww4 were assessed separately for their potential to electricity generation in the mfcs flooded with dww of an initial organic load rate olr of 1 44 kg cod m3 and ph of 8 0 for this the overnight grown cultures 0 5 v v in the nutrient broth were inoculated in the anode compartment following the inoculation of dww1 and dww4 in the anode compartment the system was represented as mfc1 and mfc2 respectively the maximum ocp mv and current generated by the mfc1 and mfc2 were 768 mv 1 8 ma and 551 3 mv 1 1 ma at 220 ω respectively fig 3a during operation of the mfc1 for seven consecutive days a significant and regular increments in the generations of ocp 215 mv to 768 mv and current 0 5 ma to 1 8 ma were discernible till three days and thereafter declined to 218 mv and 0 5 ma respectively on the other hand the mfc2 showed highest of ocp 551 mv and current 1 1 ma on fourth day and their least 217 mv 0 40 ma on seventh day since the mfc s were operated in batch mode there was a decrease in the voltage in due course of time which could be because of depletion of nutrients present in the wastewater 14 with respect to bacterial strains used in the mfc a significant power generation was observed under closed circuit conditions the pd increased in parallel to cd when different external resistances were applied on the mfc in regard to mfc1 maximum pd was recorded to be 144 mw m2 with a corresponding cd of 258 ma m2 while were registered to be 57 mw m2 and 156 ma m2 respectively for mfc2 at 220 ω based on fig 3b the current and pd obtained were higher in case of mfc1 then those generated by the mfc2 the organic compounds dissolved in the dww were utilized by the microorganisms leading to the generation of electricity different microorganisms follow diverse metabolic pathways to carry out the degradation of organic components 36 the dissimilarity in the power production capacity of the two isolates may possibly be due to the variation in their capacity towards degradation of the wastewater components 37 the ocp of mfc1 was seen to be significantly higher than that produced 654 mv after 123 h of mfc operation in a study conducted with escherichia coli kw 12 and dww 14 in the conducted study maximum of current and pd were obtained right from the first cycle of the mfc operation on the other side mardanpour et al 34 obtained higher pd and current after 2 3 cycles of mfc operation which showed a requirement of lag adjustment phase by the microorganisms thus use of indigenous microbes of dww eliminated the requirement of adaptation phase for microbial growth and provided an opportunity to generate maximum current and pd from very first cycle of the mfc operation a cod removal efficiency of 53 5 and 50 was recorded in respect to mfc1 and mfc2 during seven days of the study likewise the mfc1 and mfc2 showed conversion efficiencies chemical energy to electrical energy of 10 89 and 6 5 respectively fig 3a inset the data of pd and cd exhibited by the mfc1 of this study are significantly higher compared to those revealed by other gram positive bacteria previously table 2 in a demonstration faria et al 1 has recorded a pd value 69 mw m2 after 96 h of mfc operation which was calculated to be 2 08 fold lower than that produced by the mfc1 in this study 3 5 characterization of dww1 isolate being a most potent electrogenic isolate biochemical characterization of dww1 revealed it gram positive non motile cocci its colony was seen to be smooth punctiform and translucent after 24 h of growth on mrs agar table s1 it was determined to be catalase negative and metabolically diverse in terms of carbohydrate metabolism table s2 an almost full length sequence 1392 bp of 16 s rrna gene of strain dww1 was obtained and subjected to homology search in the ncbi genebank database with the 16 s rrna of closely related reference strains which annotated it as enterococcus faecalis dww1 accession number mt555729 a firmicute which belongs to the genus enterococcaceaein the order lactobacillales and was seen to be most closely related with enterococcus faecalis 7617 mt516167 100 sequence similarity for an out group analysis another genus of the same family was used which can be observed in the below depicted phylogenetic tree fig 4 3 6 effect of cod concentration on power production by e faecalis dww1 concentration of the substrate occupying anode compartment plays a pivotal role in the growth of microorganism thereby power production in order to determine the impact of organic load of the substrate on power production the mfcs were operated at olr of 0 994 kg cod m3 1 44 kg cod m3 1 665 kg cod m3 and 2 162 kg cod m3 at a constant ph 8 0 and containing 0 5 v v 3 8 108 cfu ml of e faecalis dww1 with hrt of 6 7 and 8 days respectively fig 5a herein the substrate concentration clearly affected the voltage generation the mfc having olr of 0 994 kg cod m3 revealed maximum ocp and current of 587 mv and 1 ma respectively at 220 ω with an increase in the olr a significant increment in the power output was recorded 1 44 kg cod m3 768 mv 1 8 ma at 220 ω however no significant difference in the voltage and current production were observed between olr of1 44 kg cod m3 and 1 665 kg cod m3 an increase in the substrate concentration has previously been reported to accelerate the rate of enzymatic reactions occurring in the mfcs leading to higher voltage generation 38 however subsequent increase in the olr 2 162 kg cod m3 418 mv 0 7 ma at 220 ω decreased the ocp and current production sharma and li 38 reported inhibition in the voltage generation at higher substrate concentration maximum pd of 144 mw m2was determined at 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 while 0 994 kg cod m3 and 2 162 kg cod m3 showed 2 5 and 4 11 folds lower pd fig 5b in the present study use of dww of olr 0 994 kg cod m3 resulted in low power output which may have attributed due to lower organic load in the substrate 15 sufficient availability of substrate has previously been shown to be essential for optimal functioning of bacterial strains consequently power production by the mfc 39 whereas high substrate concentration 2 162 kg cod m3 leads to the inhibition in enzymatic activity thus decreasing the electron transfer activity and power production 38 it has also been observed that an increase in substrate concentration increased the cod removal efficiency along with the batch time required for treatment of wastewater maximum cod removal efficiency was determinedwith2 162 kg cod m3 59 followed by 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 53 5 and 0 994 kg cod m3 47 2 respectively the ce was used to designate the recovery efficiency of the electrons in the form of electric current out of the decomposition of organic matter in the present study ce was determined to be 10 8 for 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 while was 1 1 and 3 4 folds lower for the mfc operative with 0 994 kg cod m3 and 2 162 kg cod m3 respectively fig 5c upon increasing the cod concentration from 0 994 kg cod m3to 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 the ce was seen to be increased a substantial reduction in the ce was observed soon after further increase in the cod concentration to 2 162 kg cod m3 the main reason for this inverse relationship between ce and substrate concentration may possibly be the inhibitions in bacterial activities at high cod concentration elakkiya and matheswaran 15 observed a similar trend between ce and cod concentration 3 7 effect of ph of the anolyte on power production by the e faecalis dww1 metabolic rate of microbes is significantly affected by ph of the wastewater which in turn affects the energy production capacity of a mfc in order to study the influence of ph the mfc was fed with dww of various ph 6 7 8 and 9 and having cod concentration of 1 44 kg cod m3 and containing 0 5 v v 3 8 108 cfu ml of e faecalis dww1 the ph of the anolyte was maintained using 0 1 n naoh 0 1 n hcl however 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 was used to maintain ph of the catholyte to 7 0 the maximum ocp registered for the mfcs operating at ph 6 7 8 and 9 was 413 mv 679 mv 768 mv and 446 mv respectively the maximum ocp 768 mv at ph 8 was registered on third day which was seen to be stable for three consecutive days and thereafter declined and reached to 218 mv on seventh day at the same time the mfcs operating at ph 6 7 and 9 showed peaks on fourth day remained stable for three consecutive days and then dropped to 217 mv 212 mv 215 mv respectively at the end of the experiment at different ph under ocp conditions a significant difference in voltage was observed the lag time of a day was required by the mfcs operating at ph 6 7 and 9 to achieve highest ocp which may be due to the adjustment of the e faecalis dww1 to existing ph of the anolyte fig 6a in the present study data of pd was registered to be reasonably low at ph 6 and 9 while was relatively higher at ph 7 and 8 fig 6b the pd was seen to be increased from 28 6 mw m2 at ph 6 to 144 mw m2 at ph 8 and thereafter fell remarkably 21 8 mw m2 with further increase in the ph the cod removal efficiency was determined to be 45 2 51 7 53 5 and 49 6 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively likewise the ce was highest at ph 8 10 8 followed by ph 7 7 7 ph 6 6 6 and lowest at ph 9 5 4 fig 6c the ph lower than 7 and higher than 8 has probably been suppressed the metabolic activities of the e faecalis dww1 consequently lowered pd cod and ce during experimentation simpler metabolites are produced out of oxidation of complex organic molecules which probably affect the ph of outlet wastewater after seven days of mfc operation ph of the anolyte was determined to be reduced to 6 8 7 5 and 8 5 from their initial values 7 8 and 9 respectively while ph 6 was seen to be increased to 6 6 mohanakrishna et al 36 have noted a fall in the ph of the anolyte from 7 to 4 2 during mfc operation which may be an outcome of electrochemical and microbial reactions these results showed that the microbial activity is relatively slower at sub optimal ph than that registered at optimal ph 15 3 8 electron transfer mechanism of strain dww1 the cv can be used as an important tool to detect the presence of mediator s a redox compound that facilitates the transfer of electrons from bacteria to anode surface the dww containing e faecalis dww1 displayed clear electrochemical activity by producing a reversible redox peak with a remarkable catalytic current at about 0 6 v vs ag agcl in the cyclic voltammogram however this catalytic current was not observed in a similar experiment where e faecalis dww1 was not provided dww as a source of electron donor fig 7 a plausible explanation for this pattern was that the contaminants present in the dww may have possibly been functioned as electron mediators at the anode surface in addition aas analysis of dww showed presence of metals like fe cu zn and cd in it which might have acted as electron shuttlers mediators koegh et al 40 demonstrated electroactive nature of e faecalis where this bacterium was taken advantage of fe iii fe ii redox coupling for extracellular electron transfer eet previous studies have also confirmed an indirect route of eet in gram positive bacterium e faecalis 24 25 thus for transfer electrons through thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall of gram positive bacterium electron mediators might play an essential role 25 4 conclusions one of the critical steps in getting optimum power output through the mfc is the selection of active and potential electrogenic microorganism in this study following an enrichment method an electrogenic bacterium e faecalis dww1 was captured from the biofilm of a dual chambered dww fed mfc to the best of knowledge this report for the first time demonstrated isolation of e faecalis dww1 from anodic biofilms of a dww fed mfc and its use in bioelectricity generation using the same the dream assay a rapid sensitive and low cost method has been employed to evaluate microbial electron transfer phenomenon of e faecalis dww1 this bacteria exhibited significant amount of power generation the cod concentration of dww and ph of the anolyte significantly affected the power generation capacity of e faecalis dww1 the mfc inoculated with e faecalis dww1 generated pd of 144 mw m2 258 ma m2 at optimum cod concentration of 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 at ph 8 with cod removal efficiency of 53 5 indicating significant treatment of dww while generating sustainable and clean energy value of cv revealed that the compound s present in the dww were possibly exploited as exogenous mediators for microbial electron transfer which is an added advantage to operate the mfc using dww when choosing e faecalis dww1 as chief exoelectrogen declaration of

13213,in this investigation a novel electrochemically active gram positive bacterium was isolated from the biofilm of a dual chambered microbial fuel cell mfc flooded with dairy wastewater dww and was annotated as enterococcus faecalis dww1 following the 16 s rrna sequencing the dye reduction based electron transfer activity dream assay was used as a simple criterion for evaluation of electrochemical activity 0 43 in the candidate microbe the electrochemical activity of the strain dww1 was characterized using cyclic voltametry cv cv studies revealed that the redox compound present in the dww was exploited by the strain dww1 for extracellular electron transfer towards anode current generation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiencies of the strain dww1 was examined following an optimum cod concentration of 1 440 1 665 kg cod m3 and anolyte ph of 8 maximum current density 258 ma m2 power density 144 mw m2 220 ω cod removal efficiency 53 5 coulombic efficiency 10 89 such observations revealed the potential of e faecalis dww1 towards dww remediation and energy generation keywords microbial fuel cell dairy wastewater enterococcus faecalis dream assay bioelectricity 1 introduction india is one among the larger producers of milk and dairy products according to an estimate annual milk production in india has now increased multi fold from 17 million tonnes mts 1950 51 to 176 4 mts 2017 18 besides being major power consumers the indian dairy industry as a whole discharges approximately 300 mts of wastewater annually 1 3 dairy wastewater dww produces a very persistent unpleasant foul smell apart from having higher organic load complex carbohydrates proteins vitamins and lipids and elevated concentrations of fermentable substrates 4 its improper disposal imposes severe ill impact on terrestrial and aquatic environments 3 this voluminous discharge of dww can be used for the production of energy electrical exploiting its organic load for onsite usage with simultaneous treatment of it microbial fuel cell mfc an attractive renewable and sustainable green energy technology can spontaneously convert the organic biomass into the electricity by exploiting microorganisms as natural biocatalysts 2 the anode is one of the most important components of the mfc production of power in the mfc depends on the exoelectrogenic microorganisms that adhere on the surface of anode and catalyses the oxidation of organic matter into carbon dioxide water and electrons 4 carbon based various anode materials have been employed as conventional electrodes in the mfcs 5 8 but were suffered from a severe drawback of having lower galvanic potential 9 on the other hand nanostructured carbonaceous anodes and fine structured metal anodes require substantially complicated procedures for their preparation hence these were classified as relatively unsuitable for large scale applications such as wastewater treatment therefore greater attention has now been paid over electrodes that are actual current collectors in this regard metals are considered as suitable anode materials for the mfcs 10 various metal electrodes such as cu ii ag i mo vi zn ii etc has been reported as a suitable surfaces for growth of microbial films 9 12 wastewaters are known to harbour rich diversity of microorganism that can be used as an inoculum for the mfc analyses of the anodic biofilms of the mfcs revealed a great bacterial diversity however did not divulged any specific trend in dominant members of anodophilic communities 13 a large number of non exoelectrogens are directly competing with exoelectrogens by propagating simultaneously with them thus decreasing the power output 4 several researchers have evaluated the performances of the mfcs using microbial consortium 1 14 15 but were failed to identify the roles of individual microorganisms and mechanisms involved in power production in order to enhance the power output proper selection of active exoelectrogenic microorganisms is critical which can be achieved following the repeated transfer of inoculum obtained from the anode compartment of a mfc 16 pure cultures of a number of bacterial strains have been used to examine their power production capacities in the mfcs utilizing wastewaters of various sources 5 8 12 17 it is prerequisite to identify whether the bacterial strain has the potential to be used as an inoculum in the mfc which can be done following standard screening procedures methylene blue mb dye reduction based electron transfer activity monitoring dream assay has popularly been followed to assess the ability of a bacterium to transfer electrons generated from the metabolism of the substrate to a redox active dye 18 20 the thiazine dye serves as a terminal electron acceptor and gets reduced into a colourless leuco form as a result of microbial activity 19 a dye based redox mediator assay has earlier been exploited by the von canstein 21 for detection of extracellular mediators either endogenous or exogenous in the mfc media enterococcus faecalis a metabolically versatile non spore forming commensal gut bacterium has been considered as an excellent model for electron transfer studies because of its relatively simple respiratory chain this chemo organo heterotrophic organism has been demonstrated to transfer electrons generated through fermentative metabolism by extracellular mode either directly or indirectly by taking the help of secreted mediators 22 27 studies have also revealed that the reduction of dmk dimethylmenaquinone via nadh quinoneoxidoreductase in the respiratory chain of bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is prerequisite for transfer of electrons 23 this study was designed to capture bacterial strains from the current producing anodic biofilm of a dual chambered mfc flooded with dww following an enrichment method which were then subjected to the dream assay for identification of most potent exoelectrogen if any potential organisms were then tested for their potencies towards electricity generation and bioremediation in the same set of mfc experiments were conducted to analyse the utility of dww and potencies of inhabiting bacterial strains towards power production chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and coulombic efficiency the performance of the mfc was examined against wastewaters of varying cod concentrations and ph values 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of mfc a dual chambered mfc was constructed using polyvinyl chloride containers each with a working volume of 700 ml and were joined together with a t shaped pvc salt bridge containing 10 nacl w v and 5 agar w v with the help of a sealant material zinc plates 50cm2 and carbon rods 15 7cm2 were used as anode and cathode respectively and were connected to copper wires fig 1 prior to use electrodes were allowed to stand in deionized water for overnight sterilized with 70 ethanol v v and then kept in an oven 90 c for 2 h followed by irradiation of uv light for 1 h before inoculation constructed mfcs were surface sterilized following above mentioned steps and were allowed to operate in batch mode anode chamber of the mfc was filled with dww and operated anaerobically the dww was sterilized 120 c for 15 min before inoculating with individual isolates on the other hand cathode chamber was filled with 700 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 and operated aerobically 12 the mfc was operated at room temperature 35 2 c the performance of the mfc was assessed against varied cod concentrations dilutions made using sterilized distilled water and ph of the dww 2 2 collection of dww the dww was collected from the m s devbhog milk plant kumhari india 21 13 54 n 81 29 12 e 284 m above sea level the samples were collected in clean sterile plastic containers prior to analysis the samples were kept at 4 c in view to avoid any change in the characteristics of the wastewater the sample was as it is used as inoculum flooding material in the mfc unless stated otherwise without addition of any extra nutrient or external mediator 2 3 physico chemical analyses of dww collected dww was analysed to determine levels of cod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ortho phosphorus sulphate chloride oil and grease nitrate nitrogen and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn following standard procedures 28 the ph was determined by direct measurement with a ph meter li 120 elico india while electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were monitored by using ec tds analyzer cm 183 elico india all the solvents and reagents used were of analytical grade all the experiments were conducted in three replicates and mean standard deviation sd values are presented detection of heavy metal ion was done by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas labindia india 2 4 isolation of electrogenic bacteria following the enrichment method the first set of dual chambered mfc flooded with dww was allowed to operate for seven consecutive days at room temperature thereafter 100 ml of the inoculum comprising suspended microorganisms and the biofilm harbouring anode of it were taken out and then transferred under aseptic conditions to another set of mfc containing fresh medium and this setup was allowed to operate at pre decided conditions for next seven days such transfer was repeated two more times in order to obtain significant amount of the microbial biomass after four rounds of transfer i e on 29th day a small section of the anode 1cm2 was cut aseptically washed thrice with phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 and transferred into a flask consisting sterile nutrient broth and mrs de man rogosa and sharpe broth and was then incubated at 37 c for 24 h these suspensions were serially diluted by plating 100 μl of the 10 fold serial dilutions of the cultures on agar plates so as to obtain pure cultures of the organisms following the spread plate technique after their incubation at 37 c in view to obtain morphologically distinct colonies a minimum of two isolation steps were accomplished and was confirmed following the light microscopy the isolated colonies were then maintained in the slants 2 5 characterization of the isolates bacterial isolates were characterized following their morphological microscopic and biochemical properties 29 genomic dna of the most potent isolate was extracted using spin column kit himedia india the 16 s rrna full length gene was amplified using the universal primers 27f 5 aga gtt gat cct ggc tca g 3 and

documentation system biorad usa the purified product of 1400 bp dna band was purified using exonuclease i shrimp alkaline phosphatase 30 purified amplicons were now sequenced by sanger s method using abi 3500 xl genetic analyzer life technologies usa 31 sequencing data were edited following the chromaslite ver 1 5 now the assembled nucleotide sequence was blast against the ncbi genbank database multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustalw the evolutionary history of the isolate was inferred following the maximum likelihood method and kimura 2 parameter model 32 evolutionary analysis was done in the mega x based on 1000 bootstrap analysis 33 to have an accession number the 16 s rrna sequence of the isolate was deposited to ncbi genbank 2 6 assessment of electrochemical activity using dream assay in vivo decolourization assay in which mb dye was used as an electron sink was performed to identify the possible candidate electroactive bacterial strain s in order to determine absorption maxima of mb its solution was scanned in between 350 nm to 800 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa during isolation of organism an aliquot of inoculum was withdrawn on every second day after each transfer and was then subjected to dream assay by taking 2 ml of sample 0 5 μl of mb 12 μm and 0 2 μl sodium sulphite 12 mm an oxygen scavenger in a quartz cuvette 18 20 likewise the isolates obtained from enrichment process were subjected to dream assay as per the procedure described by vishwanathan et al 18 nutrient broth 95 ml ph 7 was inoculated with 5 ml od 1 2 at 660 nm of culture of individual isolate and incubated at 37 c now 2 ml of microbial cultures were drawn after every 1 h and subjected to dream assay absorbances of the samples were measured at 660 nm and the extent of dye reduction was calculated 20 autoclaved dww added with mb and sodium sulphite was served as control 2 7 electrochemical measurements and calculation the voltage generation by microorganisms was determined using a digital multimeter mastech ms8050 true rms rs 232 pclik usa at 1 h interval on day time across 220 ω resistor and then voltage across the resistor was determined the average voltage generated per day is reported in this paper the current i in ampere is calculated from measured voltage drop across the resistor as i v r where v volts is voltage generated across the resistance connected to the electrodes and r ω is external resistance polarization data was obtained by connecting resistance which ranged in between 47 ω to 6 8 kω the voltage readings were taken only after 30 min of voltage stabilization the power density pd mw m2 and corresponding current density cd ma m2 of the mfc were calculated as pd v i a and cd v r i a where a m2 is projected surface area of the anode the polarization curve was obtained by plotting pd vs cd the cod removal efficiency was calculated by following eq 1 1 cod cod inlet cod outlet cod inlet here concentrations of inlet and outlet are in mg l coulombic efficiency ce was calculated according to eq 2 where cp is the practical coulomb by integrating current over time eq 3 and ct is theoretical coulomb available from removed cod eq 4 2 ce cp ct 100 3 cp i t 4 ct fbv cod m here i is the current intensity δt is the time interval f is the faraday s constant b 4 is the number of electrons exchanged per mole of oxygen δcod is change in the cod between inlet and outlet in batch mode v is the volume of liquid of anodic compartment and m 32 is the molecular weight of the oxygen cyclic voltammetry keithley source meter 2450 usa was carried out to characterize the oxidation and reduction reactions of the mediator either present in the dww or is being secreted by bacteria itself a conventional three electrode system with 25 ml capacity was employed with platinum as working electrode a platinum wire as counter electrode and an ag agcl as reference electrode the scan rate of 25 mv s was employed using a potentiostat over the range from 0 6 mv to 0 1 mv 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical analysis of dww physico chemical data of dww was depicted in table 1 characteristics of wastewater play a very significant role in the bioenergy production higher the organic load of a substrate more will be its potential to be used as a base media for the bioenergy production 15 34 3 2 isolation of electrogenic bacteria in the present study a total of seven distinct bacterial strains were isolated from a slimy layer biofilm deposited over the anode of the mfc these organisms were seen to be quite different from one another based on their morphological and biochemical characters and were designated as dww1 dww2 dww3 dww4 dww5 dww6 and dww7 spectroscopic scanning of mb 12 μm revealed a peak at 660 nm fig 2a inset on every second day of each successive transfer the dream assay coefficient of the inoculum was determined the extent of mb dye reduction directly relates to the microbial electron transfer activity higher the metabolic activity of the microbes greater will be the number of electrons available for dye reduction and consequently higher would be the dream assay coefficient 19 analysis revealed an increase in the dream coefficient from 0 04 to 0 32 which suggested that during the enrichment process the anodic communities may have possibly shifted towards the more electrochemically active strain fig 2a the enrichment culture technique has been proven to eliminate the non electrochemically active bacteria which could otherwise inhabit over the electrode during initial days of inoculation 16 3 3 morphological and biochemical characterization of the bacteria on the basis of phenotypic characteristics all the seven isolates varied in their shape cocci to coccobacilli gram staining positive or negative and ability to utilize oxygen among the seven isolates dww1 and dww4 were seen to be facultative anaerobes dww5 and dww7 were obligate aerobes and dww2 dww3 and dww6 were found to be microaerophilic in nature the possible reason for the growth of both aerobic and microaerophilic bacteria may be the presence of a low nonzero level of oxygen in the mfc which could have been reintroduced during the sampling process however these microaerophiles were helpful in maintaining the anaerobic condition by quenching the oxygen present in the mfc thus assisting electrogenesis 35 the morphological microscopic and biochemical characteristics of the bacterial colonies were depicted in supplementary data table s1 and s2 respectively 3 4 screening of potent electrogenic bacteria using dream assay an absorption maxima of mb was determined to be at 660 nm fig 2a inset among the seven isolates only dww1 and dww4 were seen to turn oxidized form of mb mediator blue into its reduced form colourless fig s1 complete decolourization was observed after 8 h and 10 h of incubation by the isolates dww1 and dww4 respectively fig s2 data of dream coefficient 0 39 did not revealed significant difference in the dye reduction capacities of two isolates however dww4 was found to be metabolically relatively less active fig 2b it has also been observed that at the top of the tube where a little amount of oxygen was present the decolourization process was incomplete which suggested that the oxygen was competing with the mb for sinking of electrons 18 in order to eliminate the negative effect of dissolved oxygen sodium sulphite was added simultaneously while measuring the absorbance the mb a redox mediator and acting as an electron sink is analogous to anode of the mfc 20 thus reduction of mb dye is achieved via redox proteins components of respiratory chain that transfers electrons to mb which in this case behaved as terminal electron acceptor the autoclaved dww containing sodium sulphite was unable to reduce mb dye 18 3 4 1 power generation through potential isolates the dream assay positive isolates dww1 and dww4 were assessed separately for their potential to electricity generation in the mfcs flooded with dww of an initial organic load rate olr of 1 44 kg cod m3 and ph of 8 0 for this the overnight grown cultures 0 5 v v in the nutrient broth were inoculated in the anode compartment following the inoculation of dww1 and dww4 in the anode compartment the system was represented as mfc1 and mfc2 respectively the maximum ocp mv and current generated by the mfc1 and mfc2 were 768 mv 1 8 ma and 551 3 mv 1 1 ma at 220 ω respectively fig 3a during operation of the mfc1 for seven consecutive days a significant and regular increments in the generations of ocp 215 mv to 768 mv and current 0 5 ma to 1 8 ma were discernible till three days and thereafter declined to 218 mv and 0 5 ma respectively on the other hand the mfc2 showed highest of ocp 551 mv and current 1 1 ma on fourth day and their least 217 mv 0 40 ma on seventh day since the mfc s were operated in batch mode there was a decrease in the voltage in due course of time which could be because of depletion of nutrients present in the wastewater 14 with respect to bacterial strains used in the mfc a significant power generation was observed under closed circuit conditions the pd increased in parallel to cd when different external resistances were applied on the mfc in regard to mfc1 maximum pd was recorded to be 144 mw m2 with a corresponding cd of 258 ma m2 while were registered to be 57 mw m2 and 156 ma m2 respectively for mfc2 at 220 ω based on fig 3b the current and pd obtained were higher in case of mfc1 then those generated by the mfc2 the organic compounds dissolved in the dww were utilized by the microorganisms leading to the generation of electricity different microorganisms follow diverse metabolic pathways to carry out the degradation of organic components 36 the dissimilarity in the power production capacity of the two isolates may possibly be due to the variation in their capacity towards degradation of the wastewater components 37 the ocp of mfc1 was seen to be significantly higher than that produced 654 mv after 123 h of mfc operation in a study conducted with escherichia coli kw 12 and dww 14 in the conducted study maximum of current and pd were obtained right from the first cycle of the mfc operation on the other side mardanpour et al 34 obtained higher pd and current after 2 3 cycles of mfc operation which showed a requirement of lag adjustment phase by the microorganisms thus use of indigenous microbes of dww eliminated the requirement of adaptation phase for microbial growth and provided an opportunity to generate maximum current and pd from very first cycle of the mfc operation a cod removal efficiency of 53 5 and 50 was recorded in respect to mfc1 and mfc2 during seven days of the study likewise the mfc1 and mfc2 showed conversion efficiencies chemical energy to electrical energy of 10 89 and 6 5 respectively fig 3a inset the data of pd and cd exhibited by the mfc1 of this study are significantly higher compared to those revealed by other gram positive bacteria previously table 2 in a demonstration faria et al 1 has recorded a pd value 69 mw m2 after 96 h of mfc operation which was calculated to be 2 08 fold lower than that produced by the mfc1 in this study 3 5 characterization of dww1 isolate being a most potent electrogenic isolate biochemical characterization of dww1 revealed it gram positive non motile cocci its colony was seen to be smooth punctiform and translucent after 24 h of growth on mrs agar table s1 it was determined to be catalase negative and metabolically diverse in terms of carbohydrate metabolism table s2 an almost full length sequence 1392 bp of 16 s rrna gene of strain dww1 was obtained and subjected to homology search in the ncbi genebank database with the 16 s rrna of closely related reference strains which annotated it as enterococcus faecalis dww1 accession number mt555729 a firmicute which belongs to the genus enterococcaceaein the order lactobacillales and was seen to be most closely related with enterococcus faecalis 7617 mt516167 100 sequence similarity for an out group analysis another genus of the same family was used which can be observed in the below depicted phylogenetic tree fig 4 3 6 effect of cod concentration on power production by e faecalis dww1 concentration of the substrate occupying anode compartment plays a pivotal role in the growth of microorganism thereby power production in order to determine the impact of organic load of the substrate on power production the mfcs were operated at olr of 0 994 kg cod m3 1 44 kg cod m3 1 665 kg cod m3 and 2 162 kg cod m3 at a constant ph 8 0 and containing 0 5 v v 3 8 108 cfu ml of e faecalis dww1 with hrt of 6 7 and 8 days respectively fig 5a herein the substrate concentration clearly affected the voltage generation the mfc having olr of 0 994 kg cod m3 revealed maximum ocp and current of 587 mv and 1 ma respectively at 220 ω with an increase in the olr a significant increment in the power output was recorded 1 44 kg cod m3 768 mv 1 8 ma at 220 ω however no significant difference in the voltage and current production were observed between olr of1 44 kg cod m3 and 1 665 kg cod m3 an increase in the substrate concentration has previously been reported to accelerate the rate of enzymatic reactions occurring in the mfcs leading to higher voltage generation 38 however subsequent increase in the olr 2 162 kg cod m3 418 mv 0 7 ma at 220 ω decreased the ocp and current production sharma and li 38 reported inhibition in the voltage generation at higher substrate concentration maximum pd of 144 mw m2was determined at 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 while 0 994 kg cod m3 and 2 162 kg cod m3 showed 2 5 and 4 11 folds lower pd fig 5b in the present study use of dww of olr 0 994 kg cod m3 resulted in low power output which may have attributed due to lower organic load in the substrate 15 sufficient availability of substrate has previously been shown to be essential for optimal functioning of bacterial strains consequently power production by the mfc 39 whereas high substrate concentration 2 162 kg cod m3 leads to the inhibition in enzymatic activity thus decreasing the electron transfer activity and power production 38 it has also been observed that an increase in substrate concentration increased the cod removal efficiency along with the batch time required for treatment of wastewater maximum cod removal efficiency was determinedwith2 162 kg cod m3 59 followed by 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 53 5 and 0 994 kg cod m3 47 2 respectively the ce was used to designate the recovery efficiency of the electrons in the form of electric current out of the decomposition of organic matter in the present study ce was determined to be 10 8 for 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 while was 1 1 and 3 4 folds lower for the mfc operative with 0 994 kg cod m3 and 2 162 kg cod m3 respectively fig 5c upon increasing the cod concentration from 0 994 kg cod m3to 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 the ce was seen to be increased a substantial reduction in the ce was observed soon after further increase in the cod concentration to 2 162 kg cod m3 the main reason for this inverse relationship between ce and substrate concentration may possibly be the inhibitions in bacterial activities at high cod concentration elakkiya and matheswaran 15 observed a similar trend between ce and cod concentration 3 7 effect of ph of the anolyte on power production by the e faecalis dww1 metabolic rate of microbes is significantly affected by ph of the wastewater which in turn affects the energy production capacity of a mfc in order to study the influence of ph the mfc was fed with dww of various ph 6 7 8 and 9 and having cod concentration of 1 44 kg cod m3 and containing 0 5 v v 3 8 108 cfu ml of e faecalis dww1 the ph of the anolyte was maintained using 0 1 n naoh 0 1 n hcl however 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 was used to maintain ph of the catholyte to 7 0 the maximum ocp registered for the mfcs operating at ph 6 7 8 and 9 was 413 mv 679 mv 768 mv and 446 mv respectively the maximum ocp 768 mv at ph 8 was registered on third day which was seen to be stable for three consecutive days and thereafter declined and reached to 218 mv on seventh day at the same time the mfcs operating at ph 6 7 and 9 showed peaks on fourth day remained stable for three consecutive days and then dropped to 217 mv 212 mv 215 mv respectively at the end of the experiment at different ph under ocp conditions a significant difference in voltage was observed the lag time of a day was required by the mfcs operating at ph 6 7 and 9 to achieve highest ocp which may be due to the adjustment of the e faecalis dww1 to existing ph of the anolyte fig 6a in the present study data of pd was registered to be reasonably low at ph 6 and 9 while was relatively higher at ph 7 and 8 fig 6b the pd was seen to be increased from 28 6 mw m2 at ph 6 to 144 mw m2 at ph 8 and thereafter fell remarkably 21 8 mw m2 with further increase in the ph the cod removal efficiency was determined to be 45 2 51 7 53 5 and 49 6 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively likewise the ce was highest at ph 8 10 8 followed by ph 7 7 7 ph 6 6 6 and lowest at ph 9 5 4 fig 6c the ph lower than 7 and higher than 8 has probably been suppressed the metabolic activities of the e faecalis dww1 consequently lowered pd cod and ce during experimentation simpler metabolites are produced out of oxidation of complex organic molecules which probably affect the ph of outlet wastewater after seven days of mfc operation ph of the anolyte was determined to be reduced to 6 8 7 5 and 8 5 from their initial values 7 8 and 9 respectively while ph 6 was seen to be increased to 6 6 mohanakrishna et al 36 have noted a fall in the ph of the anolyte from 7 to 4 2 during mfc operation which may be an outcome of electrochemical and microbial reactions these results showed that the microbial activity is relatively slower at sub optimal ph than that registered at optimal ph 15 3 8 electron transfer mechanism of strain dww1 the cv can be used as an important tool to detect the presence of mediator s a redox compound that facilitates the transfer of electrons from bacteria to anode surface the dww containing e faecalis dww1 displayed clear electrochemical activity by producing a reversible redox peak with a remarkable catalytic current at about 0 6 v vs ag agcl in the cyclic voltammogram however this catalytic current was not observed in a similar experiment where e faecalis dww1 was not provided dww as a source of electron donor fig 7 a plausible explanation for this pattern was that the contaminants present in the dww may have possibly been functioned as electron mediators at the anode surface in addition aas analysis of dww showed presence of metals like fe cu zn and cd in it which might have acted as electron shuttlers mediators koegh et al 40 demonstrated electroactive nature of e faecalis where this bacterium was taken advantage of fe iii fe ii redox coupling for extracellular electron transfer eet previous studies have also confirmed an indirect route of eet in gram positive bacterium e faecalis 24 25 thus for transfer electrons through thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall of gram positive bacterium electron mediators might play an essential role 25 4 conclusions one of the critical steps in getting optimum power output through the mfc is the selection of active and potential electrogenic microorganism in this study following an enrichment method an electrogenic bacterium e faecalis dww1 was captured from the biofilm of a dual chambered dww fed mfc to the best of knowledge this report for the first time demonstrated isolation of e faecalis dww1 from anodic biofilms of a dww fed mfc and its use in bioelectricity generation using the same the dream assay a rapid sensitive and low cost method has been employed to evaluate microbial electron transfer phenomenon of e faecalis dww1 this bacteria exhibited significant amount of power generation the cod concentration of dww and ph of the anolyte significantly affected the power generation capacity of e faecalis dww1 the mfc inoculated with e faecalis dww1 generated pd of 144 mw m2 258 ma m2 at optimum cod concentration of 1 44 1 665 kg cod m3 at ph 8 with cod removal efficiency of 53 5 indicating significant treatment of dww while generating sustainable and clean energy value of cv revealed that the compound s present in the dww were possibly exploited as exogenous mediators for microbial electron transfer which is an added advantage to operate the mfc using dww when choosing e faecalis dww1 as chief exoelectrogen declaration of

13214,traditionally coagulant doses are determined by the operators for the coagulation process at water treatment plants which is a multi factor approach based on raw and treated water quality and in some situations relies heavily on their decisions it can be challenging to determine appropriate coagulant doses proactively for tight coagulation control with the traditional method therefore this study looked for alternative approaches for coagulation control and maybe the first to build coagulant dose determination models using only online raw water quality data uv vis spectra combined with chemometrics to determine coagulant doses for a drinking water treatment plant wtp online uv vis spectral data at the raw water intake and alum dose data from a drinking wtp were used for building coagulant dose determination models three modelling techniques including multiple linear regression mlr partial least squares pls and artificial neural networks anns were applied in this work the results show that mlr and pls models had almost identical performances with small root mean square errors rmse and high correlation coefficients r2 both mlr and pls had slightly better performance than the anns for alum dose predictions this study shows that the combination of online uv vis spectra and a chemometric method mlr or pls was able to mimic operators decisions in the determination of coagulant doses with a ph target of 6 to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for treated water quality graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coagulant dose prediction online uv vis spectra multiple linear regression partial least squares regression artificial neural networks 1 introduction coagulation is an essential chemical process of the conventional water treatment operation for water clarification and is particularly effective for removing natural organic matter nom nom is a precursor for the formation of disinfection by products which can have significant environmental and health risks in the water distribution system the traditional method for controlling the coagulation system in water treatment plants wtps relies on jar tests which require over six hours to carry out depending on sample collection and analysis arrangement 1 3 it may lead to under or over dosing particularly when a wide fluctuation of water quality occurs as jar tests may not offer quick turnover time overdosing of coagulants for the coagulation process may lead to higher operational costs and excessive sludge production while underdosing may fail to meet the water quality targets 4 5 determination of coagulant doses using modelling approaches can demonstrate fast responses to the changes of raw water quality and allow more precise dosing control to achieve stable treated water quality coagulant dosing predictions based on mathematic modelling have been developed in recent years a few models were even employed to predict the coagulant doses and assist the water treatment processes 1 6 a variety of techniques have been used to develop the coagulation model and predict coagulant doses for drinking water treatment based on raw water quality parameters including multiple linear regression mlr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis fuzzy weighting partial least squares regression pls and artificial neural networks anns 7 12 coagulant dose determination models were built using anns and regression equations for surface water treatment with raw water quality parameters including dissolved organic carbon doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 turbidity alkalinity dissolved oxygen and ph 2 10 13 14 some studies have utilised pls combined with uv vis spectral data to predict water quality parameters in water 15 16 and wastewater 17 18 most of the reported prediction models for coagulant doses are operated based on the water quality results provided from laboratory analysis there were very few reported studies using pls to predict coagulant doses pls can extract information from a large volume of data matrix which is suitable to apply when the matrix has more independent variables than dependent variables and there is multicollinearity among the independent variables in comparison with pls anns is a popular prediction model for coagulant dose prediction anns can also handle large datasets detect complex relationships learn patterns and make decisions based on similar situations most of the prediction models rely on the raw water quality data of grab samples as inputs to predict the coagulant doses it is unlikely to capture the rapid variations of the water quality to get correct predictions based on the data of grab samples when water quality changes as there are significant delays in obtaining the laboratory data however predictions based on the online uv vis spectral data could be a promising approach which can use continuous water quality data to predict doses with the ability to capture the rapid variations of water quality to get the correct predictions colton 19 reported a unique method using the online uv vis spectra to predict coagulant doses for wtps however this was an indirect method that first needs to quantify the water quality turbidity uv254 and doc of the raw water using the spectra and then utilised the quantified water quality data as inputs for an exponential model to determine the coagulant doses zhou and meng 20 conducted a lab based study to use spectral data from a bench top uv vis instrument to determine optimal coagulant doses for the removal of dissolved organic matter from a combined coagulation and ultrafiltration system the optimal doses were determined in their study based on the correlations between spectral data and fouling behaviour this study was to establish an in situ coagulation dosing prediction and control method integrated with the online uv vis spectra monitoring technique we employed online uv vis spectral data of raw water from a municipal drinking wtp to build coagulant dose determination models and to determine coagulant doses for coagulation process control this study also aimed at directly using raw water uv vis spectra to mimic operators decisions in the determination of coagulant dose for process control three different models with different levels of complexity were evaluated including multiple linear regression mlr partial least squares pls and artificial neural networks anns 2 methods and materials 2 1 water treatment plant happy valley hv wtp in south australia was selected for this study the hv wtp employs conventional water treatment practices comprising coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration units this wtp provides drinking water across the metropolitan area in the capital city of south australia sa the raw water for the wtp is provided by the happy valley reservoir with water originating from both the river murray and local catchment areas the raw water is characterised by moderate turbidity 0 1 to 10 ntu and high doc ranging from 6 to 10 mg l turbidity and doc ranges represented seasonal variations between april and december 2013 the hv wtp was selected as the source water is the representation of enclosed surface water catchment of a reservoir in sa 2 2 monitoring location and instrument the inlet of hv wtp was the sample point for real time water quality monitoring with a submersible uv vis spectrophotometer the instrument s can spectro lyser s can messtechnik gmbh austria is a double beam photodiode array 256 pixel uv vis spectrometer with an optical path of 5 mm and spectral resolution of 2 5 nm the online instrument measures the absorbance of wavelengths within 220 720 nm the details of the instrument and the maintenance can be found in the previous study 21 2 3 data source the water source was monitored between april and december 2013 raw uv vis spectra in the range of 220 720 nm were acquired from the submersible instrument at two minute intervals the plant alum dose record in the same period was also obtained for this study alum aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o was used as the primary coagulant wtp alum doses were determined by the operators to achieve treated water with doc less than 5 mg l under ph conditions of 6 plant record the wtp alum doses were determined by wtp operators mainly based on jar tests of raw water and operators experience in some water quality event situations such as heavy rainfalls the operators may refer to the wtc coag software and the treated water quality 22 jar tests of raw water were conducted once every two months or when there were sudden changes in the water quality wtc coag is a mathematical model for real time prediction of optimal alum dose which has been used in metropolitan wtps in sa for over 10 years including the hv wtp 6 this software requires uv254 colour and turbidity of raw water as inputs to generate predicted alum doses the operators can select certain removal of the total coagulable doc and choose to refer to the coagulant doses determined based on the 80 90 doc removal using the wtc coag software when they were deciding the dose levels overall uv vis spectral data of raw water quality and plant dose data of the hv wtp were utilised in this study the uv vis spectral data were collected from the online instrument the data of plant doses were extracted from an internal operational database of sa water corporation sa water with hourly extrapolation 2 4 data pre treatment initial data pre treatment was based on the instrument operation status the online uv vis spectra related to the instrument issues and non operational period of wtp were excluded further data pre treatment was conducted using a time resolution optimisation algorithm and hourly average 21 particles in the water can affect the online uv vis measurements 23 thus the averaged uv vis spectra were processed using a particle compensation method to remove particles the baseline correction method was based on the absorbance of particles is at a wavelength of 550 nm particle compensation of source water using uv550 has been proved to be an effective method to remove the particle effect on the online uv vis measurements 21 2 5 data processing the data pre treatment and processing were conducted in the workspace of r and r studio 24 fig 1 shows a flow chart of modelling development and validation of coagulant dose determinations the online uv vis spectra of raw water quality data of the hv wtp were utilised to determine the coagulant dose important wavelengths of the online uv vis spectra were selected using variable selection methods the absorbances of the selected wavelengths were used as model inputs to predict plant alum doses the plant doses determined by operators were utilised as the model output the doc level of treated water during the same period was under 5 mg l fig s1 in si which met the drinking water quality target it indicates that the plant doses were accurate for the coagulation control 2 5 1 input variable optimisation methods three variable optimisation methods variable importance in projections vip selectivity ratio sr and correlation coefficient r were used to select the most important wavelengths that influence the coagulant dose prediction models these methods are frequently used for variable selections in chemometrics 25 these methods for x variable input importance related to the explanation of y variance output are useful for prediction the optimisation of spectral wavelengths variables can enhance the predictive ability of the full spectrum 26 28 first the full spectra of 220 720 nm were screened down to 250 600 nm as the absorbance at these wavelengths show characteristics that indicate the matrix of water quality 29 organic and turbidity in the water are represented by the wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm and 370 600 nm vip scores were obtained from the construction of the initial pls model a higher vip score indicates that the wavelength is more important to predict the alum doses while the wavelength having a lower vip score has less impact on the prediction 25 vip scores select the variables that contribute the most to the y variance explanation generally the threshold score of a vip is defined as 1 0 the threshold score can be higher if the number of variables is large 25 sr associates the statistical significance based on target projections for variable selection srs are based on the calculations of the ratio of explained to the residual variance of x obtained variance an f test 95 has been chosen to define the threshold value of sr with a f value to determine the significance the pair wise correlation coefficients r were the correlation between absorbances of wavelengths for the raw water and alum doses of hv wtp 2 5 2 development methods of coagulant dose prediction three model development methods multiple linear regression mlr partial least squares pls and artificial neural networks anns were used to determine alum doses mlr is used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables which can directly define the coefficient of each parameter while pls can indirectly reveal the functional relationships and define the coefficient of each parameter anns learns to recognise patterns in data between inputs and outputs these modelling methods were applied to capture and incorporate the operators decisions in selecting the alum doses using the spectral data of the raw water quality pls constructs components latent variables by projecting the predictor variables to a new space the observation variables are also projected then the linear regression models were built between new predictors and responses pls regression is particularly suitable to use when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observed variables and there is multicollinearity among the predictors pls can easily extract relevant information from a large data matrix and generate reliable models therefore pls was used to develop the coagulant prediction model in this study package pls was used in the r and r studio for the calculations of pls models 30 pls was analysed with leave one out cross validation to avoid under or over fitting of the model the optimal number of components minimum number of latent variables is 6 for pls anns are computational techniques based on biological neurons which can learn complex patterns among the variables through training anns employ a learning process that is similar to the human brain process to solve problems 31 one of the commonly used anns is multi layer perceptron mlp mlp consists of three layers the input layer hidden layer and output layer the input layer contains the input parameters the hidden layer processes the data and the output layer extracts the results package neuralnet is used for modelling alum dose predictions with mlp anns 32 the best anns architecture for this study is with one input layer one hidden layer and 3 nodes and one output layer the number of hidden layers and the nodes are determined by the trial and error method the whole set of data containing online uv vis spectral data of the raw water and their corresponding plant alum dose data was divided into train and test datasets using a randomization method with a ratio of 80 20 to develop and validate the developed models for coagulant dose determination the datasets were scaled to 0 to 1 using the formula xi minimum maximum minimum before they were used to develop pls and anns models 2 6 evaluation of coagulation determination model performance coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse are commonly used to evaluate the performance of models r2 is commonly used to assess the goodness of fit for regression models r2 close or equal to 1 is an indicator of a good model rmse is commonly used to measure the differences between the predicted values and the actual values rmse value is considered the most important criterion for prediction model fit the smaller the rmse the better the model another common way of using rmse to assess the developed model is to compare the rmse values of models for both train and test data the model is good if the values are similar rmse and r2 were used to evaluate the performance of the models 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimisation of input variables the best representative wavelengths of the pre processed uv vis spectral data of hv raw water that impact on the alum determination models were evaluated by three variable optimisation methods vip sr and r the high dimensional data of original spectra contain a proportion of redundant and irrelevant information for building coagulant models this is because parts of the spectra collect unnecessary water quality information and the absorbance measured at some wavelengths may represent noise rather than the real water quality optimisation of input variables reduces the complexity and calculation time for modelling while enhancing the extraction of essential information 33 wavelength optimisation methods have been used by other researchers to determine the water quality parameters using uv vis spectra 16 27 34 application of these variable selection methods before modelling could lead to better and less complex prediction models 29 vip and sr were performed with partial least squares regressions online uv vis spectral data of wavelength range from 250 to 600 nm were x variables model input and the corresponding alum doses were y variables model output both variables were normalised from 0 to 1 to make sure they had an equal influence on the model an initial pls regression model was built with leave one out cross validation vip scores and sr values were obtained from the results of the pls regression model pair wise correlation coefficients r between the absorbances of the uv vis spectra for the raw water quality and alum doses for the wtp with their level of significance p value were calculated the results of wavelength optimisation from the online uv vis spectra using vip sr and r approaches are presented in table 1 first important wavelengths were selected based on vip and sr and r for modelling alum dose determination associated with the spectral data as x variables inputs and plant alum doses as y variables outputs due to a large number of filtered variables and the strength of influence of the variables a trial and error method was also applied the most important wavelengths were determined based on the overlapping variables of the three selection methods and the trial and error method the trial and error results showed that wavelengths within 250 270 nm are the most important variables that influence the modelling of the plant coagulant dose determination and lead to the improved prediction performance of the models more detailed results are given in table s1 in supplementary information si the selected wavelengths are determined in a range of 250 270 nm with a 2 5 nm interval including nine wavelengths 250 252 5 255 257 5 260 262 5 265 267 5 and 270 nm the corresponding thresholds of the selected wavelengths were 1 82 and 1 48 for vip scores and sr f test 95 when the correlation coefficient of x variables and y variables were considered variables with r of 0 76 0 77 were the same as the variable selected by the vip and sr methods the nine selected wavelengths were considered to have significant contributions to the model development for alum dose determinations for the hv wtp all the important wavelengths are in the uv spectral region it is shown that the determination of coagulant doses of hv wtp is mainly characterised in the uv region a major purpose of coagulation is to remove the natural organic matter from the raw water the natural organic matter of the raw water is characterised within a wavelength range of 250 300 nm 27 35 in addition uv254 is a preferred indicator for selecting alum dosing for wtps 6 36 the selected wavelengths in this study also contained uv254 for modelling coagulant dose determination these studies supported that the selected wavelengths are the important variables that influence the modelling of the alum dose determinations and results in improved model interpretation and performance 25 28 37 literature has shown that the variable selections can extract the most important variables and led to enhanced performance of models 16 29 33 3 2 coagulant determination using uv vis spectra with mlr the absorbances of selected nine wavelengths were also used as inputs to build mlr determination models of plant doses for the hv wtp mlr has been used to predict water quality 38 39 and coagulant dose using water quality parameters 9 10 a train dataset was used to build the calibration mlr then a test dataset was used to validate the developed model the results of mlr were shown in fig 2 the coefficients of the mlr model were obtained and the mlr model can expressed as below y alum dose 200 69 x 250 335 33 x 252 5 58 91 x 255 185 27 x 257 5 12 68 x 260 140 26 x 262 5 154 85 x 265 312 20 x 267 5 305 24 x 270 34 41 in the mlr model equation x refers to the absorbance at a certain wavelength for instance x250 indicates the absorbance at wavelength 250 nm according to r 2 and rmse of mlr presented in fig 2 the predicted alum doses of mlr and actual plant doses were strongly correlated for the calibration model rmse and r 2 for plant alum doses were 4 19 mg l and 0 90 respectively for the validation model rmse and r 2 for plant alum doses were 4 31 mg l and 0 90 respectively rmse values of the mlr were small compared to that the plant alum doses were between 40 and 90 mg l it is confirmed that the mlr model with online uv vis spectral data as inputs can be used to determine the alum doses for wtps modelling results shown in fig 2 reveal a minor difference between the predicted alum doses using the mlr method and their corresponding observed plant alum doses mlr can be used to model the alum dose determination using online uv vis spectral data because the correlations are high between the variables and the alum doses this indicates that the determination of alum doses using online uv vis spectral data combined with mlr is comparable to the plant dose determination method jar tests and operator experience mlr results could mimic the operator decisions in selecting the appropriate alum doses this seems contradictory to an argument that mlr is unable to provide a high level relation between water quality variables and coagulant doses because of the high nonlinearity and the multiple factors affecting the coagulation process 40 however mlr has been used to predict coagulant doses with physico chemical water quality parameters and was recognised as an appropriate approach to predict coagulant doses to assist water 9 10 41 and wastewater treatment operations 42 in this work the online uv vis spectra instead of water quality parameters of raw water were used to build a coagulant dose prediction model with mlr under the optimal coagulation ph of 6 to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for treated water quality 3 3 coagulant determination using uv vis spectra with pls pls was also used to build the coagulant determination models for the hv wtp using the selected wavelengths in the uv range of 250 270 nm of raw water pls is a popular modelling method for spectral analysis which also has been used to generate water quality parameters 16 17 43 and coagulant dose prediction 44 the absorbances of the 9 wavelengths were used as model inputs and plant alum doses of hv wtp were used as model outputs the optimal number of components minimum number of latent variables of the pls model was established by the cross validation leaving one sample at a time to avoid under or over fitting of the model the rmse of the pls model was plotted against the rank of the number of the components as shown in fig 3 the optimal number of components for the model is that the lowest number of components gives the lowest rmse the results indicate that 6 was the optimal number component for the pls calibration model the established pls model was assessed with the test dataset the pls results for plant alum determination using train and test datasets are shown in fig 2 rmse of the pls based on the train dataset was 4 19 mg l and the corresponding r 2 was 0 90 the rmse of the validation was 4 30 mg l and the corresponding r 2 was 0 90 both rmse values of the pls models are small compared to the alum doses which ranged from 40 to 90 mg l therefore a good pls model of determination of plant alum doses was obtained based on the online spectral data of a submersible uv vis instrument our results reveal that uv vis spectral data can be used to determine the alum doses and model the operators decisions in the selection of the suitable doses using pls our results reveal that pls is effective in modelling alum doses using the uv vis spectra and is capable of capturing the operator experience in the determination of alum dose this statement is supported by the following two reasons firstly pls was used to develop coagulant dosage predictions with water quality parameters as inputs pls regression analysis was used for the development of coagulant dosage prediction models using water quality parameters to remove phosphate from wastewater pls was proven to be an efficient tool for coagulant dose prediction 18 pls was also used to develop a decision support system for control of the coagulant dosage at a drinking wtp using water quality parameters including uv colour chemical oxygen demand toc and conductivity thus pls could be recognised as a promising and useful estimation tool for coagulant dosing prediction 44 furthermore pls combined with uv vis spectra has also been employed to determine water quality parameters such as toc in karst water 15 toc in wastewater 17 and cod in water 16 therefore uv vis spectra of the raw water combined with pls is able to determine the coagulant dose in the wtps under the optimal ph of 6 to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for the treated water quality 3 4 coagulant determination using uv vis spectra with anns anns were used to build the coagulant determination models for the plant doses the absorbances of the selected nine wavelengths 250 270 nm were also used as the model inputs and the plant alum doses were used as the model outputs anns have been applied successfully for coagulant dose prediction based on water quality parameters 1 2 31 32 a multi layer perceptron mlp anns equipped with the feed forward back propagation algorithm was used for building ann models back propagation is a widely used algorithm for training feedforward neural networks to speed up the convergence rate and its robustness 45 feedforward ann provides a flexible way for generalizing linear regression and non linear functions dataset of the selected variables and their corresponding plant alum doses was randomly shuffled before anns training to avoid the seasonality effect there is no precise approach to obtain the optimal number of hidden layers of mlp a few hidden layers of anns have been proven to be sufficient for modelling coagulant dosage based on the reported studies 13 46 47 the optimal number of hidden layers was determined by the trial and error method 48 the best anns model is selected for its lowest rmse with one hidden layer and 3 nodes as shown in fig 4 thus the best ann architecture for plant dose determination was obtained with one input layer with 9 neurons nodes one hidden layer with 3 nodes and one output layer with a single node anns of the coagulant model had rmse of 5 25 mg l and 5 26 mg l for train and test datasets the best ann showed satisfactory r2 of 0 75 for both train and test datasets the rmse of optimal ann performance indicates the small discrepancies between the predicted and actual alum doses as the actual alum doses were between 40 and 90 mg l b1 and b2 in fig 5 are two stages of biases the bias of b2 to o1 b1 to h1 b1 to h2 b1 to h3 is 2 32 4 58 3 45 2 17 respectively which are small errors these indicate the viability of using anns to predict alum doses for wtps using uv vis spectral data anns have been applied to predict coagulant doses for wtps by other researchers based on raw water quality parameters 1 45 47 49 it is a well known pattern recognition technique for solving complex problems anns was used to determine alum doses for surface water treatment based on physio chemical parameters of the raw water 10 14 there are also software sensors using anns for online prediction of coagulant doses with the raw water quality parameters 1 6 a study incorporated the operators experience in coagulant dose determination using a time consistent mode 2 all the above support that uv vis combined with anns could mimic the operators experience in the determination of coagulant dose for wtps under the optimal ph condition to achieve target doc level of less than 5 mg l for the treated water quality 3 5 assess coagulant determination model performance three modelling techniques mlr pls and anns were applied to determine the alum dose using the selected uv spectra 250 270 nm of raw water at hv wtp according to the modelling performance indicators rmse and r 2 as shown in fig 2 all three methods can be used to predict plant alum doses with the uv vis spectra the use of uv vis spectra combined with pls or anns has been studied for the determination of toc doc and water quality index 15 16 50 anns are the most commonly used technique to predict coagulant dose with the employment of the water quality parameters 1 2 10 13 as inputs our results revealed that anns may not be the best modelling tool for alum dose predictions with the uv vis spectral data mlr and pls methods showed almost identical performance in terms of prediction of plant alum doses with small values of rmse and high r 2 mlr and pls had better performance with smaller rmse and high r 2 values than anns in modelling of alum dose using uv vis spectra mlr is a simple method that can directly define the coefficient of each parameter for coagulation determination the developed three coagulant dose determination models can well adapt to the variations of raw water quality fig s2 in si the results indicate that the utilisation of uv vis spectra of raw water combined with mlr or pls can mimic operator decisions in the selection of alum doses there is a potential of using a portable uv vis spectrophotometer combined with chemometrics mlr and pls to assist operators for real time coagulant dose prediction especially when there is an unexpected change in raw water quality coagulant doses for water treatment were typically determined by the operators based on multiple factors for process control this study shows that coagulant doses can be determined for a wtp using only the uv vis spectra of raw water under the optimal ph condition to achieve the target doc level for the treated water quality and comparable results were achieved this study may be the first that directly utilities online uv vis spectra of raw water quality to determine plant doses the combination of online uv vis spectra of raw water and coagulation dose determination models will allow better control of the coagulation process particularly for sudden water quality change events such as heavy rainfalls potentially an online submersible instrument combined with a chemometric model mlr or pls can predict coagulant doses and provide decision support information for coagulation process control at wtps 4 conclusion this study may be the first that model plant doses based on online uv vis spectra of raw water quality modelling techniques with different levels of complexity including mlr pls and anns and variable selection methods were employed to build coagulant doses models for the hv wtp important variables that influence the modelling of the alum dose determination were selected using vip sr and r methods from the uv vis spectra of raw water the selected variables were determined as nine wavelengths within 250 270 nm which revealed that the determination of coagulant doses of the hv wtp is mainly characterised in the uv region the selected variables were used as inputs and plant doses were used as the outputs for modelling coagulant dose determinations results show that all three techniques can model the alum dose prediction with the selected variables mlr and pls methods had an almost identical performance of predicting plant alum doses with small rmse and high r2 this study shows that the feasibility of predicting coagulant doses based on the uv vis spectral data of raw water combined with a chemometric model and the ability to mimic the operator decisions in selecting the appropriate doses for process control under the optimal ph condition to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for the treated water quality it is concluded that a submersible uv vis spectrophotometer combined with a chemometric model mlr or pls has the potential to support operators effectively for real time determination of coagulant doses for process control under the

13214,traditionally coagulant doses are determined by the operators for the coagulation process at water treatment plants which is a multi factor approach based on raw and treated water quality and in some situations relies heavily on their decisions it can be challenging to determine appropriate coagulant doses proactively for tight coagulation control with the traditional method therefore this study looked for alternative approaches for coagulation control and maybe the first to build coagulant dose determination models using only online raw water quality data uv vis spectra combined with chemometrics to determine coagulant doses for a drinking water treatment plant wtp online uv vis spectral data at the raw water intake and alum dose data from a drinking wtp were used for building coagulant dose determination models three modelling techniques including multiple linear regression mlr partial least squares pls and artificial neural networks anns were applied in this work the results show that mlr and pls models had almost identical performances with small root mean square errors rmse and high correlation coefficients r2 both mlr and pls had slightly better performance than the anns for alum dose predictions this study shows that the combination of online uv vis spectra and a chemometric method mlr or pls was able to mimic operators decisions in the determination of coagulant doses with a ph target of 6 to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for treated water quality graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coagulant dose prediction online uv vis spectra multiple linear regression partial least squares regression artificial neural networks 1 introduction coagulation is an essential chemical process of the conventional water treatment operation for water clarification and is particularly effective for removing natural organic matter nom nom is a precursor for the formation of disinfection by products which can have significant environmental and health risks in the water distribution system the traditional method for controlling the coagulation system in water treatment plants wtps relies on jar tests which require over six hours to carry out depending on sample collection and analysis arrangement 1 3 it may lead to under or over dosing particularly when a wide fluctuation of water quality occurs as jar tests may not offer quick turnover time overdosing of coagulants for the coagulation process may lead to higher operational costs and excessive sludge production while underdosing may fail to meet the water quality targets 4 5 determination of coagulant doses using modelling approaches can demonstrate fast responses to the changes of raw water quality and allow more precise dosing control to achieve stable treated water quality coagulant dosing predictions based on mathematic modelling have been developed in recent years a few models were even employed to predict the coagulant doses and assist the water treatment processes 1 6 a variety of techniques have been used to develop the coagulation model and predict coagulant doses for drinking water treatment based on raw water quality parameters including multiple linear regression mlr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis fuzzy weighting partial least squares regression pls and artificial neural networks anns 7 12 coagulant dose determination models were built using anns and regression equations for surface water treatment with raw water quality parameters including dissolved organic carbon doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 turbidity alkalinity dissolved oxygen and ph 2 10 13 14 some studies have utilised pls combined with uv vis spectral data to predict water quality parameters in water 15 16 and wastewater 17 18 most of the reported prediction models for coagulant doses are operated based on the water quality results provided from laboratory analysis there were very few reported studies using pls to predict coagulant doses pls can extract information from a large volume of data matrix which is suitable to apply when the matrix has more independent variables than dependent variables and there is multicollinearity among the independent variables in comparison with pls anns is a popular prediction model for coagulant dose prediction anns can also handle large datasets detect complex relationships learn patterns and make decisions based on similar situations most of the prediction models rely on the raw water quality data of grab samples as inputs to predict the coagulant doses it is unlikely to capture the rapid variations of the water quality to get correct predictions based on the data of grab samples when water quality changes as there are significant delays in obtaining the laboratory data however predictions based on the online uv vis spectral data could be a promising approach which can use continuous water quality data to predict doses with the ability to capture the rapid variations of water quality to get the correct predictions colton 19 reported a unique method using the online uv vis spectra to predict coagulant doses for wtps however this was an indirect method that first needs to quantify the water quality turbidity uv254 and doc of the raw water using the spectra and then utilised the quantified water quality data as inputs for an exponential model to determine the coagulant doses zhou and meng 20 conducted a lab based study to use spectral data from a bench top uv vis instrument to determine optimal coagulant doses for the removal of dissolved organic matter from a combined coagulation and ultrafiltration system the optimal doses were determined in their study based on the correlations between spectral data and fouling behaviour this study was to establish an in situ coagulation dosing prediction and control method integrated with the online uv vis spectra monitoring technique we employed online uv vis spectral data of raw water from a municipal drinking wtp to build coagulant dose determination models and to determine coagulant doses for coagulation process control this study also aimed at directly using raw water uv vis spectra to mimic operators decisions in the determination of coagulant dose for process control three different models with different levels of complexity were evaluated including multiple linear regression mlr partial least squares pls and artificial neural networks anns 2 methods and materials 2 1 water treatment plant happy valley hv wtp in south australia was selected for this study the hv wtp employs conventional water treatment practices comprising coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration units this wtp provides drinking water across the metropolitan area in the capital city of south australia sa the raw water for the wtp is provided by the happy valley reservoir with water originating from both the river murray and local catchment areas the raw water is characterised by moderate turbidity 0 1 to 10 ntu and high doc ranging from 6 to 10 mg l turbidity and doc ranges represented seasonal variations between april and december 2013 the hv wtp was selected as the source water is the representation of enclosed surface water catchment of a reservoir in sa 2 2 monitoring location and instrument the inlet of hv wtp was the sample point for real time water quality monitoring with a submersible uv vis spectrophotometer the instrument s can spectro lyser s can messtechnik gmbh austria is a double beam photodiode array 256 pixel uv vis spectrometer with an optical path of 5 mm and spectral resolution of 2 5 nm the online instrument measures the absorbance of wavelengths within 220 720 nm the details of the instrument and the maintenance can be found in the previous study 21 2 3 data source the water source was monitored between april and december 2013 raw uv vis spectra in the range of 220 720 nm were acquired from the submersible instrument at two minute intervals the plant alum dose record in the same period was also obtained for this study alum aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o was used as the primary coagulant wtp alum doses were determined by the operators to achieve treated water with doc less than 5 mg l under ph conditions of 6 plant record the wtp alum doses were determined by wtp operators mainly based on jar tests of raw water and operators experience in some water quality event situations such as heavy rainfalls the operators may refer to the wtc coag software and the treated water quality 22 jar tests of raw water were conducted once every two months or when there were sudden changes in the water quality wtc coag is a mathematical model for real time prediction of optimal alum dose which has been used in metropolitan wtps in sa for over 10 years including the hv wtp 6 this software requires uv254 colour and turbidity of raw water as inputs to generate predicted alum doses the operators can select certain removal of the total coagulable doc and choose to refer to the coagulant doses determined based on the 80 90 doc removal using the wtc coag software when they were deciding the dose levels overall uv vis spectral data of raw water quality and plant dose data of the hv wtp were utilised in this study the uv vis spectral data were collected from the online instrument the data of plant doses were extracted from an internal operational database of sa water corporation sa water with hourly extrapolation 2 4 data pre treatment initial data pre treatment was based on the instrument operation status the online uv vis spectra related to the instrument issues and non operational period of wtp were excluded further data pre treatment was conducted using a time resolution optimisation algorithm and hourly average 21 particles in the water can affect the online uv vis measurements 23 thus the averaged uv vis spectra were processed using a particle compensation method to remove particles the baseline correction method was based on the absorbance of particles is at a wavelength of 550 nm particle compensation of source water using uv550 has been proved to be an effective method to remove the particle effect on the online uv vis measurements 21 2 5 data processing the data pre treatment and processing were conducted in the workspace of r and r studio 24 fig 1 shows a flow chart of modelling development and validation of coagulant dose determinations the online uv vis spectra of raw water quality data of the hv wtp were utilised to determine the coagulant dose important wavelengths of the online uv vis spectra were selected using variable selection methods the absorbances of the selected wavelengths were used as model inputs to predict plant alum doses the plant doses determined by operators were utilised as the model output the doc level of treated water during the same period was under 5 mg l fig s1 in si which met the drinking water quality target it indicates that the plant doses were accurate for the coagulation control 2 5 1 input variable optimisation methods three variable optimisation methods variable importance in projections vip selectivity ratio sr and correlation coefficient r were used to select the most important wavelengths that influence the coagulant dose prediction models these methods are frequently used for variable selections in chemometrics 25 these methods for x variable input importance related to the explanation of y variance output are useful for prediction the optimisation of spectral wavelengths variables can enhance the predictive ability of the full spectrum 26 28 first the full spectra of 220 720 nm were screened down to 250 600 nm as the absorbance at these wavelengths show characteristics that indicate the matrix of water quality 29 organic and turbidity in the water are represented by the wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm and 370 600 nm vip scores were obtained from the construction of the initial pls model a higher vip score indicates that the wavelength is more important to predict the alum doses while the wavelength having a lower vip score has less impact on the prediction 25 vip scores select the variables that contribute the most to the y variance explanation generally the threshold score of a vip is defined as 1 0 the threshold score can be higher if the number of variables is large 25 sr associates the statistical significance based on target projections for variable selection srs are based on the calculations of the ratio of explained to the residual variance of x obtained variance an f test 95 has been chosen to define the threshold value of sr with a f value to determine the significance the pair wise correlation coefficients r were the correlation between absorbances of wavelengths for the raw water and alum doses of hv wtp 2 5 2 development methods of coagulant dose prediction three model development methods multiple linear regression mlr partial least squares pls and artificial neural networks anns were used to determine alum doses mlr is used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables which can directly define the coefficient of each parameter while pls can indirectly reveal the functional relationships and define the coefficient of each parameter anns learns to recognise patterns in data between inputs and outputs these modelling methods were applied to capture and incorporate the operators decisions in selecting the alum doses using the spectral data of the raw water quality pls constructs components latent variables by projecting the predictor variables to a new space the observation variables are also projected then the linear regression models were built between new predictors and responses pls regression is particularly suitable to use when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observed variables and there is multicollinearity among the predictors pls can easily extract relevant information from a large data matrix and generate reliable models therefore pls was used to develop the coagulant prediction model in this study package pls was used in the r and r studio for the calculations of pls models 30 pls was analysed with leave one out cross validation to avoid under or over fitting of the model the optimal number of components minimum number of latent variables is 6 for pls anns are computational techniques based on biological neurons which can learn complex patterns among the variables through training anns employ a learning process that is similar to the human brain process to solve problems 31 one of the commonly used anns is multi layer perceptron mlp mlp consists of three layers the input layer hidden layer and output layer the input layer contains the input parameters the hidden layer processes the data and the output layer extracts the results package neuralnet is used for modelling alum dose predictions with mlp anns 32 the best anns architecture for this study is with one input layer one hidden layer and 3 nodes and one output layer the number of hidden layers and the nodes are determined by the trial and error method the whole set of data containing online uv vis spectral data of the raw water and their corresponding plant alum dose data was divided into train and test datasets using a randomization method with a ratio of 80 20 to develop and validate the developed models for coagulant dose determination the datasets were scaled to 0 to 1 using the formula xi minimum maximum minimum before they were used to develop pls and anns models 2 6 evaluation of coagulation determination model performance coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse are commonly used to evaluate the performance of models r2 is commonly used to assess the goodness of fit for regression models r2 close or equal to 1 is an indicator of a good model rmse is commonly used to measure the differences between the predicted values and the actual values rmse value is considered the most important criterion for prediction model fit the smaller the rmse the better the model another common way of using rmse to assess the developed model is to compare the rmse values of models for both train and test data the model is good if the values are similar rmse and r2 were used to evaluate the performance of the models 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimisation of input variables the best representative wavelengths of the pre processed uv vis spectral data of hv raw water that impact on the alum determination models were evaluated by three variable optimisation methods vip sr and r the high dimensional data of original spectra contain a proportion of redundant and irrelevant information for building coagulant models this is because parts of the spectra collect unnecessary water quality information and the absorbance measured at some wavelengths may represent noise rather than the real water quality optimisation of input variables reduces the complexity and calculation time for modelling while enhancing the extraction of essential information 33 wavelength optimisation methods have been used by other researchers to determine the water quality parameters using uv vis spectra 16 27 34 application of these variable selection methods before modelling could lead to better and less complex prediction models 29 vip and sr were performed with partial least squares regressions online uv vis spectral data of wavelength range from 250 to 600 nm were x variables model input and the corresponding alum doses were y variables model output both variables were normalised from 0 to 1 to make sure they had an equal influence on the model an initial pls regression model was built with leave one out cross validation vip scores and sr values were obtained from the results of the pls regression model pair wise correlation coefficients r between the absorbances of the uv vis spectra for the raw water quality and alum doses for the wtp with their level of significance p value were calculated the results of wavelength optimisation from the online uv vis spectra using vip sr and r approaches are presented in table 1 first important wavelengths were selected based on vip and sr and r for modelling alum dose determination associated with the spectral data as x variables inputs and plant alum doses as y variables outputs due to a large number of filtered variables and the strength of influence of the variables a trial and error method was also applied the most important wavelengths were determined based on the overlapping variables of the three selection methods and the trial and error method the trial and error results showed that wavelengths within 250 270 nm are the most important variables that influence the modelling of the plant coagulant dose determination and lead to the improved prediction performance of the models more detailed results are given in table s1 in supplementary information si the selected wavelengths are determined in a range of 250 270 nm with a 2 5 nm interval including nine wavelengths 250 252 5 255 257 5 260 262 5 265 267 5 and 270 nm the corresponding thresholds of the selected wavelengths were 1 82 and 1 48 for vip scores and sr f test 95 when the correlation coefficient of x variables and y variables were considered variables with r of 0 76 0 77 were the same as the variable selected by the vip and sr methods the nine selected wavelengths were considered to have significant contributions to the model development for alum dose determinations for the hv wtp all the important wavelengths are in the uv spectral region it is shown that the determination of coagulant doses of hv wtp is mainly characterised in the uv region a major purpose of coagulation is to remove the natural organic matter from the raw water the natural organic matter of the raw water is characterised within a wavelength range of 250 300 nm 27 35 in addition uv254 is a preferred indicator for selecting alum dosing for wtps 6 36 the selected wavelengths in this study also contained uv254 for modelling coagulant dose determination these studies supported that the selected wavelengths are the important variables that influence the modelling of the alum dose determinations and results in improved model interpretation and performance 25 28 37 literature has shown that the variable selections can extract the most important variables and led to enhanced performance of models 16 29 33 3 2 coagulant determination using uv vis spectra with mlr the absorbances of selected nine wavelengths were also used as inputs to build mlr determination models of plant doses for the hv wtp mlr has been used to predict water quality 38 39 and coagulant dose using water quality parameters 9 10 a train dataset was used to build the calibration mlr then a test dataset was used to validate the developed model the results of mlr were shown in fig 2 the coefficients of the mlr model were obtained and the mlr model can expressed as below y alum dose 200 69 x 250 335 33 x 252 5 58 91 x 255 185 27 x 257 5 12 68 x 260 140 26 x 262 5 154 85 x 265 312 20 x 267 5 305 24 x 270 34 41 in the mlr model equation x refers to the absorbance at a certain wavelength for instance x250 indicates the absorbance at wavelength 250 nm according to r 2 and rmse of mlr presented in fig 2 the predicted alum doses of mlr and actual plant doses were strongly correlated for the calibration model rmse and r 2 for plant alum doses were 4 19 mg l and 0 90 respectively for the validation model rmse and r 2 for plant alum doses were 4 31 mg l and 0 90 respectively rmse values of the mlr were small compared to that the plant alum doses were between 40 and 90 mg l it is confirmed that the mlr model with online uv vis spectral data as inputs can be used to determine the alum doses for wtps modelling results shown in fig 2 reveal a minor difference between the predicted alum doses using the mlr method and their corresponding observed plant alum doses mlr can be used to model the alum dose determination using online uv vis spectral data because the correlations are high between the variables and the alum doses this indicates that the determination of alum doses using online uv vis spectral data combined with mlr is comparable to the plant dose determination method jar tests and operator experience mlr results could mimic the operator decisions in selecting the appropriate alum doses this seems contradictory to an argument that mlr is unable to provide a high level relation between water quality variables and coagulant doses because of the high nonlinearity and the multiple factors affecting the coagulation process 40 however mlr has been used to predict coagulant doses with physico chemical water quality parameters and was recognised as an appropriate approach to predict coagulant doses to assist water 9 10 41 and wastewater treatment operations 42 in this work the online uv vis spectra instead of water quality parameters of raw water were used to build a coagulant dose prediction model with mlr under the optimal coagulation ph of 6 to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for treated water quality 3 3 coagulant determination using uv vis spectra with pls pls was also used to build the coagulant determination models for the hv wtp using the selected wavelengths in the uv range of 250 270 nm of raw water pls is a popular modelling method for spectral analysis which also has been used to generate water quality parameters 16 17 43 and coagulant dose prediction 44 the absorbances of the 9 wavelengths were used as model inputs and plant alum doses of hv wtp were used as model outputs the optimal number of components minimum number of latent variables of the pls model was established by the cross validation leaving one sample at a time to avoid under or over fitting of the model the rmse of the pls model was plotted against the rank of the number of the components as shown in fig 3 the optimal number of components for the model is that the lowest number of components gives the lowest rmse the results indicate that 6 was the optimal number component for the pls calibration model the established pls model was assessed with the test dataset the pls results for plant alum determination using train and test datasets are shown in fig 2 rmse of the pls based on the train dataset was 4 19 mg l and the corresponding r 2 was 0 90 the rmse of the validation was 4 30 mg l and the corresponding r 2 was 0 90 both rmse values of the pls models are small compared to the alum doses which ranged from 40 to 90 mg l therefore a good pls model of determination of plant alum doses was obtained based on the online spectral data of a submersible uv vis instrument our results reveal that uv vis spectral data can be used to determine the alum doses and model the operators decisions in the selection of the suitable doses using pls our results reveal that pls is effective in modelling alum doses using the uv vis spectra and is capable of capturing the operator experience in the determination of alum dose this statement is supported by the following two reasons firstly pls was used to develop coagulant dosage predictions with water quality parameters as inputs pls regression analysis was used for the development of coagulant dosage prediction models using water quality parameters to remove phosphate from wastewater pls was proven to be an efficient tool for coagulant dose prediction 18 pls was also used to develop a decision support system for control of the coagulant dosage at a drinking wtp using water quality parameters including uv colour chemical oxygen demand toc and conductivity thus pls could be recognised as a promising and useful estimation tool for coagulant dosing prediction 44 furthermore pls combined with uv vis spectra has also been employed to determine water quality parameters such as toc in karst water 15 toc in wastewater 17 and cod in water 16 therefore uv vis spectra of the raw water combined with pls is able to determine the coagulant dose in the wtps under the optimal ph of 6 to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for the treated water quality 3 4 coagulant determination using uv vis spectra with anns anns were used to build the coagulant determination models for the plant doses the absorbances of the selected nine wavelengths 250 270 nm were also used as the model inputs and the plant alum doses were used as the model outputs anns have been applied successfully for coagulant dose prediction based on water quality parameters 1 2 31 32 a multi layer perceptron mlp anns equipped with the feed forward back propagation algorithm was used for building ann models back propagation is a widely used algorithm for training feedforward neural networks to speed up the convergence rate and its robustness 45 feedforward ann provides a flexible way for generalizing linear regression and non linear functions dataset of the selected variables and their corresponding plant alum doses was randomly shuffled before anns training to avoid the seasonality effect there is no precise approach to obtain the optimal number of hidden layers of mlp a few hidden layers of anns have been proven to be sufficient for modelling coagulant dosage based on the reported studies 13 46 47 the optimal number of hidden layers was determined by the trial and error method 48 the best anns model is selected for its lowest rmse with one hidden layer and 3 nodes as shown in fig 4 thus the best ann architecture for plant dose determination was obtained with one input layer with 9 neurons nodes one hidden layer with 3 nodes and one output layer with a single node anns of the coagulant model had rmse of 5 25 mg l and 5 26 mg l for train and test datasets the best ann showed satisfactory r2 of 0 75 for both train and test datasets the rmse of optimal ann performance indicates the small discrepancies between the predicted and actual alum doses as the actual alum doses were between 40 and 90 mg l b1 and b2 in fig 5 are two stages of biases the bias of b2 to o1 b1 to h1 b1 to h2 b1 to h3 is 2 32 4 58 3 45 2 17 respectively which are small errors these indicate the viability of using anns to predict alum doses for wtps using uv vis spectral data anns have been applied to predict coagulant doses for wtps by other researchers based on raw water quality parameters 1 45 47 49 it is a well known pattern recognition technique for solving complex problems anns was used to determine alum doses for surface water treatment based on physio chemical parameters of the raw water 10 14 there are also software sensors using anns for online prediction of coagulant doses with the raw water quality parameters 1 6 a study incorporated the operators experience in coagulant dose determination using a time consistent mode 2 all the above support that uv vis combined with anns could mimic the operators experience in the determination of coagulant dose for wtps under the optimal ph condition to achieve target doc level of less than 5 mg l for the treated water quality 3 5 assess coagulant determination model performance three modelling techniques mlr pls and anns were applied to determine the alum dose using the selected uv spectra 250 270 nm of raw water at hv wtp according to the modelling performance indicators rmse and r 2 as shown in fig 2 all three methods can be used to predict plant alum doses with the uv vis spectra the use of uv vis spectra combined with pls or anns has been studied for the determination of toc doc and water quality index 15 16 50 anns are the most commonly used technique to predict coagulant dose with the employment of the water quality parameters 1 2 10 13 as inputs our results revealed that anns may not be the best modelling tool for alum dose predictions with the uv vis spectral data mlr and pls methods showed almost identical performance in terms of prediction of plant alum doses with small values of rmse and high r 2 mlr and pls had better performance with smaller rmse and high r 2 values than anns in modelling of alum dose using uv vis spectra mlr is a simple method that can directly define the coefficient of each parameter for coagulation determination the developed three coagulant dose determination models can well adapt to the variations of raw water quality fig s2 in si the results indicate that the utilisation of uv vis spectra of raw water combined with mlr or pls can mimic operator decisions in the selection of alum doses there is a potential of using a portable uv vis spectrophotometer combined with chemometrics mlr and pls to assist operators for real time coagulant dose prediction especially when there is an unexpected change in raw water quality coagulant doses for water treatment were typically determined by the operators based on multiple factors for process control this study shows that coagulant doses can be determined for a wtp using only the uv vis spectra of raw water under the optimal ph condition to achieve the target doc level for the treated water quality and comparable results were achieved this study may be the first that directly utilities online uv vis spectra of raw water quality to determine plant doses the combination of online uv vis spectra of raw water and coagulation dose determination models will allow better control of the coagulation process particularly for sudden water quality change events such as heavy rainfalls potentially an online submersible instrument combined with a chemometric model mlr or pls can predict coagulant doses and provide decision support information for coagulation process control at wtps 4 conclusion this study may be the first that model plant doses based on online uv vis spectra of raw water quality modelling techniques with different levels of complexity including mlr pls and anns and variable selection methods were employed to build coagulant doses models for the hv wtp important variables that influence the modelling of the alum dose determination were selected using vip sr and r methods from the uv vis spectra of raw water the selected variables were determined as nine wavelengths within 250 270 nm which revealed that the determination of coagulant doses of the hv wtp is mainly characterised in the uv region the selected variables were used as inputs and plant doses were used as the outputs for modelling coagulant dose determinations results show that all three techniques can model the alum dose prediction with the selected variables mlr and pls methods had an almost identical performance of predicting plant alum doses with small rmse and high r2 this study shows that the feasibility of predicting coagulant doses based on the uv vis spectral data of raw water combined with a chemometric model and the ability to mimic the operator decisions in selecting the appropriate doses for process control under the optimal ph condition to achieve a target doc level of less than 5 mg l for the treated water quality it is concluded that a submersible uv vis spectrophotometer combined with a chemometric model mlr or pls has the potential to support operators effectively for real time determination of coagulant doses for process control under the
