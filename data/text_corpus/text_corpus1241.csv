6205,in this study we proposed a hybrid approach combining the standard fao 56 method with the complementary principle of evapotranspiration et to predict actual et eta on a rainfed crop field a generalized complementary relationship gcr was employed to quantify the water stress coefficient ks for the fao 56 method with no use of soil moisture data then the ks values were multiplied to the crop et etc estimated with the corrected air temperatures for the assumption of adequate land surface moisture the proposed hybrid method applied to a rotational maize soybean field where an eddy covariance flux tower was installed results showed that the reference et eto estimated by the corrected temperatures was within a range of 89 95 of that from non corrected ones implying that eto could be inflated when using the mean air temperatures measured under sub humid conditions the ks values estimated by gcr showed consistent patterns with temporal rainfall variation on the field the multiplication of the ks from gcr and etc showed higher performance in eta prediction than when the gcr was solely applied by inverting the hybrid approach a local crop coefficient curve for the rainfed maize field was developed and led to further improvement in eta prediction this study suggests that combination of the complementary principle and the fao standard method which are seemingly in separate paradigms may improve eta prediction on crop fields keywords actual evapotranspiration water stress coefficient complementary principle fao 56 method 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a major hydrologic process that determines water and energy exchanges between soil vegetation systems and the atmosphere it is fundamental to predict agricultural productivity and water availability boyer 1982 the et process is closely related to major drought events kim and rhee 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 hobbins et al 2016 water quality degradation farahani et al 2007 and long term precipitation patterns lu et al 2017 among many others however direct and long term observations of actual et eta are still unavailable in many locations across the globe han et al 2014 necessitating reliable methods for its accurate predictions the guideline for computing crop water requirements of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 hereafter the fao 56 method has been a standard method to predict eta on crop fields the fao 56 method has been widely used for modeling water consumption and growth of plants e g barker et al 2018 alberto et al 2014 liu and luo 2010 ko et al 2009 it is sometimes called the two step approach that first calculates the potential et etp rate on the reference grass surface and then adjusts it by multiplying an appropriate crop coefficient i e crop et etc etc is then readjusted by the stress coefficient when more factors limit moisture transport to the atmosphere e g water and salinity stresses hence the core hypothesis underlying the fao 56 method is the proportionality between etp and eta this proportionality hypothesis however inevitably requires soil moisture data or land surface models to identify water stress in the soil vegetation system kim and rhee 2016 indeed it might be theoretically rejected by decoupled or negative relationships between eta and etp e g hobbins et al 2004 ramírez et al 2005 on the other hand the complementary principle has provided convenience to predict eta e g han and tian 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 brutsaert 2015 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 kahler and brutsaert 2006 it is sometimes called the bouchet hypothesis e g kim and rhee 2016 ramírez et al 2005 because bouchet 1963 first introduced the feedback mechanism between the atmosphere and unsaturated land surfaces for operational eta estimation in this principle insufficient land surface moisture limits latent heat flux and raises sensible heat flux to the atmosphere thereby etp becomes greater than what should be measured under adequate water availability resulting in inverse correlation between eta and etp the complementary principle was strongly supported by observational evidence ramírez et al 2005 it also explains the decreasing pan evaporation observed in many locations in the world which was so called pan evaporation paradox hobbins et al 2004 brutsaert and parlange 1998 due to the inverse relation between eta and etp the complementary principle has been viewed as a separate paradigm from the proportionality hypothesis e g han et al 2014 in practice the complementary principle is advantageous because it allows eta estimation with no land surface information e g chun et al 2018 instead of direct soil moisture information it uses responsive behaviors of the atmosphere to surface dryness that can be identified by meteorological observations only using the land atmosphere feedback mechanism several studies assessed major drought events e g kim and rhee 2016 hobbins et al 2016 this led us to an implication that the water stress coefficient for the fao 56 method can be quantified by the complementary principle allowing eta estimation over a partially saturated crop field in other words two principles of the proportionality and the negative relation between etp and eta which seemingly conflict each other can be conceptually combined in this work we proposed a hybrid approach that combines the standard fao 56 method with a generalized complementary principle the complementary principle was applied to indicate the degree of water stress on a rainfed crop field then we used the fao 56 method to predict local daily eta here a temperature correction was applied to calculate the reference et in order to make it suited to the assumption of adequate land surface moisture by inverting the hybrid approach a plausible set of the crop coefficients were also obtained for the crop surface under sub humid conditions this study shows that a conceptual combination of the two principles can provide knowledge beyond what should be achieved from separate applications of each one 2 methodology 2 1 generalized complementary principle in the complementary principle of bouchet 1963 the evaporative potential over a saturated land surface is separately defined as the wet environment et etw the land surface is assumed to be sufficiently large and homogeneous with minimal effects of local advection due to ample water availability the latent heat flux on the saturated surface is limited by energy availability i e eta etw however if inadequate water availability limits the latent heat flux i e etw eta more radiation should be transformed to the sensible heat flux warming the lower atmosphere thus the evaporative potential under water limited conditions becomes higher than what should be measured under the wet environment i e etp etw hence the difference between etp and etw could be a predictor of eta over an unsaturated land surface for this work we employed the generalized complementary relationship gcr proposed by szilagyi et al 2017 in the gcr dimensionless variables are defined as x etw etp and y eta etp when land surface moisture is sufficient etp etw and eta should be all equal thus yielding a zero order boundary condition of y 1 for x 1 under a completely dry condition i e y 0 etp reaches its physical upper limit epmax and the corresponding x value becomes xmin etw epmax this provides another zero order boundary condition of y 0 for x xmin since changes in eta would be controlled by changes in etw at the full saturation dy dx 1 is for x 1 under zero water availability eta 0 would not vary with etw proving another first order boundary condition of dy dx 0 for x xmin when rescaling x with xmin as x x xmin 1 xmin as in crago et al 2016 the four boundary conditions can be rewritten as i y 1 for x 1 ii y 0 for x 0 iii dy dx 1 for x 1 and iv dy dx 0 for x 0 the simplest polynomial equation satisfying the four boundary conditions is 1 y 2 x 2 x 3 eq 1 enables to estimate eta from etp etw and epmax in this paper eta estimates from eq 1 will be referred to as etgcr because they are not final eta estimates when using the hybrid method to estimate etp that could be amplified by sub humid land surfaces the penman combined equation penman 1948 could be used 2 e t p δ t a v g δ t

tws was confined within the range of twb tavg theoretically tavg under sub humid conditions should always be greater than tws due to less cooling effects of latent heat fluxes while the non zero net radiation i e qn 0 results in higher tws values than twb more details about the temperature correction can be found in szilagyi 2014 the gcr could provide actual et estimates i e etgcr from routine meteorological observations only etgcr may be accepted as a regional estimate of eta e g szilagyi 2018b szilagyi et al 2017 however if field scale daily observations are used etgcr may contain considerable uncertainty the spatial resolution compatible with the gcr would be below 1 km2 because the atmospheric self adjustment seems to occur on the order of 103 m davenport and hudson 1967 lang et al 1974 kahler and brutsaert 2006 showed that a daily application of the complementary principle could result in larger uncertainty than a monthly application hence in this work etgcr was used as an indicator of water stress for the fao 56 method 2 2 the fao 56 method for eta estimation we employed the single crop coefficient method in allen et al 1998 daily eta on a crop surface mm d 1 is simply determined by multiplying two coefficients to the reference et as 8a e t a k s k c e t o 8b e t o δ t w s r n γ 90 t w s 273 u 2 e s t w s e s t d e w δ t w s γ 1 0 34 u 2 where ks is the water stress coefficient unitless kc is the crop coefficient unitless eto is the reference et mm d 1 assuming the standard grass surface it should be noted that here we used the wet surface temperature tws for eto in lieu of the mean air temperature tavg the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 employed in the fao 56 method was formulated under an assumption of adequate water availability while the mean air temperature has been usually used for the pm equation it may inflate the reference et when the sensible heat flux is enhanced by inadequate soil moisture in central california for instance lobell and bonfils 2008 found the statistically significant negative effect of irrigation on the average of daily maximum air temperatures for the assumption of ample water supply underlying the pm equation tws could be better suited for calculation of the saturation vapor pressure the slope of vapor pressure curve and the density of air the crop coefficient kc in eq 8a adjusts eto of the reference grass surface to the etp on a crop surface i e etc the kc values over a planting period can be achieved from controlled experimental plots that compare eta observations on a well watered crop surface against those on the grass surface e g trout and dejonge 2018 piccinni et al 2009 instead it is able to use the approximated kc values provided by the fao 56 method the water stress coefficient ks represents how much latent heat fluxes are limited by soil moisture deficits with a range of zero full stress to 1 no stress converting etc to eta on the crop surface under water limited conditions the fao 56 method requires the total available water the readily available water and the soil water depletion in the root zone to determine ks in other words soil moisture deficit should be evaluated to predict eta however in many cases soil moisture observations at crop fields may not be readily available and or subject to measurement errors hindering reliable estimation of eta under sub humid environments although a modeling approach is used for quantifying the soil moisture deficit e g steduto et al 2009 parameter uncertainty would become a concern in this case to circumvent the required soil moisture data or modeling here we proposed to use etgcr as an indicator of water stress since the ratio of etgcr to etw is conceptually equivalent to the ratio of eta to kc eto in eq 8a the water stress coefficient ks can be quantified as 9 k s e t g c r e t w using ks obtained from eq 9 together with kc values given in the fao 56 method or any experimental studies eta on a local crop field could be achieved with no soil moisture data 3 application of the proposed approach the proposed approach that combines the fao 56 method and the gcr was applied to a fluxnet site at the university of nebraska agricultural research development center near mead nebraska site id us ne3 located at 41 10 46 8 n 96 26 22 7 w 362 m the eddy covariance flux tower was installed in the middle of a crop field with an area of 65 4 ha in which maize and soybean have been rotationally planted since 2001 under rainfed conditions according to the site information in the ameriflux webpage https ameriflux lbl gov the fluxnet site has a humid continental climate with severe winter and hot summer seasons köppen classification of dfa the soil of the fluxnet site is a deep silty clay loam which is a typical class in eastern nebraska the standard management practices for plant population herbicide and pesticide applications and fertilizer management were applied to the crop field foolad et al 2017 suyker and verma 2009 the eddy covariance sensors are mounted at 3 0 m at the canopy height shorter than 1 0 m while they are moved to a height of 6 2 m when the canopy becomes higher than 1 0 m suyker et al 2004 mccomb et al 2018 analyzed the footprint climatology of this site confirming a 90 source contribution that fell within the crop field represented by the flux tower this led us an assumption that the eddy covariance footprint can be representative of the areal average field conditions in suyker and verma 2009 more details about the flux site are provided for this study hourly incoming shortwave radiation precipitation air temperature vpd wind speed data for 2001 2012 at the fluxnet site were collected via the fluxdata website http fluxnet fluxdata org as in foolad et al 2017 the hourly meteorological data were aggregated into daily values to estimate daily eta rates with the proposed hybrid method for the 12 years according to the fluxnet dataset the annual precipitation and the mean temperatures for the 12 years have ranges of 571 942 mm and 9 5 10 7 c respectively the precipitation from may to october accounted for 70 of the annual precipitation approximately in eta estimation we first used the kc values given in the fao 56 method later the kc curves were developed by inverting the hybrid approach and applied them for eta estimation again we predicted eta only for planting seasons typically from may to october the planting dates at the study site table 1 were obtained via an electronic correspondence to the primary investigator of the tower team a e suyker personal communication nov 11 2018 for performance evaluation the hourly latent heat flux data were collected together and aggregated into daily rates as observations we used the three performance metrics of the nash sutcliff efficiency nse the pearson correlation coefficient pearson r and the percent bias p bias 10 n s e 1 q s q o 2 q o q o 2 11 p e a r s o n r q s q s q o q o q s q s 2 q o q o 2 12 p b i a s q s q o q o 100 where qs and qo signifies simulated and observed values and q s and q o are the averages of simulations and observations respectively 4 results 4 1 temperature corrections for eto fig 1 displays the temporal variation of the daily mean temperature tavg tws and corresponding eto values in 2003 rainfall events in the early season were more frequent and intense than in the other months leading to small differences between tavg and tws tws was almost equal to tavg with few exceptions from may to early july on the other hand tws often deviated from tavg in the late season since the cooling effects of latent heat fluxes were limited by deficient water availability due to occasional precipitation tavg seems to be higher than the temperature that should be observed under full saturation the mean difference between tavg and tws from may to july was 0 45 c while it increased to 1 27 c from august to october tws was constantly lower than tavg after august in 2003 and the difference between tws and tavg reached up to 5 0 c in the middle of august fig 1 shows that the eto estimated by tavg was higher than that from tws for the late season the total eto obtained from tavg was 783 1 mm from may to october whereas that estimated by tws was 735 0 mm 6 1 less the annual eto calculated by tws for the entire data period of 2001 2012 ranged within 89 95 of that from tavg indicating that effects of the elevated temperature on eto might not be negligible approximately 5 10 of eto could be inflated when using tavg for the pm equation and would directly affect eta estimation due to the proportionality hypothesis between eta and eto correcting tavg to tws for the priestley and taylor equation szilagyi 2014 highlighted that differences between the two temperatures may exceed 12 c and led to overestimation of etw up to 14 under arid or semi arid environments further szilagyi and schepers 2014 found the existence of spatially constant tws over irrigated areas staying below adjacent tavg observations from thermal infrared images in nebraska those studies suggest that the use of tws in replacement of tavg may improve etw estimation by the priestley taylor equation likewise the correction from tavg to tws would make eto values more suited to the reference grass surface because the pm and the priestley taylor equations were all originated from the penman method hypothesizing unlimited water availability the temperature correction enables to prevent the inflation of eto particularly on hot dry days nonetheless the correction would be meaningful only when tavg tws since tws can be higher than tavg on wet days it needs to be capped by tavg mcmahon et al 2013 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 4 2 water stress coefficients from the gcr fig 2 depicts the temporal variations of ks obtained from the gcr for two planting seasons with contrasting rainfall patterns in 2003 as aforementioned rainfall events were large and frequent in the early season while the late season became drier on the contrary early dryness might be a challenge for farming in 2009 however the mid season became fairly wet from frequent precipitation the ratios of etgcr to etw were of a similar temporal variation to surface wetness expected from the rainfall patterns in 2003 the ks values from may to early august were around 0 80 with a moderated variation whereas the average ks values in september and october were dropped to 0 59 and 0 38 respectively given the rainfall pattern in 2009 the ks values from may to early june in 2009 were relatively low at around 0 6 and then it increased close to 1 0 in the mid season the ks values again declined with increasing dry spells in the late season in 2009 this consistency between ks and rainfall patterns may be explained by the degree of the atmospheric self adjustment to dryness of the land surface fig 3 illustrates the scatter plots between 15 day running averages of ks and corresponding precipitation totals for the entire years of maize and soybean in both cases low ks values i e high water stress tend to become fewer as precipitation increases the binned averages of ks values from the gcr increases with precipitation that recharges soil moisture this implies that the degree of atmospheric adjustments could become a water stress indicator in the rainfed field the larger difference between etp and etw would bring the smaller etgcr not surprisingly the surface water stress seems to be indicated by the feedback mechanism between land surfaces and the atmosphere although etgcr might be accepted as local eta estimates e g crago and qualls 2018 szilagyi 2018 it may need further refinements the etgcr from the typical priestley taylor coefficient i e α 1 26 contained a positive bias 17 with moderate noises for maize fig 4 a in the case of soybean the noises were more severe fig 4c in part the bias and noises may be from the uncalibrated parameter α and the temporal and spatial scales inadequately compatible with the atmospheric self adjustment thus it may be a better choice to use the ratio of etgcr to etw thereby reducing the effects of uncertainty in etgcr though it indicates water stress conditions only this ratio can play a crucial role in eta estimation with the fao 56 method 4 3 determining eta by the fao 56 method the fao 56 method requires the crop coefficient kc for quantifying eta the kc values tabulated in the fao 56 guideline represent a generic variation of plant growth under standard water managements however for precise eta estimation the fao 56 method recommends a further refinement of the initial kc kc ini by considering the time interval between wetting events the evaporating power of atmosphere and the magnitude of the wetting events during the initial stage eta on a crop field would be predominantly evaporation if the soil is fed by frequent wetting events kc ini tends to become greater with a shorter dry spell a lower evaporative demand and a larger rainfall depth in early seasons allen et al 1998 in table 1 together with the planting dates we summarized the mean dry spell the mean eto and the average depth of rainfall events during the initial stages of maize and soybean in each year the kc ini values were determined graphically by its relationships to eto and infiltration depths given in the fao 56 guideline all the kc ini values were higher than the tabulated value of 0 3 and 0 4 for maize and soybean respectively this provides an indication that the study site seems to be often wetter than the standard water condition adopted for the fao 56 method to calculate daily eta rates on the crop field the kc curves for the entire planting period were built by connecting the kc ini values in table 1 to the mid season and the late season kc tabulated in the fao 56 guideline as per the lengths of growth stages then daily eta estimates were obtained by multiplying the given ks and eto fig 4b and d shows the 1 1 plots between the flux observations and eta estimates from the hybrid method the hybrid method combining the gcr and the fao 56 methods provided higher performance than the case when the gcr was solely applied the variance of residuals appears to decrease when combining kc from the fao 56 method with ks from the gcr although more comparisons under diverse environments are needed to confirm it the combination of the two methods seems to improve the performance metrics nse and pearson r fig 5 displays the time series of etgcr and eta estimated by the hybrid method in 2003 maize and 2006 soybean in comparison to the flux observations in 2003 etgcr seems to be overpredicted until approximately 50 days after planting while its performance was comparable to the hybrid approach in the mid to late season on the other hand the overprediction in the early season was alleviated by the hybrid method analogously soybean eta estimates from the hybrid method in 2006 were closer to the flux observations than etgcr particularly in the early season the overprediction by the gcr may be explained by its inability to consider plant growth that affects the surface and the aerodynamic resistances since it adopted a fixed wind function for etp and an unchanging coefficient α 1 26 for etw the gcr is likely to oversimplify the contribution of vegetation development to the variation of latent heat flux by contrast the kc values per growth stage allowed the hybrid method to implicitly incorporate the effects of plant growth into eta estimation 4 4 developing the kc curve by inverting the hybrid method the proposed approach can be inverted to estimate kc values when eta observations are available for the inverse application we first calibrated the gcr against the flux observations for 2001 2006 to have a better set of ks by the trial and error approach the priestley taylor coefficient was adjusted towards maximizing the nse between the flux observations and etgcr and the best coefficient was found to be α 1 18 the maximum nses were 0 67 and 0 41 for maize and soybean respectively the stress coefficient ks for the remaining data period 2007 2012 was recalculated with α 1 18 the seasonal averages of the new ks values ranged between 0 60 and 0 84 for the validation period of 2007 2012 when comparing to the prior case of α 1 26 the seasonal averages of ks decreased by 6 10 approximately etgcr was more sensitively decreased than etw by the reduction of α from 1 26 to 1 18 due to the non linearity of eq 1 using the recalculated ks eto and eta observations daily kc estimates can be easily obtained by inverting eq 8a 13 k c e t a k s e t o fig 6 displays the collection of kc values determined by eq 13 with days after planting dap for the calibration period 2001 2006 we developed the kc curve for maize and soybean by fitting the obtained kc samples to a third degree polynomial function of dap the new kc curve for maize was generally lower than those from the fao 56 method while the new kc curve of soybean was lower than the curves from the fao 56 it became higher in the mid to late season the both kc curves seem to be generally greater than the values given for the study site by suyker and verma 2009 that simply took the ratios of observed eta to eto with no consideration of water stress using the new kc curves developed with the flux observations during the calibration we recalculated daily eta for the validation period 2007 2012 with eq 8a fig 7 illustrates the 1 1 plots between the observed and re estimated eta values for the validation period both sets of etgcr and eta estimates became closer to the observations than the case of α 1 26 since it reduced the bias in etgcr the calibration may affect performance of the hybrid approach fig 7 shows that the hybrid method could reduce the variations of residuals even after the calibration still the performance metrics nse and pearson r seem to be significantly improved by applying the hybrid method when comparing to etgcr 5 discussion 5 1 utility of the hybrid approach in eta estimation figs 4 and 7 may indicate that the combination between the gcr and the fao 56 method has a potential to improve local eta prediction over partially saturated land surfaces although it is difficult to generalize that the hybrid method can always improve the predictive performance from our single site test it was found via the paired wilcoxon test that etgcr and eta in fig 7 have statistically different mean ranks at a 5 significance level for both maize and soybean this implies that the performance improvement by the hybrid method is unlikely coincidental as discussed earlier since the hybrid method considers vegetation growth in eta estimation it may compensate the weakness of the gcr method the definitive boundary conditions of the gcr also improve generality of the complementary principle crago and qualls 2018 thus inherently making the ks estimates reliable importantly the gcr allows users to flexibly consider the inherent asymmetric nature of the complementary relationship in fig 8 we plotted the etgcr on the dimensionless space of x etw etp and y etgcr etp it shows that the asymmetry of the gcr is non stationary notwithstanding prior models based on the complementary principle e g kahler and brutsaert 2006 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 the scaling variable xmin etw epmax determines the asymmetry between etp and eta and it varies with atmospheric conditions in this study the median and the interquartile range iqr of xmin were 0 33 and 0 16 respectively almost same for both maize and soybean szilagyi 2007 argued that the relationship between etp and eta is inherently asymmetric due in part to horizontal energy transport to the location of interest in other words the scaling variable xmin might mend the effect of advected radiation that has been a common criticism on the complementary principle the inverse relation between actual and potential ets underlying the gcr can be viewed as a theory opposed to the fao 56 method in which the two are assumed to be positively correlated however the temperature correction can adjust eto to values suitable for the hypothesis of unlimited water supply preventing the inflation of eto this may allow the proportionality assumption of the fao 56 method to remain acceptable even when the soil is not fully saturated given that eto by tavg was inflated by 6 10 the eta estimates would have more positive bias if the temperature correction was not applied in addition by taking ratios between etgcr to etw the errors of etgcr could be reduced when estimating eta with the hybrid method this study highlights that the two methods i e fao 56 and gcr that seemingly conflict can be conceptually combined the hybrid method may become a better choice for local eta estimation even without calibrating the priestley taylor coefficient the inverse application of this method would provide an additional practical utility because a plausible set of the crop coefficient kc can be obtained even under water stress conditions with no soil moisture observations 5 2 limitations the gcr is subject to caveats even though the scaling variable xmin could reduce the effect of advected radiation horizontal humidity transport may still affect the vertical coupling between the atmosphere and underlying land surfaces szilagyi 2018a in addition human influences such as irrigation can disturb the atmospheric self adjustment possibly introducing biases in the water stress coefficient according to the irrigated area datasets from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer available at https modis gsfc nasa gov data the saunders county where the study site locates had around 15 of irrigated areas in 2002 and 2007 since the air mass over the rainfed field could be influenced by the irrigated areas the ks might be slightly higher than what should be gained with no surrounding irrigation however zaussinger et al 2019 suggests that the irrigation water use around the study site would be minor when comparing to precipitation amounts the rainfed surfaces are likely to exert major influences on the atmospheric adjustment conversely if an irrigated field is surrounded by large rainfed areas ks can be unacceptably biased while the lower atmosphere over the locally irrigated field may have minimal self adjustment it can be in equilibrium with the atmosphere highly adjusted by the surrounding non irrigated surfaces this would result in much lower ks than actual water stress conditions over the irrigated field in short usability of the hybrid method can be limited by the degree of human impacts on soil moistures at a location of interest or its surrounding areas 6 conclusions in this study the complementary principle of evapotranspiration was incorporated into the standard fao 56 method for predicting daily eta on a crop field under rainfed environment though two methods appear to be within separate paradigms i e positive vs negative relation between potential and actual ets this study suggests that they can be conceptually combined and improve performance to predict actual et over a rainfed crop field despite some caveats we believe that following conclusions could be drawn 1 the temperature correction for observations under sub humid conditions can make the reference et more suited to the assumption of unlimited water availability underlying the penman monteith equation 2 actual et estimates from the complementary principle can quantify the water stress coefficient required for the fao 56 method with meteorological observations alone 3 the multiplication of the water stress coefficients generic crop coefficients and the reference et may allow improved performance to predict field scale actual et this approach may reduce uncertainty associated with the complementary principle 4 by inverting the hybrid approach users can achieve a plausible set of the crop coefficient under rainfed conditions and it may become practical information for predicting actual et on crop surfaces declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the apec climate center we declare no conflicts of interest 
6205,in this study we proposed a hybrid approach combining the standard fao 56 method with the complementary principle of evapotranspiration et to predict actual et eta on a rainfed crop field a generalized complementary relationship gcr was employed to quantify the water stress coefficient ks for the fao 56 method with no use of soil moisture data then the ks values were multiplied to the crop et etc estimated with the corrected air temperatures for the assumption of adequate land surface moisture the proposed hybrid method applied to a rotational maize soybean field where an eddy covariance flux tower was installed results showed that the reference et eto estimated by the corrected temperatures was within a range of 89 95 of that from non corrected ones implying that eto could be inflated when using the mean air temperatures measured under sub humid conditions the ks values estimated by gcr showed consistent patterns with temporal rainfall variation on the field the multiplication of the ks from gcr and etc showed higher performance in eta prediction than when the gcr was solely applied by inverting the hybrid approach a local crop coefficient curve for the rainfed maize field was developed and led to further improvement in eta prediction this study suggests that combination of the complementary principle and the fao standard method which are seemingly in separate paradigms may improve eta prediction on crop fields keywords actual evapotranspiration water stress coefficient complementary principle fao 56 method 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a major hydrologic process that determines water and energy exchanges between soil vegetation systems and the atmosphere it is fundamental to predict agricultural productivity and water availability boyer 1982 the et process is closely related to major drought events kim and rhee 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 hobbins et al 2016 water quality degradation farahani et al 2007 and long term precipitation patterns lu et al 2017 among many others however direct and long term observations of actual et eta are still unavailable in many locations across the globe han et al 2014 necessitating reliable methods for its accurate predictions the guideline for computing crop water requirements of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 hereafter the fao 56 method has been a standard method to predict eta on crop fields the fao 56 method has been widely used for modeling water consumption and growth of plants e g barker et al 2018 alberto et al 2014 liu and luo 2010 ko et al 2009 it is sometimes called the two step approach that first calculates the potential et etp rate on the reference grass surface and then adjusts it by multiplying an appropriate crop coefficient i e crop et etc etc is then readjusted by the stress coefficient when more factors limit moisture transport to the atmosphere e g water and salinity stresses hence the core hypothesis underlying the fao 56 method is the proportionality between etp and eta this proportionality hypothesis however inevitably requires soil moisture data or land surface models to identify water stress in the soil vegetation system kim and rhee 2016 indeed it might be theoretically rejected by decoupled or negative relationships between eta and etp e g hobbins et al 2004 ramírez et al 2005 on the other hand the complementary principle has provided convenience to predict eta e g han and tian 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 brutsaert 2015 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 kahler and brutsaert 2006 it is sometimes called the bouchet hypothesis e g kim and rhee 2016 ramírez et al 2005 because bouchet 1963 first introduced the feedback mechanism between the atmosphere and unsaturated land surfaces for operational eta estimation in this principle insufficient land surface moisture limits latent heat flux and raises sensible heat flux to the atmosphere thereby etp becomes greater than what should be measured under adequate water availability resulting in inverse correlation between eta and etp the complementary principle was strongly supported by observational evidence ramírez et al 2005 it also explains the decreasing pan evaporation observed in many locations in the world which was so called pan evaporation paradox hobbins et al 2004 brutsaert and parlange 1998 due to the inverse relation between eta and etp the complementary principle has been viewed as a separate paradigm from the proportionality hypothesis e g han et al 2014 in practice the complementary principle is advantageous because it allows eta estimation with no land surface information e g chun et al 2018 instead of direct soil moisture information it uses responsive behaviors of the atmosphere to surface dryness that can be identified by meteorological observations only using the land atmosphere feedback mechanism several studies assessed major drought events e g kim and rhee 2016 hobbins et al 2016 this led us to an implication that the water stress coefficient for the fao 56 method can be quantified by the complementary principle allowing eta estimation over a partially saturated crop field in other words two principles of the proportionality and the negative relation between etp and eta which seemingly conflict each other can be conceptually combined in this work we proposed a hybrid approach that combines the standard fao 56 method with a generalized complementary principle the complementary principle was applied to indicate the degree of water stress on a rainfed crop field then we used the fao 56 method to predict local daily eta here a temperature correction was applied to calculate the reference et in order to make it suited to the assumption of adequate land surface moisture by inverting the hybrid approach a plausible set of the crop coefficients were also obtained for the crop surface under sub humid conditions this study shows that a conceptual combination of the two principles can provide knowledge beyond what should be achieved from separate applications of each one 2 methodology 2 1 generalized complementary principle in the complementary principle of bouchet 1963 the evaporative potential over a saturated land surface is separately defined as the wet environment et etw the land surface is assumed to be sufficiently large and homogeneous with minimal effects of local advection due to ample water availability the latent heat flux on the saturated surface is limited by energy availability i e eta etw however if inadequate water availability limits the latent heat flux i e etw eta more radiation should be transformed to the sensible heat flux warming the lower atmosphere thus the evaporative potential under water limited conditions becomes higher than what should be measured under the wet environment i e etp etw hence the difference between etp and etw could be a predictor of eta over an unsaturated land surface for this work we employed the generalized complementary relationship gcr proposed by szilagyi et al 2017 in the gcr dimensionless variables are defined as x etw etp and y eta etp when land surface moisture is sufficient etp etw and eta should be all equal thus yielding a zero order boundary condition of y 1 for x 1 under a completely dry condition i e y 0 etp reaches its physical upper limit epmax and the corresponding x value becomes xmin etw epmax this provides another zero order boundary condition of y 0 for x xmin since changes in eta would be controlled by changes in etw at the full saturation dy dx 1 is for x 1 under zero water availability eta 0 would not vary with etw proving another first order boundary condition of dy dx 0 for x xmin when rescaling x with xmin as x x xmin 1 xmin as in crago et al 2016 the four boundary conditions can be rewritten as i y 1 for x 1 ii y 0 for x 0 iii dy dx 1 for x 1 and iv dy dx 0 for x 0 the simplest polynomial equation satisfying the four boundary conditions is 1 y 2 x 2 x 3 eq 1 enables to estimate eta from etp etw and epmax in this paper eta estimates from eq 1 will be referred to as etgcr because they are not final eta estimates when using the hybrid method to estimate etp that could be amplified by sub humid land surfaces the penman combined equation penman 1948 could be used 2 e t p δ t a v g δ t

tws was confined within the range of twb tavg theoretically tavg under sub humid conditions should always be greater than tws due to less cooling effects of latent heat fluxes while the non zero net radiation i e qn 0 results in higher tws values than twb more details about the temperature correction can be found in szilagyi 2014 the gcr could provide actual et estimates i e etgcr from routine meteorological observations only etgcr may be accepted as a regional estimate of eta e g szilagyi 2018b szilagyi et al 2017 however if field scale daily observations are used etgcr may contain considerable uncertainty the spatial resolution compatible with the gcr would be below 1 km2 because the atmospheric self adjustment seems to occur on the order of 103 m davenport and hudson 1967 lang et al 1974 kahler and brutsaert 2006 showed that a daily application of the complementary principle could result in larger uncertainty than a monthly application hence in this work etgcr was used as an indicator of water stress for the fao 56 method 2 2 the fao 56 method for eta estimation we employed the single crop coefficient method in allen et al 1998 daily eta on a crop surface mm d 1 is simply determined by multiplying two coefficients to the reference et as 8a e t a k s k c e t o 8b e t o δ t w s r n γ 90 t w s 273 u 2 e s t w s e s t d e w δ t w s γ 1 0 34 u 2 where ks is the water stress coefficient unitless kc is the crop coefficient unitless eto is the reference et mm d 1 assuming the standard grass surface it should be noted that here we used the wet surface temperature tws for eto in lieu of the mean air temperature tavg the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 employed in the fao 56 method was formulated under an assumption of adequate water availability while the mean air temperature has been usually used for the pm equation it may inflate the reference et when the sensible heat flux is enhanced by inadequate soil moisture in central california for instance lobell and bonfils 2008 found the statistically significant negative effect of irrigation on the average of daily maximum air temperatures for the assumption of ample water supply underlying the pm equation tws could be better suited for calculation of the saturation vapor pressure the slope of vapor pressure curve and the density of air the crop coefficient kc in eq 8a adjusts eto of the reference grass surface to the etp on a crop surface i e etc the kc values over a planting period can be achieved from controlled experimental plots that compare eta observations on a well watered crop surface against those on the grass surface e g trout and dejonge 2018 piccinni et al 2009 instead it is able to use the approximated kc values provided by the fao 56 method the water stress coefficient ks represents how much latent heat fluxes are limited by soil moisture deficits with a range of zero full stress to 1 no stress converting etc to eta on the crop surface under water limited conditions the fao 56 method requires the total available water the readily available water and the soil water depletion in the root zone to determine ks in other words soil moisture deficit should be evaluated to predict eta however in many cases soil moisture observations at crop fields may not be readily available and or subject to measurement errors hindering reliable estimation of eta under sub humid environments although a modeling approach is used for quantifying the soil moisture deficit e g steduto et al 2009 parameter uncertainty would become a concern in this case to circumvent the required soil moisture data or modeling here we proposed to use etgcr as an indicator of water stress since the ratio of etgcr to etw is conceptually equivalent to the ratio of eta to kc eto in eq 8a the water stress coefficient ks can be quantified as 9 k s e t g c r e t w using ks obtained from eq 9 together with kc values given in the fao 56 method or any experimental studies eta on a local crop field could be achieved with no soil moisture data 3 application of the proposed approach the proposed approach that combines the fao 56 method and the gcr was applied to a fluxnet site at the university of nebraska agricultural research development center near mead nebraska site id us ne3 located at 41 10 46 8 n 96 26 22 7 w 362 m the eddy covariance flux tower was installed in the middle of a crop field with an area of 65 4 ha in which maize and soybean have been rotationally planted since 2001 under rainfed conditions according to the site information in the ameriflux webpage https ameriflux lbl gov the fluxnet site has a humid continental climate with severe winter and hot summer seasons köppen classification of dfa the soil of the fluxnet site is a deep silty clay loam which is a typical class in eastern nebraska the standard management practices for plant population herbicide and pesticide applications and fertilizer management were applied to the crop field foolad et al 2017 suyker and verma 2009 the eddy covariance sensors are mounted at 3 0 m at the canopy height shorter than 1 0 m while they are moved to a height of 6 2 m when the canopy becomes higher than 1 0 m suyker et al 2004 mccomb et al 2018 analyzed the footprint climatology of this site confirming a 90 source contribution that fell within the crop field represented by the flux tower this led us an assumption that the eddy covariance footprint can be representative of the areal average field conditions in suyker and verma 2009 more details about the flux site are provided for this study hourly incoming shortwave radiation precipitation air temperature vpd wind speed data for 2001 2012 at the fluxnet site were collected via the fluxdata website http fluxnet fluxdata org as in foolad et al 2017 the hourly meteorological data were aggregated into daily values to estimate daily eta rates with the proposed hybrid method for the 12 years according to the fluxnet dataset the annual precipitation and the mean temperatures for the 12 years have ranges of 571 942 mm and 9 5 10 7 c respectively the precipitation from may to october accounted for 70 of the annual precipitation approximately in eta estimation we first used the kc values given in the fao 56 method later the kc curves were developed by inverting the hybrid approach and applied them for eta estimation again we predicted eta only for planting seasons typically from may to october the planting dates at the study site table 1 were obtained via an electronic correspondence to the primary investigator of the tower team a e suyker personal communication nov 11 2018 for performance evaluation the hourly latent heat flux data were collected together and aggregated into daily rates as observations we used the three performance metrics of the nash sutcliff efficiency nse the pearson correlation coefficient pearson r and the percent bias p bias 10 n s e 1 q s q o 2 q o q o 2 11 p e a r s o n r q s q s q o q o q s q s 2 q o q o 2 12 p b i a s q s q o q o 100 where qs and qo signifies simulated and observed values and q s and q o are the averages of simulations and observations respectively 4 results 4 1 temperature corrections for eto fig 1 displays the temporal variation of the daily mean temperature tavg tws and corresponding eto values in 2003 rainfall events in the early season were more frequent and intense than in the other months leading to small differences between tavg and tws tws was almost equal to tavg with few exceptions from may to early july on the other hand tws often deviated from tavg in the late season since the cooling effects of latent heat fluxes were limited by deficient water availability due to occasional precipitation tavg seems to be higher than the temperature that should be observed under full saturation the mean difference between tavg and tws from may to july was 0 45 c while it increased to 1 27 c from august to october tws was constantly lower than tavg after august in 2003 and the difference between tws and tavg reached up to 5 0 c in the middle of august fig 1 shows that the eto estimated by tavg was higher than that from tws for the late season the total eto obtained from tavg was 783 1 mm from may to october whereas that estimated by tws was 735 0 mm 6 1 less the annual eto calculated by tws for the entire data period of 2001 2012 ranged within 89 95 of that from tavg indicating that effects of the elevated temperature on eto might not be negligible approximately 5 10 of eto could be inflated when using tavg for the pm equation and would directly affect eta estimation due to the proportionality hypothesis between eta and eto correcting tavg to tws for the priestley and taylor equation szilagyi 2014 highlighted that differences between the two temperatures may exceed 12 c and led to overestimation of etw up to 14 under arid or semi arid environments further szilagyi and schepers 2014 found the existence of spatially constant tws over irrigated areas staying below adjacent tavg observations from thermal infrared images in nebraska those studies suggest that the use of tws in replacement of tavg may improve etw estimation by the priestley taylor equation likewise the correction from tavg to tws would make eto values more suited to the reference grass surface because the pm and the priestley taylor equations were all originated from the penman method hypothesizing unlimited water availability the temperature correction enables to prevent the inflation of eto particularly on hot dry days nonetheless the correction would be meaningful only when tavg tws since tws can be higher than tavg on wet days it needs to be capped by tavg mcmahon et al 2013 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 4 2 water stress coefficients from the gcr fig 2 depicts the temporal variations of ks obtained from the gcr for two planting seasons with contrasting rainfall patterns in 2003 as aforementioned rainfall events were large and frequent in the early season while the late season became drier on the contrary early dryness might be a challenge for farming in 2009 however the mid season became fairly wet from frequent precipitation the ratios of etgcr to etw were of a similar temporal variation to surface wetness expected from the rainfall patterns in 2003 the ks values from may to early august were around 0 80 with a moderated variation whereas the average ks values in september and october were dropped to 0 59 and 0 38 respectively given the rainfall pattern in 2009 the ks values from may to early june in 2009 were relatively low at around 0 6 and then it increased close to 1 0 in the mid season the ks values again declined with increasing dry spells in the late season in 2009 this consistency between ks and rainfall patterns may be explained by the degree of the atmospheric self adjustment to dryness of the land surface fig 3 illustrates the scatter plots between 15 day running averages of ks and corresponding precipitation totals for the entire years of maize and soybean in both cases low ks values i e high water stress tend to become fewer as precipitation increases the binned averages of ks values from the gcr increases with precipitation that recharges soil moisture this implies that the degree of atmospheric adjustments could become a water stress indicator in the rainfed field the larger difference between etp and etw would bring the smaller etgcr not surprisingly the surface water stress seems to be indicated by the feedback mechanism between land surfaces and the atmosphere although etgcr might be accepted as local eta estimates e g crago and qualls 2018 szilagyi 2018 it may need further refinements the etgcr from the typical priestley taylor coefficient i e α 1 26 contained a positive bias 17 with moderate noises for maize fig 4 a in the case of soybean the noises were more severe fig 4c in part the bias and noises may be from the uncalibrated parameter α and the temporal and spatial scales inadequately compatible with the atmospheric self adjustment thus it may be a better choice to use the ratio of etgcr to etw thereby reducing the effects of uncertainty in etgcr though it indicates water stress conditions only this ratio can play a crucial role in eta estimation with the fao 56 method 4 3 determining eta by the fao 56 method the fao 56 method requires the crop coefficient kc for quantifying eta the kc values tabulated in the fao 56 guideline represent a generic variation of plant growth under standard water managements however for precise eta estimation the fao 56 method recommends a further refinement of the initial kc kc ini by considering the time interval between wetting events the evaporating power of atmosphere and the magnitude of the wetting events during the initial stage eta on a crop field would be predominantly evaporation if the soil is fed by frequent wetting events kc ini tends to become greater with a shorter dry spell a lower evaporative demand and a larger rainfall depth in early seasons allen et al 1998 in table 1 together with the planting dates we summarized the mean dry spell the mean eto and the average depth of rainfall events during the initial stages of maize and soybean in each year the kc ini values were determined graphically by its relationships to eto and infiltration depths given in the fao 56 guideline all the kc ini values were higher than the tabulated value of 0 3 and 0 4 for maize and soybean respectively this provides an indication that the study site seems to be often wetter than the standard water condition adopted for the fao 56 method to calculate daily eta rates on the crop field the kc curves for the entire planting period were built by connecting the kc ini values in table 1 to the mid season and the late season kc tabulated in the fao 56 guideline as per the lengths of growth stages then daily eta estimates were obtained by multiplying the given ks and eto fig 4b and d shows the 1 1 plots between the flux observations and eta estimates from the hybrid method the hybrid method combining the gcr and the fao 56 methods provided higher performance than the case when the gcr was solely applied the variance of residuals appears to decrease when combining kc from the fao 56 method with ks from the gcr although more comparisons under diverse environments are needed to confirm it the combination of the two methods seems to improve the performance metrics nse and pearson r fig 5 displays the time series of etgcr and eta estimated by the hybrid method in 2003 maize and 2006 soybean in comparison to the flux observations in 2003 etgcr seems to be overpredicted until approximately 50 days after planting while its performance was comparable to the hybrid approach in the mid to late season on the other hand the overprediction in the early season was alleviated by the hybrid method analogously soybean eta estimates from the hybrid method in 2006 were closer to the flux observations than etgcr particularly in the early season the overprediction by the gcr may be explained by its inability to consider plant growth that affects the surface and the aerodynamic resistances since it adopted a fixed wind function for etp and an unchanging coefficient α 1 26 for etw the gcr is likely to oversimplify the contribution of vegetation development to the variation of latent heat flux by contrast the kc values per growth stage allowed the hybrid method to implicitly incorporate the effects of plant growth into eta estimation 4 4 developing the kc curve by inverting the hybrid method the proposed approach can be inverted to estimate kc values when eta observations are available for the inverse application we first calibrated the gcr against the flux observations for 2001 2006 to have a better set of ks by the trial and error approach the priestley taylor coefficient was adjusted towards maximizing the nse between the flux observations and etgcr and the best coefficient was found to be α 1 18 the maximum nses were 0 67 and 0 41 for maize and soybean respectively the stress coefficient ks for the remaining data period 2007 2012 was recalculated with α 1 18 the seasonal averages of the new ks values ranged between 0 60 and 0 84 for the validation period of 2007 2012 when comparing to the prior case of α 1 26 the seasonal averages of ks decreased by 6 10 approximately etgcr was more sensitively decreased than etw by the reduction of α from 1 26 to 1 18 due to the non linearity of eq 1 using the recalculated ks eto and eta observations daily kc estimates can be easily obtained by inverting eq 8a 13 k c e t a k s e t o fig 6 displays the collection of kc values determined by eq 13 with days after planting dap for the calibration period 2001 2006 we developed the kc curve for maize and soybean by fitting the obtained kc samples to a third degree polynomial function of dap the new kc curve for maize was generally lower than those from the fao 56 method while the new kc curve of soybean was lower than the curves from the fao 56 it became higher in the mid to late season the both kc curves seem to be generally greater than the values given for the study site by suyker and verma 2009 that simply took the ratios of observed eta to eto with no consideration of water stress using the new kc curves developed with the flux observations during the calibration we recalculated daily eta for the validation period 2007 2012 with eq 8a fig 7 illustrates the 1 1 plots between the observed and re estimated eta values for the validation period both sets of etgcr and eta estimates became closer to the observations than the case of α 1 26 since it reduced the bias in etgcr the calibration may affect performance of the hybrid approach fig 7 shows that the hybrid method could reduce the variations of residuals even after the calibration still the performance metrics nse and pearson r seem to be significantly improved by applying the hybrid method when comparing to etgcr 5 discussion 5 1 utility of the hybrid approach in eta estimation figs 4 and 7 may indicate that the combination between the gcr and the fao 56 method has a potential to improve local eta prediction over partially saturated land surfaces although it is difficult to generalize that the hybrid method can always improve the predictive performance from our single site test it was found via the paired wilcoxon test that etgcr and eta in fig 7 have statistically different mean ranks at a 5 significance level for both maize and soybean this implies that the performance improvement by the hybrid method is unlikely coincidental as discussed earlier since the hybrid method considers vegetation growth in eta estimation it may compensate the weakness of the gcr method the definitive boundary conditions of the gcr also improve generality of the complementary principle crago and qualls 2018 thus inherently making the ks estimates reliable importantly the gcr allows users to flexibly consider the inherent asymmetric nature of the complementary relationship in fig 8 we plotted the etgcr on the dimensionless space of x etw etp and y etgcr etp it shows that the asymmetry of the gcr is non stationary notwithstanding prior models based on the complementary principle e g kahler and brutsaert 2006 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 the scaling variable xmin etw epmax determines the asymmetry between etp and eta and it varies with atmospheric conditions in this study the median and the interquartile range iqr of xmin were 0 33 and 0 16 respectively almost same for both maize and soybean szilagyi 2007 argued that the relationship between etp and eta is inherently asymmetric due in part to horizontal energy transport to the location of interest in other words the scaling variable xmin might mend the effect of advected radiation that has been a common criticism on the complementary principle the inverse relation between actual and potential ets underlying the gcr can be viewed as a theory opposed to the fao 56 method in which the two are assumed to be positively correlated however the temperature correction can adjust eto to values suitable for the hypothesis of unlimited water supply preventing the inflation of eto this may allow the proportionality assumption of the fao 56 method to remain acceptable even when the soil is not fully saturated given that eto by tavg was inflated by 6 10 the eta estimates would have more positive bias if the temperature correction was not applied in addition by taking ratios between etgcr to etw the errors of etgcr could be reduced when estimating eta with the hybrid method this study highlights that the two methods i e fao 56 and gcr that seemingly conflict can be conceptually combined the hybrid method may become a better choice for local eta estimation even without calibrating the priestley taylor coefficient the inverse application of this method would provide an additional practical utility because a plausible set of the crop coefficient kc can be obtained even under water stress conditions with no soil moisture observations 5 2 limitations the gcr is subject to caveats even though the scaling variable xmin could reduce the effect of advected radiation horizontal humidity transport may still affect the vertical coupling between the atmosphere and underlying land surfaces szilagyi 2018a in addition human influences such as irrigation can disturb the atmospheric self adjustment possibly introducing biases in the water stress coefficient according to the irrigated area datasets from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer available at https modis gsfc nasa gov data the saunders county where the study site locates had around 15 of irrigated areas in 2002 and 2007 since the air mass over the rainfed field could be influenced by the irrigated areas the ks might be slightly higher than what should be gained with no surrounding irrigation however zaussinger et al 2019 suggests that the irrigation water use around the study site would be minor when comparing to precipitation amounts the rainfed surfaces are likely to exert major influences on the atmospheric adjustment conversely if an irrigated field is surrounded by large rainfed areas ks can be unacceptably biased while the lower atmosphere over the locally irrigated field may have minimal self adjustment it can be in equilibrium with the atmosphere highly adjusted by the surrounding non irrigated surfaces this would result in much lower ks than actual water stress conditions over the irrigated field in short usability of the hybrid method can be limited by the degree of human impacts on soil moistures at a location of interest or its surrounding areas 6 conclusions in this study the complementary principle of evapotranspiration was incorporated into the standard fao 56 method for predicting daily eta on a crop field under rainfed environment though two methods appear to be within separate paradigms i e positive vs negative relation between potential and actual ets this study suggests that they can be conceptually combined and improve performance to predict actual et over a rainfed crop field despite some caveats we believe that following conclusions could be drawn 1 the temperature correction for observations under sub humid conditions can make the reference et more suited to the assumption of unlimited water availability underlying the penman monteith equation 2 actual et estimates from the complementary principle can quantify the water stress coefficient required for the fao 56 method with meteorological observations alone 3 the multiplication of the water stress coefficients generic crop coefficients and the reference et may allow improved performance to predict field scale actual et this approach may reduce uncertainty associated with the complementary principle 4 by inverting the hybrid approach users can achieve a plausible set of the crop coefficient under rainfed conditions and it may become practical information for predicting actual et on crop surfaces declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study

6206,in this study we developed a one dimensional mobile mobile model mm for contaminant transport in subsurface with depth dependent reaction coefficients two local systems at micro scale level are involved in this model a micro pore system and a less permeable pore system the breakthrough curves btcs obtained from the mm with depth dependent coefficients were thoroughly analyzed where the case with constant coefficients was used as the reference system the effects of different parameters on btcs were studied and a parameter analysis was also performed to illustrate the effects of adsorption coefficient and degradation coefficient on btcs results show that the btc patterns for the depth dependent reactions in which the reaction rate decreases with increasing depth vary between the two extreme cases with constant rate reactions in the topsoil and observation depth the mass transfer coefficient α plays a significant role in defining the btc pattern the double peak changes to a single peak when the value of α is large enough in addition the velocity of the main flow determines the shape of the btcs while the velocity of the svd defines the pattern of the dual peaks in btcs which also tends to be represented by a single peak as the velocity decreases finally we tested the applicability of the proposed model mm fd in the leaching experiments of both field herbicide and conservative tracer in an agricultural area of northeastern greece and compared its performance with that of the advection dispersion equation ade model by gao et al 2013 both of which have depth dependent coefficients the results showed that the proposed mobile mobile model with depth dependent reaction coefficients was able to satisfactorily capture the evolution of metolachlor concentration both at upper and lower depths keywords solute transport dual permeability mobile mobile model depth dependent 1 introduction the fate of contaminants such as pesticide in subsurface is of great interest owing to growing concerns over the environment and human health e g groundwater quality the prediction of pollutant concentration within the soil matrix is significantly important to minimizing the risk and vulnerability of aquifers furthermore the accuracy of the predicted model is crucial to adequately assessing and forecasting the contaminant transport behavior in subsurface over the past few decades several models have been developed by researchers to address specific objectives serrano 2001 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 yeh et al 2008 robinson et al 2012 li et al 2018 for instance serrano 2001 proposed a solute transport model which considers non linear sorption and decay vanderborght and vereecken 2007 developed a model coupling depth dependent dispersion sorption and decay however yeh et al 2008 suggested that the besides biodegradation the regime of flow should be considered when researching chlorine concentration decay in pipes it is now well established that both physical and reaction processes which influence pollutant transport in soil media should be adequately addressed in solute transport modeling porous media often contain different pore or flow domain due to aggregation fracturing earthworm burrows channels of decayed roots or drying cracks in swelling clay soils hartge and stewart 1995 these macro pore affect flow and solute transport at microscopic level by producing non uniform flow fields with different flow velocities hendrickx and flury 2001 reported that flow in this type of media may generate irregular patterns and non uniform flow will result in spatial dynamic instabilities of the wetting front during infiltration furthermore water moves faster along with solute in such preferential paths of the soil than that in the matrix of the soil such phenomenon is often referred to as non equilibrium flow and transport or preferential flow beven 1991 to describe non equilibrium flow in porous media several multi domain models have been developed coats and smith 1964 first developed a conceptual model considering dead end pores in porous media later the concept of mobile immobile model subsequently denoted as mim model was developed by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 to analyze the breakthrough data in aggregated soils from then on the mim model has been commonly used to describe non equilibrium flow and transport process in heterogeneous porous media charbeneau 1984 germann 1985 liu et al 2007 tyukhova and willmann 2016 this model is very effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves duiguid and lee 1977 gerke and genuchten 1993 ray et al 1997 vogel et al 2000 however the mim model only allows flow in a so called mobile domain and diffusive transfer between the mobile and immobile regions which can be described by fick s equation van genuchten and dalton 1986 or a first order rate equation selim 1998 therefore it is significantly hard for the mim model to resolve the scenario that allows flow in both inter aggregate and intra aggregate pore domains to deal with this dilemma the mobile mobile model was proposed by leij et al 2012 who assumed a different pore water velocity for the two domains and obtained an analytical solution for solute transport in porous media with different non zero flow rate in two distinct pore domains with first order solute transfer between them this model constitutes a generalized version of the advection dispersion equation ade for transport in uniform media as well as the mobile immobile model mim in media with mobile and immobile domains the concept of dual permeability was further supported by experiments carried out in volcanic ash soil with a distinct inter aggregate and intra aggregate porosity sciortino et al 2015 besides the physical characteristics of soil the fate and transport of pollutant are strongly affected by reaction process in the soil water system bouma and dekker 1978 hatano et al 1988 the reaction and adsorption processes in soils are often related to the amount and type of organic matter soil component and microbial activity it has been reported that the above factors are strongly depth dependent flury et al 1998 for example soil organic content has strong influence on both the movement and decay of chemical process generally the concentration of organic matter decreases with depth where the highest concentration can be found in the topsoil due to the degradation of plants on the surface it is the main source of organic matter near the soil surface as the content of organic carbon decreases significantly with depth paul and clark 1996 ray et al 2004 gao et al 2013 in addition soil clay mineral composition also affects the process of adsorption particularly in soils with low organic matter content many studies found that inorganic pollutants such as cu zn can be strongly adsorbed by clay si et al 2010 xie et al 2018 both the content of organic matter and clay minerals contribute to the decrease of pollutant adsorption relative to soil depth vryzas et al 2007 similar trend was exhibited for microbial activities which are common near the soil surface but decrease with depth vryzas et al 2012a this leads to higher degradation rate of pollutants at the upper profile of soils compared to degradation rates at deeper profiles paul and clark 1996 ramos et al 2000 consequently there is a strong correlation between depth dependent reaction process and the fate of contaminants in soil media hence for transport models that characterize contaminant migration it becomes necessary to consider depth variability for the reaction processes flury et al 1998 observed that the spatial variability of reaction process is usually assumed to be described by a stochastic or deterministic function of space or distance the stochastic method assumes the change of reaction coefficients as the stationary process with constant mean and variance chrysikopoulos et al 1990 loll and moldrup 2000 or that the process is correlated with the random hydraulic conductivity field shapiro and cvetkovic 1990 miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 it is worth stating that one of the advantages of the stochastic approach is that it provides the uncertainty associated with the mean prediction to decrease the uncertainty in prediction large site specific data are needed which is often too costly gao et al 2013 compared to stochastic approaches the deterministic methods are more practical and effective for example vanderborght and vereecken 2007 treated the soil profile as a layered system and assumed each layer has a constant reaction coefficient flury et al 1998 described the depth dependent reaction coefficients by using a sigmoidal function and incorporated them to the solute transport governing equations a careful review of the literature shows that both the structure of the soil media as well as the depth dependent reaction processes play an important role in predicting contaminant transport in soil to our knowledge there is no research on pollutant transport problems that considers different velocity fields and spatial variable reaction coefficients yet therefore the objective of this study is to present a novel mobile mobile model that considers both the dual permeability structure and depth dependent reaction process and assess the impact of velocity volume and variable reaction coefficients on contaminant transport in porous media 2 problem statement and mathematical model 2 1 governing equations this study considers a problem of solute transport in the vertical direction which can be described with two overlapping domains fast velocity domain fvd and slow velocity domain svd with depth dependent reaction coefficient and a linear kinetic mass transfer term between the two domains the solute adsorption is described by a liner isotherm while solute degradation is assumed to be a first order process the governing equations for this solute transport problem are expressed as follows 1 θ f r x f c f t θ f d f 2 c f x 2 θ f v f c f x θ f μ x c f α c s c f 2 θ s r x s c s t θ s d s 2 c s x 2 θ s v s c s x θ s μ x c s α c f c s where θf and θs are the volumetric water contents l3l 3 the total volumetric water content θ θf θs cf and cs are concentrations ml 3 df and ds are dispersion coefficients lt 2 vf and vs are pore water velocities lt 1 α is an effective first order rate coefficient between the aqueous regions t 1 r x f and r x s are the depth dependent retardation factors μ x is the depth dependent degradation rate t 1 x is transport depth l t is time t the subscript f and s denote fast velocity domain and slow velocity domain respectively the retardation factor is defined as 3 r x f s 1 ρ k d x f s θ f s where ρ is the soil bulk density ml 3 kd x f s is the depth dependent adsorption coefficients l3m 1 for the solute chemical fertilizer and herbicides considered in this study adsorption is considered as the major process compared to absorption therefore the absorption process is ignored here df and ds represent the dispersion coefficient of the fvd and svd l2t 1 respectively and it composed of mechanical dispersion and molecule diffusion which can be expressed as 4 d f λ f v f d 0 5 d s λ s v s d 0 where λf and λs are the dispersivities in the fvd and svd l respectively d 0 is the effective diffusion coefficient in the two domains l2 t 1 the rate of both adsorption and degradation of solutes are often related to soil organic content chemical composition and microbial activity where organic content and microbial activity are strongly depth dependent generally depth contribution to organic matter and microbial activity has been found to be of a sigmoidal form the following functions adopted by flury et al 1998 are used here to represent spatially variable reaction 6 k d x k 0 cosh 2 x x 0 7 μ x μ 0 cosh 2 x x 0 where k 0 and μ 0 are the adsorption coefficient and degradation rate in the topsoil representing the maximum of kd x and μ x respectively the parameter x 0 is constant determining how fast the reactions diminish with increasing depth the value of reaction coefficients decrease faster for a given smaller value of x 0 when x 0 increases from zero to infinity the reaction coefficients vary between the two special cases of maximum values and zero eqs 6 and 7 have been validated by flury et al 1998 on the basis of a series of experimental data when the reaction coefficients are constant the above governing eqs 1 and 2 can be re written as 8 θ f r c f t θ f d f 2 c f x 2 θ f v f c f x θ f μ c f α c s c f 9 θ s r c s t θ s d s 2 c s x 2 θ s v s c s x θ s μ c s α c f c s where r 1 ρ b k d θ and μ are constant retardation coefficient and degradation rate respectively 2 2 initial and boundary conditions this study considered solute transport in a finite system initially free of solute and a pulse input at the inlet which can be described with a first type or third type condition the initial and boundary conditions van genuchten and parker 1984 can be given as 10a c f s 0 t β λ f s c f s 0 t x m f s θ f s v f s δ t 10b c f s x 0 0 10c c f s x l t 0 where β is a dummy variable to represent a first type β 0 or third type β 1 inlet condition δ is the dirac delta function t 1 l is length of the spatial domain l if the total mass applied to the system is known the mass applied to each domain mf s can be referred from the porosity of that area m l 2 that is 11 m f s m θ f s θ the above governing equations for solute transport in finite medium with constant reactive coefficients and depth dependent reactive coefficient are hereinafter called the mm fc model mobile mobile model in finite domain with constant reactive coefficients and mm fd model mobile mobile model in finite domain with depth dependent reactive coefficients respectively 3 results and discussion the governing mobile mobile model in one dimension porous media with depth dependent reaction coefficients was solved using the finite difference method the details of discretization are shown in the appendix in order to test the accuracy of our model finding a benchmark solution is necessary for the solute transport ignoring the reaction process the analytical solution of leij et al 2012 for non reactive solute transport in one dimension media can be used as a benchmark another benchmark is the semi analytical solution by gao et al 2013 where the reaction coefficients vary with soil depth the proposed model in this study is a special case θf θs qf qs q 2 α of gao et al 2013 where the difference in flow velocities is not considered as for the analysis of the btcs such as that of effluent samples collected during the solute transport across both flow domains the solute concentration can be defined as 12 c e q f c f q s c s q with q f s θ i v i as the darcy velocity in the fast or slow domain lt 1 and the total darcy flow velocity can be given by q q f q s the comparison between the concentration of this model and the two benchmarks are shown in fig 1 the parameters used in fig 1 are as follows vf 10 cm d vs 1 25 cm d θf 0 1 θs 0 4 α 0 05 d 1 compared with leij et al 2012 vf 3 cm d vs 3 cm d θf 0 25 θs 0 25 α 109 d 1 compared with gao et al 2013 the rest of the parameters are show in table 1 obviously the compared results show that our numerical solution is sufficiently accurate and reliable 3 1 effect of mass exchange coefficient and velocity in this subsection the btcs generated by the above derived mm fd solutions were thoroughly analyzed to illustrate the effects of mass exchange coefficient and velocity on pollutant transport in finite porous media the parameter values for the simulations are summarized in table 1 for the mm fd model the mass exchange coefficient α is a critical factor it describes the process of reversible transfer between the two domains fig 2 shows the effect of rate coefficient on btcs obtained from mm fd where the value of α from a to c are 0 05 d 1 0 005 d 1 and 0 0005 d 1 respectively for decreased mass exchange coefficient α 0 0005 d 1 the concentration curve for fvd is skewed to the left the peak value decreases with decreasing α while the breakthrough curves gradually exhibit a bimodal distribution this is because there exists a wide concentration difference between the two domains with a small α value the double peak changes to a single peak when the value of α is large enough comparing fig 2 left and 2 right as x 0 increases from 30 cm to 60 cm the peak concentration of the btcs obtained from mm fd decreases significantly while the arrival time increased this is because the average reaction coefficients of mm fd increase with x 0 which leads to a concurrent acceleration of the reaction process the darcy flux represents the amount of water and dissolved solute that enters moves through and exits the domain it is determined by the permeability and bulk area of that domain with respect to the bulk area since darcy fluxes and water contents are expressed with respect to the total bulk area also the velocity of solute transport in a domain through the aqueous phase depends on its volumetric water content thus fig 3 exhibits the role of the darcy flux and volumetric water content in the breakthrough for a total darcy flux q 1 5 cm d and a total volumetric water content θ 0 5 when the main flow and solute transport qf 1 cm d occur in fvd with small transport area θf 0 05 there will be two distinct peaks a small peak value for fvd at early time and large peak value for svd at later time fig 3a fig 3b shows a case where the darcy flux remains as before but the water contents are equal θf θs 0 25 the value of the peak appears later while the first peak value is larger than the one in fig 3a whereas the situation in svd is opposite finally fig 3c shows a case where the main transport q s 1 cm d occur in svd in this case the double peak diminishes to a single peak this phenomenon indicates that the concentration of fvd may have little impact on the whole system under this circumstance it should also be noted that the pore water content controls the initial concentration distribution the btcs at three different observed points simulated by mm fd are shown in fig 4 at the shallowest point of 10 cm the arrival times of the peak for cf and cs are almost the same thus only one peak is observed for the breakthrough curve ce this is attributed to the small time difference between two domains such that the arrival time of both concentrations are almost the same similarly for the deeper layer the difference in arrival time widens gradually comparing the three figures from a to c it becomes apparent that the difference in arrival time for the peak value increases on the right side of fig 4 similar concentration changes trend between the btcs of mm fd with k dx and μ x at three different depth for x 0 30 cm and 60 cm similar to the previous case when x 0 increases from 30 cm to 60 cm peak concentration decreases significantly while arrival time increases except for fig 4a where depth equals to 10 cm this is because average reaction coefficients of mm fd increased with x 0 which further accelerates the reaction process accordingly 3 2 effects of depth dependent reaction coefficients in this subsection the breakthrough curves generated by the mm fc and mm fd were compared to illustrate the effects of depth dependent reaction coefficients on solute transport in finite porous soil medium the parameter values for the simulations are summarized in table 1 fig 5 shows the comparison of the btcs at different observation depths x 60 cm and x 120 cm between mm fd and mm fc the values of x 0 are 30 cm and 60 cm in fig 5a and b respectively two sets of constant reaction coefficients were used in the mm fc one is the reaction coefficient in the topsoil k d k 0 μ μ 0 while the second is the reaction coefficient at the observed depth k d k dx μ μ x fig 5 left shows that the btcs of the three models as presented all exhibit two distinct peaks the btc of the mm fc with k 0 and μ 0 shows the late arrival of the peak concentration as well as the smallest peak concentration in the process in contrast the mm fc with k dx and μ x exhibits earliest arrival of the peak concentration as well as the highest peak concentration in the same process however the btcs of the mm fd lie in the transition zone of the above two cases due to its domain average reaction coefficients between k dx μx and k 0 μ 0 comparing fig 5a and 5b when the value of x 0 increases from 30 cm to 60 cm the peak value of the btc obtained from the mm fd decreases remarkably while their arrival times increases as the adsorption coefficient and degradation rate increases with x 0 in fig 5 right similar results were observed from btcs at x 120 cm however one significant point should be noted there is almost no difference between the btcs of the mm fc with k dx and μ x at x 120 cm for x 0 30 cm and 60 cm this is because reaction process at this soil depth is negligible 4 application of the proposed model to test the practical application of the new model the mm fd was applied to a field herbicide and trace leaching experiment in north east greece 41 37 n 26 21 e conducted by vryzas et al 2012a b over the past thirty years economic crops such as maize sugar beet and cotton where planted in rotation in the field undamaged soil cores were sampled to obtain chemical and physical properties of soil from the field the experiment was performed during the maize planting season between 2000 and 2003 potassium bromide kbr was applied 22 g m2 as a tracer for herbicide transport before the first herbicide application in each planting season in addition three cluster of suction cups were installed in the field and each cluster consisted of five suction cups placed at five different depths a total of 1900 samplers were installed at 35 cm 60 cm 100 cm and 160 cm respectively consequently 53 sampling events were collected from all the sampling depths and analyzed to determine the herbicide and tracer concentration more detailed information about this experiment can be found in vryzas et al 2012a b the same experiment data was also used by gao et al 2013 to test the model one dimensional advection dispersion model in finite porous media with depth dependent reaction coefficients hereafter the model is called ade fd in his simulation the evolution of the herbicide concentration at the top soil is captured well by the ade fd model unfortunately the simulation results at greater depths are unsatisfactory to explain the poor performance of the ade fd in deep soil the effect of preferential flow created by plant roots soil cracks and earthworms has to be considered this explanation has been verified by tracer experiment using brilliant blue fcf performed by vryzas et al 2012a hence for those experiments the preferential flow may easily occur which can be used to test our mm fd model table 2 presents the soil properties obtained from vryzas et al 2007 2012a both the adsorption coefficient and degradation rate of herbicide metolachlor are understood to decrease with the soil depth the relationship between reaction coefficient and soil depth are well represented by a sigmoidal function verified by gao et al 2013 the fitted k 0 and x 0 with eq 6 for the adsorption coefficient were 1 113 l kg and 66 56 cm respectively the fitted μ 0 and x 0 with eq 7 for the degradation rate are 0 0137 d 1 and 91 60 cm respectively in order to obtain the transport parameters v 1 v 2 and d 1 and d 2 the concentration of bromide conservation solute were fitted with the mobile mobile model with no reaction process therefore with the obtained determined reaction parameters k 0 μ 0 and x 0 and transport parameters v 1 v 2 and d 1 and d 2 the new mm fd model was used to predict the herbicide metolachlor concentration at different soil depths furthermore the coefficient of determination r 2 was used as a criteria to establish the goodness of the simulation expressed as 13 r 2 1 i 1 n c obs i c sim i 2 i 1 n c obs i c obs 2 where ci obs and c i sim are the observed and simulated concentration of ith sample data μg l respectively c obs is the average of all samples n is the number of observation concentration data fig 6 shows the bromide concentrations simulated by the mm and ade gao et al 2013 with no reaction process at soil depths of 35 cm and 100 cm it can be observed that both the ade and mm can describe the evolution of bromide concentrations at the depth of 35 cm see fig 6a the result is supported by r 2 values of 0 912 and 0 956 respectively in spite of this mm describes the evolution even better during the later period of observation results from ade and the mm model applied at considerable soil depth shows very positive results as presented in fig 6b with an r 2 value of 0 624 and 0 903 respectively the herbicide metolachlor concentrations simulated by the ade fd and mm fd models at soil depths of 35 cm and 100 cm are shown in fig 7 similar to the btcs of bromide both the ade fd and mm fd models satisfactorily capture the evolution of the herbicide metolachlar concentrations with the r 2 values of 0 8902 and 0 968 respectively once again the results described by the mm fd model are noted to be better than that of the ade fd model also the ade fd model only fairly captures the evolution of herbicide metolachlor concentration at soil depth of 100 cm with an r 2 value is of just 0 576 the ade fd model provides a late arrival time and small peak values compared to measured ones see fig 7b in contrast mm fd model efficiently describes the evolution of the herbicide metolachlor concentration at this 100 cm soil depth with an r 2 value of 0 952 the above simulation results suggest that ade fd model proposed by gao et al 2013 can describe the evolution of herbicide metolachlor concentration at the topsoil but is not suitable at considerable soil depths however the newly proposed mm fd model satisfactorily describes the btcs of herbicide metolachlor concentration both at upper and considerably lower soil depths of over 100 cm consequently we posit that the mm fd model can effectively describe the transportation of two different concentrations with depth dependent reaction coefficients which is usually defined by preferential flow similarly the disparity in concentration caused by different velocities increases with depth this leads to a concentration of bromide and herbicide which are difficult to characterize by traditional ade at greater depth 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a novel mobile mobile model mm which considers both dual permeability structure and depth dependent reaction processes and also assessed the impact of velocity volume and depth variable reaction coefficients on contaminant transport in soil porous media the btcs from mobile mobile model with different mass exchange coefficients as well as different velocity were compared to investigate the influence of soil structure on contaminants transport behavior in finite porous media the simulated results indicate that the value of mass exchange coefficient depends on the peak concentration as well as the number and shape of concentration peaks it should be noted that when the value of exchange transfer coefficient is large enough the btcs simulated by the mm fd tend to take the shape obtained by simple single ade fd the investigation of flow velocity and volume indicate that the velocity of the main flow determines the shape of the btcs while the velocity of svd dominates the pattern of the dual peaks in btcs which also tends to represent a single peak when the velocity of svd is small in addition the contrast between the two peaks increases with soil depth to illustrate the impact of depth dependent coefficient on the pollutant transport behavior the btcs simulated by mobile mobile model with depth dependency and constant adsorption coefficients as well as degradation rate were compared the simulation results for depth dependency were found to lie in the transition zone of the two former cases indicating that the reaction coefficients are that of the topsoil and observation depth point respectively the developed mm fd model was applied to the field herbicide and trace leaching experiment in north east greece the simulation results showed that the proposed mobile mobile model with depth dependent reaction coefficients is able to effectively capture the evolution of metolachlor concentration both in upper and lower depths it appears that the proposed mm fd model can practically model preferential flow while also factoring depth dependent reaction coefficient the numerical solution developed in this study can serve as a useful tool for predicting soil pollution risk in especially vulnerable areas where large use of pesticides and herbicides is prevalent acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the national natural

6206,in this study we developed a one dimensional mobile mobile model mm for contaminant transport in subsurface with depth dependent reaction coefficients two local systems at micro scale level are involved in this model a micro pore system and a less permeable pore system the breakthrough curves btcs obtained from the mm with depth dependent coefficients were thoroughly analyzed where the case with constant coefficients was used as the reference system the effects of different parameters on btcs were studied and a parameter analysis was also performed to illustrate the effects of adsorption coefficient and degradation coefficient on btcs results show that the btc patterns for the depth dependent reactions in which the reaction rate decreases with increasing depth vary between the two extreme cases with constant rate reactions in the topsoil and observation depth the mass transfer coefficient α plays a significant role in defining the btc pattern the double peak changes to a single peak when the value of α is large enough in addition the velocity of the main flow determines the shape of the btcs while the velocity of the svd defines the pattern of the dual peaks in btcs which also tends to be represented by a single peak as the velocity decreases finally we tested the applicability of the proposed model mm fd in the leaching experiments of both field herbicide and conservative tracer in an agricultural area of northeastern greece and compared its performance with that of the advection dispersion equation ade model by gao et al 2013 both of which have depth dependent coefficients the results showed that the proposed mobile mobile model with depth dependent reaction coefficients was able to satisfactorily capture the evolution of metolachlor concentration both at upper and lower depths keywords solute transport dual permeability mobile mobile model depth dependent 1 introduction the fate of contaminants such as pesticide in subsurface is of great interest owing to growing concerns over the environment and human health e g groundwater quality the prediction of pollutant concentration within the soil matrix is significantly important to minimizing the risk and vulnerability of aquifers furthermore the accuracy of the predicted model is crucial to adequately assessing and forecasting the contaminant transport behavior in subsurface over the past few decades several models have been developed by researchers to address specific objectives serrano 2001 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 yeh et al 2008 robinson et al 2012 li et al 2018 for instance serrano 2001 proposed a solute transport model which considers non linear sorption and decay vanderborght and vereecken 2007 developed a model coupling depth dependent dispersion sorption and decay however yeh et al 2008 suggested that the besides biodegradation the regime of flow should be considered when researching chlorine concentration decay in pipes it is now well established that both physical and reaction processes which influence pollutant transport in soil media should be adequately addressed in solute transport modeling porous media often contain different pore or flow domain due to aggregation fracturing earthworm burrows channels of decayed roots or drying cracks in swelling clay soils hartge and stewart 1995 these macro pore affect flow and solute transport at microscopic level by producing non uniform flow fields with different flow velocities hendrickx and flury 2001 reported that flow in this type of media may generate irregular patterns and non uniform flow will result in spatial dynamic instabilities of the wetting front during infiltration furthermore water moves faster along with solute in such preferential paths of the soil than that in the matrix of the soil such phenomenon is often referred to as non equilibrium flow and transport or preferential flow beven 1991 to describe non equilibrium flow in porous media several multi domain models have been developed coats and smith 1964 first developed a conceptual model considering dead end pores in porous media later the concept of mobile immobile model subsequently denoted as mim model was developed by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 to analyze the breakthrough data in aggregated soils from then on the mim model has been commonly used to describe non equilibrium flow and transport process in heterogeneous porous media charbeneau 1984 germann 1985 liu et al 2007 tyukhova and willmann 2016 this model is very effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves duiguid and lee 1977 gerke and genuchten 1993 ray et al 1997 vogel et al 2000 however the mim model only allows flow in a so called mobile domain and diffusive transfer between the mobile and immobile regions which can be described by fick s equation van genuchten and dalton 1986 or a first order rate equation selim 1998 therefore it is significantly hard for the mim model to resolve the scenario that allows flow in both inter aggregate and intra aggregate pore domains to deal with this dilemma the mobile mobile model was proposed by leij et al 2012 who assumed a different pore water velocity for the two domains and obtained an analytical solution for solute transport in porous media with different non zero flow rate in two distinct pore domains with first order solute transfer between them this model constitutes a generalized version of the advection dispersion equation ade for transport in uniform media as well as the mobile immobile model mim in media with mobile and immobile domains the concept of dual permeability was further supported by experiments carried out in volcanic ash soil with a distinct inter aggregate and intra aggregate porosity sciortino et al 2015 besides the physical characteristics of soil the fate and transport of pollutant are strongly affected by reaction process in the soil water system bouma and dekker 1978 hatano et al 1988 the reaction and adsorption processes in soils are often related to the amount and type of organic matter soil component and microbial activity it has been reported that the above factors are strongly depth dependent flury et al 1998 for example soil organic content has strong influence on both the movement and decay of chemical process generally the concentration of organic matter decreases with depth where the highest concentration can be found in the topsoil due to the degradation of plants on the surface it is the main source of organic matter near the soil surface as the content of organic carbon decreases significantly with depth paul and clark 1996 ray et al 2004 gao et al 2013 in addition soil clay mineral composition also affects the process of adsorption particularly in soils with low organic matter content many studies found that inorganic pollutants such as cu zn can be strongly adsorbed by clay si et al 2010 xie et al 2018 both the content of organic matter and clay minerals contribute to the decrease of pollutant adsorption relative to soil depth vryzas et al 2007 similar trend was exhibited for microbial activities which are common near the soil surface but decrease with depth vryzas et al 2012a this leads to higher degradation rate of pollutants at the upper profile of soils compared to degradation rates at deeper profiles paul and clark 1996 ramos et al 2000 consequently there is a strong correlation between depth dependent reaction process and the fate of contaminants in soil media hence for transport models that characterize contaminant migration it becomes necessary to consider depth variability for the reaction processes flury et al 1998 observed that the spatial variability of reaction process is usually assumed to be described by a stochastic or deterministic function of space or distance the stochastic method assumes the change of reaction coefficients as the stationary process with constant mean and variance chrysikopoulos et al 1990 loll and moldrup 2000 or that the process is correlated with the random hydraulic conductivity field shapiro and cvetkovic 1990 miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 it is worth stating that one of the advantages of the stochastic approach is that it provides the uncertainty associated with the mean prediction to decrease the uncertainty in prediction large site specific data are needed which is often too costly gao et al 2013 compared to stochastic approaches the deterministic methods are more practical and effective for example vanderborght and vereecken 2007 treated the soil profile as a layered system and assumed each layer has a constant reaction coefficient flury et al 1998 described the depth dependent reaction coefficients by using a sigmoidal function and incorporated them to the solute transport governing equations a careful review of the literature shows that both the structure of the soil media as well as the depth dependent reaction processes play an important role in predicting contaminant transport in soil to our knowledge there is no research on pollutant transport problems that considers different velocity fields and spatial variable reaction coefficients yet therefore the objective of this study is to present a novel mobile mobile model that considers both the dual permeability structure and depth dependent reaction process and assess the impact of velocity volume and variable reaction coefficients on contaminant transport in porous media 2 problem statement and mathematical model 2 1 governing equations this study considers a problem of solute transport in the vertical direction which can be described with two overlapping domains fast velocity domain fvd and slow velocity domain svd with depth dependent reaction coefficient and a linear kinetic mass transfer term between the two domains the solute adsorption is described by a liner isotherm while solute degradation is assumed to be a first order process the governing equations for this solute transport problem are expressed as follows 1 θ f r x f c f t θ f d f 2 c f x 2 θ f v f c f x θ f μ x c f α c s c f 2 θ s r x s c s t θ s d s 2 c s x 2 θ s v s c s x θ s μ x c s α c f c s where θf and θs are the volumetric water contents l3l 3 the total volumetric water content θ θf θs cf and cs are concentrations ml 3 df and ds are dispersion coefficients lt 2 vf and vs are pore water velocities lt 1 α is an effective first order rate coefficient between the aqueous regions t 1 r x f and r x s are the depth dependent retardation factors μ x is the depth dependent degradation rate t 1 x is transport depth l t is time t the subscript f and s denote fast velocity domain and slow velocity domain respectively the retardation factor is defined as 3 r x f s 1 ρ k d x f s θ f s where ρ is the soil bulk density ml 3 kd x f s is the depth dependent adsorption coefficients l3m 1 for the solute chemical fertilizer and herbicides considered in this study adsorption is considered as the major process compared to absorption therefore the absorption process is ignored here df and ds represent the dispersion coefficient of the fvd and svd l2t 1 respectively and it composed of mechanical dispersion and molecule diffusion which can be expressed as 4 d f λ f v f d 0 5 d s λ s v s d 0 where λf and λs are the dispersivities in the fvd and svd l respectively d 0 is the effective diffusion coefficient in the two domains l2 t 1 the rate of both adsorption and degradation of solutes are often related to soil organic content chemical composition and microbial activity where organic content and microbial activity are strongly depth dependent generally depth contribution to organic matter and microbial activity has been found to be of a sigmoidal form the following functions adopted by flury et al 1998 are used here to represent spatially variable reaction 6 k d x k 0 cosh 2 x x 0 7 μ x μ 0 cosh 2 x x 0 where k 0 and μ 0 are the adsorption coefficient and degradation rate in the topsoil representing the maximum of kd x and μ x respectively the parameter x 0 is constant determining how fast the reactions diminish with increasing depth the value of reaction coefficients decrease faster for a given smaller value of x 0 when x 0 increases from zero to infinity the reaction coefficients vary between the two special cases of maximum values and zero eqs 6 and 7 have been validated by flury et al 1998 on the basis of a series of experimental data when the reaction coefficients are constant the above governing eqs 1 and 2 can be re written as 8 θ f r c f t θ f d f 2 c f

2 2 initial and boundary conditions this study considered solute transport in a finite system initially free of solute and a pulse input at the inlet which can be described with a first type or third type condition the initial and boundary conditions van genuchten and parker 1984 can be given as 10a c f s 0 t β λ f s c f s 0 t x m f s θ f s v f s δ t 10b c f s x 0 0 10c c f s x l t 0 where β is a dummy variable to represent a first type β 0 or third type β 1 inlet condition δ is the dirac delta function t 1 l is length of the spatial domain l if the total mass applied to the system is known the mass applied to each domain mf s can be referred from the porosity of that area m l 2 that is 11 m f s m θ f s θ the above governing equations for solute transport in finite medium with constant reactive coefficients and depth dependent reactive coefficient are hereinafter called the mm fc model mobile mobile model in finite domain with constant reactive coefficients and mm fd model mobile mobile model in finite domain with depth dependent reactive coefficients respectively 3 results and discussion the governing mobile mobile model in one dimension porous media with depth dependent reaction coefficients was solved using the finite difference method the details of discretization are shown in the appendix in order to test the accuracy of our model finding a benchmark solution is necessary for the solute transport ignoring the reaction process the analytical solution of leij et al 2012 for non reactive solute transport in one dimension media can be used as a benchmark another benchmark is the semi analytical solution by gao et al 2013 where the reaction coefficients vary with soil depth the proposed model in this study is a special case θf θs qf qs q 2 α of gao et al 2013 where the difference in flow velocities is not considered as for the analysis of the btcs such as that of effluent samples collected during the solute transport across both flow domains the solute concentration can be defined as 12 c e q f c f q s c s q with q f s θ i v i as the darcy velocity in the fast or slow domain lt 1 and the total darcy flow velocity can be given by q q f q s the comparison between the concentration of this model and the two benchmarks are shown in fig 1 the parameters used in fig 1 are as follows vf 10 cm d vs 1 25 cm d θf 0 1 θs 0 4 α 0 05 d 1 compared with leij et al 2012 vf 3 cm d vs 3 cm d θf 0 25 θs 0 25 α 109 d 1 compared with gao et al 2013 the rest of the parameters are show in table 1 obviously the compared results show that our numerical solution is sufficiently accurate and reliable 3 1 effect of mass exchange coefficient and velocity in this subsection the btcs generated by the above derived mm fd solutions were thoroughly analyzed to illustrate the effects of mass exchange coefficient and velocity on pollutant transport in finite porous media the parameter values for the simulations are summarized in table 1 for the mm fd model the mass exchange coefficient α is a critical factor it describes the process of reversible transfer between the two domains fig 2 shows the effect of rate coefficient on btcs obtained from mm fd where the value of α from a to c are 0 05 d 1 0 005 d 1 and 0 0005 d 1 respectively for decreased mass exchange coefficient α 0 0005 d 1 the concentration curve for fvd is skewed to the left the peak value decreases with decreasing α while the breakthrough curves gradually exhibit a bimodal distribution this is because there exists a wide concentration difference between the two domains with a small α value the double peak changes to a single peak when the value of α is large enough comparing fig 2 left and 2 right as x 0 increases from 30 cm to 60 cm the peak concentration of the btcs obtained from mm fd decreases significantly while the arrival time increased this is because the average reaction coefficients of mm fd increase with x 0 which leads to a concurrent acceleration of the reaction process the darcy flux represents the amount of water and dissolved solute that enters moves through and exits the domain it is determined by the permeability and bulk area of that domain with respect to the bulk area since darcy fluxes and water contents are expressed with respect to the total bulk area also the velocity of solute transport in a domain through the aqueous phase depends on its volumetric water content thus fig 3 exhibits the role of the darcy flux and volumetric water content in the breakthrough for a total darcy flux q 1 5 cm d and a total volumetric water content θ 0 5 when the main flow and solute transport qf 1 cm d occur in fvd with small transport area θf 0 05 there will be two distinct peaks a small peak value for fvd at early time and large peak value for svd at later time fig 3a fig 3b shows a case where the darcy flux remains as before but the water contents are equal θf θs 0 25 the value of the peak appears later while the first peak value is larger than the one in fig 3a whereas the situation in svd is opposite finally fig 3c shows a case where the main transport q s 1 cm d occur in svd in this case the double peak diminishes to a single peak this phenomenon indicates that the concentration of fvd may have little impact on the whole system under this circumstance it should also be noted that the pore water content controls the initial concentration distribution the btcs at three different observed points simulated by mm fd are shown in fig 4 at the shallowest point of 10 cm the arrival times of the peak for cf and cs are almost the same thus only one peak is observed for the breakthrough curve ce this is attributed to the small time difference between two domains such that the arrival time of both concentrations are almost the same similarly for the deeper layer the difference in arrival time widens gradually comparing the three figures from a to c it becomes apparent that the difference in arrival time for the peak value increases on the right side of fig 4 similar concentration changes trend between the btcs of mm fd with k dx and μ x at three different depth for x 0 30 cm and 60 cm similar to the previous case when x 0 increases from 30 cm to 60 cm peak concentration decreases significantly while arrival time increases except for fig 4a where depth equals to 10 cm this is because average reaction coefficients of mm fd increased with x 0 which further accelerates the reaction process accordingly 3 2 effects of depth dependent reaction coefficients in this subsection the breakthrough curves generated by the mm fc and mm fd were compared to illustrate the effects of depth dependent reaction coefficients on solute transport in finite porous soil medium the parameter values for the simulations are summarized in table 1 fig 5 shows the comparison of the btcs at different observation depths x 60 cm and x 120 cm between mm fd and mm fc the values of x 0 are 30 cm and 60 cm in fig 5a and b respectively two sets of constant reaction coefficients were used in the mm fc one is the reaction coefficient in the topsoil k d k 0 μ μ 0 while the second is the reaction coefficient at the observed depth k d k dx μ μ x fig 5 left shows that the btcs of the three models as presented all exhibit two distinct peaks the btc of the mm fc with k 0 and μ 0 shows the late arrival of the peak concentration as well as the smallest peak concentration in the process in contrast the mm fc with k dx and μ x exhibits earliest arrival of the peak concentration as well as the highest peak concentration in the same process however the btcs of the mm fd lie in the transition zone of the above two cases due to its domain average reaction coefficients between k dx μx and k 0 μ 0 comparing fig 5a and 5b when the value of x 0 increases from 30 cm to 60 cm the peak value of the btc obtained from the mm fd decreases remarkably while their arrival times increases as the adsorption coefficient and degradation rate increases with x 0 in fig 5 right similar results were observed from btcs at x 120 cm however one significant point should be noted there is almost no difference between the btcs of the mm fc with k dx and μ x at x 120 cm for x 0 30 cm and 60 cm this is because reaction process at this soil depth is negligible 4 application of the proposed model to test the practical application of the new model the mm fd was applied to a field herbicide and trace leaching experiment in north east greece 41 37 n 26 21 e conducted by vryzas et al 2012a b over the past thirty years economic crops such as maize sugar beet and cotton where planted in rotation in the field undamaged soil cores were sampled to obtain chemical and physical properties of soil from the field the experiment was performed during the maize planting season between 2000 and 2003 potassium bromide kbr was applied 22 g m2 as a tracer for herbicide transport before the first herbicide application in each planting season in addition three cluster of suction cups were installed in the field and each cluster consisted of five suction cups placed at five different depths a total of 1900 samplers were installed at 35 cm 60 cm 100 cm and 160 cm respectively consequently 53 sampling events were collected from all the sampling depths and analyzed to determine the herbicide and tracer concentration more detailed information about this experiment can be found in vryzas et al 2012a b the same experiment data was also used by gao et al 2013 to test the model one dimensional advection dispersion model in finite porous media with depth dependent reaction coefficients hereafter the model is called ade fd in his simulation the evolution of the herbicide concentration at the top soil is captured well by the ade fd model unfortunately the simulation results at greater depths are unsatisfactory to explain the poor performance of the ade fd in deep soil the effect of preferential flow created by plant roots soil cracks and earthworms has to be considered this explanation has been verified by tracer experiment using brilliant blue fcf performed by vryzas et al 2012a hence for those experiments the preferential flow may easily occur which can be used to test our mm fd model table 2 presents the soil properties obtained from vryzas et al 2007 2012a both the adsorption coefficient and degradation rate of herbicide metolachlor are understood to decrease with the soil depth the relationship between reaction coefficient and soil depth are well represented by a sigmoidal function verified by gao et al 2013 the fitted k 0 and x 0 with eq 6 for the adsorption coefficient were 1 113 l kg and 66 56 cm respectively the fitted μ 0 and x 0 with eq 7 for the degradation rate are 0 0137 d 1 and 91 60 cm respectively in order to obtain the transport parameters v 1 v 2 and d 1 and d 2 the concentration of bromide conservation solute were fitted with the mobile mobile model with no reaction process therefore with the obtained determined reaction parameters k 0 μ 0 and x 0 and transport parameters v 1 v 2 and d 1 and d 2 the new mm fd model was used to predict the herbicide metolachlor concentration at different soil depths furthermore the coefficient of determination r 2 was used as a criteria to establish the goodness of the simulation expressed as 13 r 2 1 i 1 n c obs i c sim i 2 i 1 n c obs i c obs 2 where ci obs and c i sim are the observed and simulated concentration of ith sample data μg l respectively c obs is the average of all samples n is the number of observation concentration data fig 6 shows the bromide concentrations simulated by the mm and ade gao et al 2013 with no reaction process at soil depths of 35 cm and 100 cm it can be observed that both the ade and mm can describe the evolution of bromide concentrations at the depth of 35 cm see fig 6a the result is supported by r 2 values of 0 912 and 0 956 respectively in spite of this mm describes the evolution even better during the later period of observation results from ade and the mm model applied at considerable soil depth shows very positive results as presented in fig 6b with an r 2 value of 0 624 and 0 903 respectively the herbicide metolachlor concentrations simulated by the ade fd and mm fd models at soil depths of 35 cm and 100 cm are shown in fig 7 similar to the btcs of bromide both the ade fd and mm fd models satisfactorily capture the evolution of the herbicide metolachlar concentrations with the r 2 values of 0 8902 and 0 968 respectively once again the results described by the mm fd model are noted to be better than that of the ade fd model also the ade fd model only fairly captures the evolution of herbicide metolachlor concentration at soil depth of 100 cm with an r 2 value is of just 0 576 the ade fd model provides a late arrival time and small peak values compared to measured ones see fig 7b in contrast mm fd model efficiently describes the evolution of the herbicide metolachlor concentration at this 100 cm soil depth with an r 2 value of 0 952 the above simulation results suggest that ade fd model proposed by gao et al 2013 can describe the evolution of herbicide metolachlor concentration at the topsoil but is not suitable at considerable soil depths however the newly proposed mm fd model satisfactorily describes the btcs of herbicide metolachlor concentration both at upper and considerably lower soil depths of over 100 cm consequently we posit that the mm fd model can effectively describe the transportation of two different concentrations with depth dependent reaction coefficients which is usually defined by preferential flow similarly the disparity in concentration caused by different velocities increases with depth this leads to a concentration of bromide and herbicide which are difficult to characterize by traditional ade at greater depth 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a novel mobile mobile model mm which considers both dual permeability structure and depth dependent reaction processes and also assessed the impact of velocity volume and depth variable reaction coefficients on contaminant transport in soil porous media the btcs from mobile mobile model with different mass exchange coefficients as well as different velocity were compared to investigate the influence of soil structure on contaminants transport behavior in finite porous media the simulated results indicate that the value of mass exchange coefficient depends on the peak concentration as well as the number and shape of concentration peaks it should be noted that when the value of exchange transfer coefficient is large enough the btcs simulated by the mm fd tend to take the shape obtained by simple single ade fd the investigation of flow velocity and volume indicate that the velocity of the main flow determines the shape of the btcs while the velocity of svd dominates the pattern of the dual peaks in btcs which also tends to represent a single peak when the velocity of svd is small in addition the contrast between the two peaks increases with soil depth to illustrate the impact of depth dependent coefficient on the pollutant transport behavior the btcs simulated by mobile mobile model with depth dependency and constant adsorption coefficients as well as degradation rate were compared the simulation results for depth dependency were found to lie in the transition zone of the two former cases indicating that the reaction coefficients are that of the topsoil and observation depth point respectively the developed mm fd model was applied to the field herbicide and trace leaching experiment in north east greece the simulation results showed that the proposed mobile mobile model with depth dependent reaction coefficients is able to effectively capture the evolution of metolachlor concentration both in upper and lower depths it appears that the proposed mm fd model can practically model preferential flow while also factoring depth dependent reaction coefficient the numerical solution developed in this study can serve as a useful tool for predicting soil pollution risk in especially vulnerable areas where large use of pesticides and herbicides is prevalent acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the national natural

6207,mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica has been widely used in vegetation restoration and for windbreaks in sandy regions of northern china where water is the principal factor limiting tree survival and growth an understanding of water use in mongolian pine plantations is critical for effective vegetation restoration to determine water sources in a mongolian pine plantation we investigated the stable isotopic ratios of δ 18o and δd in precipitation groundwater in soil water in different soil layers and in tree xylem at different tree ages along a precipitation gradient and in different micro landforms the results indicated that the main water sources for mongolian pine were precipitation derived shallow soil water in semi humid regions and that the contribution proportion decreased with an increase in tree age with reduced precipitation in semi arid and arid regions contribution of deep soil water to mongolian pine water use gradually increased and differences in soil water contribution among trees due to tree age also significantly increased water use patterns in trees planted in different micro landforms e g sand dune crest or inter dune lowland became more distinct as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to semiarid and arid regions moreover mongolian pine including 15 20 25 and 45 year old trees similar height and dbh without groundwater in semi arid climate in ejin horo banner while trees planted in extremely arid climate linze relied on irrigation for survival despite abundant and available groundwater at that study site these results indicated that groundwater may be beyond reach to be a main water source for mongolian pine trees soil water conditions determined the survival and sustainable growth of planted trees especially at depths less than 1 m where soil layers were recharged mainly by precipitation although mongolian pine exhibits strong ecological adaptability a trait that makes it ideally suited for controlling desertification in sandy regions of northern china water stress crown dieback or even tree mortality are likely to occur under conditions of extremely low precipitation keywords mongolian pine plantation stable isotopes sandy soils asian summer monsoon precipitation water extraction depth 1 introduction precipitation is the main source of water in terrestrial ecosystems fundamentally affecting nearly all ecological processes ehleringer et al 2000 xu and li 2006 and exerting profound impacts on regional water balances and plant persistence nicotra et al 2010 grossiord et al 2017 in arid and semiarid areas plant survival and activity and the stability of ecological systems are tightly coupled to water availability precipitation often falls only sporadically and is subject to losses by evaporation surface runoff and groundwater soils in arid areas typically have limited capacity for storing plant available water chang 2012 gu et al 2016 in regions where evaporative demand exceeds precipitation and water tends to be unavailable in upper soil horizons in the dry season plants are likely to have deep roots and extract water from deep soil layers or from groundwater west et al 2007 nie et al 2012 thus the distribution of precipitation and the depth of groundwater level control the spatial pattern of soil water availability which plays a vital role in plant adaptation and vegetation composition variation in the use of water sources is critical for many tree species for meeting their water demands and canopy transpiration and carbon assimilation needs voltas et al 2015 grossiord et al 2017 it is generally agreed that the phenotype or architecture of root systems is one of the most important determinants of soil water availability for many plants sperry and hacke 2002 xu and li 2006 schwinning and ehleringer 2001 reported that where deeper soil water is a more important water source than pulse water such as in an arid environment with an occasional rainfall event root systems tend to adapt to maximize access to deep water sources trees often rely on access to deep water reservoirs eg subsoil water or groundwater to withstand seasonal droughts david et al 2007 barbeta et al 2015 otieno et al 2017 or water conditions that vary in space trogisch et al 2016 otieno et al 2017 the ability to change among main water sources has been linked with plant phenotypes especially the depth and distribution of functional roots soil characteristics and specific sites ehleringer and dawson 1992 voltas et al 2015 ontogenetic changes in water use patterns by trees occur because of the different external micro environment experienced by trees of different ages and sizes in arid and semiarid regions matzner et al 2003 song et al 2016 older trees have deeper roots that can access deeper water than young tree roots this allows old trees to avoid or minimize the effects of drought oliveira et al 2005 drake et al 2011 kerhoulas et al 2013 in fact water conditions play a critical role in shaping plant adaptation and water use strategies and in determining the compositions of plant communities one of the most important tree species for afforestation in sandy regions is mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica the species occurs naturally in the hulunbeier sandy plains 47 35 48 36 n 118 58 120 32 e located in the daxinganling mountains of northeastern china 50 10 53 33 n 121 11 127 10 e mongolian pine has high drought and cold resistance and tolerates poor soil quality it has been extensively introduced to enhance sand stabilization in northern china zhu et al 2008 song et al 2016 especially in the keerqin 42 11 45 41 n 119 15 123 43 e mu us 37 27 5 39 22 5 n 107 20 111 30 e and hexi sandland 39 19 39 28 n 100 07 100 21 e monocultures of this tree species in sandy regions have now reached more than 6 7 105 ha in northern china song et al 2016 where it tolerates a wide range of thermal and moisture conditions but the early mongolian pine plantations especially those in the zhanggutai region in the southeastern keerqin sandland experienced dieback and mortality zhu et al 2008 song et al 2014 multiple studies have reported that most of the dieback and mortality occurred at tree ages 30 to 35 years old and indicated that water deficit was the main reason zhu et al 2006 2008 song et al 2016 consequently a greater understanding of water use patterns of plantation trees over the course of their life cycle will support fundamental knowledge of tree ecophysiology and tree acclimation to arid and semi arid environments and increase the sustainability and long term stability of plantation ecosystems an analysis of the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water provides a powerful reliable and nondestructive method to determine differences in the sources of plant water within the soil profile voltas et al 2015 grossiord et al 2017 although many studies have examined variation in the use of water sources by plants in arid and semi arid environments xu and li 2006 brooks et al 2010 song et al 2016 the relevance of variation of water use with one plant species and across varying precipitation remains elusive xylem water and soil water isotopic composition at different depths can be used to determine the mean depth from which water in the plant originates given a sufficient gradient in soil water isotope value ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson et al 2002 grossiord et al 2017 previous studies have demonstrated that pinus sylvestris trees could maintain a relatively stable growth state rely on the ability to switch between sources of water under a seasonally drought environment and they reported that groundwater was the primary water source in years of extremely low rainfall song et al 2014 2016 pinus sylvestris including 16 20 and 40 years old trees is a shallow rooted species with about 65 of lateral roots in the surface soil and tap roots reaching to 1 5 2 5 m in sandy regions zhu et al 2008 this indicates that shallow soil water recharged by precipitation is critical for the growth of these pine trees wei et al 2013 therefore it is important to determine how the pine trees are related to precipitation variability and plant water sources we examined the variation in the depth of water uptake in a mongolian pine plantation in semi humid mean annual precipitation about 469 4 mm to extremely arid region mean annual precipitation about 116 8 mm for different tree ages and micro topography dune and inter dune in xylem water and soil water isotopic values we had the following objectives to determine the main water sources for pine trees at different ages and in varied micro topography to characterize changes in water sources across varying precipitation regimes to explore water use strategies of pine trees in relation to life history strategies and environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted across three typical sandy regions in northern china the keerqin the mu us and the hexi sandland which ranged in climate from semi humid to extremely arid fig 1 the keerqin sandland is located in northeastern china 42 11 to 45 41 n 119 15 to 123 43 e the mean altitude is 226 m a s l and this region ranges in climate from semi humid to semiarid from east to west annual precipitation

classified as aeolian sandy soil yang et al 2015 the hexi sandland is located at the southern edge of the badain jaran desert in northwestern china 39 19 to 39 28 n 100 07 to 100 21 e the area has an extremely arid temperate climate mean annual temperature is 7 6 c mean annual precipitation is 110 mm and over 80 of precipitation occurs between may and september mean annual pan water evaporation is

zhanggutai naiman yuling ejin horo banner yanchi and linze that spanned different micro topography tree ages and climatic conditions from semi humid to extremely arid table 1 2 the description of the study sites show in table1 the pine plantation stands are distributed both on the dune crest and in the inter dune lowland and the landscape pattern of dunes exhibited dendritic and honeycomb characteristics at each study site selected plantation stands were assigned to various age groups from young to old in each plantation stand three plots 100 m2 each were selected and three representative trees were selected in each plot these trees had similar diameter at breast height dbh 1 3 m and average tree height of each pine stand they were tagged for determination of the stable isotope composition of water the dune crest sites were 7 6 18 2 m higher in elevation than the inter dune lowland sites with the groundwater table for the dune crest higher than for the inter dune lowland table 2 except at the yanchi and linze sites where trees were planted in an artificial flat sandy region 2 2 sample collection plant and soil samples were obtained from each site from 26 july to 27 august tree samples were taken between 08 00 and 11 00 h solar time from healthy tree branches after removing the phloem five to 10 cm long branch sections were cut with clippers immediately placed in airtight vials sealed with a screw lid and parafilm wrap to avoid evaporation and stored in car refrigerator for transport to the laboratory concurrently with xylem sampling soil samples were obtained with a hand auger from 0 to 200 cm depth 50 cm away from the base of sample trees soil samples were collected at 10 cm intervals and separated into two subsamples the subsamples for stable isotope analyses were immediately double bagged in airtight vials transported in cool condition to the laboratory and refrigerated until water extraction the other subsamples were sealed in tin cups for measuring soil water content swc by the oven drying method we obtained precipitation data from the weather station near our study sites from the china meteorological data service center cmdc the precipitation samples were collected each time it rained in beakers placed outdoors during the summer of 2015 these samples were collected by the staff of the weather station near our study sites

june to august in 2015 was 338 1 240 8 220 229 4 166 4 and 64 mm for zhanggutai naiman yuling ejin horo banner yanchi and linze respectively these amounts accounted for 57 68 of the total annual precipitation at these sites the regions compared with each other summer precipitation gradually decreased with decreasing longitude from semi humid to extremely arid region fig 1 the areas differed significantly in δd δ 18o table 3 and the isotope values δd δ 18o were more enriched at the western than at the eastern sites there was also considerably less variability in δd δ 18o and d excess in the eastern than in the western areas fig 1 the δd value of precipitation ranged from 49 9 5 36 zhanggutai semi humid region to 34 27 8 18 linze extremely arid region the δ 18o value of precipitation

region reported values are mean se 3 2 isotopic composition of soil water groundwater and xylem water fig 2 shows linear relationships between δd and δ 18o in xylem water soil water and groundwater in different mongolian pine stands at each site soil water and xylem water fell below the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating some evaporation especially for the semi arid and arid regions vertical changes in soil water isotopes with increasing soil depth in semi arid and arid regions were much greater than the difference between soil depths in semi humid regions f value 102 8 for yanchi sample plots f value 29 2 for zhanggutai sample plots soil water isotope ratios decreased with depth in all plots in zhanggutai the change was from an average of 64 79 at 10 cm to 76 45 at 200 cm for δd and an average of 4 67 at 10 cm to 10 28 at 200 cm for δ 18o in yanchi the change was from an average of 39 16 at 10 cm to 63 75 at 200 cm for δd and an average of 1 95 at 10 cm to 8 56 at 200 cm for δ 18o isotope ratios of tree xylem water were similar to those of soil water fig 3 moreover δd and δ 18o of groundwater were similar to those of the lmwl indicating that groundwater and deep soil water did not reflect isotopic fractionation due to evaporation for most sampling sites soil water isotopic values δd δ 18o in shallow soil layers were consistently more enriched with the heavy isotope than those in deeper soil layers for both dune crest and inter dune sites fig 3 in shallow soil layers isotopic values of soil water were lowest δd 69 34 for dune crest 74 33 for inter dune areas δ 18o 5 81 for dune crest 8 73 for inter dune areas at the semi humid site zhanggutai and then gradually increased with decreasing longitude as the influence of precipitation weakened and reached a maximum 41 38 for δd and 2 98 for δ 18o in the artificial flat sandy region in the extremely arid region linze despite significant differences between shallow and deep soil layers in δd and δ 18o for most regions isotopic values were not significantly different among deep soil layers 100 150 and 150 200 cm for both dune crest and inter dune sites fig 3 soil water isotopic values varied significantly p 0 01 among soil layers at depths to 100 cm 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 50 50 80 80 100 cm especially for dune crest sites tree age and micro topography both affected xylem water isotopic values of mongolian pine trees but these effects were dependent on water conditions within region across all regions we found heavier δd and δ 18o values in young trees on dune crests than in older trees during the summer more specifically in the semi humid region zhanggutai there were no significant differences in isotopic values among trees of different ages on both dune crest and inter dune areas the δ 18o values of xylem water 8 87 to 7 44 for 60 year old 8 34 to 7 17 for 40 year old 8 20 to 7 43 for 15 year old and 8 91 to 7 01 for 8 year old trees respectively were similar to those of soil water at 0 30 cm depth fig 3 suggesting a higher reliance on superficial water sources in the semi arid and arid regions there were significant differences in the δ 18o values of xylem water between young and old trees especially on dune crest p 0 001 the values for young trees 7 74 to 5 93 for 15 year old in neiman 7 42 to 6 03 for 15 year old in ejin horo banner and 6 52 to 3 50 for 15 year old in yanchi were similar to soil water isotopic composition at 0 30 cm depth and for old trees 8 74 to 7 13 for 40 year old in neiman 9 27 to 7 01 for 45 year old in ejin horo banner and 8 68 to 6 13 for 15 year old in yanchi respectively they were similar to soil water isotopic composition at 30 50 cm depth 3 3 water sources of mongolian pine trees using isotopic values of xylem and soil water we found significant variability in the contribution of different water sources to mongolian pine trees differing in ages and in micro topography in semi humid semi arid and extremely arid regions fig 4 mixing models revealed that trees were able to extract water simultaneously from four water pools shallow middle deep soil layers and groundwater but in varying relative amounts depending on the amount of precipitation in the semi humid region there was a large contribution of the shallow soil layer 0 30 cm 62 54 8 46 4 49 4 for 8 15 40 and 60 year old trees respectively on both dune crest and inter dune areas but these proportions decreased as tree age increased in the semi arid region although the shallow soil water was also the main water source for the study trees the proportion taken up from the shallow soil water was significantly different between dune crest and inter dune areas for example at the yulin site shallow soil water contributed 49 4 47 4 and 33 respectively to the 18 30 and 50 year old trees on the dune crest and that was less than in inter dune areas eg 50 5 54 6 and 61 7 for 18 30 50 year old fig 4 by contrast trees took up a higher proportion of water originating from the lower soil layers middle and deep soil and even from the groundwater in the arid region the relative contribution of shallow soil layer to the 40 year old trees was 24 1 and 19 9 in yanchi and linze respectively but the groundwater contribution increased to 27 4 and 20 6 even for the 15 year old trees the shallow soil water contribution to xylem water was less than 40 at the yanchi site fig 5 4 discussion this study provides new insights into the variability in water sources of a widespread sand stabilizing woody species in response to water availability this is important because the critical issue of differences in water use patterns for plant species that are typical of sand fixing and drought prone environment such as the mongolian pine 4 1 precipitation and its effects on stable isotopes of soil water due to the effect of temperature precipitation amounts dansgaard 1964 j r liu et al 2014 w j liu et al 2014 yamanaka et al 2007 vapor sources air trajectories bhattacharya et al 2003 aggarwal et al 2004 and orographic terrain guan et al 2009 sinclair et al 2011 the isotopic values δd δ 18o of precipitation in this study exhibited significant variation among the regions fig 1 including the keerqin the mu us and the hexi sandlands overall the δd and δ 18o values increased along the pathway from semi humid to arid areas possible explanations may be the sub cloud kinetic fractionations of falling raindrops in drier atmospheric conditions or intense mixing effects with the recycled moisture from the surface of the earth zhang et al 2011 salamalikis et al 2016 re evaporated moisture is usually characterized by relatively high δd and δ 18o values in an arid semi arid region liu et al 2009 further the d excess values also showed significant differences among the regions these values fluctuated more and were lower in arid than in the semi arid region fig 1 due to the sub cloud processes and local surface moisture contribution precipitation isotope values gradually increased from semi humid region to extremely arid region guan et al 2013 the dual isotope plot presented in fig 2 a f represents an overview of the interactions of eco hydrological processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuous system isotopic ratios of soil water and plant xylem falling to the right of the lmwl indicate a strong kinetic isotope effect via the process of evaporation craig 1961 but it can t account for the variation along the line particularly for low isotope ratios in soil water at depth such as those that are lower than the annual average precipitation isotope ratio brooks et al 2010 moreover isotopic enrichment of the surface soil was affected by evaporation j r liu et al 2014 w j liu et al 2014 qian et al 2017 and was stronger in arid and semiarid regions than in semi humid regions deeper soil water was usually more depleted in heavy isotopes than shallow soil water collected at the same location fig 3 partly because of capillary movement of groundwater rezzoug et al 2004 containing light isotopes and also because heavy rainfall especially in the semi humid regions enriched in light isotopes rapidly percolates into these layers wang et al 2010a b qian et al 2017 as evaporation from soil increases rapidly from semi humid regions to semiarid and arid regions plant water is obtained primarily by deeper roots as precipitation decreases as summer proceeds plants growing in more arid regions are able to take up deeper soil water sand dunes and inter dune areas have been shown to provide habitat heterogeneity and to profoundly influence the spatial distribution of soil water across the landscape grigg et al 2008 dai et al 2015 similar to these reports we found isotopic values of soil water in dune crest areas were more enriched than those in inter dune areas in mongolian pine plantations especially in shallow soil layers in semi arid and arid regions fig 3 soils of dune crests had greater wind erosion and evaporation than those of inter dune areas liu et al 2007 meanwhile with heavy rain most of the precipitation flows to the inter dune lowland in the form of runoff kidron 2011 wu et al 2012 this process permits a deterioration of soil water conditions at dune crests and formation of dry soil at the surface dai et al 2015 conversely inter dune lowlands may experience ponding in the rainy season while groundwater table is also high enough for recharge of soil moisture by capillary rising jansen et al 2001 liu et al 2007 hence soil water in dune crests is more easily isotopically enriched than that in the inter dune areas this is more pronounced in semi arid and in arid regions than in humid ones 4 2 variability in the source of xylem water along a precipitation gradient based on the isotopic composition xylem water represents a mixture of water sources absorbed by the plant ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson et al 2002 changes in isotopic composition of soil water by micro landforms have significant effects on isotopic compositions of xylem water in mongolian pine trees and this effect increases from semi humid to semi arid and arid regions mongolian pine trees experienced the highest rainfall and temperature in summer trees of different ages exhibited significantly different water sources during the measurement period from semi humid regions to semiarid and arid regions figs 3 4 for young trees eg 8 15 18 year old mongolian pine trees isotopic values of xylem water and the isosource results indicated that the main water sources were from precipitation derived shallow soil water and that the proportion of this contribution decreased as tree age increased fig 4a the differences in water sources indicated that adaptive variability in water uptake patterns existed among populations of mongolian pine trees when subjected to reduced precipitation across semi humid to arid regions the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater to mongolian pine trees gradually increased and the differences among tree ages also significantly increased fig 4b c d e f mongolian pine trees appear to be able to maintain the ability to increase the depth of water uptake across semi arid and arid environments these results support the common assumption that trees can increase their water uptake from deep pools eg deep soil water and groundwater as their age increases kerhoulas et al 2013 song et al 2016 and under conditions of soil water depletion mccole and stern 2007 grossiord et al 2017 for example song et al 2016 reported that 10 and 22 year old mongolian pine trees used soil water only during the two years of observation but the 32 and 42 year old trees utilized both soil water and groundwater grossiord et al 2017 found that juniper exhibited depleted xylem water isotopic values relative to ambient trees under reduced precipitation consistent with a higher reliance on deeper water sources as drought can reduce soil water content in a limited water environment williams et al 2010 we expected that the main water sources for trees were deep soils water or groundwater our results however indicated that in the arid region groundwater contributed less than 30 of the isotopic composition of xylem water and the main water sources for trees were shallow and mid soil water 0 100 cm even for adult trees eg 40 50 60 year old mongolian pine trees in summer this suggests that lowered precipitation and increased evaporative forces influence water uptake patterns of mongolian pine trees by reducing the proportion of shallow soil water used and increasing reliance on deeper soil water mongolian pine trees have difficulty using groundwater fig 4 soil and xylem water isotopic values δ 18o revealed that the main water source for mongolian pine trees in summer is the shallow soil layer figs 3 and 4 the distinct water use pattern of trees planted in different micro landforms eg sand dune crest or inter dune lowland became more noticeable as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to the semiarid and arid regions fig 4 in the semi humid region mongolian pine trees mainly used the shallow soil layer either at the sand dune crest or in the inter dune lowland although these two sites had 5 8 m elevation difference soil depth of 20 60 cm is the major rooting depth of mongolian pine trees zhu et al 2005 however when the upper soil water content decrease to a low level that become less available trees take up more deep soil water song et al 2016 in semi arid and arid regions sand dunes and inter dune areas exhibited different soil water conditions and trees differed significantly in their main water sources trees growing in the inter dune lowland utilized water mainly from the shallow soil layers however those growing on the dune crest used more mid and deep soil water several studies reported that trees in semiarid and arid ecosystems absorbed most of their water from the shallow soil layers under wet conditions and more water from deep water pools such as groundwater under dry conditions quesada et al 2008 nie et al 2012 song et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 in our study trees used water mainly from soil layers less than 1 m deep even if these trees had been planted on sand dunes in semi arid and arid regions with low amounts of recharge by precipitation fig 4 although groundwater represents a reliable water source in semi arid and arid regions mongolian pine trees were limited in their use of groundwater even if the trees were planted in the inter dune lowland with higher groundwater table than dune crest generally plant roots extract resources from shallow soil layers to minimize plant energy expenditure schenk and jackson 2005 and the most of tree species including mongolian pine trees have roots distributed mostly in the soil layers less than 1 m schenk and jackson 2002 zhu et al 2005 4 3 tree water use patterns and ecological adaptability mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica is a geographical variety of scots pine that is naturally distributed in northeastern china the species has a high cold and drought tolerance and has been widely introduced for vegetation restoration and windbreaks in the desertified sandy regions in northern china zhu et al 2006 however water is still the principal factor limiting this species survival and sustainable growth in this area zhu et al 2006 wei et al 2013 song et al 2016 it is generally believed that groundwater plays a critical role in shaping plant adaptation in water use strategies and has a direct effect on plant growth in semi arid and arid environments wang et al 2013 zolfaghar et al 2015 some studies reported that declining groundwater level resulted in a water stress in mongolian pine reduced live biomass and increased subsequent dieback and mortality song et al 2016 in fact plant rooting depth and distribution define the depth to which plants can potentially extract water ehleringer and dawson 1992 xu and li 2006 jiang et al 2002 reported that mongolian pine trees at 32 and 42 years of age had the maximum rooting depth to use groundwater as well as soil water however zhu et al 2005 found that approximately 98 roots of this species were distributed within the 0 to 1 0 m soil depth and only taproots reached several meters in depth thus the main water source of mongolian pine trees is limited to less than 1 0 m of soil depth which is mainly recharged by precipitation these findings were also supported by the results of isosource outputs for semi humid semi arid and arid sandy regions fig 4 although song et al 2016 reported that the contribution of groundwater to transpiration in mongolian pine trees increased with decreasing precipitation the very small proportion of the root system distributed in the deep soil layer or even reaching to groundwater table zhu et al 2005 may not supply enough water for tree transpiration we investigated a geographical structure in water uptake patterns of mongolian pine trees across most of their current range in plantation distribution in sand regions of northern china with a tendency for the trees in the eastern part to rely more on shallow soil water in summer than their western counterparts this may demonstrate ecotypic differences in the functional plasticity of root systems in these pine trees esteban et al 2010 voltas et al 2015 other studies on water sources in mongolian pine trees have detected a significant seasonal variation with groundwater as a main water source when precipitation decreased zhu et al 2005 song et al 2016 nonetheless our study showed that the main water source of mongolian pine trees came from the soil layers at less than 1 m depth and that too deep groundwater did not restrict the growth of the trees in ejin horo banner semi arid climate region soil water recharged by precipitation is the only water source for the mongolian pine trees at 15 to 45 years of age because the groundwater table deep reached to 200 m from which no plant can extract water for growth in linze extremely arid climate region soil water recharged by precipitation and river irrigation precipitation is so scarce that river irrigation can recharge soil water and meet the demands of tree growth in addition the trees have the ability to absorb some groundwater therefore the growth of mongolian pine trees is controlled by soil water conditions especially in soil layers less than 1 m in depth although mongolian pine trees exhibit strong ecological adaptability extremely low precipitation can predispose them to water stress crown dieback or even tree mortality 5 conclusions in this study we applied the dual stable isotopes of δ 18o and δd method to detect the variability in water sources for mongolian pine trees along a precipitation gradient from the northeastern semi humid to the northwestern arid regions in china although the species has high cold and drought tolerance and an ability to adjust its water sources to different soil depths soil water mainly recharged by precipitation is the critical factor controlling its survival and growth we concluded that the trees derived water in summer mainly from shallow soil in the semi humid region and could shift to deeper soil with a decrease in precipitation however less than 2 of the mongolian pine roots reach several meters in depth zhu et al 2005 restricting their water use from deep sources therefore precipitation determined tree survival and growth although at times groundwater can contribute nearly 30 of the water used by old mongolian pine trees we suggest that further plantations should consider the local precipitation inputs and that pine trees in the inter dune areas will have a higher survival rate declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors thank anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments on this manuscript this study was

6207,mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica has been widely used in vegetation restoration and for windbreaks in sandy regions of northern china where water is the principal factor limiting tree survival and growth an understanding of water use in mongolian pine plantations is critical for effective vegetation restoration to determine water sources in a mongolian pine plantation we investigated the stable isotopic ratios of δ 18o and δd in precipitation groundwater in soil water in different soil layers and in tree xylem at different tree ages along a precipitation gradient and in different micro landforms the results indicated that the main water sources for mongolian pine were precipitation derived shallow soil water in semi humid regions and that the contribution proportion decreased with an increase in tree age with reduced precipitation in semi arid and arid regions contribution of deep soil water to mongolian pine water use gradually increased and differences in soil water contribution among trees due to tree age also significantly increased water use patterns in trees planted in different micro landforms e g sand dune crest or inter dune lowland became more distinct as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to semiarid and arid regions moreover mongolian pine including 15 20 25 and 45 year old trees similar height and dbh without groundwater in semi arid climate in ejin horo banner while trees planted in extremely arid climate linze relied on irrigation for survival despite abundant and available groundwater at that study site these results indicated that groundwater may be beyond reach to be a main water source for mongolian pine trees soil water conditions determined the survival and sustainable growth of planted trees especially at depths less than 1 m where soil layers were recharged mainly by precipitation although mongolian pine exhibits strong ecological adaptability a trait that makes it ideally suited for controlling desertification in sandy regions of northern china water stress crown dieback or even tree mortality are likely to occur under conditions of extremely low precipitation keywords mongolian pine plantation stable isotopes sandy soils asian summer monsoon precipitation water extraction depth 1 introduction precipitation is the main source of water in terrestrial ecosystems fundamentally affecting nearly all ecological processes ehleringer et al 2000 xu and li 2006 and exerting profound impacts on regional water balances and plant persistence nicotra et al 2010 grossiord et al 2017 in arid and semiarid areas plant survival and activity and the stability of ecological systems are tightly coupled to water availability precipitation often falls only sporadically and is subject to losses by evaporation surface runoff and groundwater soils in arid areas typically have limited capacity for storing plant available water chang 2012 gu et al 2016 in regions where evaporative demand exceeds precipitation and water tends to be unavailable in upper soil horizons in the dry season plants are likely to have deep roots and extract water from deep soil layers or from groundwater west et al 2007 nie et al 2012 thus the distribution of precipitation and the depth of groundwater level control the spatial pattern of soil water availability which plays a vital role in plant adaptation and vegetation composition variation in the use of water sources is critical for many tree species for meeting their water demands and canopy transpiration and carbon assimilation needs voltas et al 2015 grossiord et al 2017 it is generally agreed that the phenotype or architecture of root systems is one of the most important determinants of soil water availability for many plants sperry and hacke 2002 xu and li 2006 schwinning and ehleringer 2001 reported that where deeper soil water is a more important water source than pulse water such as in an arid environment with an occasional rainfall event root systems tend to adapt to maximize access to deep water sources trees often rely on access to deep water reservoirs eg subsoil water or groundwater to withstand seasonal droughts david et al 2007 barbeta et al 2015 otieno et al 2017 or water conditions that vary in space trogisch et al 2016 otieno et al 2017 the ability to change among main water sources has been linked with plant phenotypes especially the depth and distribution of functional roots soil characteristics and specific sites ehleringer and dawson 1992 voltas et al 2015 ontogenetic changes in water use patterns by trees occur because of the different external micro environment experienced by trees of different ages and sizes in arid and semiarid regions matzner et al 2003 song et al 2016 older trees have deeper roots that can access deeper water than young tree roots this allows old trees to avoid or minimize the effects of drought oliveira et al 2005 drake et al 2011 kerhoulas et al 2013 in fact water conditions play a critical role in shaping plant adaptation and water use strategies and in determining the compositions of plant communities one of the most important tree species for afforestation in sandy regions is mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica the species occurs naturally in the hulunbeier sandy plains 47 35 48 36 n 118 58 120 32 e located in the daxinganling mountains of northeastern china 50 10 53 33 n 121 11 127 10 e mongolian pine has high drought and cold resistance and tolerates poor soil quality it has been extensively introduced to enhance sand stabilization in northern china zhu et al 2008 song et al 2016 especially in the keerqin 42 11 45 41 n 119 15 123 43 e mu us 37 27 5 39 22 5 n 107 20 111 30 e and hexi sandland 39 19 39 28 n 100 07 100 21 e monocultures of this tree species in sandy regions have now reached more than 6 7 105 ha in northern china song et al 2016 where it tolerates a wide range of thermal and moisture conditions but the early mongolian pine plantations especially those in the zhanggutai region in the southeastern keerqin sandland experienced dieback and mortality zhu et al 2008 song et al 2014 multiple studies have reported that most of the dieback and mortality occurred at tree ages 30 to 35 years old and indicated that water deficit was the main reason zhu et al 2006 2008 song et al 2016 consequently a greater understanding of water use patterns of plantation trees over the course of their life cycle will support fundamental knowledge of tree ecophysiology and tree acclimation to arid and semi arid environments and increase the sustainability and long term stability of plantation ecosystems an analysis of the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water provides a powerful reliable and nondestructive method to determine differences in the sources of plant water within the soil profile voltas et al 2015 grossiord et al 2017 although many studies have examined variation in the use of water sources by plants in arid and semi arid environments xu and li 2006 brooks et al 2010 song et al 2016 the relevance of variation of water use with one plant species and across varying precipitation remains elusive xylem water and soil water isotopic composition at different depths can be used to determine the mean depth from which water in the plant originates given a sufficient gradient in soil water isotope value ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson et al 2002 grossiord et al 2017 previous studies have demonstrated that pinus sylvestris trees could maintain a relatively stable growth state rely on the ability to switch between sources of water under a seasonally drought environment and they reported that groundwater was the primary water source in years of extremely low rainfall song et al 2014 2016 pinus sylvestris including 16 20 and 40 years old trees is a shallow rooted species with about 65 of lateral roots in the surface soil and tap roots reaching to 1 5 2 5 m in sandy regions zhu et al 2008 this indicates that shallow soil water recharged by precipitation is critical for the growth of these pine trees wei et al 2013 therefore it is important to determine how the pine trees are related to precipitation variability and plant water sources we examined the variation in the depth of water uptake in a mongolian pine plantation in semi humid mean annual precipitation about 469 4 mm to extremely arid region mean annual precipitation about 116 8 mm for different tree ages and micro topography dune and inter dune in xylem water and soil water isotopic values we had the following objectives to determine the main water sources for pine trees at different ages and in varied micro topography to characterize changes in water sources across varying precipitation regimes to explore water use strategies of pine trees in relation to life history strategies and environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted across three typical sandy regions in northern china the keerqin the mu us and the hexi sandland which ranged in climate from semi humid to extremely arid fig 1 the keerqin sandland is located in northeastern china 42 11 to 45 41 n 119 15 to 123 43 e the mean altitude is 226 m a s l and this region ranges in climate from semi humid to semiarid from east to west annual precipitation

mean pan evaporation is approximately 2000 mm the major soil type belongs to the semiaripsamment group which developed from sandy parent material through wind action zhu et al 2008 characteristics of

zhanggutai naiman yuling ejin horo banner yanchi and linze that spanned different micro topography tree ages and climatic conditions from semi humid to extremely arid table 1 2 the description of the study sites show in table1 the pine plantation stands are distributed both on the dune crest and in the inter dune lowland and the landscape pattern of dunes exhibited dendritic and honeycomb characteristics at each study site selected plantation stands were assigned to various age groups from young to old in each plantation stand three plots 100 m2 each were selected and three representative trees were selected in each plot these trees had similar diameter at breast height dbh 1 3 m and average tree height of each pine stand they were tagged for determination of the stable isotope composition of water the dune crest sites were 7 6 18 2 m higher in elevation than the inter dune lowland sites with the groundwater table for the dune crest higher than for the inter dune lowland table 2 except at the yanchi and linze sites where trees were planted in an artificial flat sandy region 2 2 sample collection plant and soil samples were obtained from each site from 26 july to 27 august tree samples were taken between 08 00 and 11 00 h solar time from healthy tree branches after removing the phloem five to 10 cm long branch sections were cut with clippers immediately placed in airtight vials sealed with a screw lid and parafilm wrap to avoid evaporation and stored in car refrigerator for transport to the laboratory concurrently with xylem sampling soil samples were obtained with a hand auger from 0 to 200 cm depth 50 cm away from the base of sample trees soil samples were collected at 10 cm intervals and separated into two subsamples the subsamples for stable isotope analyses were immediately double bagged in airtight vials transported in cool condition to the laboratory and refrigerated until water extraction the other subsamples were sealed in tin cups for measuring soil water content swc by the oven drying method we obtained precipitation data from the weather station near our study sites from the china meteorological data service center cmdc the precipitation samples were collected each time it rained in beakers placed outdoors during the summer of 2015 these samples were collected by the staff of the weather station near our study sites ground water samples were collected from a drilling well in each study site both precipitation and groundwater samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm filter immediately enclosed in glass vials wrapped in parafilm and refrigerated at 2 c until stable isotope analysis in september 2015 2 3 isotopic analyses water from xylem and soil samples was extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation system

los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa with repeatability precision of 0 1 for δ 18o and 0 3 for δd wei et al 2012 yang et al 2015 organic contaminants in water extracted from plant tissues interfere with the measurements of isotopic ratios of δ 18o and δd by the iris system therefore organic contaminants were identified and quantified with the spectral contamination post processing

al 2005 was used to quantify the contribution of different water sources to mongolian pine water use four potential sources of water including shallow mid and deep soil 0 30 30 100 and 100 200 cm and groundwater were considered in calculations of the relative contribution to the trees we assumed that there is no isotopic fractionation during plant water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson et

to analyze differences in soil water content swc and xylem water δ 18o values of trees among sites multiple comparisons of δ 18o values of soil water from individual soil layers were determined with

june to august in 2015 was 338 1 240 8 220 229 4 166 4 and 64 mm for zhanggutai naiman yuling ejin horo banner yanchi and linze respectively these amounts accounted for 57 68 of the total annual precipitation at these sites the regions compared with each other summer precipitation gradually decreased with decreasing longitude from semi humid to extremely arid region fig 1 the areas differed significantly in δd δ 18o table 3 and the isotope values δd δ 18o were more enriched at the western than at the eastern sites there was also considerably less variability in δd δ 18o and d excess in the eastern than in the western areas fig 1 the δd value of precipitation ranged from 49 9 5 36 zhanggutai semi humid region to 34 27 8 18 linze extremely arid region the δ 18o value of precipitation varied from 7 32 0 74 zhanggutai semi humid region to 4 69 1 23 linze extremely arid region the value of d excess varied from 8 71 1 18 zhanggutai semi humid region to 3 31 3 61 linze extremely arid region reported values are mean se 3 2 isotopic composition of soil water groundwater and xylem water fig 2 shows linear relationships between δd and δ 18o in xylem water soil water and groundwater in different mongolian pine stands at each site soil water and xylem water fell below the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating some evaporation especially for the semi arid and arid regions vertical changes in soil water isotopes with increasing soil depth in semi arid and arid regions were much greater than the difference between soil depths in semi humid regions f value 102 8 for yanchi sample plots f value 29 2 for zhanggutai sample plots soil water isotope ratios decreased with depth in all plots in zhanggutai the change was from an average of 64 79 at 10 cm to 76 45 at 200 cm for δd and an average of 4 67 at 10 cm to 10 28 at 200 cm for δ 18o in yanchi the change was from an average of 39 16 at 10 cm to 63 75 at 200 cm for δd and an average of 1 95 at 10 cm to 8 56 at 200 cm for δ 18o isotope ratios of tree xylem water were similar to those of soil water fig 3 moreover δd and δ 18o of groundwater were similar to those of the lmwl indicating that groundwater and deep soil water did not reflect isotopic fractionation due to evaporation for most sampling sites soil water isotopic values δd δ 18o in shallow soil layers were consistently more enriched with the heavy isotope than those in deeper soil layers for both dune crest and inter dune sites fig 3 in shallow soil layers isotopic values of soil water were lowest δd 69 34 for dune crest 74 33 for inter dune areas δ 18o 5 81 for dune crest 8 73 for inter dune areas at the semi humid site zhanggutai and then gradually increased with decreasing longitude as the influence of precipitation weakened and reached a maximum 41 38 for δd and 2 98 for δ 18o in the artificial flat sandy region in the extremely arid region linze despite significant differences between shallow and deep soil layers in δd and δ 18o for most regions isotopic values were not significantly different among deep soil layers 100 150 and 150 200 cm for both dune crest and inter dune sites fig 3 soil water isotopic values varied significantly p 0 01 among soil layers at depths to 100 cm 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 50 50 80 80 100 cm especially for dune crest sites tree age and micro topography both affected xylem water isotopic values of mongolian pine trees but these effects were dependent on water conditions within region across all regions we found heavier δd and δ 18o values in young trees on dune crests than in older trees during the summer more specifically in the semi humid region zhanggutai there were no significant differences in isotopic values among trees of different ages on both dune crest and inter dune areas the δ 18o values of xylem water 8 87 to 7 44 for 60 year old 8 34 to 7 17 for 40 year old 8 20 to 7 43 for 15 year old and 8 91 to 7 01 for 8 year old trees respectively were similar to those of soil water at 0 30 cm depth fig 3 suggesting a higher reliance on superficial water sources in the semi arid and arid regions there were significant differences in the δ 18o values of xylem water between young and old trees especially on dune crest p 0 001 the values for young trees 7 74 to 5 93 for 15 year old in neiman 7 42 to 6 03 for 15 year old in ejin horo banner and 6 52 to 3 50 for 15 year old in yanchi were similar to soil water isotopic composition at 0 30 cm depth and for old trees 8 74 to 7 13 for 40 year old in neiman 9 27 to 7 01 for 45 year old in ejin horo banner and 8 68 to 6 13 for 15 year old in yanchi respectively they were similar to soil water isotopic composition at 30 50 cm depth 3 3 water sources of mongolian pine trees using isotopic values of xylem and soil water we found significant variability in the contribution of different water sources to mongolian pine trees differing in ages and in micro topography in semi humid semi arid and extremely arid regions fig 4 mixing models revealed that trees were able to extract water simultaneously from four water pools shallow middle deep soil layers and groundwater but in varying relative amounts depending on the amount of precipitation in the semi humid region there was a large contribution of the shallow soil layer 0 30 cm 62 54 8 46 4 49 4 for 8 15 40 and 60 year old trees respectively on both dune crest and inter dune areas but these proportions decreased as tree age increased in the semi arid region although the shallow soil water was also the main water source for the study trees the proportion taken up from the shallow soil water was significantly different between dune crest and inter dune areas for example at the yulin site shallow soil water contributed 49 4 47 4 and 33 respectively to the 18 30 and 50 year old trees on the dune crest and that was less than in inter dune areas eg 50 5 54 6 and 61 7 for 18 30 50 year old fig 4 by contrast trees took up a higher proportion of water originating from the lower soil layers middle and deep soil and even from the groundwater in the arid region the relative contribution of shallow soil layer to the 40 year old trees was 24 1 and 19 9 in yanchi and linze respectively but the groundwater contribution increased to 27 4 and 20 6 even for the 15 year old trees the shallow soil water contribution to xylem water was less than 40 at the yanchi site fig 5 4 discussion this study provides new insights into the variability in water sources of a widespread sand stabilizing woody species in response to water availability this is important because the critical issue of differences in water use patterns for plant species that are typical of sand fixing and drought prone environment such as the mongolian pine 4 1 precipitation and its effects on stable isotopes of soil water due to the effect of temperature precipitation amounts dansgaard 1964 j r liu et al 2014 w j liu et al 2014 yamanaka et al 2007 vapor sources air trajectories bhattacharya et al 2003 aggarwal et al 2004 and orographic terrain guan et al 2009 sinclair et al 2011 the isotopic values δd δ 18o of precipitation in this study exhibited significant variation among the regions fig 1 including the keerqin the mu us and the hexi sandlands overall the δd and δ 18o values increased along the pathway from semi humid to arid areas possible explanations may be the sub cloud kinetic fractionations of falling raindrops in drier atmospheric conditions or intense mixing effects with the recycled moisture from the surface of the earth zhang et al 2011 salamalikis et al 2016 re evaporated moisture is usually characterized by relatively high δd and δ 18o values in an arid semi arid region liu et al 2009 further the d excess values also showed significant differences among the regions these values fluctuated more and were lower in arid than in the semi arid region fig 1 due to the sub cloud processes and local surface moisture contribution precipitation isotope values gradually increased from semi humid region to extremely arid region guan et al 2013 the dual isotope plot presented in fig 2 a f represents an overview of the interactions of eco hydrological processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuous system isotopic ratios of soil water and plant xylem falling to the right of the lmwl indicate a strong kinetic isotope effect via the process of evaporation craig 1961 but it can t account for the variation along the line particularly for low isotope ratios in soil water at depth such as those that are lower than the annual average precipitation isotope ratio brooks et al 2010 moreover isotopic enrichment of the surface soil was affected by evaporation j r liu et al 2014 w j liu et al 2014 qian et al 2017 and was stronger in arid and semiarid regions than in semi humid regions deeper soil water was usually more depleted in heavy isotopes than shallow soil water collected at the same location fig 3 partly because of capillary movement of groundwater rezzoug et al 2004 containing light isotopes and also because heavy rainfall especially in the semi humid regions enriched in light isotopes rapidly percolates into these layers wang et al 2010a b qian et al 2017 as evaporation from soil increases rapidly from semi humid regions to semiarid and arid regions plant water is obtained primarily by deeper roots as precipitation decreases as summer proceeds plants growing in more arid regions are able to take up deeper soil water sand dunes and inter dune areas have been shown to provide habitat heterogeneity and to profoundly influence the spatial distribution of soil water across the landscape grigg et al 2008 dai et al 2015 similar to these reports we found isotopic values of soil water in dune crest areas were more enriched than those in inter dune areas in mongolian pine plantations especially in shallow soil layers in semi arid and arid regions fig 3 soils of dune crests had greater wind erosion and evaporation than those of inter dune areas liu et al 2007 meanwhile with heavy rain most of the precipitation flows to the inter dune lowland in the form of runoff kidron 2011 wu et al 2012 this process permits a deterioration of soil water conditions at dune crests and formation of dry soil at the surface dai et al 2015 conversely inter dune lowlands may experience ponding in the rainy season while groundwater table is also high enough for recharge of soil moisture by capillary rising jansen et al 2001 liu et al 2007 hence soil water in dune crests is more easily isotopically enriched than that in the inter dune areas this is more pronounced in semi arid and in arid regions than in humid ones 4 2 variability in the source of xylem water along a precipitation gradient based on the isotopic composition xylem water represents a mixture of water sources absorbed by the plant ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson et al 2002 changes in isotopic composition of soil water by micro landforms have significant effects on isotopic compositions of xylem water in mongolian pine trees and this effect increases from semi humid to semi arid and arid regions mongolian pine trees experienced the highest rainfall and temperature in summer trees of different ages exhibited significantly different water sources during the measurement period from semi humid regions to semiarid and arid regions figs 3 4 for young trees eg 8 15 18 year old mongolian pine trees isotopic values of xylem water and the isosource results indicated that the main water sources were from precipitation derived shallow soil water and that the proportion of this contribution decreased as tree age increased fig 4a the differences in water sources indicated that adaptive variability in water uptake patterns existed among populations of mongolian pine trees when subjected to reduced precipitation across semi humid to arid regions the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater to mongolian pine trees gradually increased and the differences among tree ages also significantly increased fig 4b c d e f mongolian pine trees appear to be able to maintain the ability to increase the depth of water uptake across semi arid and arid environments these results support the common assumption that trees can increase their water uptake from deep pools eg deep soil water and groundwater as their age increases kerhoulas et al 2013 song et al 2016 and under conditions of soil water depletion mccole and stern 2007 grossiord et al 2017 for example song et al 2016 reported that 10 and 22 year old mongolian pine trees used soil water only during the two years of observation but the 32 and 42 year old trees utilized both soil water and groundwater grossiord et al 2017 found that juniper exhibited depleted xylem water isotopic values relative to ambient trees under reduced precipitation consistent with a higher reliance on deeper water sources as drought can reduce soil water content in a limited water environment williams et al 2010 we expected that the main water sources for trees were deep soils water or groundwater our results however indicated that in the arid region groundwater contributed less than 30 of the isotopic composition of xylem water and the main water sources for trees were shallow and mid soil water 0 100 cm even for adult trees eg 40 50 60 year old mongolian pine trees in summer this suggests that lowered precipitation and increased evaporative forces influence water uptake patterns of mongolian pine trees by reducing the proportion of shallow soil water used and increasing reliance on deeper soil water mongolian pine trees have difficulty using groundwater fig 4 soil and xylem water isotopic values δ 18o revealed that the main water source for mongolian pine trees in summer is the shallow soil layer figs 3 and 4 the distinct water use pattern of trees planted in different micro landforms eg sand dune crest or inter dune lowland became more noticeable as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to the semiarid and arid regions fig 4 in the semi humid region mongolian pine trees mainly used the shallow soil layer either at the sand dune crest or in the inter dune lowland although these two sites had 5 8 m elevation difference soil depth of 20 60 cm is the major rooting depth of mongolian pine trees zhu et al 2005 however when the upper soil water content decrease to a low level that become less available trees take up more deep soil water song et al 2016 in semi arid and arid regions sand dunes and inter dune areas exhibited different soil water conditions and trees differed significantly in their main water sources trees growing in the inter dune lowland utilized water mainly from the shallow soil layers however those growing on the dune crest used more mid and deep soil water several studies reported that trees in semiarid and arid ecosystems absorbed most of their water from the shallow soil layers under wet conditions and more water from deep water pools such as groundwater under dry conditions quesada et al 2008 nie et al 2012 song et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 in our study trees used water mainly from soil layers less than 1 m deep even if these trees had been planted on sand dunes in semi arid and arid regions with low amounts of recharge by precipitation fig 4 although groundwater represents a reliable water source in semi arid and arid regions mongolian pine trees were limited in their use of groundwater even if the trees were planted in the inter dune lowland with higher groundwater table than dune crest generally plant roots extract resources from shallow soil layers to minimize plant energy expenditure schenk and jackson 2005 and the most of tree species including mongolian pine trees have roots distributed mostly in the soil layers less than 1 m schenk and jackson 2002 zhu et al 2005 4 3 tree water use patterns and ecological adaptability mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica is a geographical variety of scots pine that is naturally distributed in northeastern china the species has a high cold and drought tolerance and has been widely introduced for vegetation restoration and windbreaks in the desertified sandy regions in northern china zhu et al 2006 however water is still the principal factor limiting this species survival and sustainable growth in this area zhu et al 2006 wei et al 2013 song et al 2016 it is generally believed that groundwater plays a critical role in shaping plant adaptation in water use strategies and has a direct effect on plant growth in semi arid and arid environments wang et al 2013 zolfaghar et al 2015 some studies reported that declining groundwater level resulted in a water stress in mongolian pine reduced live biomass and increased subsequent dieback and mortality song et al 2016 in fact plant rooting depth and distribution define the depth to which plants can potentially extract water ehleringer and dawson 1992 xu and li 2006 jiang et al 2002 reported that mongolian pine trees at 32 and 42 years of age had the maximum rooting depth to use groundwater as well as soil water however zhu et al 2005 found that approximately 98 roots of this species were distributed within the 0 to 1 0 m soil depth and only taproots reached several meters in depth thus the main water source of mongolian pine trees is limited to less than 1 0 m of soil depth which is mainly recharged by precipitation these findings were also supported by the results of isosource outputs for semi humid semi arid and arid sandy regions fig 4 although song et al 2016 reported that the contribution of groundwater to transpiration in mongolian pine trees increased with decreasing precipitation the very small proportion of the root system distributed in the deep soil layer or even reaching to groundwater table zhu et al 2005 may not supply enough water for tree transpiration we investigated a geographical structure in water uptake patterns of mongolian pine trees across most of their current range in plantation distribution in sand regions of northern china with a tendency for the trees in the eastern part to rely more on shallow soil water in summer than their western counterparts this may demonstrate ecotypic differences in the functional plasticity of root systems in these pine trees esteban et al 2010 voltas et al 2015 other studies on water sources in mongolian pine trees have detected a significant seasonal variation with groundwater as a main water source when precipitation decreased zhu et al 2005 song et al 2016 nonetheless our study showed that the main water source of mongolian pine trees came from the soil layers at less than 1 m depth and that too deep groundwater did not restrict the growth of the trees in ejin horo banner semi arid climate region soil water recharged by precipitation is the only water source for the mongolian pine trees at 15 to 45 years of age because the groundwater table deep reached to 200 m from which no plant can extract water for growth in linze extremely arid climate region soil water recharged by precipitation and river irrigation precipitation is so scarce that river irrigation can recharge soil water and meet the demands of tree growth in addition the trees have the ability to absorb some groundwater therefore the growth of mongolian pine trees is controlled by soil water conditions especially in soil layers less than 1 m in depth although mongolian pine trees exhibit strong ecological adaptability extremely low precipitation can predispose them to water stress crown dieback or even tree mortality 5 conclusions in this study we applied the dual stable isotopes of δ 18o and δd method to detect the variability in water sources for mongolian pine trees along a precipitation gradient from the northeastern semi humid to the northwestern arid regions in china although the species has high cold and drought tolerance and an ability to adjust its water sources to different soil depths soil water mainly recharged by precipitation is the critical factor controlling its survival and growth we concluded that the trees derived water in summer mainly from shallow soil in the semi humid region and could shift to deeper soil with a decrease in precipitation however less than 2 of the mongolian pine roots reach several meters in depth zhu et al 2005 restricting their water use from deep sources therefore precipitation determined tree survival and growth although at times groundwater can contribute nearly 30 of the water used by old mongolian pine trees we suggest that further plantations should consider the local precipitation inputs and that pine trees in the inter dune areas will have a higher survival rate declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors thank anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments on this manuscript this study was

6208,this study proposes a new method for downscaling actual evapotranspiration from resolution of 1 km to 30 m the disaggregation approach is performed using the jarvis model to simulate surface resistance which describes the restriction of vapor from land surface in the water exchange process without using land surface temperature data the integrated surface resistance model which takes climate indicators and canopy conditions into account is primarily validated using in situ observations and employed in the downscaling model with considerable accuracy covering an entire growing season april october in zhangye oasis good performance and good agreements between daily downscaled results and flux records from an ec eddy covariance tower have been obtained the coefficient of determination r2 ranges from 0 80 to 0 91 and the mean bias mb ranges from 0 17 to 0 72 the vegetation growth process is also captured well by the downscaled results the proposed method in this research performs better than downscaling approach based on land surface temperature the accurate validation results and detailed spatial patterns suggest that the proposed downscaling strategy is reliable for water resource management keywords evapotranspiration downscaling surface resistance daily water consumption water management 1 introduction currently large number of human being are suffering from water stress vörösmarty et al 2000 hameed et al 2019 water supply shortages play a direct role in the deterioration of economic conditions in some countries with arid and semi arid climates gleick 2013 thus a systematic water saving strategy is urgently needed traditional water management schemes have been demonstrated to be ineffective when faced with intensive human activity and supply of available water without considering water recycling as part of the whole system grafton 2017 perry 2011 evapotranspiration et is the summation of evaporation mainly from the soil and transpiration from canopy level plants and constitutes a dominant proportion of actual water consumption of land surface et based water management projects for monitoring actual consumption have been proposed as a new type of approach across different applications from agriculture to ecology anderson et al 2012 gowda et al 2008 thevs et al 2015 but this technique requires adequate et information considering the heterogeneity of the land surface et measurements can be expanded from the site scale to the basin scale with the help of remote sensing rs technology rs based water research can provide estimates of surface conditions that vary spatially over short periods of time li et al 2013 with the help of diverse remote sensors and advanced data management systems gorelick et al 2017 more data can be involved to complement traditional hydrological research pekel et al 2016 because of the complexity of et models considering a method that can retrieve water consumption from a single data source seems impossible typical regional et simulation model requires remotely sensed land surface parameters spatial resolution usually consists with expected results combined with meteorological information from satellite or in situ observations to calculate the energy flux allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 2003 su 2002 timmermans et al 2007 among all the input parameters needed for et estimation which is based on energy balance land surface temperature lst is critical for describing the energy transformation process su 2002 the temperature gradient between land surface and boundary layer is indicative of the energy flux at the interface there are sensors with diverse spatiotemporal resolutions in service that can provide lst information for et estimation unfortunately finer spatial resolution images are usually associated with longer time intervals selecting adequate lst data sources is required to improve the success of energy balance based et monitoring singh et al 2014 one strategy to obtain gridded et data with a consistent high temporal resolution and a high spatial resolution is to combine rs data from diverse sensors with different resolutions studies have been performed on disaggregating low resolution lst data into higher resolution kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007 thus low resolution lst data in combination with other information like meteorological observation could be used to calculate higher resolution et bechtel et al 2012 bisquert et al 2016 zakšek and oštir 2012 additionally some studies have proposed methods for creating coarse et maps using different surface parameters directly a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm was used to disaggregate coarse et dataset into 30 m resolution with finer grids liu et al 2011 some researchers have employed the correlations among et map with different time intervals and spatial resolution to extend 30 m et map from a snapshot to a complete time series with the temporal information provided by modis hong et al 2011 singh et al 2014 spiliotopoulos et al 2013 methods mentioned above can be classified as a combination of et estimates with two spatial resolutions which could take the advantages from different rs images however surface et based on energy balance approach with a high spatial resolution are not always available especially during wet seasons due to the cloud contamination over rs images thus other rs indicators with 30 m grids could be used driving downscaling model research by ke suggests that et has high correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ke et al 2016 furthermore tan proposed a downscaling method based on the ndvi and historical ratios that could be obtained from a wider range of remote sensors like landsat and huanjing satellites tan et al 2017 disaggregating et using ndvi or other indicators can avoid the limitations associated with the lack of available high resolution lst images but may eliminate some high frequency signals hence the downscaling approach is usually performed with eight or ten day time intervals similar to the energy balance approaches estimating et by the penman monteith pm equation has exhibited good performance as well allen et al 1998 cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 mu et al 2007 researchers using this strategy have to employ surface resistance r sur as the driving indicator of evapotranspiration from land r sur is mainly affected by leaf conductance over vegetated areas and by soil conductance over bare land however transpiration through stomata during photosynthesis is a very complex process and is affected by many factors such as solar radiation air temperature and vapour pressure deficit vpd jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 some researchers have concentrated on the parameterization of leaf conductance and surface resistance a discount model of stomatal conductance reciprocal of stomatal resistance was first proposed by jarvis and this model assumes leaf stomatal is at the most active stage under a considerable environment with the maximum velocity of photosynthesis and thus transpiration jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 stomatal conductance will decrease with environmental deviation from the ideal conditions occurs the environmental parameters taken into account and the chosen parameterization strategy differ among researchers l et al 2004 oren et al 2010 ql et al 1997 xu and baldocchi 2003 compared to the jarvis approach of deviation from the ideal conditions the method proposed by leuning features a more specific consideration upon weakening of radiation by canopy leuning et al 2008 further parameterization and calibration of this model is needed as well a comparison and review of the diverse r sur simulation methods could be found in li et al 2015 song et al 2012 most r sur models can be applied over large range of earth surface with the help of rs images notably lst data are not always necessary for the estimation of et in some pm based et monitoring strategies considering the limitations of lst data and the good performance of the pm method based on surface resistance a new downscaling method of actual et is proposed in this paper to calculate daily surface resistance 30 m satellite images are employed based on the calculated results the 1 km etwatch dataset is then disaggregated to a resolution of 30 m since the validated good performance of the dataset in current research region wu et al 2016 in section 2 a detailed description of the research area and material contains a detailed description of etwatch is provided in section 3 the parameterization of surface resistance and the downscaling approach are described an evaluation and validation of the surface resistance model and downscaled et results are provided in section 4 discussion and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and materials 2 1 research area this research is conducted in the middle reach of the heihe basin a small oasis located in gansu province china the heihe river flows through three north western provinces and the catchment features several climate and topographic types the middle reach 98 57 100 52 e 38 39 39 59 n near zhangye city covers an area of approximately 3200 km2 after long term cultivation by local residents the area of intensely irrigated farmland in the oasis has remained stable over the years and the cultivated areas are surrounded by bare soil and sparse grassland due to the scarcity of water suppling approximately 110 mm of rainfall per year with annual average temperature of 7 c and a near 2000 mm of potential evapotranspiration small arbours rather than large forests are usually planted outside farmland as shelterbelts in summary the research area features a typical oasis under a semi arid climate the single growing season of vegetation in this region usually starts in april and ends in october due to the representativeness of the heihe basin a system of ground observations has been implemented for this region li et al 2013 2009 and includes many aspects of water resource management li and guo 2015 li et al 2016 data from four flux sites are used to validate the downscaled results in this study detailed information on the four sites can be found in table 1 a spatially distributed soil texture map has been obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao nachtergaele et al 2010 among which the daman site dm represents cropland with irrigation in the case of the research period maize the shidi site sd is located inside the zhangye national wetland park and features a wetland surface which is associated with a greater water supply than cropland the gebi site gb is located in sparse grassland near a small patch of farmland validation results at this site could reflect the performance and reliability of the downscaling approach when faced with heterogeneous region and mixing pixels the last site is the shenshawo site ssw which records flux data over a desert area without vegetation this site is taken into account for the purpose of validating surface resistance model under condition with sparse vegetation covering flux towers with supersonic anemometer csat3 and gas analyser li7500a could provide origin observation with 10 hz of frequency records are then processed into 30 min interval by eddypro liu et al 2016 the four sites are all equipped with an automatic weather stations aws to record routine weather parameters the positions of the flux sites and a land cover map are shown in fig 1 a relative position and dem digital elevation model map of the oasis could be referred to fig 1 b and c respectively which displays no obvious hills inside the oasis actually there is no slope with more than 15 in the region 2 2 etwatch data daily water consumption estimated by etwatch strategy is performed as et input with coarse grids in this research the model is a parameterized actual et simulation system that combines surface energy balance strategy sebs and the pm method at daily interval chen et al 2013 wu et al 2012 results of the system have been calibrated and validated under several climate types and the model has been demonstrated to produce reliable water consumption estimates for basin scale water management wu et al 2012 2016 approximately 90 cloud free modis images per year are used to estimate the instantaneous energy balance at the visiting snapshots by the residue approach covering entire heihe region which consider target latent heat flux as the residue of net radiation minus sensible heat flux and soil heat flux sensible heat at snapshots is calculated based on the temperature deficit between the land surface and the planet boundary layer at a certain height which is detected by feng method feng et al 2015 layered air temperature and pressure data are provided by gap filled mod07 atmospheric profile product with 5 km grids and daily temporal scale considering the vegetation growth topography and microscopic surface roughness an approach for estimating the integrated aerodynamic roughness length is employed during the simulation of air resistance xing et al 2014 energy fracture ef at modis snapshots which describes the ratio of latent heat flux against available energy from radiation is then calculated based on the proportion of energy balance components daily net radiation rn received by land surface is simulated by an approach which is similar with the method recommended by the fao 56 allen 1997 determined parameters of sunshine duration in the model which are calibrated for diverse cloud types and are provided by a geostationary meteorological satellite are used to estimate the daily sunshine hours wu et al 2017 the method for simulating the diurnal surface soil heat flux g is based on research from zhu et al 2014 instantaneous latent heat flux is then extended to the whole day scale with the help of ef since daily information about net income energy over the land surface is available an inverse pm equation is used to calculate the surface resistance during a clear day to obtain daily et with limited cloud free rs images a time series re construction approach that considers parameters that influence r sur is used wu et al 2016 during this step information of time series leaf area index vapour pressure deficit and soil moisture dynamics are used by a simplified expression of r sur wu et al 2012 xu et al 2018 daily water consumption is calculated based on routine meteorological observations all sub models mentioned above have exhibited high accuracies in the heihe basin overall correlation coefficient r2 of etwatch ranges from 0 86 at dm to 0 77 at ssw in 2013 2 3 satellite data rs data with a 30 m spatial resolution is employed in this research which covers the complete growing season from april to october of maize and other crops in the oasis since the spatial pattern of the canopy changes gradually one image per month can meet the requirements of the ndvi time series reconstruction landsat8 operational land imager oli images were downloaded from earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov only one image is needed to cover the whole research area path 133 and row 33 every 16 days unfortunately no images are available in august and september due to cloud contamination images from the huanjing satellite hj 1a and hj 1b which are available from the website of cresda china centre for resources satellite data and application are chosen as a substitute the hj images have the same spatial resolution as the landsat8 images 30 m but a shorter time interval 2 days research has been performed on the normalization of images from the two satellites zhong et al 2014 images from hj have been transformed into same coordinate system as those from landsat8 which means that the pixels from the two satellites represent the same surface area the detailed acquisition dates of the 30 m images are listed in table 2 in current research surface reflectance and ndvi map is required providing vegetation condition which is commonly used an integrated concept that contains growing status and vegetation phenology fensholt et al 2004 the 30 m snapshot images are then gap filled into daily series additionally 30 m land cover data sourced from rs images is produced by an object based method with a total accuracy of over 90 zhang et al 2014 the dataset is revised every 5 years countrywide and data from 2010 is used in the current research since the area of the cropland and grassland near zhangye city keeps unchangeable this time interval is reasonable according to the dataset cropland represents approximately 49 of the region and is surrounded by a large area of sparse grassland 32 and desert 9 in addition to artificial surfaces 7 forest 2 and water areas 1 represent small proportions under this semi arid climate due to intense evaporation 3 method there are three steps in the downscaling of daily et the daily surface resistance of the at 1 km resolution is first retrieved by the pm equation which is introduced in section 3 1 then daily 30 m surface resistance is estimated by the calibrated jarvis approach using 30 m rs images assuming the atmospheric indicators are stable inside a single pixel et distribution at 30 m resolution can be calculated using the downscaled 30 m surface resistance 3 1 calculation of coarse surface resistance surface resistance with a 1 km resolution is retrieved by inverting the pm method monteith 1965 1 λ e sa ρ c p e sat e a r a s γ 1 r sur r a where λ e mlm 2 day 1 is the latent heat flux s kpa c 1 is the slope of the curve relating saturated water vapour pressure to

vapour pressure at a certain temperature e a kpa is the actual water vapour pressure and r a sm 1 is the aerodynamic resistance the psychrometric constant γ is usually given as 0 665 10 3 p where p hpa is the atmospheric pressure the surface resistance r sur sm 1 is the integrated resistance of evapotranspiration between the land surface and the atmosphere which indicates the restriction upon the water vapor from all objects of land surface over a certain range monteith 1965 energy and water flux from the surface of the earth is usually hampered by the vegetation canopy and near surface atmospheric layers aerodynamic resistance r a sm 1 represents the resistance of the energy flux and water vapor transformation and is calculated following the method suggested by the fao allen et al 1998 2 r a ln z m d z 0 m ln z h d z 0 h k 2 u z where z m m is the height of the wind speed recorder z h m is the height of humidity recorder z 0 m m is the roughness length z 0 h is the roughness length governing the transfer of heat and vapour d is zero plane displacement height k is von kaman s constant and is usually set as 0 41 and u z ms 1 is the wind speed at height z z 0 m and d reflect the geometric roughness of the land surface and canopy during the transfer of energy z 0 m is usually expressed as a function of a constant 0 1 multiplied by canopy height which depends on the type and growing status of canopy zeng and wang 2006 chen et al 2013 maximum canopy height h c could refer to table 4 furthermore d can be estimated by an empirical expression such as the following equation colaizzi et al 2004 pereira et al 1999 3 d h 1 2 1 e 0 5 l a i lai z 0 m where h m is canopy height estimated by relative correlation with h c during this step routine meteorological observations wind speed air temperature and relative humidity are necessary as inputs the spatial distributions of a and r a can be simulated based on rs images among the strategies of r a calculation the method above is chosen in this research because rs based lst estimates are not necessary in this model liu et al 2007 after all the data are prepared inversion of the pm equation has been conducted to retrieve daily r sur since meteorological indicators and spatial distributed a and r a are all available as following eq 4 in which the parameters share the same units and meaning with eq 1 4 r sur sa ρ c p e sat e a r a λ e s γ 1 r a 3 2 parameterization of surface resistance at high resolution the simulation of high resolution surface resistance is based on 30 m rs parameters considering the contributions of different surface types inside one pixel the r sur of the land surface over every single pixel could be expressed by sub pixel objects as follows li et al 2009 5 r sur f 1 r s 1 f 2 r s 2 f 3 r s 3 where f n represents the area fraction of land cover type n and r s n is the surface resistance of land cover type n under most circumstances only the contributions from vegetation and soil are taken into account thus we can write the following 6 r sur f v r c 1 f v r soil where f v is vegetation coverage r c ms 1 is the resistance over the vegetation canopy and r soil is the resistance from the soil since we can consider every pixel is a mixture of vegetation and bare land r c and r soil describe the resistance during water vapor transfer for canopy and soil surface respectively r c is mainly affected by leaf stomata and leaf area while r c is influenced by soil particles and soil water content the fractional vegetation cover f v calculated from ndvi images can be retrieved by the following empirical equation 7 f v ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 the soil resistance r soil in eq 8 is simulated by a strategy similar to the discount model and involves considering the soil water content parameters for every soil type are suggested by ghilain et al 2014 and have been validated to perform well 8 r soil r soil m i n θ g θ wilt θ sat θ wilt 3 where r soil m i n ms 1 is the minimum soil resistance which is taken as 50 ms 1 θ sat m3m 3 is the saturated soil water holding capacity of a certain soil type and θ wilt m3m 3 is the wilt water content hu and jia 2015 θ g m3m 3 is actual soil moisture which is provided and interpolated using daily observations over 10 sites the parameterization strategy assumes that evaporation from the soil is highly correlated with the physical characteristics of soil particles which is displayed in table 3 chen and dudhia 2001 zhuang et al 2016 the jarvis approach has been used to simulate canopy resistance as follows noilhan and planton 1989 9 r c r c m i n lai f 1 1 f 2 1 f 3 4 where r c m i n ms 1 is the minimum leaf resistance indicating the maximum leaf conductance and transpiration velocity under ideal condition lai is the leaf area index which describes the leaf density of a given canopy and f 1 f 2 and f 3 are environmental indicators describing deviation from the ideal conditions notably song et al 2012 treats soil moisture sm as a climate factor in their model according to research by ma et al 2017 under the same climate type no significant relationship exists between r c and the soil water content once a minimum threshold is reached besides there is a strong correlation between canopy condition and water supply lai in the following equation could reflect the vegetation condition difference caused by sm finally we do not take the sm factor into consideration r c m i n represents the minimum leaf resistance largest conductance under ideal conditions as displayed in table 4 chen and dudhia 2001 lai can be retrieved using an empirical rs method f 1 reflects the influence of solar radiation which usually has a positive effect on transpiration sellers 1994 10 f 1 f r c m i n r c m a x 1 f where 11 f 0 55 r s r sl 2 lai and where r c m a x ms 1 is the maximum value of the leaf resistance which is relatively insensitive in the calculation and always set as a constant 5000 ms 1 r s wm 2 is the downward shortwave radiation and r sl is a scaling parameter and set to 100 wm 2 as a constant value a higher lai value represents a denser canopy which usually means more leaves and better use of solar energy 12 f 2 1 c v v p d f 2 is the factor describing the influence of the vpd where c v hpa 1 is an indicator of the response to vpd variation for diverse vegetation types a higher vpd value corresponds to greater drying power canopy resistance increases under dry conditions to avoid water loss parameterization of c v could also refer to table 4 the highest transpiration rates occur when the air temperature is high and the transpiration rate decreases with deviation from this condition factor f 3 represents the influence of temperature deviation on leaf resistance dickinson 1984 13 f 3 1 0 0016 298 t a 2 where t a k is the air temperature at the height of the canopy 3 3 downscaling strategy the overall water consumption of one coarse pixel e g with a resolution of 1 km grid should be the summation of the et contributed from every finer scale pixel inside it kustas and norman 2000 then we can write the mixing step as 14 λ e 1 k m λ e 30 m n given the assumption that atmospheric factors usually remain constant at the scale of 1 km r sur dominates the modelled et of every 30 m grids we can combine the eqs 1 and 14 as follows 15 rsur 1 k m rsur 30 m n the aim of the downscaling process in this research is to decompose rsur 1 k m into every single rsur 30 m grid without changing the total water consumption amount simulated with 1 km grids due to the inevitable differences between remote sensors a matching step is needed during the downscaling of r sur to guarantee that the summation of the downscaled rsur is the same as the original coarse rsur 1 k m which is similar to disalexi approach norman et al 2003 retrieved rsur 30 m data are then employed to disaggregate rsur 1 k m into every 30 m grids in this step pixels in high resolution image of surface parameters are matched to the coincident coarse pixel by making a linear slope adjustment to accommodate differences due to different sensor view angles uncertainties in sensor calibration and resistance models thus we can write the following equation 16 rsur downscaled rsur 1 k m rsur 30 m rsur 30 m n where rsur downscaled is the downscaled 30 m rsur rsur 1 k m is the resistance retrieved from the 1 km et dataset in section 3 1 rsur 30 m is the 30 m resistance simulated by the jarvis strategy in section 3 2 and n is the number of 30 m pixels in the studied 1 km grid a diagram combines with a workflow of the downscaling process is displayed in fig 2 land surface in a 1 km pixel is usually dominated by different land cover types mixed resistance from every object or small surface patches caused a mixing of et under same meteorological condition this mixed surface resistance is then disaggregated into single 30 m grids based on the modelled jarvis resistance simulated by eqs 6 13 during this step every 30 m pixel inside 1 km grid is taken into account which is decided by the central position of 30 m grids since daily 1 km et map and meteorological indicators are available the downscaled rsur is then employed to driving downscaling model at daily scale the complete disaggregation system is displayed in fig 2 b 4 results since the jarvis based surface resistance model has been optimized in the research area by other researchers we follow the parameterization strategy from song et al 2012 the performance of the surface resistance model is first validated using in situ records from flux sites in section 4 1 good performance of the resistance model enables the success of disaggregation downscaled result is then used in section 4 2 to test the reliability for further application since the method is proposed for the purpose of improving water management the evaluation of current downscaling approach mainly concerns about the detailed present of spatial pattern validation accuracy using flux observation there is a comparison between downscaling results using images from different satellites in section 4 3 and comparison between downscaling approach proposed in this research and based on lst in section 4 4 4 1 model performance validation of surface resistance is usually conducted by retrieving et results using the pm equation in the current research we obtained complete et records that cover the entire growing season in 2013 april october at the dm and ssw sites at the gb site some data were lost approximately 20 days and only data from late june to october are available at sd site due to the maintenance of equipment comparisons between in situ observed et data and model retrieved et data are shown in fig 3 the results suggest that the surface resistance model performs better at dm with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 94 due to the complexity of turbulence at sparsely vegetated sites such as ssw and gb the model exhibits a slightly inconsiderable accuracy the sd site is located in a wetland with reeds and an underestimation is observed at this site the jarvis rsur model was initially designed for vegetation canopies so the good performance at the dm site is expected similar accuracies have been reported by other studies song et al 2012 among the four sites the average daily et is higher at sd 4 45 mm from june to october than at dm 2 98 mm considering both sites feature a closed canopy lai values greater than 1 5 during the growing season abundant soil water content could contribute to greater evaporation from bare land the soil around the sd site is always saturated due to the supply of water from the wetland therefore introducing the soil resistance parameter effectively describes the evaporation from areas between plants in the energy balance based et approach that uses lst data a sufficient water supply in the soil will decrease the lst but the resistance term accounts for the effects of the soil water content and the associated evaporation hence modelling et using this approach is straightforward and reasonable good accuracy is observed at 3 sites with partial vegetation coverage dm sd and gb indicating that the strategy of dividing the land surface into areas of canopy and bare soil is adequate the overall r2 of 0 96 for all 4 sites with a root mean square error rmse of 0 40 indicates that the current rsur model is reliable the good accuracy of the proposed resistance model should guarantee the success of the downscaling with rs data input 4 2 downscaled results the validated surface resistance model is then employed with complete rs data input the original 1 km and downscaled 30 m results of total water consumption covering the entire growing season april october are displayed in fig 4 the etwatch 1 km dataset is interpolated by bi linear interpolation to a 30 m resolution for better comparison without extra spatial details the downscaled results follow the spatial trends in the original coarse dataset intense water consumption over cropland and lower et over bare soil in particular water consumption is higher over riparian forests and crop the downscaled et map clearly displays spatial differences between crop and forest areas in the north similarly small villages patchy fields and railways are not obvious in the 1 km image but can be recognized easily in the downscaled results further water management monitoring could be performed with the help of the downscaled dataset the current downscaling approach maintains the consistency of the overall et data inside each coarse pixel in the original dataset the average et values for different land cover types are held constant after disaggregation however the et map with a 30 m resolution can provide more information for water management globally the average annual water consumption is 545 2 mm for cropland and 183 4 mm for grassland based on an average rainfall of approximately 110 mm exploitation of groundwater could be estimated based on the 30 m et map for example there is a small sprinkler irrigated area in the southeast approximately 2 km 2 km that is not clearly shown in the 1 km map an average et of 518 mm over this patch is estimated based on the 30 m et map although this small patch experiences addition evaporation related to advection an advanced irrigation strategy still holds the potential to save water although forested areas are sparse in the research area the average water consumption of these areas is calculated to be 497 mm during the growing season additionally trees beside the river tend to consume more water 678 mm consequently the presence of trees represents a trade off increasing the number of trees would create a more stable ecosystem but would result in greater water consumption figs 5 and 6 show scatter plots and the temporal progression of et at the 4 sites with detailed statistics listed in table 5 similar to the model validation results the dm site shows the best performance among the 4 sites with r2 values of 0 86 for etwatch and 0 91 for the downscaled data the results for sd exhibit a good consistency with the original etwatch data but an inconsiderable performance when compared with in situ observations specifically the results at this site show an underestimation of et after september this phenomenon indicates that the coarse dataset at this site somehow neglects soil evaporation for saturated wetland during this period little improvement in the r2 values with respect to the coarse dataset is observed at the gb and ssw sites disaggregation based on surface resistance is reliable when complex mixed pixels are decomposed into different components overall the downscaled results follow the accuracy of the coarse dataset with little improvement the d values range from 0 93 at ssw to 0 98 at dm which suggest good performance of the model as well a comparison of the monthly residuals between the original 1 km dataset and the downscaled results is displayed in fig 7 to show the performance of the disaggregation process obvious accuracy improvements by the downscaled results are observed at dm and gb especially during june to september the two sites are located in a heterogeneous patch with a mixture of bare land and vegetation at the 1 km scale the improvement in accuracy means that the decoupling of vegetation and soil pixels is effective among all the sites the accuracy at gb improved most significantly with an improvement of 23 followed by improvements of 22 at ssw 17 at dm and 13 at sd we can conclude that the downscaled results yield greater improvements in accuracy for more complex land surfaces a maximum of approximately 50 improvement is observed in a single month which means that no rectification could be performed if there was a wrong estimate in the coarse dataset the newly proposed downscaling model can only improve the spatial resolution and output accuracy of a sufficiently accurate coarse dataset this conclusion is also supported by the research of tan tan et al 2017 the results at the 4 sites all follow the evapotranspiration trends which include the entire process of vegetation growth and abrupt fluctuations due to variations in weather conditions detailed spatial patterns and accurate validation results over diverse land cover types demonstrate that downscaling based on surface resistance is a suitable strategy for obtaining a daily 30 m resolution et dataset 4 3 comparison between different data source retrieving of surface resistance calculation is sensitive to the input 30 m ndvi and land cover maps unfortunately landsat8 images used to retrieve the ndvi are not available in august and september due to cloud contamination however hj images with the same spatial resolution and similar bands are an ideal substitute and could fulfil the aim of at least one ndvi image per month a comparison of the downscaled results based on the two sensors at all four sites is presented in fig 8 to validate the feasibility of using hj images as an input linear fitting is performed without setting an intercept to reveal the differences between the two inputs similar r2 values were obtained 0 97 and 0 96 and the rmse varies slightly from 0 45 to 0 61 satisfied r2 results partly comes from the mixing comparison of data from total 4 sites besides downscaled results using ndvi from the two satellites show close fitting equation with 0 95 and 0 97 of slope above results indicate that using hj images as an input data source does not markedly change the output accuracy however due to the difference between the coordinate systems of the two satellites heavy use of hj images may cause mismatches between surface pixels 4 4 comparison between different downscaling strategies since lst is another important driven factor of et simulation and downscaling in this section we use landsat8 lst images as input totally 5 scenes of lst map are employed without cloud contamination acquisition date could also be referred to table 2 fusion strategy is similar with research of semmens semmens et al 2016 disaggregation results are displayed in fig 9 there is an obviously accuracy advantage of downscaling results based on r sur compared with lst based method which performs by a better r2 0 94 versus 0 87 and less deviation rmse 0 50 mm day versus 0 74 mm day better performance could be explained as follows lst is influenced by meteorological indicators which is more vulnerable than ndvi driven surface resistance at the one month time interval and performs more sensitively in et model the sub kilometre spatial pattern reflecting water supply and consumption displayed by lst is not as stable as surface resistance besides due to the absence no sharpen step employed in this research 100 m of spatial resolution is not fine enough to perform some spatial information of patch field 5 discussion and conclusion in this research a new downscaling strategy based on 30 m surface resistance data is proposed and validated in the middle reach of the heihe basin the proposed model eliminates the requirement of an lst map the surface resistance model for downscaling has been optimized by peer researchers and validated using in situ observations good performance has been observed with an overall r2 value of 0 96 and an rmse of 0 40 the considerable accuracy of the 30 m resistance model is a prerequisite of the disaggregation approach and downscaling analysis is then conducted based on the resistance model and the etwatch dataset improvement in the output accuracy with respect to the original 1 km dataset was observed especially at gb and ssw site the r2 value ranges from 0 80 to 0 91 and the rmse ranges from 0 23 to 0 69 an improvement of 19 compared with the original 1 km dataset was observed indicating that downscaling actual et based on surface resistance is a reliable strategy for obtaining a daily 30 m et map similar to the disalexi and other downscaling strategy low resolution rs indictors can be disaggregated into higher resolution datasets using 30 m images in current research norman et al 2003 both decomposition strategies require a normalization or matching step for rs parameters from different sensors to maintain consistency between the downscaled results and the original data however in this study surface resistance rather than land surface temperature has been employed because the former parameter is more easily obtained from rs images additionally disalexi simulates 30 m net radiation using albedo from snapshots in this research considering the aim of obtaining daily et maps throughout the whole growing season we use the gap filled 30 m albedo based on the savitzky golay s g filter savitzky and golay 1964 since downward shortwave radiation is mainly influenced by meteorological parameters and sunshine duration which does not change much over short distances a resolution of 1 km is sufficient in the rsur model in section 4 1 the surface resistance model performs better at gb than ssw the two sites both feature limited sm and sparse canopies considering the similar surface water supplying the accuracy differences may come from the simulation of aerodynamic resistance due to the undulating dunes in the desert the topography near the ssw site is more complex than that at the gb site the r a method in this research does not take elevation variation within a pixel into consideration further research will be performed to introduce a parameterized r a approach at 30 m resolution chen et al 2015 downscaling strategy in current research needs daily 1 km and 30 m surface resistance data as input parameters there is difference between performance simulating et using jarvis rsur and in situ observed parameters and disaggregation results displayed in figs 3 and 5 respectively this difference mainly comes from uncertainty of input data downscaling strategy describes the process of evapotranspiration by jarvis model which could simulate et with a considerable accuracy using ideal data input recorded by flux sites data quality of rs based products mainly meteorological indictors is not as good as which by in situ observation the uncertainty is also from the accuracy of coarse et product according to research of tan there might be serious mistake using unsatisfied 1 km et information tan et al 2017 the calculation of daily et using 30 m surface resistance without downscaling is also feasible with the same input which is well displayed by good performance in fig 3 there are two main reasons for downscaling a combined coarse et dataset rather than calculating the 30 m et directly firstly the lack of appropriate rs derived soil water content data is considered for better performance calibrated advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr data is used to describe the soil water content however a 25 km resolution is not sufficient to provide the spatial patterns in sm there might be a scaling effect caused by heterogeneity inside sm grids kustas and norman 2000 due to leakage and similarity of soil textures at small scales the sm inside one modis pixel can be considered invariable downscaling with the help of the rsur model seems more feasible than retrieving et directly over a wide scale this strategy still needs to be improved for pixels with sparse water surfaces and vegetation because the sm does not remain constant in these areas consequently a fluctuation in downscaled et is observed at the sd site at the end of the growing season after withering of the reeds future work on model improvement will focus on disaggregating sm using an empirical method holzman et al 2014 besides due to the long time interval retrieving 30 m et by the rsur based model directly may eliminate some high frequency signals caused by intense irrigation or harvesting such abrupt events could be displayed instantaneously by short re visiting interval images such as those of modis uniting images with different spatial resolutions through surface resistance leads to a better performance that combines the spatial temporal advantages of various datasets in this research 30 m resolution land cover data are used with parameters determined by other studies the oasis of heihe basin is mainly cultivated with maize so different crop types are considered as a single entity future research will be performed to validate the proposed method in areas with diverse crop types the parameterization of different crop types and different growing stages will be a challenge before this model is universally applicable monitoring et using combined rs data is the only way to improve spatiotemporal resolution the et downscaling approach proposed in this research has been demonstrated to be sufficient and feasible the good performance of the surface resistance model has been validated using in situ observations daily downscaled results using all data from a remote sensor has also been shown to be feasible additionally the limitations of landsat8 data due to cloud contamination have been overcome by using hj images thereby enhancing the stability of the downscaling strategy above all the new proposed method is suitable for heterogeneous areas and can provide high resolution evapotranspiration time series datasets declaration of competing interest none aknowlegements this study was supported financially by national key research and development program of

6208,this study proposes a new method for downscaling actual evapotranspiration from resolution of 1 km to 30 m the disaggregation approach is performed using the jarvis model to simulate surface resistance which describes the restriction of vapor from land surface in the water exchange process without using land surface temperature data the integrated surface resistance model which takes climate indicators and canopy conditions into account is primarily validated using in situ observations and employed in the downscaling model with considerable accuracy covering an entire growing season april october in zhangye oasis good performance and good agreements between daily downscaled results and flux records from an ec eddy covariance tower have been obtained the coefficient of determination r2 ranges from 0 80 to 0 91 and the mean bias mb ranges from 0 17 to 0 72 the vegetation growth process is also captured well by the downscaled results the proposed method in this research performs better than downscaling approach based on land surface temperature the accurate validation results and detailed spatial patterns suggest that the proposed downscaling strategy is reliable for water resource management keywords evapotranspiration downscaling surface resistance daily water consumption water management 1 introduction currently large number of human being are suffering from water stress vörösmarty et al 2000 hameed et al 2019 water supply shortages play a direct role in the deterioration of economic conditions in some countries with arid and semi arid climates gleick 2013 thus a systematic water saving strategy is urgently needed traditional water management schemes have been demonstrated to be ineffective when faced with intensive human activity and supply of available water without considering water recycling as part of the whole system grafton 2017 perry 2011 evapotranspiration et is the summation of evaporation mainly from the soil and transpiration from canopy level plants and constitutes a dominant proportion of actual water consumption of land surface et based water management projects for monitoring actual consumption have been proposed as a new type of approach across different applications from agriculture to ecology anderson et al 2012 gowda et al 2008 thevs et al 2015 but this technique requires adequate et information considering the heterogeneity of the land surface et measurements can be expanded from the site scale to the basin scale with the help of remote sensing rs technology rs based water research can provide estimates of surface conditions that vary spatially over short periods of time li et al 2013 with the help of diverse remote sensors and advanced data management systems gorelick et al 2017 more data can be involved to complement traditional hydrological research pekel et al 2016 because of the complexity of et models considering a method that can retrieve water consumption from a single data source seems impossible typical regional et simulation model requires remotely sensed land surface parameters spatial resolution usually consists with expected results combined with meteorological information from satellite or in situ observations to calculate the energy flux allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 2003 su 2002 timmermans et al 2007 among all the input parameters needed for et estimation which is based on energy balance land surface temperature lst is critical for describing the energy transformation process su 2002 the temperature gradient between land surface and boundary layer is indicative of the energy flux at the interface there are sensors with diverse spatiotemporal resolutions in service that can provide lst information for et estimation unfortunately finer spatial resolution images are usually associated with longer time intervals selecting adequate lst data sources is required to improve the success of energy balance based et monitoring singh et al 2014 one strategy to obtain gridded et data with a consistent high temporal resolution and a high spatial resolution is to combine rs data from diverse sensors with different resolutions studies have been performed on disaggregating low resolution lst data into higher resolution kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007 thus low resolution lst data in combination with other information like meteorological observation could be used to calculate higher resolution et bechtel et al 2012 bisquert et al 2016 zakšek and oštir 2012 additionally some studies have proposed methods for creating coarse et maps using different surface parameters directly a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm was used to disaggregate coarse et dataset into 30 m resolution with finer grids liu et al 2011 some researchers have employed the correlations among et map with different time intervals and spatial resolution to extend 30 m et map from a snapshot to a complete time series with the temporal information provided by modis hong et al 2011 singh et al 2014 spiliotopoulos et al 2013 methods mentioned above can be classified as a combination of et estimates with two spatial resolutions which could take the advantages from different rs images however surface et based on energy balance approach with a high spatial resolution are not always available especially during wet seasons due to the cloud contamination over rs images thus other rs indicators with 30 m grids could be used driving downscaling model research by ke suggests that et has high correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ke et al 2016 furthermore tan proposed a downscaling method based on the ndvi and historical ratios that could be obtained from a wider range of remote sensors like landsat and huanjing satellites tan et al 2017 disaggregating et using ndvi or other indicators can avoid the limitations associated with the lack of available high resolution lst images but may eliminate some high frequency signals hence the downscaling approach is usually performed with eight or ten day time intervals similar to the energy balance approaches estimating et by the penman monteith pm equation has exhibited good performance as well allen et al 1998 cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 mu et al 2007 researchers using this strategy have to employ surface resistance r sur as the driving indicator of evapotranspiration from land r sur is mainly affected by leaf conductance over vegetated areas and by soil conductance over bare land however transpiration through stomata during photosynthesis is a very complex process and is affected by many factors such as solar radiation air temperature and vapour pressure deficit vpd jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 some researchers have concentrated on the parameterization of leaf conductance and surface resistance a discount model of stomatal conductance reciprocal of stomatal resistance was first proposed by jarvis and this model assumes leaf stomatal is at the most active stage under a considerable environment with the maximum velocity of photosynthesis and thus transpiration jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 stomatal conductance will decrease with environmental deviation from the ideal conditions occurs the environmental parameters taken into account and the chosen parameterization strategy differ among researchers l et al 2004 oren et al 2010 ql et al 1997 xu and baldocchi 2003 compared to the jarvis approach of deviation from the ideal conditions the method proposed by leuning features a more specific consideration upon weakening of radiation by canopy leuning et al 2008 further parameterization and calibration of this model is needed as well a comparison and review of the diverse r sur simulation methods could be found in li et al 2015 song et al 2012 most r sur models can be applied over large range of earth surface with the help of rs images notably lst data are not always necessary for the estimation of et in some pm based et monitoring strategies considering the limitations of lst data and the good performance of the pm method based on surface resistance a new downscaling method of actual et is proposed in this paper to calculate daily surface resistance 30 m satellite images are employed based on the calculated results the 1 km etwatch dataset is then disaggregated to a resolution of 30 m since the validated good performance of the dataset in current research region wu et al 2016 in section 2 a detailed description of the research area and material contains a detailed description of etwatch is provided in section 3 the parameterization of surface resistance and the downscaling approach are described an evaluation and validation of the surface resistance model and downscaled et results are provided in section 4 discussion and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and materials 2 1 research area this research is conducted in the middle reach of the heihe basin a small oasis located in gansu province china the heihe river flows through three north western provinces and the catchment features several climate and topographic types the middle reach 98 57 100 52 e 38 39 39 59 n near zhangye city covers an area of approximately 3200 km2 after long term cultivation by local residents the area of intensely irrigated farmland in the oasis has remained stable over the years and the cultivated areas are surrounded by bare soil and sparse grassland due to the scarcity of water suppling approximately 110 mm of rainfall per year with annual average temperature of 7 c and a near 2000 mm of potential evapotranspiration small arbours rather than large forests are usually planted outside farmland as shelterbelts in summary the research area features a typical oasis under a semi arid climate the single growing season of vegetation in this region usually starts in april and ends in october due to the representativeness of the heihe basin a system of ground observations has been implemented for this region li et al 2013 2009 and includes many aspects of water resource management li and guo 2015 li et al 2016 data from four flux sites are used to validate the downscaled results in this study detailed information on the four sites can be found in table 1 a spatially distributed soil texture map has been obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao nachtergaele et al 2010 among which the daman site dm represents cropland with irrigation in the case of the research period maize the shidi site sd is located inside the zhangye national wetland park and features a wetland surface which is associated with a greater water supply than cropland the gebi site gb is located in sparse grassland near a small patch of farmland validation results at this site could reflect the performance and reliability of the downscaling approach when faced with heterogeneous region and mixing pixels the last site is the shenshawo site ssw which records flux data over a desert area without vegetation this site is taken into account for the purpose of validating surface resistance model under condition with sparse vegetation covering flux towers with supersonic anemometer csat3 and gas analyser li7500a could provide origin observation with 10 hz of frequency records are then processed into 30 min interval by eddypro liu et al 2016 the four sites are all equipped with an automatic weather stations aws to record routine weather parameters the positions of the flux sites and a land cover map are shown in fig 1 a relative position and dem digital elevation model map of the oasis could be referred to fig 1 b and c respectively which displays no obvious hills inside the oasis actually there is no slope with more than 15 in the region 2 2 etwatch data daily water consumption estimated by etwatch strategy is performed as et input with coarse grids in this research the model is a parameterized actual et simulation system that combines surface energy balance strategy sebs and the pm method at daily interval chen et al 2013 wu et al 2012 results of the system have been calibrated and validated under several climate types and the model has been demonstrated to produce reliable water consumption estimates for basin scale water management wu et al 2012 2016 approximately 90 cloud free modis images per year are used to estimate the instantaneous energy balance at the visiting snapshots by the residue approach covering entire heihe region which consider target latent heat flux as the residue of net radiation minus sensible heat flux and soil heat flux sensible heat at snapshots is calculated based on the temperature deficit between the land surface and the planet boundary layer at a certain height which is detected by feng method feng et al 2015 layered air temperature and pressure data are provided by gap filled mod07 atmospheric profile product with 5 km grids and daily temporal scale considering the vegetation growth topography and microscopic surface roughness an approach for estimating the integrated aerodynamic roughness length is employed during the simulation of air resistance xing et al 2014 energy fracture ef at modis snapshots which describes the ratio of latent heat flux against available energy from radiation is then calculated based on the proportion of energy balance components daily net radiation rn received by land surface is simulated by an approach which is similar with the method recommended by the fao 56 allen 1997 determined parameters of sunshine duration in the model which are calibrated for diverse cloud types and are provided by a geostationary meteorological satellite are used to estimate the daily sunshine hours wu et al 2017 the method for simulating the diurnal surface soil heat flux g is based on research from zhu et al 2014 instantaneous latent heat flux is then extended to the whole day scale with the help of ef since daily information about net income energy over the land surface is available an inverse pm equation is used to calculate the surface resistance during a clear day to obtain daily et with limited cloud free rs images a time series re construction approach that considers parameters that influence r sur is used wu et al 2016 during this step information of time series leaf area index vapour pressure deficit and soil moisture dynamics are used by a simplified expression of r sur wu et al 2012 xu et al 2018 daily water consumption is calculated based on routine meteorological observations all sub models mentioned above have exhibited high accuracies in the heihe basin overall correlation coefficient r2 of etwatch ranges from 0 86 at dm to 0 77 at ssw in 2013 2 3 satellite data rs data with a 30 m spatial resolution is employed in this research which covers the complete growing season from april to october of maize and other crops in the oasis since the spatial pattern of the canopy changes gradually one image per month can meet the requirements of the ndvi time series reconstruction landsat8 operational land imager oli images were downloaded from earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov only one image is needed to cover the whole research area path 133 and row 33 every 16 days unfortunately no images are available in august and september due to cloud contamination images from the huanjing satellite hj 1a and hj 1b which are available from the website of cresda china centre for resources satellite data and application are chosen as a substitute the hj images have the same spatial resolution as the landsat8 images 30 m but a shorter time interval 2 days research has been performed on the normalization of images from the two satellites zhong et al 2014 images from hj have been transformed into same coordinate system as those from landsat8 which means that the pixels from the two satellites represent the same surface area the detailed acquisition dates of the 30 m images are listed in table 2 in current research surface reflectance and ndvi map is required providing vegetation condition which is commonly used an integrated concept that contains growing status and vegetation phenology fensholt et al 2004 the 30 m snapshot images are then gap filled into daily series additionally 30 m land cover data sourced from rs images is produced by an object based method with a total accuracy of over 90 zhang et al 2014 the dataset is revised every 5 years countrywide and data from 2010 is used in the current research since the area of the cropland and grassland near zhangye city keeps unchangeable this time interval is reasonable according to the dataset cropland represents approximately 49 of the region and is surrounded by a large area of sparse grassland 32 and desert 9 in addition to artificial surfaces 7 forest 2 and water areas 1 represent small proportions under this semi arid climate due to intense evaporation 3 method there are three steps in the downscaling of daily et the daily surface resistance of the at 1 km resolution is first retrieved by the pm equation which is introduced in section 3 1 then daily 30 m surface resistance is estimated by the calibrated jarvis approach using 30 m rs images assuming the atmospheric indicators are stable inside a single pixel et distribution at 30 m resolution can be calculated using the downscaled 30 m surface resistance 3 1 calculation of coarse surface resistance surface resistance with a 1 km resolution is retrieved by inverting the pm method monteith 1965 1 λ e sa ρ c p e sat e a r a s γ 1 r sur r a where λ e mlm 2 day 1 is the latent heat flux s kpa c 1 is the slope of the curve relating saturated water vapour pressure to temperature a mlm2 2day 1 is the available energy calculated using net radiation and soil heat flux ρ gl 1 is air density c p jkg 1 c 1 is the specific heat capacity of air e sat kpa is the saturated vapour pressure at a certain temperature e a kpa is the actual water vapour pressure and r a sm 1 is the aerodynamic resistance the psychrometric constant γ is usually given as 0 665 10 3 p where p hpa is the atmospheric pressure the surface resistance r sur sm 1 is the integrated resistance of evapotranspiration between the land surface and the atmosphere which indicates the restriction upon the water vapor from all objects of land surface over a certain range monteith 1965 energy and water flux from the surface of the earth is usually hampered by the vegetation canopy and near surface atmospheric layers aerodynamic resistance r a sm 1 represents the resistance of the energy flux and water vapor transformation and is calculated following the method suggested by the fao allen et al 1998 2 r a ln z m d z 0 m ln z h d z 0 h k 2 u z where z m m is the height of the wind speed recorder z h m is the height of humidity recorder z 0 m m is the roughness length z 0 h is the roughness length governing the transfer of heat and vapour d is zero plane displacement height k is von kaman s constant and is usually set as 0 41 and u z ms 1 is the wind speed at height z z 0 m and d reflect the geometric roughness of the land surface and canopy during the transfer of energy z 0 m is usually expressed as a function of a constant 0 1 multiplied by canopy height which depends on the type and growing status of canopy zeng and wang 2006 chen et al 2013 maximum canopy height h c could refer to table 4 furthermore d can be estimated by an empirical expression such as the following equation colaizzi et al 2004 pereira et al 1999 3 d h 1 2 1 e 0 5 l a i lai z 0 m where h m is canopy height estimated by relative correlation with h c during this step routine meteorological observations wind speed air temperature and relative humidity are necessary as inputs the spatial distributions of a and r a can be simulated based on rs images among the strategies of r a calculation the method above is chosen in this research because rs based lst estimates are not necessary in this model liu et al 2007 after all the data are prepared inversion of the pm equation has been conducted to retrieve daily r sur since meteorological indicators and spatial distributed a and r a are all available as following eq 4 in which the parameters share the same units and meaning with eq 1 4 r sur sa ρ c p e sat e a r a λ e s γ 1 r a 3 2 parameterization of surface resistance at high resolution the simulation of high resolution surface resistance is based on 30 m rs parameters considering the contributions of different surface types inside one pixel the r sur of the land surface over every single pixel could be expressed by sub pixel objects as follows li et al 2009 5 r sur f 1 r s 1 f 2 r s 2 f 3 r s 3 where f n represents the area fraction of land cover type n and r s n is the surface resistance of land cover type n under most circumstances only the contributions from vegetation and soil are taken into account thus we can write the following 6 r sur f v r c 1 f v r soil where f v is vegetation coverage r c ms 1 is the resistance over the vegetation canopy and r soil is the resistance from the soil since we can consider every pixel is a mixture of vegetation and bare land r c and r soil describe the resistance during water vapor transfer for canopy and soil surface respectively r c is mainly affected by leaf stomata and leaf area while r c is influenced by soil particles and soil water content the fractional vegetation cover f v calculated from ndvi images can be retrieved by the following empirical equation 7 f v ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 the soil resistance r soil in eq 8 is simulated by a strategy similar to the discount model and involves considering the soil water content parameters for every soil type are suggested by ghilain et al 2014 and have been validated to perform well 8 r soil r soil m i n θ g θ wilt θ sat θ wilt 3 where r soil m i n ms 1 is the minimum soil resistance which is taken as 50 ms 1 θ sat m3m 3 is the saturated soil water holding capacity of a certain soil type and θ wilt m3m 3 is the wilt water content hu and jia 2015 θ g m3m 3 is actual soil moisture which is provided and interpolated using daily observations over 10 sites the parameterization strategy assumes that evaporation from the soil is highly correlated with the physical characteristics of soil particles which is displayed in table 3 chen and dudhia 2001 zhuang et al 2016 the jarvis approach has been used to simulate canopy resistance as follows noilhan and planton 1989 9 r c r c m i n lai f 1 1 f 2 1 f 3 4 where r c m i n ms 1 is the minimum leaf resistance indicating the maximum leaf conductance and transpiration velocity under ideal condition lai is the leaf area index which describes the leaf density of a given canopy and f 1 f 2 and f 3 are environmental indicators describing deviation from the ideal conditions notably song et al 2012 treats soil moisture sm as a climate factor in their model according to research by ma et al 2017 under the same climate type no significant relationship exists between r c and the soil water content once a minimum threshold is reached besides there is a strong correlation between canopy condition and water supply lai in the following equation could reflect the vegetation condition difference caused by sm finally we do not take the sm factor into consideration r c m i n represents the minimum leaf resistance largest conductance under ideal conditions as displayed in table 4 chen and dudhia 2001 lai can be retrieved using an empirical rs method f 1 reflects the influence of solar radiation which usually has a positive effect on transpiration sellers 1994 10 f 1 f r c m i n r c m a x 1 f where 11 f 0 55 r s r sl 2 lai and where r c m a x ms 1 is the maximum value of the leaf resistance which is relatively insensitive in the calculation and always set as a constant 5000 ms 1 r s wm 2 is the downward shortwave radiation and r sl is a scaling parameter and set to 100 wm 2 as a constant value a higher lai value represents a denser canopy which usually means more leaves and better use of solar energy 12 f 2 1 c v v p d f 2 is the factor describing the influence of the vpd where c v hpa 1 is an indicator of the response to vpd variation for diverse vegetation types a higher vpd value corresponds to greater drying power canopy resistance increases under dry conditions to avoid water loss parameterization of c v could also refer to table 4 the highest transpiration rates occur when the air temperature is high and the transpiration rate decreases with deviation from this condition factor f 3 represents the influence of temperature deviation on leaf resistance dickinson 1984 13 f 3 1 0 0016 298 t a 2 where t a k is the air temperature at the height of the canopy 3 3 downscaling strategy the overall water consumption of one coarse pixel e g with a resolution of 1 km grid should be the summation of the et contributed from every finer scale pixel inside it kustas and norman 2000 then we can write the mixing step as 14 λ e 1 k m λ e 30 m n given the assumption that atmospheric factors usually remain constant at the scale of 1 km r sur dominates the modelled et of every 30 m grids we can combine the eqs 1 and 14 as follows 15 rsur 1 k m rsur 30 m n the aim of the downscaling process in this research is to decompose rsur 1 k m into every single rsur 30 m grid without changing the total water consumption amount simulated with 1 km grids due to the inevitable differences between remote sensors a matching step is needed during the downscaling of r sur to guarantee that the summation of the downscaled rsur is the same as the original coarse rsur 1 k m which is similar to disalexi approach norman et al 2003 retrieved rsur 30 m data are then employed to disaggregate rsur 1 k m into every 30 m grids in this step pixels in high resolution image of surface parameters are matched to the coincident coarse pixel by making a linear slope adjustment to accommodate differences due to different sensor view angles uncertainties in sensor calibration and resistance models thus we can write the following equation 16 rsur downscaled rsur 1 k m rsur 30 m rsur 30 m n where rsur downscaled is the downscaled 30 m rsur rsur 1 k m is the resistance retrieved from the 1 km et dataset in section 3 1 rsur 30 m is the 30 m resistance simulated by the jarvis strategy in section 3 2 and n is the number of 30 m pixels in the studied 1 km grid a diagram combines with a workflow of the downscaling process is displayed in fig 2 land surface in a 1 km pixel is usually dominated by different land cover types mixed resistance from every object or small surface patches caused a mixing of et under same meteorological condition this mixed surface resistance is then disaggregated into single 30 m grids based on the modelled jarvis resistance simulated by eqs 6 13 during this step every 30 m pixel inside 1 km grid is taken into account which is decided by the central position of 30 m grids since daily 1 km et map and meteorological indicators are available the downscaled rsur is then employed to driving downscaling model at daily scale the complete disaggregation system is displayed in fig 2 b 4 results since the jarvis based surface resistance model has been optimized in the research area by other researchers we follow the parameterization strategy from song et al 2012 the performance of the surface resistance model is first validated using in situ records from flux sites in section 4 1 good performance of the resistance model enables the success of disaggregation downscaled result is then used in section 4 2 to test the reliability for further application since the method is proposed for the purpose of improving water management the evaluation of current downscaling approach mainly concerns about the detailed present of spatial pattern validation accuracy using flux observation there is a comparison between downscaling results using images from different satellites in section 4 3 and comparison between downscaling approach proposed in this research and based on lst in section 4 4 4 1 model performance validation of surface resistance is usually conducted by retrieving et results using the pm equation in the current research we obtained complete et records that cover the entire growing season in 2013 april october at the dm and ssw sites at the gb site some data were lost approximately 20 days and only data from late june to october are available at sd site due to the maintenance of equipment comparisons between in situ observed et data and model retrieved et data are shown in fig 3 the results suggest that the surface resistance model performs better at dm with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 94 due to the complexity of turbulence at sparsely vegetated sites such as ssw and gb the model exhibits a slightly inconsiderable accuracy the sd site is located in a wetland with reeds and an underestimation is observed at this site the jarvis rsur model was initially designed for vegetation canopies so the good performance at the dm site is expected similar accuracies have been reported by other studies song et al 2012 among the four sites the average daily et is higher at sd 4 45 mm from june to october than at dm 2 98 mm considering both sites feature a closed canopy lai values greater than 1 5 during the growing season abundant soil water content could contribute to greater evaporation from bare land the soil around the sd site is always saturated due to the supply of water from the wetland therefore introducing the soil resistance parameter effectively describes the evaporation from areas between plants in the energy balance based et approach that uses lst data a sufficient water supply in the soil will decrease the lst but the resistance term accounts for the effects of the soil water content and the associated evaporation hence modelling et using this approach is straightforward and reasonable good accuracy is observed at 3 sites with partial vegetation coverage dm sd and gb indicating that the strategy of dividing the land surface into areas of canopy and bare soil is adequate the overall r2 of 0 96 for all 4 sites with a root mean square error rmse of 0 40 indicates that the current rsur model is reliable the good accuracy of the proposed resistance model should guarantee the success of the downscaling with rs data input 4 2 downscaled results the validated surface resistance model is then employed with complete rs data input the original 1 km and downscaled 30 m results of total water consumption covering the entire growing season april october are displayed in fig 4 the etwatch 1 km dataset is interpolated by bi linear interpolation to a 30 m resolution for better comparison without extra spatial details the downscaled results follow the spatial trends in the original coarse dataset intense water consumption over cropland and lower et over bare soil in particular water consumption is higher over riparian forests and crop the downscaled et map clearly displays spatial differences between crop and forest areas in the north similarly small villages patchy fields and railways are not obvious in the 1 km image but can be recognized easily in the downscaled results further water management monitoring could be performed with the help of the downscaled dataset the current downscaling approach maintains the consistency of the overall et data inside each coarse pixel in the original dataset the average et values for different land cover types are held constant after disaggregation however the et map with a 30 m resolution can provide more information for water management globally the average annual water consumption is 545 2 mm for cropland and 183 4 mm for grassland based on an average rainfall of approximately 110 mm exploitation of groundwater could be estimated based on the 30 m et map for example there is a small sprinkler irrigated area in the southeast approximately 2 km 2 km that is not clearly shown in the 1 km map an average et of 518 mm over this patch is estimated based on the 30 m et map although this small patch experiences addition evaporation related to advection an advanced irrigation strategy still holds the potential to save water although forested areas are sparse in the research area the average water consumption of these areas is calculated to be 497 mm during the growing season additionally trees beside the river tend to consume more water 678 mm consequently the presence of trees represents a trade off increasing the number of trees would create a more stable ecosystem but would result in greater water consumption figs 5 and 6 show scatter plots and the temporal progression of et at the 4 sites with detailed statistics listed in table 5 similar to the model validation results the dm site shows the best performance among the 4 sites with r2 values of 0 86 for etwatch and 0 91 for the downscaled data the results for sd exhibit a good consistency with the original etwatch data but an inconsiderable performance when compared with in situ observations specifically the results at this site show an underestimation of et after september this phenomenon indicates that the coarse dataset at this site somehow neglects soil evaporation for saturated wetland during this period little improvement in the r2 values with respect to the coarse dataset is observed at the gb and ssw sites disaggregation based on surface resistance is reliable when complex mixed pixels are decomposed into different components overall the downscaled results follow the accuracy of the coarse dataset with little improvement the d values range from 0 93 at ssw to 0 98 at dm which suggest good performance of the model as well a comparison of the monthly residuals between the original 1 km dataset and the downscaled results is displayed in fig 7 to show the performance of the disaggregation process obvious accuracy improvements by the downscaled results are observed at dm and gb especially during june to september the two sites are located in a heterogeneous patch with a mixture of bare land and vegetation at the 1 km scale the improvement in accuracy means that the decoupling of vegetation and soil pixels is effective among all the sites the accuracy at gb improved most significantly with an improvement of 23 followed by improvements of 22 at ssw 17 at dm and 13 at sd we can conclude that the downscaled results yield greater improvements in accuracy for more complex land surfaces a maximum of approximately 50 improvement is observed in a single month which means that no rectification could be performed if there was a wrong estimate in the coarse dataset the newly proposed downscaling model can only improve the spatial resolution and output accuracy of a sufficiently accurate coarse dataset this conclusion is also supported by the research of tan tan et al 2017 the results at the 4 sites all follow the evapotranspiration trends which include the entire process of vegetation growth and abrupt fluctuations due to variations in weather conditions detailed spatial patterns and accurate validation results over diverse land cover types demonstrate that downscaling based on surface resistance is a suitable strategy for obtaining a daily 30 m resolution et dataset 4 3 comparison between different data source retrieving of surface resistance calculation is sensitive to the input 30 m ndvi and land cover maps unfortunately landsat8 images used to retrieve the ndvi are not available in august and september due to cloud contamination however hj images with the same spatial resolution and similar bands are an ideal substitute and could fulfil the aim of at least one ndvi image per month a comparison of the downscaled results based on the two sensors at all four sites is presented in fig 8 to validate the feasibility of using hj images as an input linear fitting is performed without setting an intercept to reveal the differences between the two inputs similar r2 values were obtained 0 97 and 0 96 and the rmse varies slightly from 0 45 to 0 61 satisfied r2 results partly comes from the mixing comparison of data from total 4 sites besides downscaled results using ndvi from the two satellites show close fitting equation with 0 95 and 0 97 of slope above results indicate that using hj images as an input data source does not markedly change the output accuracy however due to the difference between the coordinate systems of the two satellites heavy use of hj images may cause mismatches between surface pixels 4 4 comparison between different downscaling strategies since lst is another important driven factor of et simulation and downscaling in this section we use landsat8 lst images as input totally 5 scenes of lst map are employed without cloud contamination acquisition date could also be referred to table 2 fusion strategy is similar with research of semmens semmens et al 2016 disaggregation results are displayed in fig 9 there is an obviously accuracy advantage of downscaling results based on r sur compared with lst based method which performs by a better r2 0 94 versus 0 87 and less deviation rmse 0 50 mm day versus 0 74 mm day better performance could be explained as follows lst is influenced by meteorological indicators which is more vulnerable than ndvi driven surface resistance at the one month time interval and performs more sensitively in et model the sub kilometre spatial pattern reflecting water supply and consumption displayed by lst is not as stable as surface resistance besides due to the absence no sharpen step employed in this research 100 m of spatial resolution is not fine enough to perform some spatial information of patch field 5 discussion and conclusion in this research a new downscaling strategy based on 30 m surface resistance data is proposed and validated in the middle reach of the heihe basin the proposed model eliminates the requirement of an lst map the surface resistance model for downscaling has been optimized by peer researchers and validated using in situ observations good performance has been observed with an overall r2 value of 0 96 and an rmse of 0 40 the considerable accuracy of the 30 m resistance model is a prerequisite of the disaggregation approach and downscaling analysis is then conducted based on the resistance model and the etwatch dataset improvement in the output accuracy with respect to the original 1 km dataset was observed especially at gb and ssw site the r2 value ranges from 0 80 to 0 91 and the rmse ranges from 0 23 to 0 69 an improvement of 19 compared with the original 1 km dataset was observed indicating that downscaling actual et based on surface resistance is a reliable strategy for obtaining a daily 30 m et map similar to the disalexi and other downscaling strategy low resolution rs indictors can be disaggregated into higher resolution datasets using 30 m images in current research norman et al 2003 both decomposition strategies require a normalization or matching step for rs parameters from different sensors to maintain consistency between the downscaled results and the original data however in this study surface resistance rather than land surface temperature has been employed because the former parameter is more easily obtained from rs images additionally disalexi simulates 30 m net radiation using albedo from snapshots in this research considering the aim of obtaining daily et maps throughout the whole growing season we use the gap filled 30 m albedo based on the savitzky golay s g filter savitzky and golay 1964 since downward shortwave radiation is mainly influenced by meteorological parameters and sunshine duration which does not change much over short distances a resolution of 1 km is sufficient in the rsur model in section 4 1 the surface resistance model performs better at gb than ssw the two sites both feature limited sm and sparse canopies considering the similar surface water supplying the accuracy differences may come from the simulation of aerodynamic resistance due to the undulating dunes in the desert the topography near the ssw site is more complex than that at the gb site the r a method in this research does not take elevation variation within a pixel into consideration further research will be performed to introduce a parameterized r a approach at 30 m resolution chen et al 2015 downscaling strategy in current research needs daily 1 km and 30 m surface resistance data as input parameters there is difference between performance simulating et using jarvis rsur and in situ observed parameters and disaggregation results displayed in figs 3 and 5 respectively this difference mainly comes from uncertainty of input data downscaling strategy describes the process of evapotranspiration by jarvis model which could simulate et with a considerable accuracy using ideal data input recorded by flux sites data quality of rs based products mainly meteorological indictors is not as good as which by in situ observation the uncertainty is also from the accuracy of coarse et product according to research of tan there might be serious mistake using unsatisfied 1 km et information tan et al 2017 the calculation of daily et using 30 m surface resistance without downscaling is also feasible with the same input which is well displayed by good performance in fig 3 there are two main reasons for downscaling a combined coarse et dataset rather than calculating the 30 m et directly firstly the lack of appropriate rs derived soil water content data is considered for better performance calibrated advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr data is used to describe the soil water content however a 25 km resolution is not sufficient to provide the spatial patterns in sm there might be a scaling effect caused by heterogeneity inside sm grids kustas and norman 2000 due to leakage and similarity of soil textures at small scales the sm inside one modis pixel can be considered invariable downscaling with the help of the rsur model seems more feasible than retrieving et directly over a wide scale this strategy still needs to be improved for pixels with sparse water surfaces and vegetation because the sm does not remain constant in these areas consequently a fluctuation in downscaled et is observed at the sd site at the end of the growing season after withering of the reeds future work on model improvement will focus on disaggregating sm using an empirical method holzman et al 2014 besides due to the long time interval retrieving 30 m et by the rsur based model directly may eliminate some high frequency signals caused by intense irrigation or harvesting such abrupt events could be displayed instantaneously by short re visiting interval images such as those of modis uniting images with different spatial resolutions through surface resistance leads to a better performance that combines the spatial temporal advantages of various datasets in this research 30 m resolution land cover data are used with parameters determined by other studies the oasis of heihe basin is mainly cultivated with maize so different crop types are considered as a single entity future research will be performed to validate the proposed method in areas with diverse crop types the parameterization of different crop types and different growing stages will be a challenge before this model is universally applicable monitoring et using combined rs data is the only way to improve spatiotemporal resolution the et downscaling approach proposed in this research has been demonstrated to be sufficient and feasible the good performance of the surface resistance model has been validated using in situ observations daily downscaled results using all data from a remote sensor has also been shown to be feasible additionally the limitations of landsat8 data due to cloud contamination have been overcome by using hj images thereby enhancing the stability of the downscaling strategy above all the new proposed method is suitable for heterogeneous areas and can provide high resolution evapotranspiration time series datasets declaration of competing interest none aknowlegements this study was supported financially by national key research and development program of

6209,a combined field and numerical study of water flow and solute transport was conducted along a clean transect of a tidal gravel beach in smith island prince william sound pws that was heavily polluted after the exxon valdez oil spill water table and pore water salinity were directly measured in the field the numerical model marun validated with the field observations was used to simulate subsurface flow and dissolved salt transport processes our study identified a two layer hydraulic structure in the beach a high permeability upper layer and a low permeability layer at the bottom numerical simulations indicated that the density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater strongly affects solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach a sensitivity study indicated that depth to and slope of the bedrock had major effects on solute transport in the lower layer but minor effects in the upper layer a deep bedrock caused the water particles travelling in the lower layer to penetrate deeper in the beach our study revealed high terrestrial freshwater recharge to the transect which promotes the removal of oil in two layer beaches by maintaining the water table at or above the interface of the two layers the study presented in this paper has strong implications on the oil persistence and associated removal strategies along the alaskan coastline polluted with oil findings from this work in relation to oiled beaches include 1 oil tends to persist at locations of small freshwater recharge and 2 prior to oil arriving to the shoreline one could minimize oil penetration into the beach by releasing water onto the beach at the high tide line during low tides keywords tidal gravel beach freshwater recharge marun numerical model particle tracking exxon valdez oil spill prince william sound 1 introduction as a result of the 40 million liters exxon valdez oil spill in march of 1989 approximately 800 km of shorelines in prince william sound pws were polluted neff et al 1995 in response to the spill one of the largest containment and clean up operation was mobilized between 1989 and 1992 different surveys were conducted on the shorelines of pws and gulf of alaska that were believed to contain oil the results showed considerable decline in the extent of oiling neff et al 1995 however short et al 2004 studied 91 randomly selected beaches in summer of 2001 and found oil in 78 of them with the estimated remaining subsurface oil of 56 tons the persistence of oil was noted by other studies boufadel et al 2016 li and boufadel 2010 michel and hayes 1999 taylor and reimer 2008 boufadel et al 2015 conducted a study to identify the sites in pws with lingering subsurface oil where restoration efforts were feasible and likely to be effective they found that 63 out of 100 sites in their initial list were identified as candidates for restoration nixon and michel 2018 estimated the presence of 227 tons of lingering subsurface oil residues patchily distributed across the shorelines of pws lindeberg et al 2018 conducted a survey at few beaches in pws that were polluted by the exxon valdez oil and found that oil was still present at most of the sites and the oil still retained toxic compounds in order to analyze mechanisms causing oil persistence in the beaches and also to remediate the oil contaminated areas it is important to understand beach hydrodynamics namely groundwater flow and dissolved salt transport within the beach matrix boufadel et al 2006 geng et al 2015 geng et al 2016 li et al 2007 venosa et al 1996 groundwater flow dynamics and solute transport in beach aquifers has been extensively addressed in the literature by implementing analytical solutions geng et al 2009 huang et al 2015 shi et al 2018 numerical simulations geng and boufadel 2015 malott et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 and laboratory or field experiments geng et al 2017 heiss and michael 2014 wu et al 2017 most of the studies on beach hydrodynamics focus on the littoral environments composed of sand sediments e g sandy beaches and less attention has been paid to the study of gravel beaches robinson et al 2018 horn 2002 this could be due to the logistical problems associated with studying gravel beaches buscombe and masselink 2006 or more usage of sandy beaches for recreational purposes hayes et al 2010 however understanding the dynamics of gravel beaches is important buscombe and masselink 2006 especially if the goal is to responds to oil spills or to remediate the polluted beaches e g gulf of alaska beaches hayes et al 2010 michel and hayes 1999 in the past decade numerous studies have been conducted to explore beach hydrodynamics and its implications on oil persistence in gulf of alaska beaches polluted with the exxon valdez oil spill li and boufadel 2010 conducted a field study to identify the hydrogeological factors that determined the persistence of oil in a gravel beach in eleanor island pws their results indicated that a beach in high latitudes could be viewed as a two layer system from a hydraulic point of view with a higher permeability layer on top of a very low permeability layer this two layer system was confirmed by other studies conducted later in different beaches of pws bobo et al 2012 guo et al 2010 xia et al 2010 xia et al 2010 studied an oiled transect of a gravel beach in knight island pws and concluded that the small flow entering the beach from the land could be the reason of the oil persistence in that beach they also conducted a numerical simulation of nutrient application on the beach surface and concluded that if the nutrient is the limiting factor this method of nutrient application could provide enough nutrients for enough time so that the biodegradation could happen guo et al 2010 investigated beach hydrodynamics in a clean transect of the same gravel beach studied by xia et al 2010 they conducted field measurements and numerical simulations and also performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of hydraulic conductivity and dispersivities on the simulation results bobo et al 2012 studied the groundwater flow in another tidally influenced gravel beach in pws they found that the change in the beach slope affected the water flow in the gravel beach they studied guo et al 2014 reported the results of a tracer study at a gravel beach on pws the oil did not persist in the transect they studied they concluded that the combination of the two layered beach structure the tidal fluctuation and the freshwater flow from inland could be the reasons for the oil disappearance from this beach recently geng and boufadel 2017 performed spectral and correlation analysis to characterize long term patterns of subsurface flow salinity and temperature in response to tidal signals at gravel beaches in pws alaska their results identified a significant role of terrestrial freshwater recharge in regulating groundwater flow and associated salt transport in these tidally influenced gravel beaches in order to further study the effects of hydrodynamics on the oil persistence in alaskan beaches and explore potential oil removal strategies for alaskan coastlines subjected to oil contamination our investigations targeted a tidal gravel beach beach sm006c in smith island pws fig 1 a in comparison to the studies conducted in the same general region pws the role of freshwater and the effect of salinity are elucidated in more details the beach was contaminated by the 1989 exxon valdez oil spills neff et al 1995 and was subjected to extensive treatment page et al 2008 taylor and reimer 2008 oil persisted on the left side of the beach facing landward between the mid tide line and the low tide line at the amount considered to be heavy oil residue hor according to the astm f1687 97 2003 classification see also short et al 2004 but no oil residues were found in the right side of the beach fig 1c at the time of our study 2008 2011 two transects each containing six monitoring wells installed in each side of the beach one in the oiled left side and one in the clean right side to provide explanation on possible reasons for the disappearance of the oil at the right side while it persisted at the left side in this paper the focus is on understanding the hydrodynamic factors accounting for the oil disappearance from the right side of the beach right transect using the results of field measurements and numerical simulations in spite of the heterogeneity in the sediments our hypothesis was that beach scale factors such as freshwater recharge and as hydraulic gradient could contribute to the disappearance of the oil in the right transect 2 field and laboratory studies 2 1 field setup the selected beach is located on the smith island at the coordinates 147 24 13 84 w 60 31 10 30 n fig 1a the beach faces north and is subjected to waves developed over a fetch of 60 km as they travel southwest the length of the beach across shore is 120 m and its width along shore is about 50 m after the earthquake of 27 march 1964 this beach was uplifted about 1 to 2 m plafker 1969 the sediments throughout the beach are coarse ranging from gravel a few millimeters to pebbles and cobbles 10 20 cm interspersed between boulders up to 100 cm the rock of this area consists mainly of orca group turbidities orca group sedimentary rocks lethcoe 1990 the left side of the beach is exposed to waves from the northeast while a tombolo protruding rock formation shelters the right side below the mid tide level the average slope at the right transect in the intertidal zone about 50 m long was 11 the sediments on the right side of the beach are more uniform in shape and are classified as boulder cobble gravel page et al 2008 the range of neap tides was around 3 0 m and that of the spring tides was around 6 0 m around 30 m landward of the high tide line of the right side of the beach a freshwater pond existed fig 2 2 2 field measurements due to the coarse structure of the sediments page et al 2008 it was practically impossible for us to drive multiport sampling wells or sensors into the beach therefore six pits w1 w6 were hand dug along the right transect to a maximum depth of 1 0 m wherever possible see table 1 for the depth of pits the presence of larger boulders at depth on the right precluded deeper pits in each pit a pvc pipe and a stainless steel multiport sampling well were placed vertically fig 3 the pits were then refilled with the excavated soil effort was made to replace sediments back in the order they were extracted however this was found later to be immaterial as the pits were assigned the permeability of the upper layer this created a pit effect li and boufadel 2011 discussed below the pvc pipe consisted of two concentric pipes with a near tight fit both pipes were slotted across their whole lengths and there was a fine stainless steel 100 mesh screen with opening size of 0 014 cm between them to allow water passage while keeping out sediment a pressure transducer mini diver datalogger dl501 schlumberger was placed at the bottom of each of the four pvc pipes wells 1 2 4 and 6 to record the water pressure and the water temperature every 10 min from 6 29 2008 3 30 51 pm initial time t 0 in this paper with the recording duration of 89 h all the pressure readings were calibrated against the barometric pressure monitored by an air pressure sensor barologger dl 500 schlumberger during the same period no rain or strong winds occurred during the whole experiment the stainless steel multiport sampling wells contained four ports labeled a b c and d from the bottom up which were covered with a fine stainless steel screen to prevent blockage by fine sediments the distance between any two adjacent ports was 23 cm the elevations of ports and sensors for different wells are listed in table 1 each port was connected to a stainless steel tube that extended to the top of the well where it was connected by means of tygon tubing to a luer lock three way valve fig 3c shows a schematic vertical cross section of w4 after the installation of multiport and pvc pipe a pressure transducer mini diver datalogger dl501 schlumberger was placed in the pond landward of the beach to provide the water level it also provided the water temperature water samples approximately 50 ml were collected with 60 ml luer lock syringes from the multiport sampling wells and placed in 125 ml polyethylene bottles fisher scientific fairlawn nj the samples were shipped to the laboratory for chemical analysis of the salinity the salinity was measured using digital refractometer 300035 sper scientific for each of the samples in order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments in the field in situ conductivity tests were performed at three different elevations at three close by locations around the midtide line the approach was as follows after digging a hole a clear pvc pipe was placed in the hole and the annular space between the casing and the borehole was sealed with grout and sediment at top then the falling head test was performed and the hydraulic conductivity was computed from the hvorslev 1951 equation as follows daniel 1989 1 k π d 11 t 2 t 1 ln h 1 h 2 where k is the mean hydraulic conductivity m s d is diameter of the pipe m t is the time s and h 1 and h 2 are the water head m in the pipe at t 1 and t 2 respectively 2 3 laboratory measurements of sediment properties twenty nine sediment samples were collected in the field to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity for freshwater flow and the capillary parameters these parameters were used as prior information for the numerical model marun model and then were updated by calibrating the model the sediment samples 125 cm3 to 750 cm3 were obtained at three depths 30 cm 60 cm and 75 90 cm at each well and were shipped to the lab for analysis the porosity of the samples was measured in the lab using the water saturation method dullien 1992 in the lab sediment samples were sieved to generate the grain size distribution according to the procedure astm d 422 63 based on the grain size distribution the effective diameter d 10 which is the grain diameters in mm corresponding to 10 passing on the cumulative grain size distribution curve was calculated the porosity and d 10 values were used to predict the hydraulic conductivity using the kozeny carman equation carrier 2003 given below 2 k g v 8 3 10 3 φ 3 1 φ 3 d 10 2 in this equation g is acceleration due to gravity g 9 81 m s2 ν is the water kinematic viscosity 1 0 10 6 m2 s and φ is porosity a review of empirical formulae to yield hydraulic conductivity can be found in odong 2007 and bobo et al 2012 the capillary parameters were estimated by fitting the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 to capillary retention experiment bear 1972 boufadel et al 1998 the van genuchten model is one of the models that characterizes the water retention curves and is expressed as 3 s e s s r 1 s r 1 1 α ψ n m where s e is the effective soil moisture ratio s is the soil moisture ratio soil water content divided by porosity s r is the residual saturation α l 1 and n are model parameters determined by the laboratory experiments and m 1 1 n 3 numerical modeling 3 1 marun model the marun marine unsaturated is a finite element model that can simulate water flows in the saturated and the unsaturated zones of two dimensional porous media taking into account the effects of salt concentration on water density and water viscosity the marun code has been used to reproduce previous well known numerical results such as the henry s problem of seawater intrusion boufadel et al 1999a b croucher and o sullivan 1995 frind 1982 and the elder problem boufadel et al 1999b elder 1967 the marun code was also validated extensively in the literature e g geng and boufadel 2015 geng et al 2017 guo et al 2010 li and boufadel 2010 li et al 2007 2008 naba et al 2002 xia et al 2010 via predicting laboratory and field experiment data 3 2 numerical implementation the simulation domain of the right transect across the shoreline is presented in fig 4 which was extended from the pond to the sea the simulated beach was 95 m long and 3 m deep the average slope at this transect in the intertidal zone was 11 the domain was discretized using 21 and 442 nodes in vertical and horizontal directions respectively this resulted in 9982 nodes and 17 640 triangular elements the courant number is defined as c r v δ t δ l where v is the darcy velocity δ t is the maximum time step and δ l is the maximum spacing between nodes in the simulations the time step was variable but it was selected in a way to ensure that the courant number was less than 0 95 for numerical stability the peclet number was select to be less that 2 0 zheng and bennett 2002 3 3 boundary and initial conditions a zero flow and zero mass transport boundary condition was adopted along the domain bottom and unsaturated boundaries beach surface above tide and landward zone above the water level for groundwater flow and salt transport simulations respectively below the water level a dirichlet boundary condition was used for the water equation the salinity boundary condition in the submerged part of the beach is dependent on flow direction if groundwater was flowing into the beach a dirichlet boundary condition was assigned with seawater concentration 31 0 g l if groundwater discharging then a neumann boundary with a zero dispersive flux was assigned boufadel 2000 galeati et al 1992 li et al 2007 at the landward boundary the water table was fixed at 6 5 m which was the water level at the pond during the field study and the salinity was fixed at 0 0 g l based on the measured salinity at the pond the water pressure on the submerged beach surface and sea floor was determined by the tidal seawater column above the beach surface i e ψ β tide h tide t z where β sea is the density ratio of seawater to freshwater htide t is the tide level and z is the elevation it was not possible to place a sensor far offshore to measure the lowest low tide therefore in order to calculate tide level htide t a theoretical expression of tide merritt 2004 was fitted to the observed water level at well w6 using the least squared method the theoretical expression is 4 h tide t h msl i 1 5 a i cos ω i t ϕ i where h msl denotes the mean sea level and the summation represents five harmonic components o1 k1 m2 s2 and n2 see table 2 for tides the parameters a i ω i and ϕ i are the amplitude m frequency radian hour and phase shift rad of the i th component of tide respectively although the theoretical expression for tide contains seventeen components we found it sufficient to use five components r2 0 99 the observed and simulated tidal levels are reported in fig 5 and the mean sea level and the values of the five tidal components are listed in table 2 the initial condition was a hydrostatic state at low tide with a sharp freshwater seawater interface as given by the ghyben herzberg approximation bear 1972 to obtain quasi steady state numerical solution several spring neap tidal cycles were run until the difference of the dependent variables water table and salinity between two successive spring neap tidal cycles became negligible 4 results 4 1 sediment properties based on the water saturation method the average porosity of the samples was equal to 0 31 table 3 the porosity does not impact the hydrodynamics of groundwater which greatly depends on the permeability sanford et al 1993 so the average value was used in the marun model based on the grain size distribution the results are not presented the effective diameter d10 was calculated and is reported in table 3 the average hydraulic conductivity at each well or pit see fig 3 estimated by the kozeny carman equation by taking the averaged d10 and porosity values is also reported in table 3 the average hydraulic conductivity was 0 002 m s based on the falling head test that was conducted at three different elevations 20 cm 65 cm and 70 cm deeper than the beach surface around the midtide line the hydraulic conductivities were computed eq 1 as 9 1 10 3 m s 1 4 10 6 m s and 8 0 10 7 m s respectively it is interesting that the hydraulic conductivity was four orders of magnitude smaller for a sample that was collected only 40 cm deeper these results show that the hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth exponentially bobo et al 2012 explored hydraulics in a gravel beach in pws alaska and reported that the hydraulic conductivity decreases sharply with depth and it was due to the reduction of the porosity as the sediment size distribution was essentially the same the reduction in porosity is probably due to sediment compaction due to tidal pumping while sediments near the surface are distributed by surface currents and waves other researchers noted the decrease in the porosity with depth in the beaches of pws atlas and bragg 2009 page et al 2008 and in other coastal aquifers briggs and richardson 1997 kimura and tsurumi 2004 the compaction in the field resulted in in situ hydraulic conductivity to be two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the hydraulic conductivity obtained by kozeny carman equation eq 2 in the lab the estimated hydraulic conductivity values based on the in situ tests and laboratory measurements were used as an initial guess for running the marun model the values of hydraulic conductivity were then calibrated based upon the groundwater table and salinity data observed in the field note that a criterion for the application of darcy s law is that reynolds number r e d10 q ν should be less than 1 0 in our case r e 10 3 m 10 6 m s 10 6 m2 s results in a value smaller than 1 thus in fairly general conditions in the beach the flow is laminar and darcy s law is valid the average values for capillary parameters were α 12 7 m 1 n 1 66 and sr 0 064 based on fitting to capillary retention curves as done in prior works boufadel et al 1998 geng et al 2017 4 2 water table fig 6 shows the variations of the observed and simulated water table with time at wells w1 w2 w4 and w6 for the duration of 89 h during falling tides the water level at w1 w2 and w4 dropped at the same speed as the tide then it abruptly became almost constant at a certain depth the water table at these three wells almost remained constant at an elevation higher than the pressure transducer this behavior of the water table variation is an indication of a two layer system where each layer is piecewise homogenous as an approximation a high permeability upper layer of loose material and a low permeability lower layer of compacted fine material bobo et al 2012 guo et al 2010 2014 li and boufadel 2010 xia et al 2010 this conceptual model was also supported by field investigation when the digging of pits became extremely difficult beyond a certain depth the higher elevation of the water table at wells w1 w2 and w4 above the pressure transducers during the low tide could be also an indication of freshwater recharge from the pond inland of the study transect the average water level in the pond was 2 6 m higher than the lowest water level at w1 providing a maximum seaward hydraulic gradient of 7 the water level at w6 showed the same behavior in a sense that the water level remained higher than the sensor elevation but the water level was decreasing slowly with time at w6 until the subsequent flood tide reached this well this slow decrease in water level can be due to lower permeability of the sediment at w6 and or more supply of water from the beach landward of w6 4 3 salinity fig 7 presents the observed and simulated salinity as function of time at three depths of wells w1 w6 the values reported from t 49 h almost two days after starting of water table measurement until t 90 h two seawater samples were collected from the sea adjacent to the beach and resulted in an average seawater salinity of 31 g l results from some of the ports were not available due to clogging the observed salinity at ports a and b of well w1 fluctuated with the tidal level dramatically at low tides the salinity values were small around 1 g l but as soon as tide reached to the ports the salinity rose abruptly and reached to 20 g l however this value was almost 10 g l lower than the seawater salinity no variation of salinity with depth is noted at this well at w2 the salinity of ports a b and c was in the range of 10 28 g l 5 30 g l and 1 31 g l respectively thus the variation of salinity increased with elevation i e when approaching the beach surface the pore water salinity of port b was equal to 30 g l at t 71 h high tide and it started decreasing with the tide falling the salinity at this port became eventually equal to 14 g l at t 77 h almost low tide similar to other near surface ports e g w1a and w1b salinity at port c demonstrated large fluctuations in response to tides the salinity at this port was almost equal to zero at low tide and it reached to seawater salinity at high tide an explanation of this behavior is provided next in fig 8 at w3 the salinity of port c was ranging from 23 to 31 g l and it was smaller than the values of port b fig 7 the salinity at this well did not follow a specific pattern at w4 salinity of ports a b and c were ranging from 17 27 g l 17 29 g l and 16 31 g l respectively surprisingly the average salinity at w4 was smaller of those at w3 this means that there was higher amount of freshwater at this well comparing to the w3 even if the w3 was closer to the pond one reason for that can be existence of different flow path due to the heterogeneity of the beach at low tide the salinity at port b of w5 was around 18 g l and when the tide reached to this port its salinity rose to 31 g l the salinity at port a was also ranging from 24 to 30 g l the salinity at port c was around 31 g l for most of the time except when the tide fell below the beach surface at w5 t 76 h at this time salinity dropped to 27 g l there were only two readings at port a of w6 the average of salinity at this port is 10 g l showing the existence of freshwater even in this well based on fig 7 whenever tide dropped the surface elevation at each well the salinity dropped rapidly as well especially at more landward wells this shows the high quantity of freshwater recharge from inland which could travel relatively fast in the upper layer with high permeability this was also noted in the field while digging the pits as the freshwater seepages were observed on the walls of the new dug pits 4 4 model validation verification the goal was to fit the simulation results of both water table and pore water salinity to the observed data while keeping the conceptual model as simple as possible the sediment properties such as capillary parameters hydraulic conductivity and porosity were estimated by analyzing the samples obtained in the field or by conducting the in situ tests table 3 these values were used as the initial estimates to run the simulations although the observed results water table and in situ hydraulic conductivity test suggested that the beach should be viewed as consisting of two layers with very different hydraulic conductivities we explored the case of the beach being homogenous different values a range from 1 10 4 m s to 5 10 2 m s were selected for the hydraulic conductivity of this one layer beach but none of those cases could explain the water table behavior in the pits even when we allowed the formation of a seepage face which was not present in reality the water table results for the one layer beach considering two different values for the hydraulic conductivity 5 10 3 m s and 10 3 m s are presented in fig 6 for the remainder of the paper we treat the beach as consisting of two layers for the upper layer in the intertidal zone the average hydraulic conductivity value 2 10 3 m s table 3 estimated based on the kozeny carman equation carrier 2003 was used as the initial guess the domain was extended to the pond at the landward boundary based on field observations the sediments in the area close to the pond at the surface consisted of a mixture of fine gravel and organic soil this suggests that hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer in the supratidal zone should be lower than that in the intertidal zone therefore two values were selected for the hydraulic conductivity a smaller value for zone 1 20 m x 0 m fig 4 and a larger value for zone 2 0 m x 75 m for the lower layer the average results of the in situ test at the depths of 0 65 m and 0 70 m 1 10 6 m s were chosen as the initial estimate the marun model was calibrated based upon the observed data and the values of the saturated hydraulic conductivities for the two layers and for zone 1 and zone 2 were determined for the lower layer the hydraulic conductivity was found to be around 10 5 m s the hydraulic conductivity for the upper layer was around 7 10 2 m s for zone 1 20 m x 0 m and around 5 10 2 m s for zone 2 0 m x 75 m the calibrated values were only an order of magnitude different than the initial values after pit excavation for well installation the original compacted less permeable material in the lower depths was replaced by the loosened mixed materials from the surface and lower depths this provided an unwanted increase in the permeability in the pit which was referred to as the pit effect in li and boufadel 2010 and li and boufadel 2011 this pit effect was accounted for in the model calibration by assigning a zone of the same permeability as the upper layer to the pits the measured capillary parameters in the lab were used in the model and were updated by model calibration it should be noted that the lower layer in the intertidal zone always remained submerged and as a result the capillary parameters for the upper layer were not applicable to this layer the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were selected based on the model calibration the model parameters and their values are listed in table 4 the simulated water table is compared with the observed results in fig 6 which shows that the marun model was able to reproduce the observed data very well as the difference between simulated and observed water tables was less than 2 0 cm with the exception of w6 at well w6 the simulated water level reached the low value of the observed water table rather rapidly this discrepancy could be due to local variation in the hydraulic conductivity around w6 based on the simulations if the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments in the pit at w6 and of the sediments around w6 is decreased the agreement between the observed and simulated water table will improve at w6 however in order to keep the model simple and more general the hydraulic conductivity of the materials in the pit at w6 was kept equal to that in other pits the hydraulic conductivity of the pits was equal to that of surface layer because of the pit effect discussed above fig 7 shows that the model was able to reproduce the overall pattern and values of the observed salinity at various depths of various wells for example at w2 the model was able to reproduce the small salinity variation at depth location a and the large salinity variation at the surface location c the same could be stated about w4 especially at times 68 h and around 76 h the model was less sensitive at w5 but the agreement was still good the agreement at w6 was poor but as stated earlier in the context of water level variation it is possible that local heterogeneity was strong there it is also possible that multiscale nonlinear behavior occurred that caused deviation from the tidal variation imposed on the model this behavior has been noted in other studies xin et al 2014 xin et al 2015 in addition for aquifer systems it is hard to achieve a quasi steady state due to incident wave and rainfall effects yu et al 2019 therefore implementing the quasi steady state achieved by synthetic tidal boundary as the initial condition for modeling may lead to discrepancy between simulations and observations 5 numerical investigations 5 1 effect of density gradient in the intertidal zone abdollahi nasab et al 2010 conducted experiments to investigate the flushing of saltwater out of a homogenous laboratory beach by freshwater with no tidal action they found that density difference between freshwater and seawater plays an important role for the high salinity case seawater concentration of 34 g l ataie ashtiani et al 2001 used a numerical model to investigate the influence of tidal fluctuation on contaminants carried by saline groundwater to the sea they did not include the higher density of seawater in their model as they assumed that the gradients generated by tidal fluctuations would be substantially larger than gradients and consequential velocity components because of the density effects here the goal is to examine how the density gradient will affect water flow and solute transport when strong tidal fluctuations are present the density effects on groundwater flow were assessed by comparing the results from the base case simulations with the simulation cases that neglected seawater groundwater density contrast in the first set of simulations the pit effect was included and the observed salinity and water table were compared with the simulation results of the case with no density effect fig 8 shows the variation of observed and simulated water table with time at wells w1 and w4 for the sake of brevity only the results of only two of four wells are demonstrated two simulation results are presented in the figure with one including the density effect control case and the other one neglecting it based on fig 8 ruling out the density effect would not affect the water table results as there was a decent match between the two simulated cases fig 9 shows the observed salinity at ports w1b and w4c along with the simulated results with and without density effects for the case with no density effect the salinity was very low at intermediate and deep ports w1b and w4c the maximum value was 1 5 g l respectively also the salinity no longer fluctuated over time as noted in the observation or density dependent results fig 7 when the density effect was not taken into account the simulated results did not reproduce the observation results fig 10 compares the salinity distribution during a falling tide t 75 h in the intact beach i e the pits were assumed not to be present between the case with the density effect included and the case that neglected it the water table in the beach is shown by black dashed line and the sea level is shown with dashed blue line based on fig 10a when the density effect was considered the seawater occupied the upper layer in the submerged part of the beach also the seawater was diluted by freshwater landward of the intersection of groundwater table and the beach surface on the other hand when the density effect was not incorporated in the model fig 10b the freshwater washed out the seawater in the upper layer also the seawater did not penetrate the beach in the submerged part neglecting the density effect means that the seawater and freshwater have the same density and therefore buoyancy will not affect solute transport anymore in this case seawater infiltration and associated mixing with groundwater was underestimated that is probably the reason that relatively lower salinity for w1b and w4c was calculated for the no density case compared to the density dependent case fig 9 indicating the important role of density gradient in controlling solute transport in the intertidal zone it was mentioned that the density gradient between freshwater and groundwater did not affect the water table in the beach based on fig 8 moreover comparing fig 10a and b suggests that the shape of water table was unaffected when the density gradient was neglected this is probably due to the fact that the fluctuations of the groundwater table in the simulated domain were primarily constrained by landward and seaward boundary conditions which were assigned the same for both cases the results to some extent show that the model that neglected density effects reproduced the fluctuations of groundwater table in the beach intertidal zone but greatly underestimated salinity variations this model could be validated by matching perfectly to observed groundwater table from monitoring wells but it could not predict the complexity of groundwater flow and associated solute transport processes in tidally influenced beach accurately 5 2 effect of bedrock on solute transport in this section the goal is to investigate the effect of bedrock on solute transport in a beach aquifer the volumetric flow rate can be defined as the flow velocity of water or fluids multiplied by the cross sectional area if the flow passage area shrinks while the flow rate is constant the velocity magnitude consequently increases the flow passage area in a simple unconfined beach aquifer is bounded by the beach surface from the top and the bedrock at the bottom alternating the flow passage area e g by considering various depths of bedrock with respect to the beach surface could affect the solute transport in beaches the effect of depth and slope of the bedrock on solute transport was noted by li et al 2008 who investigated the tide induced seawater groundwater circulation in shallow beach aquifers the saltwater wedge seaward of the low tide line was not observed in their beach aquifer in contrast to many other studies of coastal aquifers e g ataie ashtiani et al 2001 werner and lockington 2006 the shallow depth of the aquifer they studied resulted in high seaward groundwater flow that washed out the saltwater wedge to sea in order to investigate how the depth and slope of bedrock affect solute transport two beach domains with different depths and slopes of bedrock fig 11 were designed the first domain was designed to model a shallow beach aquifer in this case the bedrock was assumed to be few centimeters deeper than the bottom elevation of the pits at each well table 1 and the slope of the bedrock was variable in the second domain the bedrock was horizontal deep aquifer with zero slope for the bedrock and located at the elevation of 3 6 m with respect to the lowest low tide elevation during the field study as mentioned previously the thickness of the domain for the control case was 3 m uniform depth or parallel bedrock the simulations of water table and salinity were conducted using the three types of bedrock the pit effect was taken into account in the first set of simulations results which were not presented in this paper show that the depth of bedrock didn t affect the water table in the pits and there was a perfect agreement across all the cases there were minor discrepancies between the salinity results for deep aquifer horizontal bedrock and the control case parallel bedrock 3 m uniform thickness of the domain fig 12 compares the observed salinity at all ports of well w4 with the simulation results of the shallow aquifer and deep aquifer this figure shows that the maximum difference between two cases was only 2 g l which is 6 of the seawater salinity the salinity in the deep aquifer was lower than the salinity in the shallow aquifer most of the time the thickness of the lower layer low permeability layer in the deep aquifer was much larger than the thickness in the shallow aquifer this means that higher freshwater recharge from left in the deep aquifer can further dilute the seawater fig 13 compares the spatial salinity at falling tide t 75 h among the three domains with different bedrock depth for the intact beach one could conclude that the upper saline plume in the intertidal zone was not greatly affected by the depth of bedrock with respect to the beach surface this could be due to the existence of the two layer system the permeability of the upper layer was around three orders of magnitude higher than the permeability in the lower layer and as a result the velocity values were much larger in the upper layer comparing to the lower layer this means that for this system most of the exchange occurs in the upper layer and therefore the depth of bedrock will not affect water flow and solute transport in the upper layer of the two layer system particle tracking was used to elucidate the impact of the depth to bedrock on groundwater flow pathways random walk particle tracking rwpm has been used to simulate transport in porous media geng and boufadel 2015 labolle et al 1996 tompson 1993 the basic idea is to approximate the travel path of a quantity by a collection of particles transporting by the velocity and dispersion field in the domain in this research this method is used to compare the water pathways among the cases with different depths of bedrock therefore the transport by convection was only considered and dispersion was not included in this case the location of a particle at a given time is governed by only the velocity vector and its previous location and can be expressed as 5 x p t δ t x p t v δ t where x p t is the location vector of particle p l at time t δ t is the time step t and v is the groundwater velocity vector lt 1 obtained from the marun model because of the low permeability of the lower layer the particles traveled in this layer very slowly and therefore the marun code was run for several spring neap tidal cycle to generate long term data as the input for the particle tracking code particles were released from a location close to the pond x 19 85 m z 5 7 m fig 14 shows the flow paths of freshwater originated from the pond and compares how the depth of bedrock with respect to the beach surface affected particles transport the particles moving in the shallow aquifer took the shortest travel distance and the particles moving in the deep aquifer took the longest travel distance when the bedrock was considered deep the particles migrated deeper into the beach which is probably due to the increased freedom of transport when the tide reaches its highest value conversely when the bedrock is close to the beach surface the particles cannot penetrate deeper nevertheless the travel distance of the particles during three months was comparable among the three cases the results presented here showed that for solutes emanating from the pond landward of the beach the depth of bedrock has a sizeable effect on solute transport in the lower layer but has a minor effect on transport in the upper layer 6 persistence of exxon valdez oil in subsurface michel et al 2009 studied several beaches in pws based on their observations there was no subsurface oil lingering in the beaches where a small pond occurred behind the storm berm the mechanism that relates the freshwater recharge to the oil disappearance from some of the gravel beaches in alaska is explored here fig 15 reports the pond water level and water temperature fluctuations over one year after the study period in summer of 2008 the pond water level was equal to 6 5 m during the field study from july 2008 to june 2009 the minimum maximum and average water levels were equal to 6 20 m 7 15 m and 6 75 m respectively to explore how the freshwater in the pond affects the water table in the beach two simulations with different pond water levels were conducted for the first case the water level in the pond was equal to the yearly average of that 6 75 m for the second case the water level at the pond was set equal to 5 6 m which was only 40 cm above the level of highest high tide this level is assumed to be the lowest level of water table in the beach far enough from the intertidal zone the simulations were conducted with the pit effect included fig 16 compares the water level at the pits assuming three different pond water levels based on fig 16 when the water level was lowest in the pond pond water level at 5 6 m the water table at w1 and w2 dropped only few centimeters below the interface of the two layers on the other hand the water table at w4 and w6 stayed on the interface for the whole period when the water level at pond was at the elevation of 6 5 m during the field study the water table at the wells stayed at or above the interface of the two layers when the simulations were conducted considering the water level in the pond equal to the average of that over a year pond water level of 6 75 m the water table at the pits stayed few centimeters above the interface of the two layers in all of the wells this means that even at the lowest low tide there was always freshwater flow in the pits it can be argued that at the time of exxon valdez oil spill after the oil reached the beaches in pws the upper layer stored the oil temporarily whenever the water table dropped below the two layers interface the oil penetrated into the lower layer and entrapped there because of the capillary forces due to the fine sediments of the lower layer the oil persisted on the left side of the beach not studied here between the mid tide line and the low tide line short et al 2004 the right side of the beach was clean at the time of the field study though the observed results suggest that there was high freshwater recharge to the right side of the beach based on the results presented in fig 16 for any water levels at the pond the water table stayed always at or above the interface of the two layers at least at the wells w4 and w6 which were located in the mid tide and low tide zone of the beach respectively it can be concluded that high freshwater recharge promotes the removal of oil by sustaining a high water table in the intertidal zone at low tides the same mechanism was observed in the work of li and boufadel 2010 xia et al 2010 and guo et al 2010 therefore it is less likely to find oil in locations with a source of freshwater recharge like a pond or freshwater stream if beaches with similar setup of the beach studied here two layer system are polluted it is important to keep the oil from penetrating to the lower layer this can be done by applying water onto the upper layer at high tide line to sustain the water table above the interface of the two layers in the intertidal zone 7 conclusions the focus of this paper was on the analyses of hydrodynamic factors affecting water and solute transport in gravel beaches and evaluation of their potential impact on coastal areas that are subjected to multiple stressors such as saltwater intrusion sea level rise and oil spills pollution the investigation was carried out through a field study complemented with numerical simulations in a tidally influenced beach in pws alaska usa the field measurements showed that oil persisted on the left side of the beach when looking landward from sea but no oil residues were found in the right side of the beach at the time of the field study when a transect was established there the observed water level results the in situ and lab sediment analyses and the field observations indicated the presence of a two layer structure in the beach this system is characterized by a high permeability layer overlaying a much lower permeability layer as one notes by the levelling off of the water table when it reaches the interface of the two layers the observed salinity decreased at many sensors indicating a relatively large fresh ground water recharge to the transect the two layer system in conjunction with inland recharge seems to play an important role in the persistence or lack thereof of oil in pws beaches inland recharge sustains a high water table in the beach during low tides and subsequently prevents the oil from infiltrating into the lower permeability lower layer also high seaward flow in the upper layer could cause the dislodgement of oil and its washout to sea after calibrating the model marun numerical simulations were conducted to assess the effect of density gradient and shape of bedrock on the solute transport in the gravel beaches the simulation results indicated the important role of density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater in controlling the solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach the model neglecting the density gradient well reproduced fluctuations of the water table observed from monitoring wells but caused poor match of salinity variations to field measurements this indicates that single depth groundwater table measurements from the monitoring wells installed along the across shore transect might not be adequate to delineate the complexity of groundwater flow and associated solute transport processes in tidally influenced beach as density gradient between seawater and groundwater as a major driving force could not be fully reflected through those measurements numerical investigations also suggested that depth and slope of bedrock has a minor effect on the solute transport in the upper layer of two layer beaches while it greatly alters groundwater flow and solute transport processes in the lower layer the particle tracking indicated that when the bedrock was assumed deep the water particles migrated deeper into the beach while they advected close to the beach surface when the bedrock considered shallow the combined field and numerical study presented herein could be used to infer possible reasons for the lack of oil on the right side of the beach findings from this work in relation to oil contaminated beaches include 1 oil tends to persist at locations of small freshwater recharge 2 prior to oil arriving to the shoreline one could minimize oil

6209,a combined field and numerical study of water flow and solute transport was conducted along a clean transect of a tidal gravel beach in smith island prince william sound pws that was heavily polluted after the exxon valdez oil spill water table and pore water salinity were directly measured in the field the numerical model marun validated with the field observations was used to simulate subsurface flow and dissolved salt transport processes our study identified a two layer hydraulic structure in the beach a high permeability upper layer and a low permeability layer at the bottom numerical simulations indicated that the density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater strongly affects solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach a sensitivity study indicated that depth to and slope of the bedrock had major effects on solute transport in the lower layer but minor effects in the upper layer a deep bedrock caused the water particles travelling in the lower layer to penetrate deeper in the beach our study revealed high terrestrial freshwater recharge to the transect which promotes the removal of oil in two layer beaches by maintaining the water table at or above the interface of the two layers the study presented in this paper has strong implications on the oil persistence and associated removal strategies along the alaskan coastline polluted with oil findings from this work in relation to oiled beaches include 1 oil tends to persist at locations of small freshwater recharge and 2 prior to oil arriving to the shoreline one could minimize oil penetration into the beach by releasing water onto the beach at the high tide line during low tides keywords tidal gravel beach freshwater recharge marun numerical model particle tracking exxon valdez oil spill prince william sound 1 introduction as a result of the 40 million liters exxon valdez oil spill in march of 1989 approximately 800 km of shorelines in prince william sound pws were polluted neff et al 1995 in response to the spill one of the largest containment and clean up operation was mobilized between 1989 and 1992 different surveys were conducted on the shorelines of pws and gulf of alaska that were believed to contain oil the results showed considerable decline in the extent of oiling neff et al 1995 however short et al 2004 studied 91 randomly selected beaches in summer of 2001 and found oil in 78 of them with the estimated remaining subsurface oil of 56 tons the persistence of oil was noted by other studies boufadel et al 2016 li and boufadel 2010 michel and hayes 1999 taylor and reimer 2008 boufadel et al 2015 conducted a study to identify the sites in pws with lingering subsurface oil where restoration efforts were feasible and likely to be effective they found that 63 out of 100 sites in their initial list were identified as candidates for restoration nixon and michel 2018 estimated the presence of 227 tons of lingering subsurface oil residues patchily distributed across the shorelines of pws lindeberg et al 2018 conducted a survey at few beaches in pws that were polluted by the exxon valdez oil and found that oil was still present at most of the sites and the oil still retained toxic compounds in order to analyze mechanisms causing oil persistence in the beaches and also to remediate the oil contaminated areas it is important to understand beach hydrodynamics namely groundwater flow and dissolved salt transport within the beach matrix boufadel et al 2006 geng et al 2015 geng et al 2016 li et al 2007 venosa et al 1996 groundwater flow dynamics and solute transport in beach aquifers has been extensively addressed in the literature by implementing analytical solutions geng et al 2009 huang et al 2015 shi et al 2018 numerical simulations geng and boufadel 2015 malott et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 and laboratory or field experiments geng et al 2017 heiss and michael 2014 wu et al 2017 most of the studies on beach hydrodynamics focus on the littoral environments composed of sand sediments e g sandy beaches and less attention has been paid to the study of gravel beaches robinson et al 2018 horn 2002 this could be due to the logistical problems associated with studying gravel beaches buscombe and masselink 2006 or more usage of sandy beaches for recreational purposes hayes et al 2010 however understanding the dynamics of gravel beaches is important buscombe and masselink 2006 especially if the goal is to responds to oil spills or to remediate the polluted beaches e g gulf of alaska beaches hayes et al 2010 michel and hayes 1999 in the past decade numerous studies have been conducted to explore beach hydrodynamics and its implications on oil persistence in gulf of alaska beaches polluted with the exxon valdez oil spill li and boufadel 2010 conducted a field study to identify the hydrogeological factors that determined the persistence of oil in a gravel beach in eleanor island pws their results indicated that a beach in high latitudes could be viewed as a two layer system from a hydraulic point of view with a higher permeability layer on top of a very low permeability layer this two layer system was confirmed by other studies conducted later in different beaches of pws bobo et al 2012 guo et al 2010 xia et al 2010 xia et al 2010 studied an oiled transect of a gravel beach in knight island pws and concluded that the small flow entering the beach from the land could be the reason of the oil persistence in that beach they also conducted a numerical simulation of nutrient application on the beach surface and concluded that if the nutrient is the limiting factor this method of nutrient application could provide enough nutrients for enough time so that the biodegradation could happen guo et al 2010 investigated beach hydrodynamics in a clean transect of the same gravel beach studied by xia et al 2010 they conducted field measurements and numerical simulations and also performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of hydraulic conductivity and dispersivities on the simulation results bobo et al 2012 studied the groundwater flow in another tidally influenced gravel beach in pws they found that the change in the beach slope affected the water flow in the gravel beach they studied guo et al 2014 reported the results of a tracer study at a gravel beach on pws the oil did not persist in the transect they studied they concluded that the combination of the two layered beach structure the tidal fluctuation and the freshwater flow from inland could be the reasons for the oil disappearance from this beach recently geng and boufadel 2017 performed spectral and correlation analysis to characterize long term patterns of subsurface flow salinity and temperature in response to tidal signals at gravel beaches in pws alaska their results identified a significant role of terrestrial freshwater recharge in regulating groundwater flow and associated salt transport in these tidally influenced gravel beaches in order to further study the effects of hydrodynamics on the oil persistence in alaskan beaches and explore potential oil removal strategies for alaskan coastlines subjected to oil contamination our investigations targeted a tidal gravel beach beach sm006c in smith island pws fig 1 a in comparison to the studies conducted in the same general region pws the role of freshwater and the effect of salinity are elucidated in more details the beach was contaminated by the 1989 exxon valdez oil spills neff et al 1995 and was subjected to extensive treatment page et al 2008 taylor and reimer 2008 oil persisted on the left side of the beach facing landward between the mid tide line and the low tide line at the amount considered to be heavy oil residue hor according to the astm f1687 97 2003 classification see also short et al 2004 but no oil residues were found in the right side of the beach fig 1c at the time of our study 2008 2011 two transects each containing six monitoring wells installed in each side of the beach one in the oiled left side and one in the clean right side to provide explanation on possible reasons for the disappearance of the oil at the right side while it persisted at the left side in this paper the focus is on understanding the hydrodynamic factors accounting for the oil disappearance from the right side of the beach right transect using the results of field measurements and numerical simulations in spite of the heterogeneity in the sediments our hypothesis was that beach scale factors such as freshwater recharge and as hydraulic gradient could contribute to the disappearance of the oil in the right transect 2 field and laboratory studies 2 1 field setup the selected beach is located on the smith island at the coordinates 147 24 13 84 w 60 31 10 30 n fig 1a the beach faces north and is subjected to waves developed over a fetch of 60 km as they travel southwest the length of the beach across shore is 120 m and its width along shore is about 50 m after the earthquake of 27 march 1964 this beach was uplifted about 1 to 2 m plafker 1969 the sediments throughout the beach are coarse ranging from gravel a few millimeters to pebbles and cobbles 10 20 cm interspersed between boulders up to 100 cm the rock of this area consists mainly of orca group turbidities orca group sedimentary rocks lethcoe 1990 the left side of the beach is exposed to waves from the northeast while a tombolo protruding rock formation shelters the right side below the mid tide level the average slope at the right transect in the intertidal zone about 50 m long was 11 the sediments on the right side of the beach are more uniform in shape and are classified as boulder cobble gravel page et al 2008 the range of neap tides was around 3 0 m and that of the spring tides was around 6 0 m around 30 m landward of the high tide line of the right side of the beach a freshwater pond existed fig 2 2 2 field measurements due to the coarse structure of the sediments page et al 2008 it was practically impossible for us to drive multiport sampling wells or sensors into the beach therefore six pits w1 w6 were hand dug along the right transect to a maximum depth of 1 0 m wherever possible see table 1 for the depth of pits the presence of larger boulders at depth on the right precluded deeper pits in each pit a pvc pipe and a stainless steel multiport sampling well were placed vertically fig 3 the pits were then refilled with the excavated soil effort was made to replace sediments back in the order they were extracted however this was found later to be immaterial as the pits were assigned the permeability of the upper layer this created a pit effect li and boufadel 2011 discussed below the pvc pipe consisted of two concentric pipes with a near tight fit both pipes were slotted across their whole lengths and there was a fine stainless steel 100 mesh screen with opening size of 0 014 cm between them to allow water passage while keeping out sediment a pressure transducer mini diver datalogger dl501 schlumberger was placed at the bottom of each of the four pvc pipes wells 1 2 4 and 6 to record the water pressure and the water temperature every 10 min from 6 29 2008 3 30 51 pm initial time t 0 in this paper with the recording duration of 89 h all the pressure readings were calibrated against the barometric pressure monitored by an air pressure sensor barologger dl 500 schlumberger during the same period no rain or strong winds occurred during the whole experiment the stainless steel multiport sampling wells contained four ports labeled a b c and d from the bottom up which were covered with a fine stainless steel screen to prevent blockage by fine sediments the distance between any two adjacent ports was 23 cm the elevations of ports and sensors for different wells are listed in table 1 each port was connected to a stainless steel tube that extended to the top of the well where it was connected by means of tygon tubing to a luer lock three way valve fig 3c shows a schematic vertical cross section of w4 after the installation of multiport and pvc pipe a pressure transducer mini diver datalogger dl501 schlumberger was placed in the pond landward of the beach to provide the water level it also provided the water temperature water samples approximately 50 ml were collected with 60 ml luer lock syringes from the multiport sampling wells and placed in 125 ml polyethylene bottles fisher scientific fairlawn nj the samples were shipped to the laboratory for chemical analysis of the salinity the salinity was measured using digital refractometer 300035 sper scientific for each of the samples in order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments in the field in situ conductivity tests were performed at three different elevations at three close by locations around the midtide line the approach was as follows after digging a hole a clear pvc pipe was placed in the hole and the annular space between the casing and the borehole was sealed with grout and sediment at top then the falling head test was performed and the hydraulic conductivity was computed from the hvorslev 1951 equation as follows daniel 1989 1 k π d 11 t 2 t 1 ln h 1 h 2 where k is the mean hydraulic conductivity m s d is diameter of the pipe m t is the time s and h 1 and h 2 are the water head m in the pipe at t 1 and t 2 respectively 2 3 laboratory measurements of sediment properties twenty nine sediment samples were collected in the field to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity for freshwater flow and the capillary parameters these parameters were used as prior information for the numerical model marun model and then were updated by calibrating the model the sediment samples 125 cm3 to 750 cm3 were obtained at three depths 30 cm 60 cm and 75 90 cm at each well and were shipped to the lab for analysis the porosity of the samples was measured in the lab using the water saturation method dullien 1992 in the lab sediment samples were sieved to generate the grain size distribution according to the procedure astm d 422 63 based on the grain size distribution the effective diameter d 10 which is the grain diameters in mm corresponding to 10 passing on the cumulative grain size distribution curve was calculated the porosity and d 10 values were used to predict the hydraulic conductivity using the kozeny carman equation carrier 2003 given below 2 k g v 8 3 10 3 φ 3 1 φ 3 d 10 2 in this equation g is acceleration due to gravity

capillary parameters were estimated by fitting the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 to capillary retention experiment bear 1972 boufadel et al 1998 the van genuchten model is one of the models that characterizes the water retention curves and is expressed as 3 s e s s r 1 s r 1 1 α ψ n m where s e is the effective soil moisture ratio s is the soil moisture ratio soil water content divided

finite element model that can simulate water flows in the saturated and the unsaturated zones of two dimensional porous media taking into account the effects of salt concentration on water density and water viscosity the marun code has been used to reproduce previous well known numerical results such as the henry s problem of seawater intrusion boufadel et al 1999a b croucher and o sullivan 1995 frind 1982 and the elder problem boufadel et al 1999b elder 1967 the marun code was also validated extensively in the literature e g geng and boufadel 2015 geng et al 2017 guo et al 2010 li and boufadel 2010 li et al 2007 2008 naba et al 2002 xia et al 2010 via predicting laboratory and field experiment data 3 2 numerical implementation the simulation domain of the right transect across the shoreline is presented in fig 4 which was extended from the pond to the sea the simulated beach was 95 m long and 3 m deep the average slope at this transect in the intertidal zone was 11 the domain was discretized using 21 and 442 nodes in vertical and horizontal directions respectively this resulted in 9982 nodes and 17 640 triangular elements the courant number is defined as c r v δ t δ l where v is the darcy velocity δ t is the maximum time step and δ l is the maximum spacing between nodes in the simulations the time step was variable but it was selected in a way to ensure that the courant number was less than 0 95 for numerical stability the peclet number was select to be less that 2 0 zheng and bennett 2002 3 3 boundary and initial conditions a zero flow and zero mass transport boundary condition was adopted along the domain bottom and unsaturated boundaries beach surface above tide and landward zone above the water level for groundwater flow and salt transport simulations respectively below the water level a dirichlet boundary condition was used for the water equation the salinity boundary condition in the submerged part of the beach is dependent on flow direction if groundwater was flowing into the beach a dirichlet boundary condition was assigned with seawater concentration 31 0 g l if groundwater discharging then a neumann boundary with a zero dispersive flux was assigned boufadel 2000 galeati et al 1992 li et al 2007 at the landward boundary the water table was fixed at 6 5 m which was the water level at the pond during the field study and the salinity was fixed at 0 0 g l based on the measured salinity at the pond the water pressure on the submerged beach surface and sea floor was determined by the tidal seawater column above the beach surface i e ψ β tide h tide t z where β sea is the density ratio of seawater to freshwater htide t is the tide level and z is the elevation it was not possible to place a sensor far offshore to measure the lowest low tide therefore in order to calculate tide level htide t a theoretical expression of tide merritt 2004 was fitted to the observed water level at well w6 using the least squared method the theoretical expression is 4 h tide t h msl i 1 5 a i cos ω i t ϕ i where h msl denotes the mean sea level and the summation represents five harmonic components o1 k1 m2 s2 and n2 see table 2 for tides the parameters a i ω i and ϕ i are the amplitude m frequency radian hour and phase shift rad of the i th component of tide respectively although the theoretical expression for tide contains seventeen components we found it sufficient to use five components r2 0 99 the observed and simulated tidal levels are reported in fig 5 and the mean sea level and the values of the five tidal components are listed in table 2 the initial condition was a hydrostatic state at low tide with a sharp freshwater seawater interface as given by the ghyben herzberg approximation bear 1972 to obtain quasi steady state numerical solution several spring neap tidal cycles were run until the difference of the dependent variables water table and salinity between two successive spring neap tidal cycles became negligible 4 results 4 1 sediment properties based on the water saturation method the average porosity of the samples was equal to 0 31 table 3 the porosity does not impact the hydrodynamics of groundwater which greatly depends on the permeability sanford et al 1993 so the average value was used in the marun model based on the grain size distribution the results are not presented the effective diameter d10 was calculated and is reported in table 3 the average hydraulic conductivity at each well or pit see fig 3 estimated by the kozeny carman equation by taking the averaged d10 and porosity values is also reported in table 3 the average hydraulic conductivity was 0 002 m s based on the falling head test that was conducted at three different elevations 20 cm 65 cm and 70 cm deeper than the beach surface around the midtide line the hydraulic conductivities were computed eq 1 as 9 1 10 3 m s 1 4 10 6 m s and 8 0 10 7 m s respectively it is interesting that the hydraulic conductivity was four orders of magnitude smaller for a sample that was collected only 40 cm deeper these results show that the hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth exponentially bobo et al 2012 explored hydraulics in a gravel beach in pws alaska and reported that the hydraulic conductivity decreases sharply with depth and it was due to the reduction of the porosity as the sediment size distribution was essentially the same the reduction in porosity is probably due to sediment compaction due to tidal pumping while sediments near the surface are distributed by surface currents and waves other researchers noted the decrease in the porosity with depth in the beaches of pws atlas and bragg 2009 page et al 2008 and in other coastal aquifers briggs and richardson 1997 kimura and tsurumi 2004 the compaction in the field resulted in in situ hydraulic conductivity to be two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the hydraulic conductivity obtained by kozeny carman equation eq 2 in the lab the estimated hydraulic conductivity values based on the in situ tests and laboratory measurements were used as an initial guess for running the marun model the values of hydraulic conductivity were then calibrated based upon the groundwater table and salinity data observed in the field note that a criterion for the application of darcy s law is that reynolds number r e d10 q ν should be less than 1 0 in our case r e 10 3 m 10 6 m s 10 6 m2 s results in a value smaller than 1 thus in fairly general conditions in the beach the flow is laminar and darcy s law is valid the average values for capillary parameters were α 12 7 m 1 n 1 66 and sr 0 064 based on fitting to capillary retention curves as done in prior works boufadel et al 1998 geng et al 2017 4 2 water table fig 6 shows the variations of the observed and simulated water table with time at wells w1 w2 w4 and w6 for the duration of 89 h during falling tides the water level at w1 w2 and w4 dropped at the same speed as the tide then it abruptly became almost constant at a certain depth the water table at these three wells almost remained constant at an elevation higher than the pressure transducer this behavior of the water table variation is an indication of a two layer system where each layer is piecewise homogenous as an approximation a high permeability upper layer of loose material and a low permeability lower layer of compacted fine material bobo et al 2012 guo et al 2010 2014 li and boufadel 2010 xia et al 2010 this conceptual model was also supported by field investigation when the digging of pits became extremely difficult beyond a certain depth the higher elevation of the water table at wells w1 w2 and w4 above the pressure transducers during the low tide could be also an indication of freshwater recharge from the pond inland of the study transect the average water level in the pond was 2 6 m higher than the lowest water level at w1 providing a maximum seaward hydraulic gradient of 7 the water level at w6 showed the same behavior in a sense that the water level remained higher than the sensor elevation but the water level was decreasing slowly with time at w6 until the subsequent flood tide reached this well this slow decrease in water level can be due to lower permeability of the sediment at w6 and or more supply of water from the beach landward of w6 4 3 salinity fig 7 presents the observed and simulated salinity as function of time at three depths of wells w1 w6 the values reported from t 49 h almost two days after starting of water table measurement until t 90 h two seawater samples were collected from the sea adjacent to the beach and resulted in an average seawater salinity of 31 g l results from some of the ports were not available due to clogging the observed salinity at ports a and b of well w1 fluctuated with the tidal level dramatically at low tides the salinity values were small around 1 g l but as soon as tide reached to the ports the salinity rose abruptly and reached to 20 g l however this value was almost 10 g l lower than the seawater salinity no variation of salinity with depth is noted at this well at w2 the salinity of ports a b and c was in the range of 10 28 g l 5 30 g l and 1 31 g l respectively thus the variation of salinity increased with elevation i e when approaching the beach surface the pore water salinity of port b was equal to 30 g l at t 71 h high tide and it started decreasing with the tide falling the salinity at this port became eventually equal to 14 g l at t 77 h almost low tide similar to other near surface ports e g w1a and w1b salinity at port c demonstrated large fluctuations in response to tides the salinity at this port was almost equal to zero at low tide and it reached to seawater salinity at high tide an explanation of this behavior is provided next in fig 8 at w3 the salinity of port c was ranging from 23 to 31 g l and it was smaller than the values of port b fig 7 the salinity at this well did not follow a specific pattern at w4 salinity of ports a b and c were ranging from 17 27 g l 17 29 g l and 16 31 g l respectively surprisingly the average salinity at w4 was smaller of those at w3 this means that there was higher amount of freshwater at this well comparing to the w3 even if the w3 was closer to the pond one reason for that can be existence of different flow path due to the heterogeneity of the beach at low tide the salinity at port b of w5 was around 18 g l and when the tide reached to this port its salinity rose to 31 g l the salinity at port a was also ranging from 24 to 30 g l the salinity at port c was around 31 g l for most of the time except when the tide fell below the beach surface at w5 t 76 h at this time salinity dropped to 27 g l there were only two readings at port a of w6 the average of salinity at this port is 10 g l showing the existence of freshwater even in this well based on fig 7 whenever tide dropped the surface elevation at each well the salinity dropped rapidly as well especially at more landward wells this shows the high quantity of freshwater recharge from inland which could travel relatively fast in the upper layer with high permeability this was also noted in the field while digging the pits as the freshwater seepages were observed on the walls of the new dug pits 4 4 model validation verification the goal was to fit the simulation results of both water table and pore water salinity to the observed data while keeping the conceptual model as simple as possible the sediment properties such as capillary parameters hydraulic conductivity and porosity were estimated by analyzing the samples obtained in the field or by conducting the in situ tests table 3 these values were used as the initial estimates to run the simulations although the observed results water table and in situ hydraulic conductivity test suggested that the beach should be viewed as consisting of two layers with very different hydraulic conductivities we explored the case of the beach being homogenous different values a range from 1 10 4 m s to 5 10 2 m s were selected for the hydraulic conductivity of this one layer beach but none of those cases could explain the water table behavior in the pits even when we allowed the formation of a seepage face which was not present in reality the water table results for the one layer beach considering two different values for the hydraulic conductivity 5 10 3 m s and 10 3 m s are presented in fig 6 for the remainder of the paper we treat the beach as consisting of two layers for the upper layer in the intertidal zone the average hydraulic conductivity value 2 10 3 m s table 3 estimated based on the kozeny carman equation carrier 2003 was used as the initial guess the domain was extended to the pond at the landward boundary based on field observations the sediments in the area close to the pond at the surface consisted of a mixture of fine gravel and organic soil this suggests that hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer in the supratidal zone should be lower than that in the intertidal zone therefore two values were selected for the hydraulic conductivity a smaller value for zone 1 20 m x 0 m fig 4 and a larger value for zone 2 0 m x 75 m for the lower layer the average results of the in situ test at the depths of 0 65 m and 0 70 m 1 10 6 m s were chosen as the initial estimate the marun model was calibrated based upon the observed data and the values of the saturated hydraulic conductivities for the two layers and for zone 1 and zone 2 were determined for the lower layer the hydraulic conductivity was found to be around 10 5 m s the hydraulic conductivity for the upper layer was around 7 10 2 m s for zone 1 20 m x 0 m and around 5 10 2 m s for zone 2 0 m x 75 m the calibrated values were only an order of magnitude different than the initial values after pit excavation for well installation the original compacted less permeable material in the lower depths was replaced by the loosened mixed materials from the surface and lower depths this provided an unwanted increase in the permeability in the pit which was referred to as the pit effect in li and boufadel 2010 and li and boufadel 2011 this pit effect was accounted for in the model calibration by assigning a zone of the same permeability as the upper layer to the pits the measured capillary parameters in the lab were used in the model and were updated by model calibration it should be noted that the lower layer in the intertidal zone always remained submerged and as a result the capillary parameters for the upper layer were not applicable to this layer the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were selected based on the model calibration the model parameters and their values are listed in table 4 the simulated water table is compared with the observed results in fig 6 which shows that the marun model was able to reproduce the observed data very well as the difference between simulated and observed water tables was less than 2 0 cm with the exception of w6 at well w6 the simulated water level reached the low value of the observed water table rather rapidly this discrepancy could be due to local variation in the hydraulic conductivity around w6 based on the simulations if the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments in the pit at w6 and of the sediments around w6 is decreased the agreement between the observed and simulated water table will improve at w6 however in order to keep the model simple and more general the hydraulic conductivity of the materials in the pit at w6 was kept equal to that in other pits the hydraulic conductivity of the pits was equal to that of surface layer because of the pit effect discussed above fig 7 shows that the model was able to reproduce the overall pattern and values of the observed salinity at various depths of various wells for example at w2 the model was able to reproduce the small salinity variation at depth location a and the large salinity variation at the surface location c the same could be stated about w4 especially at times 68 h and around 76 h the model was less sensitive at w5 but the agreement was still good the agreement at w6 was poor but as stated earlier in the context of water level variation it is possible that local heterogeneity was strong there it is also possible that multiscale nonlinear behavior occurred that caused deviation from the tidal variation imposed on the model this behavior has been noted in other studies xin et al 2014 xin et al 2015 in addition for aquifer systems it is hard to achieve a quasi steady state due to incident wave and rainfall effects yu et al 2019 therefore implementing the quasi steady state achieved by synthetic tidal boundary as the initial condition for modeling may lead to discrepancy between simulations and observations 5 numerical investigations 5 1 effect of density gradient in the intertidal zone abdollahi nasab et al 2010 conducted experiments to investigate the flushing of saltwater out of a homogenous laboratory beach by freshwater with no tidal action they found that density difference between freshwater and seawater plays an important role for the high salinity case seawater concentration of 34 g l ataie ashtiani et al 2001 used a numerical model to investigate the influence of tidal fluctuation on contaminants carried by saline groundwater to the sea they did not include the higher density of seawater in their model as they assumed that the gradients generated by tidal fluctuations would be substantially larger than gradients and consequential velocity components because of the density effects here the goal is to examine how the density gradient will affect water flow and solute transport when strong tidal fluctuations are present the density effects on groundwater flow were assessed by comparing the results from the base case simulations with the simulation cases that neglected seawater groundwater density contrast in the first set of simulations the pit effect was included and the observed salinity and water table were compared with the simulation results of the case with no density effect fig 8 shows the variation of observed and simulated water table with time at wells w1 and w4 for the sake of brevity only the results of only two of four wells are demonstrated two simulation results are presented in the figure with one including the density effect control case and the other one neglecting it based on fig 8 ruling out the density effect would not affect the water table results as there was a decent match between the two simulated cases fig 9 shows the observed salinity at ports w1b and w4c along with the simulated results with and without density effects for the case with no density effect the salinity was very low at intermediate and deep ports w1b and w4c the maximum value was 1 5 g l respectively also the salinity no longer fluctuated over time as noted in the observation or density dependent results fig 7 when the density effect was not taken into account the simulated results did not reproduce the observation results fig 10 compares the salinity distribution during a falling tide t 75 h in the intact beach i e the pits were assumed not to be present between the case with the density effect included and the case that neglected it the water table in the beach is shown by black dashed line and the sea level is shown with dashed blue line based on fig 10a when the density effect was considered the seawater occupied the upper layer in the submerged part of the beach also the seawater was diluted by freshwater landward of the intersection of groundwater table and the beach surface on the other hand when the density effect was not incorporated in the model fig 10b the freshwater washed out the seawater in the upper layer also the seawater did not penetrate the beach in the submerged part neglecting the density effect means that the seawater and freshwater have the same density and therefore buoyancy will not affect solute transport anymore in this case seawater infiltration and associated mixing with groundwater was underestimated that is probably the reason that relatively lower salinity for w1b and w4c was calculated for the no density case compared to the density dependent case fig 9 indicating the important role of density gradient in controlling solute transport in the intertidal zone it was mentioned that the density gradient between freshwater and groundwater did not affect the water table in the beach based on fig 8 moreover comparing fig 10a and b suggests that the shape of water table was unaffected when the density gradient was neglected this is probably due to the fact that the fluctuations of the groundwater table in the simulated domain were primarily constrained by landward and seaward boundary conditions which were assigned the same for both cases the results to some extent show that the model that neglected density effects reproduced the fluctuations of groundwater table in the beach intertidal zone but greatly underestimated salinity variations this model could be validated by matching perfectly to observed groundwater table from monitoring wells but it could not predict the complexity of groundwater flow and associated solute transport processes in tidally influenced beach accurately 5 2 effect of bedrock on solute transport in this section the goal is to investigate the effect of bedrock on solute transport in a beach aquifer the volumetric flow rate can be defined as the flow velocity of water or fluids multiplied by the cross sectional area if the flow passage area shrinks while the flow rate is constant the velocity magnitude consequently increases the flow passage area in a simple unconfined beach aquifer is bounded by the beach surface from the top and the bedrock at the bottom alternating the flow passage area e g by considering various depths of bedrock with respect to the beach surface could affect the solute transport in beaches the effect of depth and slope of the bedrock on solute transport was noted by li et al 2008 who investigated the tide induced seawater groundwater circulation in shallow beach aquifers the saltwater wedge seaward of the low tide line was not observed in their beach aquifer in contrast to many other studies of coastal aquifers e g ataie ashtiani et al 2001 werner and lockington 2006 the shallow depth of the aquifer they studied resulted in high seaward groundwater flow that washed out the saltwater wedge to sea in order to investigate how the depth and slope of bedrock affect solute transport two beach domains with different depths and slopes of bedrock fig 11 were designed the first domain was designed to model a shallow beach aquifer in this case the bedrock was assumed to be few centimeters deeper than the bottom elevation of the pits at each well table 1 and the slope of the bedrock was variable in the second domain the bedrock was horizontal deep aquifer with zero slope for the bedrock and located at the elevation of 3 6 m with respect to the lowest low tide elevation during the field study as mentioned previously the thickness of the domain for the control case was 3 m uniform depth or parallel bedrock the simulations of water table and salinity were conducted using the three types of bedrock the pit effect was taken into account in the first set of simulations results which were not presented in this paper show that the depth of bedrock didn t affect the water table in the pits and there was a perfect agreement across all the cases there were minor discrepancies between the salinity results for deep aquifer horizontal bedrock and the control case parallel bedrock 3 m uniform thickness of the domain fig 12 compares the observed salinity at all ports of well w4 with the simulation results of the shallow aquifer and deep aquifer this figure shows that the maximum difference between two cases was only 2 g l which is 6 of the seawater salinity the salinity in the deep aquifer was lower than the salinity in the shallow aquifer most of the time the thickness of the lower layer low permeability layer in the deep aquifer was much larger than the thickness in the shallow aquifer this means that higher freshwater recharge from left in the deep aquifer can further dilute the seawater fig 13 compares the spatial salinity at falling tide t 75 h among the three domains with different bedrock depth for the intact beach one could conclude that the upper saline plume in the intertidal zone was not greatly affected by the depth of bedrock with respect to the beach surface this could be due to the existence of the two layer system the permeability of the upper layer was around three orders of magnitude higher than the permeability in the lower layer and as a result the velocity values were much larger in the upper layer comparing to the lower layer this means that for this system most of the exchange occurs in the upper layer and therefore the depth of bedrock will not affect water flow and solute transport in the upper layer of the two layer system particle tracking was used to elucidate the impact of the depth to bedrock on groundwater flow pathways random walk particle tracking rwpm has been used to simulate transport in porous media geng and boufadel 2015 labolle et al 1996 tompson 1993 the basic idea is to approximate the travel path of a quantity by a collection of particles transporting by the velocity and dispersion field in the domain in this research this method is used to compare the water pathways among the cases with different depths of bedrock therefore the transport by convection was only considered and dispersion was not included in this case the location of a particle at a given time is governed by only the velocity vector and its previous location and can be expressed as 5 x p t δ t x p t v δ t where x p t is the location vector of particle p l at time t δ t is the time step t and v is the groundwater velocity vector lt 1 obtained from the marun model because of the low permeability of the lower layer the particles traveled in this layer very slowly and therefore the marun code was run for several spring neap tidal cycle to generate long term data as the input for the particle tracking code particles were released from a location close to the pond x 19 85 m z 5 7 m fig 14 shows the flow paths of freshwater originated from the pond and compares how the depth of bedrock with respect to the beach surface affected particles transport the particles moving in the shallow aquifer took the shortest travel distance and the particles moving in the deep aquifer took the longest travel distance when the bedrock was considered deep the particles migrated deeper into the beach which is probably due to the increased freedom of transport when the tide reaches its highest value conversely when the bedrock is close to the beach surface the particles cannot penetrate deeper nevertheless the travel distance of the particles during three months was comparable among the three cases the results presented here showed that for solutes emanating from the pond landward of the beach the depth of bedrock has a sizeable effect on solute transport in the lower layer but has a minor effect on transport in the upper layer 6 persistence of exxon valdez oil in subsurface michel et al 2009 studied several beaches in pws based on their observations there was no subsurface oil lingering in the beaches where a small pond occurred behind the storm berm the mechanism that relates the freshwater recharge to the oil disappearance from some of the gravel beaches in alaska is explored here fig 15 reports the pond water level and water temperature fluctuations over one year after the study period in summer of 2008 the pond water level was equal to 6 5 m during the field study from july 2008 to june 2009 the minimum maximum and average water levels were equal to 6 20 m 7 15 m and 6 75 m respectively to explore how the freshwater in the pond affects the water table in the beach two simulations with different pond water levels were conducted for the first case the water level in the pond was equal to the yearly average of that 6 75 m for the second case the water level at the pond was set equal to 5 6 m which was only 40 cm above the level of highest high tide this level is assumed to be the lowest level of water table in the beach far enough from the intertidal zone the simulations were conducted with the pit effect included fig 16 compares the water level at the pits assuming three different pond water levels based on fig 16 when the water level was lowest in the pond pond water level at 5 6 m the water table at w1 and w2 dropped only few centimeters below the interface of the two layers on the other hand the water table at w4 and w6 stayed on the interface for the whole period when the water level at pond was at the elevation of 6 5 m during the field study the water table at the wells stayed at or above the interface of the two layers when the simulations were conducted considering the water level in the pond equal to the average of that over a year pond water level of 6 75 m the water table at the pits stayed few centimeters above the interface of the two layers in all of the wells this means that even at the lowest low tide there was always freshwater flow in the pits it can be argued that at the time of exxon valdez oil spill after the oil reached the beaches in pws the upper layer stored the oil temporarily whenever the water table dropped below the two layers interface the oil penetrated into the lower layer and entrapped there because of the capillary forces due to the fine sediments of the lower layer the oil persisted on the left side of the beach not studied here between the mid tide line and the low tide line short et al 2004 the right side of the beach was clean at the time of the field study though the observed results suggest that there was high freshwater recharge to the right side of the beach based on the results presented in fig 16 for any water levels at the pond the water table stayed always at or above the interface of the two layers at least at the wells w4 and w6 which were located in the mid tide and low tide zone of the beach respectively it can be concluded that high freshwater recharge promotes the removal of oil by sustaining a high water table in the intertidal zone at low tides the same mechanism was observed in the work of li and boufadel 2010 xia et al 2010 and guo et al 2010 therefore it is less likely to find oil in locations with a source of freshwater recharge like a pond or freshwater stream if beaches with similar setup of the beach studied here two layer system are polluted it is important to keep the oil from penetrating to the lower layer this can be done by applying water onto the upper layer at high tide line to sustain the water table above the interface of the two layers in the intertidal zone 7 conclusions the focus of this paper was on the analyses of hydrodynamic factors affecting water and solute transport in gravel beaches and evaluation of their potential impact on coastal areas that are subjected to multiple stressors such as saltwater intrusion sea level rise and oil spills pollution the investigation was carried out through a field study complemented with numerical simulations in a tidally influenced beach in pws alaska usa the field measurements showed that oil persisted on the left side of the beach when looking landward from sea but no oil residues were found in the right side of the beach at the time of the field study when a transect was established there the observed water level results the in situ and lab sediment analyses and the field observations indicated the presence of a two layer structure in the beach this system is characterized by a high permeability layer overlaying a much lower permeability layer as one notes by the levelling off of the water table when it reaches the interface of the two layers the observed salinity decreased at many sensors indicating a relatively large fresh ground water recharge to the transect the two layer system in conjunction with inland recharge seems to play an important role in the persistence or lack thereof of oil in pws beaches inland recharge sustains a high water table in the beach during low tides and subsequently prevents the oil from infiltrating into the lower permeability lower layer also high seaward flow in the upper layer could cause the dislodgement of oil and its washout to sea after calibrating the model marun numerical simulations were conducted to assess the effect of density gradient and shape of bedrock on the solute transport in the gravel beaches the simulation results indicated the important role of density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater in controlling the solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach the model neglecting the density gradient well reproduced fluctuations of the water table observed from monitoring wells but caused poor match of salinity variations to field measurements this indicates that single depth groundwater table measurements from the monitoring wells installed along the across shore transect might not be adequate to delineate the complexity of groundwater flow and associated solute transport processes in tidally influenced beach as density gradient between seawater and groundwater as a major driving force could not be fully reflected through those measurements numerical investigations also suggested that depth and slope of bedrock has a minor effect on the solute transport in the upper layer of two layer beaches while it greatly alters groundwater flow and solute transport processes in the lower layer the particle tracking indicated that when the bedrock was assumed deep the water particles migrated deeper into the beach while they advected close to the beach surface when the bedrock considered shallow the combined field and numerical study presented herein could be used to infer possible reasons for the lack of oil on the right side of the beach findings from this work in relation to oil contaminated beaches include 1 oil tends to persist at locations of small freshwater recharge 2 prior to oil arriving to the shoreline one could minimize oil
