23775,seasonal prediction highly depends on its initialization scheme currently the operational utilization of advanced data assimilation methods in the oceanic initialization is still relatively less and its benefit is far from being fully unveiled in this study the community earth system model cesm is configured with an ensemble adjustment kalman filter eakf to initialize the seasonal prediction the performance of the established prediction system is assessed by comparing it with a benchmark prediction system which is based on the same model but with a nudging scheme results show that the assimilation of only oceanic observations can not only effectively constrain the oceanic variables but also improves the atmospheric variables through coupling processes which helps to produce accurate and compatible initial conditions with the initial conditions the current prediction system is better than the benchmark prediction system and can produce skillful predictions for sea surface temperature ocean heat content air temperature at 2 m precipitation and major climate variabilities including el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod the current prediction system also shows better ensemble consistency and less prediction drifts which could contribute to the improvement of prediction skill keywords coupled data assimilation seasonal prediction cesm dart eakf data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal prediction has long been paid much attention due to its profound economic and societal influences stockdale et al 1998 doblas reyes et al 2013 becker et al 2022 statistical models xue et al 2000 ren et al 2018 ding et al 2018 dynamical models cane et al 1986 chen et al 1997 rosati et al 1997 and their combinations tang et al 2001 zhang and gao 2016 are all applied in the seasonal prediction although statistical models based on machine learning methods have aroused strong interests recently due to their impressive performance ham et al 2019 liu et al 2021 schneider et al 2022 dynamical predictions governed by relatively clear physics have been routinely issued as the main procedure in various leading centers worldwide palmer et al 2004 jin et al 2008 wang et al 2009 kirtman et al 2014 liu et al 2015 tompkins et al 2017 weisheimer et al 2020 data assimilation has therefore become much more attractive and widely adopted to provide dynamical predictions with accurate initial conditions martin et al 2015 hoteit et al 2018 carrassi et al 2018 moore et al 2019 although initial conditions of atmosphere and land are important for the seasonal prediction hudson et al 2011 materia et al 2014 previous studies have shown that the oceanic initialization plays the dominant role in coupled models because the ocean contributes much of the predictability chen et al 2004 balmaseda and anderson 2009 however the oceanic initialization schemes have been relatively simple balmaseda et al 2009 penny and hamill 2017 for example by implementing a sea surface temperature sst nudging scheme into a fully coupled general circulation model cgcm initial conditions compatible between the atmosphere and ocean were generated and remarkable el niño southern oscillation enso prediction skill was achieved by luo et al 2005 ham et al 2014 revealed that the national aeronautics and space administration nasa geos 5 seasonal prediction system borovikov et al 2019 based on a multivariate ensemble optimal interpolation enoi assimilation scheme was improved compared to its previous version based on optimal interpolation oi the canadian seasonal to interannual prediction system cansips merryfield et al 2013 lin et al 2020 also adopted a nudging scheme for its sst and a simplified variational procedure described by tang et al 2004 for the subsurface temperature these assimilation methods were employed mainly because they are cost effective but the lack of flow dependent background error covariances could be a limitation on their assimilation performance with the rapid development of computation capacity state of the art data assimilation methods which can provide flow dependent background error covariances zupanski and dusanka 1997 evensen 1994 anderson 2001 kalnay et al 2007 are increasingly adopted in the oceanic initialization to generate reanalysis products zhang et al 2007a b counillon et al 2016 karspeck et al 2018 tang et al 2020 o kane et al 2021 and initialize seasonal predictions sugiura et al 2008 vecchi et al 2014 zhenya et al 2015 wang et al 2019 gade et al 2022 for example an ensemble coupled data assimilation was developed to generate historical analysis at the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl zhang et al 2007a b chang et al 2013 and the generated initial conditions were also used to initialize the seasonal prediction vecchi et al 2014 wang et al 2019 employed the norwegian climate prediction model norcpm with the ensemble kalman filter enkf to assimilate sst in the manner of anomaly field initialization smith et al 2013 hu et al 2020 results showed that their prediction system exhibited comparable or even higher skills in contrast to the north american multi model ensemble nmme kirtman et al 2014 at 6 and 12 month lead times gade et al 2022 established a data assimilation system based on the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2014 and the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf hunt et al 2007 to initialize monsoon prediction nonetheless despite the aforementioned studies the operational utilization of these advanced data assimilation methods in seasonal prediction is still not wide spread and the benefit is yet to be fully explored studies also suggest that competitive skills can be achieved by implementing nudging schemes zhu et al 2017 liu et al 2022 the data assimilation developed in this study was based on the data assimilation research testbed dart anderson et al 2009 dart is an open source software developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar to provide implementations of a variety of filter methods among the various methods the ensemble adjustment kalman filter eakf is the most widely adopted and carefully studied one karspeck et al 2018 following the lead of previous studies the present study has established a data assimilation system based on the community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 and eakf oceanic observations including sst and subsurface temperature and salinity t s were assimilated in the full field manner to initialize the seasonal prediction the main goal of this study is to assess the performance of the current prediction system by comparing it with a benchmark system that was established with the same model but a nudging scheme song et al 2022a meanwhile the emphasis is also placed on investigating the impact of the two initialization schemes the results of the present study should reveal benefits that can be obtained from the use of an advanced initialization scheme the eakf and offer new clues on how to improve the seasonal prediction skill the remainder of this article is organized as follows section 2 introduces details of the two prediction systems in section 3 results are presented to reveal the performance of the current prediction system and benefits of the applied initialization scheme section 4 summarizes the results and provides discussions 2 prediction systems and the experimental design coupled models have proven useful for providing more compatible initial conditions via coupled data assimilation fujii et al 2009 mulholland et al 2015 penny and hamill 2017 zhang et al 2020a b and improving the seasonal prediction jin et al 2008 kug et al 2008 saha et al 2014 in this study a fully coupled model cesm was used for the initialization and prediction throughout the present study the cesm was configured with the eakf as a newly developed prediction system which is referred to as cesm e in the following study for comparison a benchmark prediction system that was established based on the same model but with a nudging scheme is introduced and referred to as cesm n description of the two prediction systems and design of the hindcast experiments will be presented in detail in this section 2 1 the cesm e prediction system the cesm is an open source global coupled model developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar the version 1 2 1 was used in this study hurrell et al 2013 the atmosphere component is the community atmospheric model version 4 cam4 neale et al 2012 the ocean component is the parallel ocean program version 2 pop2 danabasoglu et al 2012 the sea ice component is the community ice code version 4 cice4 holland et al 2012 and the land component is the community land model version 4 clm4 lawrence et al 2011 horizontally the model has a nominal 1 resolution vertically it has 26 layers and 60 layers for the atmosphere and the ocean respectively the atmosphere and ocean are coupled once per day without any flux corrections the cesm has been widely assessed and used in a number of studies deser et al 2012 capotondi 2013 li et al 2016 yao et al 2016 tan et al 2020 the model was run in the twentieth century climate state forced by the solar output greenhouse gases aerosols and volcanic activity in the corresponding time period gent et al 2011 the data assimilation system was implemented with dart in this study anderson et al 2009 karspeck et al 2018 castruccio et al 2020 table 1 details the cesm e data assimilation scheme the ocean observations including sst and in situ t s profiles from the optimum interpolation sea surface temperature oisst dataset version 2 1 huang et al 2021 and the en4 profile dataset version 4 2 1 good et al 2013 respectively were assimilated via the eakf an ensemble of 20 members and an assimilation frequency of 10 days were adopted similar to the setting in many previous works balmaseda et al 2009 martin et al 2015 zhang and rosati 2010 thus observations during the 5 days before and after the assimilation step were assimilated into the model a spatially varying but temporally invariant observational error was assigned to the t s profiles by calculating climatological variabilities using the gridded en4 objective analysis data in terms of the sst observations the uncertainty estimation provided by the product itself was assigned as the observational error the eakf is a sophisticated data assimilation method that can provide flow dependent background error covariances meaning that the 20 members in the assimilation evolve through time based on model dynamics analysis increments are obtained from the statistics of those members and are then used to update the prior ensembles the eakf is also a multi variate assimilation method through statistical covariance influences in the analysis step the directly assimilated variables can have an impact on other ocean variables including the temperature salinity vector current and sea surface height ssh in the forecast step updated ocean variables can lead to the improvement of variables in other components through flux exchange which can ultimately lead to the more balanced initial conditions for prediction by running an ensemble of members the eakf can naturally provide initial conditions for ensemble prediction without further perturbations to the produced analyses due to the use of a finite number of ensemble members most ensemble filters suffer from spurious long distance correlations and tend to underestimate the background variance a fifth order piecewise polynomial localization function gaspari and cohn 1999 was used in this study for localization to restrict the impact of geographically remote observations with an isotropic radius of about 600 km in the horizontal vertically the localization radius was 250 m and 1000 m for the sst and t s profiles respectively based on the result of sensitivity experiments a constant prior inflation factor of 1 02 was used to alleviate the spread collapse in addition it was found that the initial state can have great impact on the assimilation performance of the current data assimilation system in this study the initial state used in the assimilation was from a long term model integration with its t s replaced by the world ocean atlas woa garcia et al 2019 counterparts before the assimilation more details about the assimilation scheme and the performance of the current data assimilation system are provided in chen et al 2022 2 2 the cesm n prediction system the benchmark prediction system cesm n is also based on the cesm version 1 2 1 but with the nudging method which is a simple but broadly used data assimilation approach chen et al 2004 keenlyside et al 2005 luo et al 2005 sandery et al 2011 baehr et al 2015 ren et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 song et al 2022a in the nudging scheme the model states are relaxed to the observed or reanalyzed counterparts by adding a forcing term to the prognostic equations the forcing term depends on the difference between model and observation and is usually scaled by an empirically determined nudging coefficient an advantage of such method is that it can be easily implemented in coupled systems with low computational burden however biases in reanalysis data together with those in the model could further degrade the assimilation performance in addition the empirically determined nudging coefficient may also impair the assimilation performance because it is not an optimal or objective method and contains considerable artificial components table 2 details the cesm n data assimilation scheme in cesm n the ocean temperature was nudged to the global ocean data assimilation system godas reanalysis behringer and xue 2004 the depth dependent nudging timescale for ocean temperature decreases from 10 days at the surface to 150 days at 400 m approximately according to a hyperbolic tangent function for the atmosphere wind components below 500 hpa were nudged to the 6 hour era interim berrisford et al 2011 with a constant nudging timescale of 6 h unlike cesm e cesm n runs with a single member thus the analysis needs to be perturbed to yield multiple initial conditions for ensemble prediction for this purpose the climatically relevant singular vectors csv kleeman et al 2003 tang et al 2006 were calculated to produce perturbation modes to approximate the fastest growth errors which are recognized as the optimal growth errors palmer et al 1993 toth and kalnay 1997 cheng et al 2010 the csv obtained perturbation modes were then used to perturb the cesm n subsurface temperature to yield the 20 member ensemble the cesm n hindcast experiment was conducted from 1881 to 2017 to investigate the decadal predictability of enso liu et al 2022 and indian ocean dipole iod song et al 2022b the results showed that cesm n exhibited good performance that can be comparable to the multi model ensemble mean of nmme kirtman et al 2014 details about the cesm n prediction system including csv perturbation modes can be found in song et al 2022a 2 3 the experimental design the cesm e assimilation was run from 2005 because of limited computational resource a benchmark prediction system is required to evaluate the performance of cesm e as aforementioned cesm n is used as the benchmark prediction system for comparison in the present study the reasons are twofold firstly previous studies have shown that cesm n exhibits comparable skills in predicting enso and iod events during a long time period liu et al 2022 song et al 2022b by comparing cesm e with cesm n we can have a general picture of the status of cesm e among those widely examined prediction systems secondly the two prediction systems are based on the same version of model which enables us to determine what difference in the initialization schemes contributes to the difference in prediction skills as such in this study the assessed hindcasts for both cesm e and cesm n start from 2006 to 2017 12 years predictions are issued on the first day of each january april july and october for 12 months one month lead prediction is here defined as the model integration averaged over the same calendar month of the initial time for example the averaged model integration over january is the prediction of one month lead initialized from the 1st january 2 4 verification data the examined variables include the sst ocean subsurface t s wind speed air temperature and large scale total precipitation rate some regular observations and reanalysis products were leveraged as verification data the sst dataset is the hadley centre sea ice and sea surface temperature dataset hadisst rayner et al 2003 the subsurface t s data are from the objective analysis data of the en4 2 1 dataset good et al 2013 the wind speed and air temperature data are from the era5 hersbach et al 2019 precipitation data are from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2003 all the above products cover a 12 year period from january 2006 to december 2017 and are interpolated onto the uniform 1 grid the anomalies of each variable are relative to their climatology averaged over the period from 2006 to 2017 for convenience these verification data are referred to as obs in the following discussions since the en4 t s profiles were assimilated in cesm e the use of en4 objective analysis product as verification data for the subsurface temperature may lead to an issue regarding independence of the verification data to address this concern widely assessed reanalyses including godas gfdl ecda zhang et al 2007a b chang et al 2013 and oras5 zuo et al 2019 which are constructed with different models observational datasets assimilation methods quality control procedures and so on were also used for verification of the subsurface temperature 3 results in this section the initial conditions analyses of cesm e are first compared to a long term free integration of the model denoted as noassim to examine the biases of model climatology which is helpful for the interpretation of the subsequent results mean biases of each variable are calculated over the period from 2006 to 2017 then prediction skills are assessed by comparing cesm e with cesm n the skill assessments are all based on deterministic measures two commonly applied metrics the anomaly correlation coefficient acc and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the prediction skill finally prediction biases are examined to show possible reasons that lead to the difference between the two prediction systems due to relatively large uncertainties in high latitudes we defined the global domain as the horizontal area from 60 s to 60 n and 180 w to 180 e in this study unless otherwise noted 3 1 initial conditions fig 1 depicts the horizontal distribution of the mean sst and sea surface salinity sss biases for noassim and cesm e respectively fig 1 a shows warm biases around 1 c in most of the global ocean for noassim there are also apparent large biases exceeding 3 c in regions such as the gulf stream region the major upwelling regions and the southern hemisphere midlatitudes these systematic errors commonly exist in the cesm gent et al 2011 and other coupled models wang et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 b these biases can be effectively reduced in cesm e due to the assimilation of sst but some biases persist in areas such as the gulf stream and southern ocean fig 1 c reveals that there are fresh biases over most of global regions and salty biases in the north atlantic east pacific and arctic in noassim most of these biases are reduced in cesm e fig 1 d because of the assimilation of salinity profiles but large biases remain in some coastal regions such as the maritime continent western tropical atlantic and in the arctic there also exist obvious salinity biases due to the absence of sea ice assimilation in the arctic the assimilation of sss and sea ice observations could ameliorate the situation fig 2 illustrates the mean temperature and salinity biases below the sea surface noassim shows a positive bias at all depths as shown in fig 2 a the assimilation of temperature profiles significantly reduces these biases as a result cesm e shows very close mean temperature compared to obs except a small bias remains at around 100 m depth with respect to salinity as shown in fig 2 b the model exhibits systematic negative biases above approximately 800 m and positive biases below likewise these biases are effectively decreased in cesm e in addition cesm e is generally in good agreement with current widely used reanalyses including oras5 godas and ecda indicating that the influence of verification data on results should be small above results demonstrate that the assimilation of oceanic observations can effectively correct the corresponding oceanic variables previous studies have shown that the assimilation of oceanic observations can also reduce biases in the atmospheric component through coupling processes fujii et al 2009 dong et al 2016 tang et al 2020 here we examine to what extent the assimilation of oceanic observations can ameliorate the atmospheric variables in the current model fig 3 reveals the mean biases of the air temperature and wind speed at 992 hpa the bottom level of the atmospheric component of the coupled model and of the large scale total precipitation rate noassim shows warm biases of more than 2 c in most ocean basins which exhibits a similar spatial pattern to the sst bias indicating the role of ocean in heating the atmosphere the corresponding wind biases of the model are also shown in fig 3 a the air temperature and wind biases are decreased to a large extent in cesm e by only assimilating oceanic components fig 3 b the air temperature bias is reduced by approximately 1 k over almost the whole global ocean the wind bias over the ocean is also correspondingly reduced it is worth noting that the reduced air temperature and wind biases at the surface can lead to even stronger adjustment in the upper troposphere through enhanced convection and the lapse rate feedback as also in tang et al 2020 the improvement of bias over land however is not apparent noassim shows the characteristic pattern of the double intertropical convergence zone itcz problem with excessive precipitation off the equator and insufficient precipitation on the equator lin 2007 as shown in fig 3 c the biases are much mitigated in cesm e with a smaller positive bias occurring along the equator as shown in fig 3 d it suggests that the better representation of sst in the cgcm could be a remedy to the double itcz problem zhang and wang 2006 zhang et al 2007a b li and xie 2014 in addition biases in the tropical indian and atlantic ocean are also decreased to some extent although some biases deteriorate in regions such as the south asia and central africa 3 2 prediction skills 3 2 1 sst fig 4 reflects sst prediction skills in cesm e and cesm n the left panel shows the sst acc in cesm e at the 1 6 and 11 month lead times it is above 90 significance level when acc is greater than 0 19 according to one tailed student s t test with the degree of freedom of 46 as shown in fig 4 a cesm e has a high prediction skill at the 1 month lead time with accs above 0 6 in almost all ocean basins the most predictable regions appear in the central and eastern pacific where accs can be above 0 9 indicating the potentially large influence of enso the prediction skill drops as the lead time increases but the central pacific is still relatively skillful even at the 11 month lead time in general cesm e exhibits apparent larger extent of skillful regions compared to cesm n at all lead times at the lead month 1 cesm e shows obvious improvements in regions such as the indian ocean and western pacific the improvement at the first lead time is to a large extent due to the superiority of the initialization scheme specifically cesm e assimilated sst observation via the eakf while cesm n was nudged towards the godas one reason is that the godas sst is not as precise as the real observation another probable reason is that the nudging timescale at the surface may not be well tuned global averaged accs shown in the top right of each panel confirm the conclusion that cesm e exhibits generally higher sst skill than cesm n 3 2 2 ocean heat content the variability of upper ocean heat content is of great significance for seasonal prediction xue et al 2000 zheng et al 2007 fig 5 is presented to reveal the prediction skill of upper ocean heat content the upper ocean heat content is estimated by averaging the sea temperature from the surface to 300 m depth denoted as hc300 hereafter as shown in fig 5 hc300 shows higher predictability than sst with accs in many pacific areas exceeding 0 9 at the first lead month and generally higher accs at other lead times at lead month 1 cesm e and cesm n have close accs in most ocean basins the global mean hc300 accs in cesm e and cesm n are 0 67 and 0 68 respectively verified against the en4 objective analysis it indicates that the nudging scheme may indeed have an assimilation quality in some regions comparable to that obtained from an advanced data assimilation method but the same scheme may not well apply in other regions due to the deficiencies of the method such as the empirically determined nudging timescale and its dependence on quality of the reanalysis products that the model is nudged to on the contrary the flow dependent data assimilation method is able to achieve the more reasonable distribution of the background error and thus yield high skills as the lead time increases cesm e shows generally higher skills than cesm n in most ocean basins at lead month 11 the global mean hc300 accs in cesm e and cesm n are 0 27 and 0 24 respectively it should be noted that no obvious difference was found when oras5 and ecda are used as the verification data 3 2 3 air temperature and precipitation above results reveal that cesm e exhibits superior performance in terms of the prediction skills of sst and hc300 in addition to sst and hc300 the seasonal prediction skills of 2 m air temperature t2 m and total precipitation tp are also evaluated it should be noted that no atmospheric observation was assimilated in cesm e while cesm n was nudged to the wind field from reanalysis fig 6 reflects the prediction skill of 2 m air temperature the horizontal distribution of t2 m accs resembles the distribution of sst and hc300 with the most predictable regions appearing in the central and eastern pacific and remaining up to lead month 11 at the 1 month lead time cesm n shows higher accs over land because of its nudging of wind fields the global mean t2 m accs in cesm n and cesm e are 0 54 and 0 51 respectively over the entire ocean domain however cesm e is comparable to cesm n and has obvious improvements over many regions such as the western indian ocean and western pacific which is consistent with that in sst the global mean accs over the entire ocean domain in cesm n and cesm e are 0 61 and 0 60 respectively at the 11 month lead time cesm e shows generally better performance than cesm n the global mean accs in cesm n and cesm e are 0 14 and 0 12 respectively fig 7 reflects the prediction skill of total precipitation tp in cesm e and cesm n the prediction of tp is much more difficult than that of sst hc300 and t2 m at the 1 and 3 month lead times the high tp prediction skill in cesm e mainly locates in the tropical pacific while cesm n seems to have higher skills in some land and extratropical areas where both prediction systems show relatively low skills tropical averaged accs show that cesm e and cesm n are comparable at lead month 1 and cesm e is slightly better than cesm n at lead month 3 with their accs of 0 22 and 0 20 respectively this result together with that shown in the t2 m prediction is quite encouraging because no atmospheric observations were assimilated in cesm e while cesm n was nudged to era wind fields it suggests the critical impact of sst assimilation on the prediction skill of t2 m and tp over the ocean due to the good relationship between sst and t2 m and tp feng et al 2018 fujii et al 2021 meanwhile the results reveal that the assimilation of only ocean observations may not be enough to provide skillful prediction over land and that the atmosphere and land initialization should also be considered to increase the t2 m and tp prediction skill in the future study 3 2 4 enso and iod the seasonal prediction skill is closely related to climate variability such as enso mcphaden et al 2006 tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a b and iod saji and yamagata 2003 liu et al 2017 doi et al 2020 because of their global impact fig 8 presents the acc and rmse between the observed and predicted nino3 4 time series the nino3 4 index was calculated by averaging sst anomalies over the niño3 4 region 5 s 5 n 170 w 120 w the two prediction systems both beat the persistence prediction cesm e exhibits slightly higher acc than cesm n when the lead month is more than 4 and less than 10 although they show very close skills in the first 4 months in addition cesm e shows the slightly lower rmse than cesm n at approximately all lead months indicating smaller sst anomaly errors in cesm e it should be noted that the ensemble spread in cesm e is higher than that in cesm n by between 0 05 and 0 1 at all lead times this indicates that cesm e may have a more reasonable ensemble distribution which can to a larger extent represent the possible distribution of errors it reveals one of the eakf s benefits as an assimilation approach to generate an ensemble of initial conditions for the ensemble prediction conveniently and effectively yet the ensemble spread in both prediction systems is far less than the rmse indicating that the model is overconfident in the nino3 4 region fig 9 presents the acc and rmse between the observed and predicted dipole mode index dmi time series following saji et al 1999 the dmi is defined as the sst anomaly difference between the western pole 50 70 e 10 s 10 n and eastern pole 90 110 e 10 s 0 of the tropical indian ocean in terms of acc the two prediction systems both beat the persistence prediction and cesm e shows the obvious higher accs than cesm n at all lead times in addition cesm e shows the generally lower rmse than cesm n it is interesting that the two systems show close rmses to the persistence prediction which indicates rather large uncertainty in the tropical indian ocean moreover as in the tropical pacific cesm e spread agrees well with its rmse compared to cesm n in the tropical indian indicating again the better ensemble distribution in cesm e which could be one reason responsible for its better performance the result is consistent with that in gade et al 2022 who showed that the initial conditions generated by an ensemble based weakly coupled data assimilation system tended to maintain the ensemble consistency throughout the prediction 3 2 5 rmses and the random walk test table 3 shows the global mean rmses between the predicted and observed sst hc300 t2 m and tp anomalies respectively for different lead times cesm e exhibits better performance than cesm n in general for example the sst rmses at the first lead month in cesm e and cesm n are 0 33 and 0 38 respectively indicating a 13 improvement in cesm e as lead time increases the improvement in cesm e sst drops in terms of hc300 rmse cesm e and cesm n show comparable skills verified against different reanalyses for t2 m the cesm e shows smaller rmse at the first lead month this is encouraging since there is no atmospheric data assimilated in cesm e the reason however is still unclear and needs further investigation for tp rmses in cesm e and cesm n are 1 06 and 1 23 at one month lead time respectively corresponding to a 14 improvement in cesm e which is consistent with that in sst a procedure based on random walks is applied to examine prediction skill differences and highlights the significance of the reported skill differences delsole and tippett 2016 a count increases by 1 when the cesm e is less skillful than cesm n and decreases by 1 otherwise the count is accumulated forward in time over all initial months and years of the hindcast if the distance traveled by a random walk falls outside the 5 and 95 interval of a binomial distribution then the hypothesis of equally skillful predictions is rejected at the 10 significance level fig 10 reveals skill differences based on random walks at 1 month lead between cesm e and cesm n fig 10 a shows that cesm e nino3 and nino3 4 indices are more skillful than cesm n after only a few steps in addition it indicates that cesm e and cesm n have comparable dmi prediction skill at one month lead time based on the random walk fig 10 b reflects that cesm e is more skillful in predicting sst anomaly pattern correlations over different regions including the global ocean pacific and indian ocean 3 3 prediction bias when predictions are initialized with the full field states derived from observations the predictions will drift toward the model s own climatology due to the systematic model biases misra et al 2008 magnusson et al 2013 saurral et al 2021 in addition to the gradual model drift the full field initialization may also lead to a rapid initial adjustment of the model if there is a large imbalance between the prescribed initial conditions and the model dynamics known as the initialization shock problem tang et al 2003 mulholland et al 2015 the conventional method for removing the drifting climatology of predictions cannot eliminate the influence of biased processes that can degrade the predictions through various coupled feedbacks kim et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 siongco et al 2020 wu et al 2022 therefore the prediction bias should be less if one initialization scheme is more reasonable the prediction bias is estimated as the difference between the predicted and observed climatology over the hindcast period at different lead times fig 11 reflects the mean sst prediction bias at 1 6 and 11 month lead times in general both cesm e and cesm n exhibit small biases at the first lead month due to their respective initializations these biases grow as the lead time increases at 6 month lead time these biases become evident and continue to develop until 11 month lead time as shown in fig 11 e and f cesm e and cesm n share some similar biases such as the two positive biases off the west coasts of north and south america and the biases in the north atlantic and southern ocean these systematic errors are consistent with those shown in noassim fig 1 a although these biases commonly exist in cesm e and cesm n it is obvious that the biases grow more slowly in cesm e indicating its initialization scheme is superior in inhibiting the prediction bias in addition to the similarities between cesm e and cesm n there are also differences for example a minor cold bias is apparent in the central pacific at 6 and 11 month lead times in cesm e while it does not appear in cesm n the cold bias could be associated with the weakened warm biases off the west coasts of american continents in cesm e the weakened warm biases in these regions mainly result from the enhanced upwellings gent et al 2010 which could lead to the cooling of sst and induce the cold bias in cesm e moreover the cold bias in the north atlantic due to the misrepresentation of gulf stream is larger in cesm n than in cesm e and even noassim these results suggest that the same model initialized with different initialization schemes may exhibit different bias characteristics which adds to the challenge in tracking the origins of biases the prediction biases of t2 m precipitation and wind stress were also quantified it was found that the variation of wind stress bias is relatively minor as lead time increases the variations of precipitation and t2 m biases are more related to sst as sst evolves toward its model climatology the precipitation and t2 m biases also approach their respective climatologies meanwhile no significant difference is found between cesm e and cesm n fig 12 further shows the mean prediction biases of subsurface temperature along the equator at 1 6 and 11 month lead times which are quite common in ocean models lellouche et al 2018 castruccio et al 2020 these biases are closely coupled to the sst biases through thermocline sst feedbacks fig 12 a and b reveal that cesm e and cesm n have comparable biases of subsurface temperature along the equator at lead month 1 however it is apparent that these biases exhibit relatively less growth in cesm e as the lead time increases especially in the tropical pacific in cesm n on the contrary the biases are apparently strengthened as the lead time increases from 1 to 11 the result again reveals the smaller prediction biases in csem e the use of godas oras5 and ecda as verification data shows no clear difference the superiority of cesm e is probably due to its two advantages over cesm n first eakf is a multivariate data assimilation method the assimilated ocean variables can have an impact on other variables including t s ssh and currents that are updated through statistical regression in the analysis step not only by model coupling integration as in nudging method this extra statistical correction of non assimilated variables can reduce imbalances between model variables to some extent second the lack of salinity data assimilation in cesm n could also be responsible for the rapid growth of prediction biases because the initial subsurface salinity errors could result in the rapid adjustment of density and ultimately lead to large errors in the predicted temperature mean state and variability zhao et al 2013 the reduced prediction bias could be one of the main reasons why cesm e shows better prediction performance as is shown in the previous subsection wu et al 2022 illustrated that the could tongue bias affects the enso predictions and eventually degrades the prediction skill of global climate kim et al 2017 revealed that the subsurface temperature bias in the equatorial pacific which becomes more intense with increasing lead times is a possible cause of prediction errors in the thermocline feedback and thus in enso amplitude how specifically these biases affect the prediction in the current prediction system is beyond the scope of this study and will be explored in the future 4 summary and discussions the purpose of this study was to assess a seasonal prediction system based on the ensemble coupled data assimilation the assessed prediction system referred to as cesm e was established with the broadly used cesm and an advanced assimilation method eakf a reference system based on the cesm and nudging method referred to as cesm n was compared with the current prediction system only oceanic observations including sst and t s were assimilated in cesm e while cesm n was nudged to the reanalyzed ocean temperature and wind fields therefore the emphasis was also placed on the impact of different initialization schemes firstly the initial conditions of cesm e were compared with a long term free integration of the model noassim to show the inherent model errors and assimilation performance results demonstrated that the assimilation of oceanic observations can effectively correct the corresponding oceanic variables in addition the atmospheric variables such as wind fields air temperature and precipitation can also be improved through coupling processes secondly prediction skills of the two systems were compared based on acc and rmse cesm e exhibited generally better performance in the predictions of sst hc300 t2 m and tp than cesm n a random walk test has been conducted to show that the cesm e sst is more skillful at 90 significance level in the pacific region at the first lead month than cesm n the assimilation of sst real observations and the use of eakf method in cesm e could be the main reasons responsible for better prediction skills the improved sst prediction can further lead to comparable or even better t2 m and tp predictions over ocean in cesm e although the assimilation of subsurface temperature is of utmost importance balmaseda and anderson 2009 dunstone and smith 2010 turpin et al 2016 the result here suggested that the assimilation of sst could be also critical since the atmosphere can only be influenced by sst through the flux exchange during the whole data assimilation process in cesm e i e the quasi weakly coupled data assimilation framework penny and hamill 2017 cesm e also produced higher enso and iod prediction skills and it is worth noting that the ensemble members in cesm e tended to have the better consistency throughout the prediction finally prediction biases in the two predictions systems were also evaluated in terms of sst cesm e and cesm n showed some comparable biases in regions such as the eastern pacific and southern ocean at the first lead month but these prediction biases tended to grow faster in cesm n than in cesm e the same conclusion is also evident for the equatorial subsurface temperature which is closely coupled to sst these biases are detrimental to the predictions according to previous studies misra et al 2008 kim et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 siongco et al 2020 wu et al 2022 and their different behaviors in cesm e and cesm n could be one of the main reasons for the difference in skills in a nutshell cesm e shows overall superior performance compared with cesm n however it is difficult to quantify which part in the initialization procedure contributes most to the improvement of the current prediction system as in other assessment studies ham et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 doi et al 2017 for example the assimilation of sst observations may be a critical factor leading to the higher seasonal prediction skills in cesm e in addition the influence of salinity data observation in cesm e cannot be ignored as it was revealed that the initial subsurface salinity errors could result in the rapid adjustment of density and ultimately led to large errors in the predicted temperature mean state and variability zhao et al 2013 most importantly the use of eakf in cesm e is indispensable for the improvement by producing relatively accurate and compatible initial conditions it should also be noted that the use of wind data assimilation is certainly beneficial for the cesm n prediction which could be one important reason that the improvement due to the use of eakf in cesm e cannot be fully embodied therefore the authors argue that the application of the eakf data assimilation method which maximizes the use of various observations is the main reason that the current prediction is improved results presented here might depend on the choice of assimilation parameters in cesm e and cesm n for example cesm n shows comparable or even better performance in terms of the subsurface temperature in certain regions such as the tropical pacific particularly this could be related to the well tuned nudging timescale in cesm n on the other hand it could also be related to the relatively large observational error given in cesm e in the region which could be further improved for its better performance while we tuned these parameters in the assimilation scheme by some sensitivity experiments their optimal values might not be well known in its best performance thus one should take cautions to interpret the comparative results presented in this study the results only represent the performances of the authors best efforts in applying each assimilation scheme the comparison between cesm e and cesm n can shed some useful lights on the design of a data assimilation system from a lessons learned perspective model bias is one of the key reasons limiting the assimilation performance and prediction skill chen et al 2000 dee 2005 chepurin et al 2005 balmaseda et al 2007 deng et al 2010 wang et al 2014 du et al 2020 to improve the prediction skill the optimal solution is to reduce the systematic bias of the model itself however it is very difficult and even impractical to completely eradicate the model bias under these circumstances the initialization scheme should be carefully designed so that the inevitable prediction bias can be well inhibited or at least will not be amplified rapidly the present study reveals that the prediction bias can be contained to some extent with the appropriate initialization scheme the present study also highlights the benefits of using an advanced data assimilation method like the eakf more studies should be conducted to further improve the initialization scheme and increase the prediction skill of the current prediction system credit authorship contribution statement yihao

23775,seasonal prediction highly depends on its initialization scheme currently the operational utilization of advanced data assimilation methods in the oceanic initialization is still relatively less and its benefit is far from being fully unveiled in this study the community earth system model cesm is configured with an ensemble adjustment kalman filter eakf to initialize the seasonal prediction the performance of the established prediction system is assessed by comparing it with a benchmark prediction system which is based on the same model but with a nudging scheme results show that the assimilation of only oceanic observations can not only effectively constrain the oceanic variables but also improves the atmospheric variables through coupling processes which helps to produce accurate and compatible initial conditions with the initial conditions the current prediction system is better than the benchmark prediction system and can produce skillful predictions for sea surface temperature ocean heat content air temperature at 2 m precipitation and major climate variabilities including el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod the current prediction system also shows better ensemble consistency and less prediction drifts which could contribute to the improvement of prediction skill keywords coupled data assimilation seasonal prediction cesm dart eakf data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal prediction has long been paid much attention due to its profound economic and societal influences stockdale et al 1998 doblas reyes et al 2013 becker et al 2022 statistical models xue et al 2000 ren et al 2018 ding et al 2018 dynamical models cane et al 1986 chen et al 1997 rosati et al 1997 and their combinations tang et al 2001 zhang and gao 2016 are all applied in the seasonal prediction although statistical models based on machine learning methods have aroused strong interests recently due to their impressive performance ham et al 2019 liu et al 2021 schneider et al 2022 dynamical predictions governed by relatively clear physics have been routinely issued as the main procedure in various leading centers worldwide palmer et al 2004 jin et al 2008 wang et al 2009 kirtman et al 2014 liu et al 2015 tompkins et al 2017 weisheimer et al 2020 data assimilation has therefore become much more attractive and widely adopted to provide dynamical predictions with accurate initial conditions martin et al 2015 hoteit et al 2018 carrassi et al 2018 moore et al 2019 although initial conditions of atmosphere and land are important for the seasonal prediction hudson et al 2011 materia et al 2014 previous studies have shown that the oceanic initialization plays the dominant role in coupled models because the ocean contributes much of the predictability chen et al 2004 balmaseda and anderson 2009 however the oceanic initialization schemes have been relatively simple balmaseda et al 2009 penny and hamill 2017 for example by implementing a sea surface temperature sst nudging scheme into a fully coupled general circulation model cgcm initial conditions compatible between the atmosphere and ocean were generated and remarkable el niño southern oscillation enso prediction skill was achieved by luo et al 2005 ham et al 2014 revealed that the national aeronautics and space administration nasa geos 5 seasonal prediction system borovikov et al 2019 based on a multivariate ensemble optimal interpolation enoi assimilation scheme was improved compared to its previous version based on optimal interpolation oi the canadian seasonal to interannual prediction system cansips merryfield et al 2013 lin et al 2020 also adopted a nudging scheme for its sst and a simplified variational procedure described by tang et al 2004 for the subsurface temperature these assimilation methods were employed mainly because they are cost effective but the lack of flow dependent background error covariances could be a limitation on their assimilation performance with the rapid development of computation capacity state of the art data assimilation methods which can provide flow dependent background error covariances zupanski and dusanka 1997 evensen 1994 anderson 2001 kalnay et al 2007 are increasingly adopted in the oceanic initialization to generate reanalysis products zhang et al 2007a b counillon et al 2016 karspeck et al 2018 tang et al 2020 o kane et al 2021 and initialize seasonal predictions sugiura et al 2008 vecchi et al 2014 zhenya et al 2015 wang et al 2019 gade et al 2022 for example an ensemble coupled data assimilation was developed to generate historical analysis at the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl zhang et al 2007a b chang et al 2013 and the generated initial conditions were also used to initialize the seasonal prediction vecchi et al 2014 wang et al 2019 employed the norwegian climate prediction model norcpm with the ensemble kalman filter enkf to assimilate sst in the manner of anomaly field initialization smith et al 2013 hu et al 2020 results showed that their prediction system exhibited comparable or even higher skills in contrast to the north american multi model ensemble nmme kirtman et al 2014 at 6 and 12 month lead times gade et al 2022 established a data assimilation system based on the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2014 and the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf hunt et al 2007 to initialize monsoon prediction nonetheless despite the aforementioned studies the operational utilization of these advanced data assimilation methods in seasonal prediction is still not wide spread and the benefit is yet to be fully explored studies also suggest that competitive skills can be achieved by implementing nudging schemes zhu et al 2017 liu et al 2022 the data assimilation developed in this study was based on the data assimilation research testbed dart anderson et al 2009 dart is an open source software developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar to provide implementations of a variety of filter methods among the various methods the ensemble adjustment kalman filter eakf is the most widely adopted and carefully studied one karspeck et al 2018 following the lead of previous studies the present study has established a data assimilation system based on the community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 and eakf oceanic observations including sst and subsurface temperature and salinity t s were assimilated in the full field manner to initialize the seasonal prediction the main goal of this study is to assess the performance of the current prediction system by comparing it with a benchmark system that was established with the same model but a nudging scheme song et al 2022a meanwhile the emphasis is also placed on investigating the impact of the two initialization schemes the results of the present study should reveal benefits that can be obtained from the use of an advanced initialization scheme the eakf and offer new clues on how to improve the seasonal prediction skill the remainder of this article is organized as follows section 2 introduces details of the two prediction systems in section 3 results are presented to reveal the performance of the current prediction system and benefits of the applied initialization scheme section 4 summarizes the results and provides discussions 2 prediction systems and the experimental design coupled models have proven useful for providing more compatible initial conditions via coupled data assimilation fujii et al 2009 mulholland et al 2015 penny and hamill 2017 zhang et al 2020a b and improving the seasonal prediction jin et al 2008 kug et al 2008 saha et al 2014 in this study a fully coupled model cesm was used for the initialization and prediction throughout the present study the cesm was configured with the eakf as a newly developed prediction system which is referred to as cesm e in the following study for comparison a benchmark prediction system that was established based on the same model but with a nudging scheme is introduced and referred to as cesm n description of the two prediction systems and design of the hindcast experiments will be presented in detail in this section 2 1 the cesm e prediction system the cesm is an open source global coupled model developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar the version 1 2 1 was used in this study hurrell et al 2013 the atmosphere component is the community atmospheric model version 4 cam4 neale et al 2012 the ocean component is the parallel ocean program version 2 pop2 danabasoglu et al 2012 the sea ice component is the community ice code version 4 cice4 holland et al 2012 and the land component is the community land model version 4 clm4 lawrence et al 2011 horizontally the model has a nominal 1 resolution vertically it has 26 layers and 60 layers for the atmosphere and the ocean respectively the atmosphere and ocean are coupled once per day without any flux corrections the cesm has been widely assessed and used in a number of studies deser et al 2012 capotondi 2013 li et al 2016 yao et al 2016 tan et al 2020 the model was run in the twentieth century climate state forced by the solar output greenhouse gases aerosols and volcanic activity in the corresponding time period gent et al 2011 the data assimilation system was implemented with dart in this study anderson et al 2009 karspeck et al 2018 castruccio et al 2020 table 1 details the cesm e data assimilation scheme the ocean observations including sst and in situ t s profiles from the optimum interpolation sea surface temperature oisst dataset version 2 1 huang et al 2021 and the en4 profile dataset version 4 2 1 good et al 2013 respectively were assimilated via the eakf an ensemble of 20 members and an assimilation frequency of 10 days were adopted similar to the setting in many previous works balmaseda et al 2009 martin et al 2015 zhang and rosati 2010 thus observations during the 5 days before and after the assimilation step were assimilated into the model a spatially varying but temporally invariant observational error was assigned to the t s profiles by calculating climatological variabilities using the gridded en4 objective analysis data in terms of the sst observations the uncertainty estimation provided by the product itself was assigned as the observational error the eakf is a sophisticated data assimilation method that can provide flow dependent background error covariances meaning that the 20 members in the assimilation evolve through time based on model dynamics analysis increments are obtained from the statistics of those members and are then used to update the prior ensembles the eakf is also a multi variate assimilation method through statistical covariance influences in the analysis step the directly assimilated variables can have an impact on other ocean variables including the temperature salinity vector current and sea surface height ssh in the forecast step updated ocean variables can lead to the improvement of variables in other components through flux exchange which can ultimately lead to the more balanced initial conditions for prediction by running an ensemble of members the eakf can naturally provide initial conditions for ensemble prediction without further perturbations to the produced analyses due to the use of a finite number of ensemble members most ensemble filters suffer from spurious long distance correlations and tend to underestimate the background variance a fifth order piecewise polynomial localization function gaspari and cohn 1999 was used in this study for localization to restrict the impact of geographically remote observations with an isotropic radius of about 600 km in the horizontal vertically the localization radius was 250 m and 1000 m for the sst and t s profiles respectively based on the result of sensitivity experiments a constant prior inflation factor of 1 02 was used to alleviate the spread collapse in addition it was found that the initial state can have great impact on the assimilation performance of the current data assimilation system in this study the initial state used in the assimilation was from a long term model integration with its t s replaced by the world ocean atlas woa garcia et al 2019 counterparts before the assimilation more details about the assimilation scheme and the performance of the current data assimilation system are provided in chen et al 2022 2 2 the cesm n prediction system the benchmark prediction system cesm n is also based on the cesm version 1 2 1 but with the nudging method which is a simple but broadly used data assimilation approach chen et al 2004 keenlyside et al 2005 luo et al 2005 sandery et al 2011 baehr et al 2015 ren et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 song et al 2022a in the nudging scheme the model states are relaxed to the observed or reanalyzed counterparts by adding a forcing term to the prognostic equations the forcing term depends on the difference between model and observation and is usually scaled by an empirically determined nudging coefficient an advantage of such method is that it can be easily implemented in coupled systems with low computational burden however biases in reanalysis data together with those in the model could further degrade the assimilation performance in addition the empirically determined nudging coefficient may also impair the assimilation performance because it is not an optimal or objective method and contains considerable artificial components table 2 details the cesm n data assimilation scheme in cesm n the ocean temperature was nudged to the global ocean data assimilation system godas reanalysis behringer and xue 2004 the depth dependent nudging timescale for ocean temperature decreases from 10 days at the surface to 150 days at 400 m approximately according to a hyperbolic tangent function for the atmosphere wind components below 500 hpa were nudged to the 6 hour era interim berrisford et al 2011 with a constant nudging timescale of 6 h unlike cesm e cesm n runs with a single member thus the analysis needs to be perturbed to yield multiple initial conditions for ensemble prediction for this purpose the climatically relevant singular vectors csv kleeman et al 2003 tang et al 2006 were calculated to produce perturbation modes to approximate the fastest growth errors which are recognized as the optimal growth errors palmer et al 1993 toth and kalnay 1997 cheng et al 2010 the csv obtained perturbation modes were then used to perturb the cesm n subsurface temperature to yield the 20 member ensemble the cesm n hindcast experiment was conducted from 1881 to 2017 to investigate the decadal predictability of enso liu et al 2022 and indian ocean dipole iod song et al 2022b the results showed that cesm n exhibited good performance that can be comparable to the multi model ensemble mean of nmme kirtman et al 2014 details about the cesm n prediction system including csv perturbation modes can be found in song et al 2022a 2 3 the experimental design the cesm e assimilation was run from 2005 because of limited computational resource a benchmark prediction system is required to evaluate the performance of cesm e as aforementioned cesm n is used as the benchmark prediction system for comparison in the present study the reasons are twofold firstly previous studies have shown that cesm n exhibits comparable skills in predicting enso and iod events during a long time period liu et al 2022 song et al 2022b by comparing cesm e with cesm n we can have a general picture of the status of cesm e among those widely examined prediction systems secondly the two prediction systems are based on the same version of model which enables us to determine what difference in the initialization schemes contributes to the difference in prediction skills as such in this study the assessed hindcasts for both cesm e and cesm n start from 2006 to 2017 12 years predictions are issued on the first day of each january april july and october for 12 months one month lead prediction is here defined as the model integration averaged over the same calendar month of the initial time for example the averaged model integration over january is the prediction of one month lead initialized from the 1st january 2 4 verification data the examined variables include the sst ocean subsurface t s wind speed air temperature and large scale total precipitation rate some regular observations and reanalysis products were leveraged as verification data the sst dataset is the hadley centre sea ice and sea surface temperature dataset hadisst rayner et al 2003 the subsurface t s data are from the objective analysis data of the en4 2 1 dataset good et al 2013 the wind speed and air temperature data are from the era5 hersbach et al 2019 precipitation data are from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2003 all the above products cover a 12 year period from january 2006 to december 2017 and are interpolated onto the uniform 1 grid the anomalies of each variable are relative to their climatology averaged over the period from 2006 to 2017 for convenience these verification data are referred to as obs in the following discussions since the en4 t s profiles were assimilated in cesm e the use of en4 objective analysis product as verification data for the subsurface temperature may lead to an issue regarding independence of the verification data to address this concern widely assessed reanalyses including godas gfdl ecda zhang et al 2007a b chang et al 2013 and oras5 zuo et al 2019 which are constructed with different models observational datasets assimilation methods quality control procedures and so on were also used for verification of the subsurface temperature 3 results in this section the initial conditions analyses of cesm e are first compared to a long term free integration of the model denoted as noassim to examine the biases of model climatology which is helpful for the interpretation of the subsequent results mean biases of each variable are calculated over the period from 2006 to 2017 then prediction skills are assessed by comparing cesm e with cesm n the skill assessments are all based on deterministic measures two commonly applied metrics the anomaly correlation coefficient acc and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the prediction skill finally prediction biases are examined to show possible reasons that lead to the difference between the two prediction systems due to relatively large uncertainties in high latitudes we defined the global domain as the horizontal area from 60 s to 60 n and 180 w to 180 e in this study unless otherwise noted 3 1 initial conditions fig 1 depicts the horizontal distribution of the mean sst and sea surface salinity sss biases for noassim and cesm e respectively fig 1 a shows warm biases around 1 c in most of the global ocean for noassim there are also apparent large biases exceeding 3 c in regions such as the gulf stream region the major upwelling regions and the southern hemisphere midlatitudes these systematic errors commonly exist in the cesm gent et al 2011 and other coupled models wang et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 b these biases can be effectively reduced in cesm e due to the assimilation of sst but some biases persist in areas such as the gulf stream and southern ocean fig 1 c reveals that there are fresh biases over most of global regions and salty biases in the north atlantic east pacific and arctic in noassim most of these biases are reduced in cesm e fig 1 d because of the assimilation of salinity profiles but large biases remain in some coastal regions such as the maritime continent western tropical atlantic and in the arctic there also exist obvious salinity biases due to the absence of sea ice assimilation in the arctic the assimilation of sss and sea ice observations could ameliorate the situation fig 2 illustrates the mean temperature and salinity biases below the sea surface noassim shows a positive bias at all depths as shown in fig 2 a the assimilation of temperature profiles significantly reduces these biases as a result cesm e shows very close mean temperature compared to obs except a small bias remains at around 100 m depth with respect to salinity as shown in fig 2 b the model exhibits systematic negative biases above approximately 800 m and positive biases below likewise these biases are effectively decreased in cesm e in addition cesm e is generally in good agreement with current widely used reanalyses including oras5 godas and ecda indicating that the influence of verification data on results should be small above results demonstrate that the assimilation of oceanic observations can effectively correct the corresponding oceanic variables previous studies have shown that the assimilation of oceanic observations can also reduce biases in the atmospheric component through coupling processes fujii et al 2009 dong et al 2016 tang et al 2020 here we examine to what extent the assimilation of oceanic observations can ameliorate the atmospheric variables in the current model fig 3 reveals the mean biases of the air temperature and wind speed at 992 hpa the bottom level of the atmospheric component of the coupled model and of the large scale total precipitation rate noassim shows warm biases of more than 2 c in most ocean basins which exhibits a similar spatial pattern to the sst bias indicating the role of ocean in heating the atmosphere the corresponding wind biases of the model are also shown in fig 3 a the air temperature and wind biases are decreased to a large extent in cesm e by only assimilating oceanic components fig 3 b the air temperature bias is reduced by approximately 1 k over almost the whole global ocean the wind bias over the ocean is also correspondingly reduced it is worth noting that the reduced air temperature and wind biases at the surface can lead to even stronger adjustment in the upper troposphere through enhanced convection and the lapse rate feedback as also in tang et al 2020 the improvement of bias over land however is not apparent noassim shows the characteristic pattern of the double intertropical convergence zone itcz problem with excessive precipitation off the equator and insufficient precipitation on the equator lin 2007 as shown in fig 3 c the biases are much mitigated in cesm e with a smaller positive bias occurring along the equator as shown in fig 3 d it suggests that the better representation of sst in the cgcm could be a remedy to the double itcz problem zhang and wang 2006 zhang et al 2007a b li and xie 2014 in addition biases in the tropical indian and atlantic ocean are also decreased to some extent although some biases deteriorate in regions such as the south asia and central africa 3 2 prediction skills 3 2 1 sst fig 4 reflects sst prediction skills in cesm e and cesm n the left panel shows the sst acc in cesm e at the 1 6 and 11 month lead times it is above 90 significance level when acc is greater than 0 19 according to one tailed student s t test with the degree of freedom of 46 as shown in fig 4 a cesm e has a high prediction skill at the 1 month lead time with accs above 0 6 in almost all ocean basins the most predictable regions appear in the central and eastern pacific where accs can be above 0 9 indicating the potentially large influence of enso the prediction skill drops as the lead time increases but the central pacific is still relatively skillful even at the 11 month lead time in general cesm e exhibits apparent larger extent of skillful regions compared to cesm n at all lead times at the lead month 1 cesm e shows obvious improvements in regions such as the indian ocean and western pacific the improvement at the first lead time is to a large extent due to the superiority of the initialization scheme specifically cesm e assimilated sst observation via the eakf while cesm n was nudged towards the godas one reason is that the godas sst is not as precise as the real observation another probable reason is that the nudging timescale at the surface may not be well tuned global averaged accs shown in the top right of each panel confirm the conclusion that cesm e exhibits generally higher sst skill than cesm n 3 2 2 ocean heat content the variability of upper ocean heat content is of great significance for seasonal prediction xue et al 2000 zheng et al 2007 fig 5 is presented to reveal the prediction skill of upper ocean heat content the upper ocean heat content is estimated by averaging the sea temperature from the surface to 300 m depth denoted as hc300 hereafter as shown in fig 5 hc300 shows higher predictability than sst with accs in many pacific areas exceeding 0 9 at the first lead month and generally higher accs at other lead times at lead month 1 cesm e and cesm n have close accs in most ocean basins the global mean hc300 accs in cesm e and cesm n are 0 67 and 0 68 respectively verified against the en4 objective analysis it indicates that the nudging scheme may indeed have an assimilation quality in some regions comparable to that obtained from an advanced data assimilation method but the same scheme may not well apply in other regions due to the deficiencies of the method such as the empirically determined nudging timescale and its dependence on quality of the reanalysis products that the model is nudged to on the contrary the flow dependent data assimilation method is able to achieve the more reasonable distribution of the background error and thus yield high skills as the lead time increases cesm e shows generally higher skills than cesm n in most ocean basins at lead month 11 the global mean hc300 accs in cesm e and cesm n are 0 27 and 0 24 respectively it should be noted that no obvious difference was found when oras5 and ecda are used as the verification data 3 2 3 air temperature and precipitation above results reveal that cesm e exhibits superior performance in terms of the prediction skills of sst and hc300 in addition to sst and hc300 the seasonal prediction skills of 2 m air temperature t2 m and total precipitation tp are also evaluated it should be noted that no atmospheric observation was assimilated in cesm e while cesm n was nudged to the wind field from reanalysis fig 6 reflects the prediction skill of 2 m air temperature the horizontal distribution of t2 m accs resembles the distribution of sst and hc300 with the most predictable regions appearing in the central and eastern pacific and remaining up to lead month 11 at the 1 month lead time cesm n shows higher accs over land because of its nudging of wind fields the global mean t2 m accs in cesm n and cesm e are 0 54 and 0 51 respectively over the entire ocean domain however cesm e is comparable to cesm n and has obvious improvements over many regions such as the western indian ocean and western pacific which is consistent with that in sst the global mean accs over the entire ocean domain in cesm n and cesm e are 0 61 and 0 60 respectively at the 11 month lead time cesm e shows generally better performance than cesm n the global mean accs in cesm n and cesm e are 0 14 and 0 12 respectively fig 7 reflects the prediction skill of total precipitation tp in cesm e and cesm n the prediction of tp is much more difficult than that of sst hc300 and t2 m at the 1 and 3 month lead times the high tp prediction skill in cesm e mainly locates in the tropical pacific while cesm n seems to have higher skills in some land and extratropical areas where both prediction systems show relatively low skills tropical averaged accs show that cesm e and cesm n are comparable at lead month 1 and cesm e is slightly better than cesm n at lead month 3 with their accs of 0 22 and 0 20 respectively this result together with that shown in the t2 m prediction is quite encouraging because no atmospheric observations were assimilated in cesm e while cesm n was nudged to era wind fields it suggests the critical impact of sst assimilation on the prediction skill of t2 m and tp over the ocean due to the good relationship between sst and t2 m and tp feng et al 2018 fujii et al 2021 meanwhile the results reveal that the assimilation of only ocean observations may not be enough to provide skillful prediction over land and that the atmosphere and land initialization should also be considered to increase the t2 m and tp prediction skill in the future study 3 2 4 enso and iod the seasonal prediction skill is closely related to climate variability such as enso mcphaden et al 2006 tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a b and iod saji and yamagata 2003 liu et al 2017 doi et al 2020 because of their global impact fig 8 presents the acc and rmse between the observed and predicted nino3 4 time series the nino3 4 index was calculated by averaging sst anomalies over the niño3 4 region 5 s 5 n 170 w 120 w the two prediction systems both beat the persistence prediction cesm e exhibits slightly higher acc than cesm n when the lead month is more than 4 and less than 10 although they show very close skills in the first 4 months in addition cesm e shows the slightly lower rmse than cesm n at approximately all lead months indicating smaller sst anomaly errors in cesm e it should be noted that the ensemble spread in cesm e is higher than that in cesm n by between 0 05 and 0 1 at all lead times this indicates that cesm e may have a more reasonable ensemble distribution which can to a larger extent represent the possible distribution of errors it reveals one of the eakf s benefits as an assimilation approach to generate an ensemble of initial conditions for the ensemble prediction conveniently and effectively yet the ensemble spread in both prediction systems is far less than the rmse indicating that the model is overconfident in the nino3 4 region fig 9 presents the acc and rmse between the observed and predicted dipole mode index dmi time series following saji et al 1999 the dmi is defined as the sst anomaly difference between the western pole 50 70 e 10 s 10 n and eastern pole 90 110 e 10 s 0 of the tropical indian ocean in terms of acc the two prediction systems both beat the persistence prediction and cesm e shows the obvious higher accs than cesm n at all lead times in addition cesm e shows the generally lower rmse than cesm n it is interesting that the two systems show close rmses to the persistence prediction which indicates rather large uncertainty in the tropical indian ocean moreover as in the tropical pacific cesm e spread agrees well with its rmse compared to cesm n in the tropical indian indicating again the better ensemble distribution in cesm e which could be one reason responsible for its better performance the result is consistent with that in gade et al 2022 who showed that the initial conditions generated by an ensemble based weakly coupled data assimilation system tended to maintain the ensemble consistency throughout the prediction 3 2 5 rmses and the random walk test table 3 shows the global mean rmses between the predicted and observed sst hc300 t2 m and tp anomalies respectively for different lead times cesm e exhibits better performance than cesm n in general for example the sst rmses at the first lead month in cesm e and cesm n are 0 33 and 0 38 respectively indicating a 13 improvement in cesm e as lead time increases the improvement in cesm e sst drops in terms of hc300 rmse cesm e and cesm n show comparable skills verified against different reanalyses for t2 m the cesm e shows smaller rmse at the first lead month this is encouraging since there is no atmospheric data assimilated in cesm e the reason however is still unclear and needs further investigation for tp rmses in cesm e and cesm n are 1 06 and 1 23 at one month lead time respectively corresponding to a 14 improvement in cesm e which is consistent with that in sst a procedure based on random walks is applied to examine prediction skill differences and highlights the significance of the reported skill differences delsole and tippett 2016 a count increases by 1 when the cesm e is less skillful than cesm n and decreases by 1 otherwise the count is accumulated forward in time over all initial months and years of the hindcast if the distance traveled by a random walk falls outside the 5 and 95 interval of a binomial distribution then the hypothesis of equally skillful predictions is rejected at the 10 significance level fig 10 reveals skill differences based on random walks at 1 month lead between cesm e and cesm n fig 10 a shows that cesm e nino3 and nino3 4 indices are more skillful than cesm n after only a few steps in addition it indicates that cesm e and cesm n have comparable dmi prediction skill at one month lead time based on the random walk fig 10 b reflects that cesm e is more skillful in predicting sst anomaly pattern correlations over different regions including the global ocean pacific and indian ocean 3 3 prediction bias when predictions are initialized with the full field states derived from observations the predictions will drift toward the model s own climatology due to the systematic model biases misra et al 2008 magnusson et al 2013 saurral et al 2021 in addition to the gradual model drift the full field initialization may also lead to a rapid initial adjustment of the model if there is a large imbalance between the prescribed initial conditions and the model dynamics known as the initialization shock problem tang et al 2003 mulholland et al 2015 the conventional method for removing the drifting climatology of predictions cannot eliminate the influence of biased processes that can degrade the predictions through various coupled feedbacks kim et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 siongco et al 2020 wu et al 2022 therefore the prediction bias should be less if one initialization scheme is more reasonable the prediction bias is estimated as the difference between the predicted and observed climatology over the hindcast period at different lead times fig 11 reflects the mean sst prediction bias at 1 6 and 11 month lead times in general both cesm e and cesm n exhibit small biases at the first lead month due to their respective initializations these biases grow as the lead time increases at 6 month lead time these biases become evident and continue to develop until 11 month lead time as shown in fig 11 e and f cesm e and cesm n share some similar biases such as the two positive biases off the west coasts of north and south america and the biases in the north atlantic and southern ocean these systematic errors are consistent with those shown in noassim fig 1 a although these biases commonly exist in cesm e and cesm n it is obvious that the biases grow more slowly in cesm e indicating its initialization scheme is superior in inhibiting the prediction bias in addition to the similarities between cesm e and cesm n there are also differences for example a minor cold bias is apparent in the central pacific at 6 and 11 month lead times in cesm e while it does not appear in cesm n the cold bias could be associated with the weakened warm biases off the west coasts of american continents in cesm e the weakened warm biases in these regions mainly result from the enhanced upwellings gent et al 2010 which could lead to the cooling of sst and induce the cold bias in cesm e moreover the cold bias in the north atlantic due to the misrepresentation of gulf stream is larger in cesm n than in cesm e and even noassim these results suggest that the same model initialized with different initialization schemes may exhibit different bias characteristics which adds to the challenge in tracking the origins of biases the prediction biases of t2 m precipitation and wind stress were also quantified it was found that the variation of wind stress bias is relatively minor as lead time increases the variations of precipitation and t2 m biases are more related to sst as sst evolves toward its model climatology the precipitation and t2 m biases also approach their respective climatologies meanwhile no significant difference is found between cesm e and cesm n fig 12 further shows the mean prediction biases of subsurface temperature along the equator at 1 6 and 11 month lead times which are quite common in ocean models lellouche et al 2018 castruccio et al 2020 these biases are closely coupled to the sst biases through thermocline sst feedbacks fig 12 a and b reveal that cesm e and cesm n have comparable biases of subsurface temperature along the equator at lead month 1 however it is apparent that these biases exhibit relatively less growth in cesm e as the lead time increases especially in the tropical pacific in cesm n on the contrary the biases are apparently strengthened as the lead time increases from 1 to 11 the result again reveals the smaller prediction biases in csem e the use of godas oras5 and ecda as verification data shows no clear difference the superiority of cesm e is probably due to its two advantages over cesm n first eakf is a multivariate data assimilation method the assimilated ocean variables can have an impact on other variables including t s ssh and currents that are updated through statistical regression in the analysis step not only by model coupling integration as in nudging method this extra statistical correction of non assimilated variables can reduce imbalances between model variables to some extent second the lack of salinity data assimilation in cesm n could also be responsible for the rapid growth of prediction biases because the initial subsurface salinity errors could result in the rapid adjustment of density and ultimately lead to large errors in the predicted temperature mean state and variability zhao et al 2013 the reduced prediction bias could be one of the main reasons why cesm e shows better prediction performance as is shown in the previous subsection wu et al 2022 illustrated that the could tongue bias affects the enso predictions and eventually degrades the prediction skill of global climate kim et al 2017 revealed that the subsurface temperature bias in the equatorial pacific which becomes more intense with increasing lead times is a possible cause of prediction errors in the thermocline feedback and thus in enso amplitude how specifically these biases affect the prediction in the current prediction system is beyond the scope of this study and will be explored in the future 4 summary and discussions the purpose of this study was to assess a seasonal prediction system based on the ensemble coupled data assimilation the assessed prediction system referred to as cesm e was established with the broadly used cesm and an advanced assimilation method eakf a reference system based on the cesm and nudging method referred to as cesm n was compared with the current prediction system only oceanic observations including sst and t s were assimilated in cesm e while cesm n was nudged to the reanalyzed ocean temperature and wind fields therefore the emphasis was also placed on the impact of different initialization schemes firstly the initial conditions of cesm e were compared with a long term free integration of the model noassim to show the inherent model errors and assimilation performance results demonstrated that the assimilation of oceanic observations can effectively correct the corresponding oceanic variables in addition the atmospheric variables such as wind fields air temperature and precipitation can also be improved through coupling processes secondly prediction skills of the two systems were compared based on acc and rmse cesm e exhibited generally better performance in the predictions of sst hc300 t2 m and tp than cesm n a random walk test has been conducted to show that the cesm e sst is more skillful at 90 significance level in the pacific region at the first lead month than cesm n the assimilation of sst real observations and the use of eakf method in cesm e could be the main reasons responsible for better prediction skills the improved sst prediction can further lead to comparable or even better t2 m and tp predictions over ocean in cesm e although the assimilation of subsurface temperature is of utmost importance balmaseda and anderson 2009 dunstone and smith 2010 turpin et al 2016 the result here suggested that the assimilation of sst could be also critical since the atmosphere can only be influenced by sst through the flux exchange during the whole data assimilation process in cesm e i e the quasi weakly coupled data assimilation framework penny and hamill 2017 cesm e also produced higher enso and iod prediction skills and it is worth noting that the ensemble members in cesm e tended to have the better consistency throughout the prediction finally prediction biases in the two predictions systems were also evaluated in terms of sst cesm e and cesm n showed some comparable biases in regions such as the eastern pacific and southern ocean at the first lead month but these prediction biases tended to grow faster in cesm n than in cesm e the same conclusion is also evident for the equatorial subsurface temperature which is closely coupled to sst these biases are detrimental to the predictions according to previous studies misra et al 2008 kim et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 siongco et al 2020 wu et al 2022 and their different behaviors in cesm e and cesm n could be one of the main reasons for the difference in skills in a nutshell cesm e shows overall superior performance compared with cesm n however it is difficult to quantify which part in the initialization procedure contributes most to the improvement of the current prediction system as in other assessment studies ham et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 doi et al 2017 for example the assimilation of sst observations may be a critical factor leading to the higher seasonal prediction skills in cesm e in addition the influence of salinity data observation in cesm e cannot be ignored as it was revealed that the initial subsurface salinity errors could result in the rapid adjustment of density and ultimately led to large errors in the predicted temperature mean state and variability zhao et al 2013 most importantly the use of eakf in cesm e is indispensable for the improvement by producing relatively accurate and compatible initial conditions it should also be noted that the use of wind data assimilation is certainly beneficial for the cesm n prediction which could be one important reason that the improvement due to the use of eakf in cesm e cannot be fully embodied therefore the authors argue that the application of the eakf data assimilation method which maximizes the use of various observations is the main reason that the current prediction is improved results presented here might depend on the choice of assimilation parameters in cesm e and cesm n for example cesm n shows comparable or even better performance in terms of the subsurface temperature in certain regions such as the tropical pacific particularly this could be related to the well tuned nudging timescale in cesm n on the other hand it could also be related to the relatively large observational error given in cesm e in the region which could be further improved for its better performance while we tuned these parameters in the assimilation scheme by some sensitivity experiments their optimal values might not be well known in its best performance thus one should take cautions to interpret the comparative results presented in this study the results only represent the performances of the authors best efforts in applying each assimilation scheme the comparison between cesm e and cesm n can shed some useful lights on the design of a data assimilation system from a lessons learned perspective model bias is one of the key reasons limiting the assimilation performance and prediction skill chen et al 2000 dee 2005 chepurin et al 2005 balmaseda et al 2007 deng et al 2010 wang et al 2014 du et al 2020 to improve the prediction skill the optimal solution is to reduce the systematic bias of the model itself however it is very difficult and even impractical to completely eradicate the model bias under these circumstances the initialization scheme should be carefully designed so that the inevitable prediction bias can be well inhibited or at least will not be amplified rapidly the present study reveals that the prediction bias can be contained to some extent with the appropriate initialization scheme the present study also highlights the benefits of using an advanced data assimilation method like the eakf more studies should be conducted to further improve the initialization scheme and increase the prediction skill of the current prediction system credit authorship contribution statement yihao

23776,this paper focuses on a new approach to describe coastal morphodynamics based on optimization theory and more specifically on the assumption that a sandy beach profile evolves in order to minimize a wave related function the choice of which depends on what is considered the driving force behind the coastal morphodynamic processes considered the numerical model derived from this theory uses a gradient descent method and allows us to account for physical constraints such as sand conservation in wave flume experiments hence the model automatically adapts to either wave flume or open sea settings and only involves two hyper parameters a sand mobility and a critical angle of repose the ability of optimorph to model cross shore beach morphodynamics is illustrated on a flume configuration comparison of the beach profile changes computed with optimorph with experimental data as well as the results from the coastal morphodynamic software xbeach demonstrates the potential of a model by wave energy minimization keywords hydro morphodynamics optimization model validation coastal variational approach energy minimization optimal transport waves data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction optimization theory is the study of the evolution of a system while searching systematically for the minimum of a function derived from physical properties of the system in this paper we have applied this approach to coastal dynamics with our primary objective to simulate the interactions between the waves and the sea bottom along a cross shore profile using mathematical optimization theory isèbe et al 2014 isebe et al 2008 isèbe et al 2008 bouharguane et al 2010 bouharguane and mohammadi 2012 mohammadi and bouharguane 2011 mohammadi and bouchette 2014 mohammadi 2017 cook et al 2021 we have designed a model that describes the evolution of the sea bottom while taking into account the coupling between morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes this study focuses on a theoretical and numerical approach to the modeling of this coupling based on the assumption that the beach profile adapts to minimize a certain wave related function the choice of this function determines the driving force behind the morphological evolution of the beach profile this optimization problem is subjected to a certain number of constraints allowing for a more accurate description of the morphodynamic evolution this study is accompanied by the development of a numerical hydro morphodynamic model which has the advantages of being fast robust and of low complexity the model was given the name optimorph the paper starts with a description of the simple hydrodynamic model used to calculate the driving forces behind the morphodynamic processes then we provide a description of the morphodynamic model optimorph based on wave energy minimization with the purpose of validating optimorph we compare the results of the numerical simulation with that of experimental data acquired in a flume experiment we also compare the model to another nearshore hydro morphodynamic model xbeach roelvink et al 2009 to see how it fares against existing hydro morphodynamic models xbeach being considered to be quite a reputable model in the coastal dynamic community zimmermann et al 2012 bugajny et al 2013 williams et al 2015 1 1 state of the art numerical models of morphodynamic processes are seen as a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the evolution of the sediment transport of the morphology over time in coastal areas different morphodynamic models exist in the literature ranging from empirical models de vriend et al 1994 gravens 1997 kana et al 1999 ruessink and terwindt 2000 to process based models the latter can be sorted into several categories such as i profile evolution models larson and kraus 1989 larson et al 1990 nairn and southgate 1993 which use only cross shore transport ii rules based models storms et al 2002 mccarroll et al 2021 based on a number of rules such as brunn s rule bruun 1954 iii 2d morphological models fleming and hunt 1977 latteux 1980 coeffe and pechon 1982 yamaguchi and nishioka 1985 watanabe et al 1986 maruyama and takagi 1988 wang et al 1993 johnson et al 1995 nicholson et al 1997 roelvink et al 2009 which use depth averaged wave and current equations to model the sediment transport while neglecting the vertical variations of wave derived parameters as well as iv 3d and quasi 3d models roelvink et al 1994 lesser et al 2004 roelvink et al 1995 briand and kamphuis 1993 zyserman and johnson 2002 ding et al 2006 droenen and deigaard 2007 which determine the sediment evolution using both horizontal and vertical variations of the wave derived parameters the optimorph model described in this paper is based on optimal control in the past the use of optimization theory has primarily been used in the design of coastal defense structures whether in the design of ports and offshore breakwaters isebe et al 2008 isèbe et al 2008 optimal control has already been considered for the modeling of shallow water morphodynamics based on the assumption that the seabed acts as a flexible structure and adapts to a certain hydrodynamic quantity mohammadi and bouharguane 2011 bouharguane et al 2010 these studies were based on somewhat theoretical developments with no direct relationship with real case studies our objectives in this work is to produce a physically robust numerical morphodynamic model based on optimal control and to validate it using numerical data from well established morphodynamics software as well as wave flume experiments 1 2 hypotheses optimorph is based on a certain number of assumptions first since the model is based on the minimization of a cost function some hypotheses must be made regarding the choice of this function this function which originates from a physical quantity must be directly linked to the elevation of the seabed in the current version of the model we set the quantity to be minimized as the energy of shoaling waves this implies that the sea bottom reacts to the state of the waves by minimizing the energy of shoaling waves other assumptions assess the behavior of the sea bottom and originate from general observations in particular the bed load sediment transport is controlled by the orbital displacement of water particles soulsby 1987 thus a greater sediment mobility has to be considered in shallower waters another natural observation concerns the slope of the seabed which cannot be overly steep without an avalanching process occurring reineck and singh 1973 last in an experimental wave flume the quantity of sand must remain constant over time with no inflow or outflow of sand to alter the sand stock 2 theoretical developments 2 1 modeling framework for the sake of simplicity we present the principle of morphodynamics by optimization in a one dimensional setting this enables us to compare the numerical results based on this theory with experimental flume data however no assumptions are made regarding the dimension of the problem and as a result it is straightforward to extend this theory to a two dimensional configuration we consider a coordinate system composed of a horizontal axis x and a vertical axis z we denote ω 0 x max the domain of the cross shore profile of the active coastal zone where x 0 is a fixed point in deep water where no significant change in bottom elevation can occur and x max is an arbitrary point at the shore beyond the shoreline as shown by fig 1 the elevation of the sea bottom is a one dimensional positive function defined by ψ ω 0 t f ψ r where 0 t f is the duration of the simulation s and ψ is the set of physical parameters describing the characteristics of the beach profile in order to model the evolution over time of ψ and given the assumption that ψ changes over time in response to the energy of shoaling waves a description of the surface waves is needed 2 2 hydrodynamic model the literature on hydrodynamic models is vast murray 2007 however our main focus in this work is a on the morphodynamic part of the approach and b on providing evidence of the ability of optimization to perform robust morphodynamic prediction even under weakly constrained hydrodynamics so we present the procedures with a hydrodynamic model as simple as possible that is based on the linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 2004 a very basic shoaling equation and some geometrical breaking parameter it has the advantage of being easy to differentiate compared to more sophisticated models that would need automatic differentiation hascoet and pascual 2004 mohammadi and bouharguane 2011 or huge additional numerical developments this numerical implementation has a significantly short run time as shown by the convergence results of section 4 1 this model has the advantage of expressing wave height as an explicit function of the bottom elevation which leads to rapid calculations of the morphodynamics let h m be the depth of the water from a mean water level h 0 at the point where waves are generated cf fig 1 ocean waves here assumed monochromatic are characterized by phase velocity c m s 1 group velocity c g m s 1 and wave number k m 1 determined by the linear dispersion relation 1 where σ is the pulsation of the waves s 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 1 σ 2 g k tanh k h we define ω s as the time dependent subset of ω over which the waves shoal and ω b the subset of ω over which the waves break cf fig 1 munk s breaking criterion munk 1949 enables us to define ω s t x ω h x t h x t γ and ω b t x ω h x t h x t γ where γ is a wave breaking index then we have 2 h x t h 0 t k s x t the height of the waves h over the cross shore profile is inspired by the shoaling eq 2 where h 0 t is the deep water wave height and k s is a shoaling coefficient given by 3 k s 1 2 c 0 c g 1 2 where c 0 is the deep water wave velocity and 4 n c c g c c 0 tanh k h c g 1 2 c 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h instead of considering that waves depend solely on offshore wave height h 0 this model suggests that shoaling waves are decreasingly influenced by seawards waves the greater the distance the less effect it has on the present wave height as such we introduce a weighting function w assuming that the maximal distance of local spatial dependency of a wave is denoted d w the weighting function over the maximal distance d w is given by w 0 d w r such that w 0 1 w d w 0 and decreases exponentially eq 2 for shoaling wave height becomes eq 5 where h 0 w is defined by 6 5 h x t h 0 w x t k s x t 6 h 0 w x t 1 x x x w x y d y x x x w x y h y k y d y eq 5 applies only to the shoaling nearshore dependent waves of ω s significant wave height over the cross shore profile h ω r is defined by 7 where α x x d w over 0 d w to allow a smooth transition between offshore and nearshore dependent waves 7 2 3 morphodynamic model by wave energy minimization the evolution of the sea bottom is assumed to be driven by the minimization of a cost function j j s m 1 recalling the hypotheses made in section 1 2 the shape of the beach profile is determined by the minimization of the potential energy of shoaling waves for all t 0 t f 8 j ψ t 1 16 t t c o u p l t ω s ρ w g h 2 ψ x τ d x d τ where h denotes the height of the waves over the cross shore profile m ρ w is water density kg m 3 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 t c o u p l s defines the coupling time interval between hydrodynamic and morphodynamic models so that we have t f t c o u p l iterations in order to describe the evolution of the beach profile whose initial state is given by ψ 0 we assume that the sea bottom elevation ψ in its effort to minimize j verifies the following dynamics 9 ψ t υ λ d ψ t 0 ψ 0 where ψ t is the evolution of the bottom elevation over time m s 1 υ is a measure of the sand mobility expressed in m s kg 1 λ measures the excitation of the seabed by the orbital motion of water waves and d is the direction of the descent j s m 2 which indicates the manner in which the sea bottom changes the approach involves two parameters with clear physical interpretation the first υ takes into account the physical characteristics of the sand and represents the mobility of the sediment simulations with varying υ that reflect variations of the d 50 grain diameter from 0 25 mm to 2 mm were performed changes in the beach profile were observed but no significant alteration of the trends in beach profile evolution through time the asymptotic behavior of the simulations remains the same although the velocity at which a given profile is reached changes further explanation of the nature of the υ parameter will be given at a later stage of the model development the second parameter λ is a local function which represents the influence of the relative water depth k h on the beach profile dynamics and is defined after the term describing the vertical attenuation of the velocity potential according to linear wave theory soulsby 1987 10 λ ω 0 h 0 r x z cosh k x h x h 0 z cosh k x h x in unconstrained circumstances for instance if a total sand volume constraint does not need to be enforced we set d ψ j which indicates a direction for local minimization of j with regards to ψ the calculation of ψ j is described in appendix a 1 however constraints are added to the model to incorporate more physics and to deliver more realistic results while driving forces behind the morphological evolution of the beach profile are described by the minimization of the cost function j secondary processes are expressed by constraints in the interest of simplicity we have adopted two physical constraints though more can be introduced if necessary the first concerns the local slope of the bottom depending on the composition of the sediment the bottom slope is bounded by a grain dependent threshold m slope dean and dalrymple 2004 this is conveyed by the following constraint on the local bottom slope 11 ψ x m slope the dimensionless parameter m slope represents the critical angle of repose of the sediment this angle is based on observed angles in natural beach environments which are often between 0 01 and 0 2 bascom 1951 vos et al 2020 short 1996 we have considered the observed critical angle of 0 2 a second example concerns the sand stock in the case of an experimental flume in a flume the quantity of sand must be constant over time as given by 12 contrarily to an open sea configuration where sand can be transported between the nearshore zone and a domain beyond the closure water depth where sediment is lost definitely for beach morphodynamics hattori and kawamata 1980 quick 1991 this constraint can be written as 12 ω ψ t x d x ω ψ 0 x d x t 0 t f this constraint is necessary for verifying and validating the numerical model with the wave flume experimental data 3 numerical application in this section we present the numerical results produced by the optimorph model for validation purposes the resulting beach profile is compared to experimental data acquired during a flume experiment we also conduct a comparative analysis between the beach profiles produced experimentally by optimorph and by xbeach with the aim of assessing how optimorph holds up against existing hydro morphodynamic models a brief description of the experiment is provided as well the xbeach model 3 1 description of the experiment the experimental observations have been collected as part of the copter project and a series of laboratory wave flume experiments were performed in order to investigate the morphodynamic impact of introducing solid geotextile tubes in the nearshore bouchette 2017 we use the part of the experiment run without tubes that was devoted to the description of the natural evolution of the beach profile under various wave conditions time and length scale ratio are set to 1 3 and 1 10 respectively to that of the field a flume measuring 36 m long 0 55 m wide and 1 3 m deep is equipped with a wave maker and gauges measuring the elevation of the water surface from which wave properties are derived artificial particles are placed inside the flume representing the mobile sea bottom and an ultrasonic gauge is used to measure the experimental beach profile the experimental beach profile described in fig 1 is subjected to a series of 30 minute storm climates among which a typical moderate storm event at the scale of the flume with a significant wave height and period of h s 135 mm and t s 2 5 s 3 2 xbeach model xbeach is an open source process based model developed by deltares unesco ihe and delft university of technology to simulate the hydro morphodynamic processes in coastal areas roelvink et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2012 bugajny et al 2013 williams et al 2015 in brief xbeach uses four interconnected modules to model near shore processes daly 2009 roelvink et al 2010 the two hydrodynamic modules consist of the short wave module and the flow module the first is based on wave action equations holthuijsen et al 1989 and incorporates breaking dissipation roelvink 1993 and wave current interactions while the latter is governed by shallow water equations andrews and mcintyre 1978 walstra et al 2000 one of the two morphodynamic modules is the sediment transport module based on the equilibrium sediment concentration equation soulsby 1997 and a depth averaged advection diffusion equation galappatti and vreugdenhil 1985 the other is the morphology module which concerns seabed transformations such as the evolution of the sea bottom and avalanching for the simulations the domain ω is defined over 32 m with a uniform subdivision of 320 cells the incoming wave boundary condition is provided using a jonswap wave spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 with a significant wave height of h m0 0 015 m and a peak frequency at f p 0 4 s 1 the breaker model uses the roelvink formulation roelvink 1993 with a breaker coefficient of γ 0 4 a power n 15 and a wave dissipation coefficient of 0 5 these parameters were calibrated using the hydrodynamic data produced during the physical flume experiment concerning sediment parameters the d 50 coefficient is set as 0 0006 and the porosity is 2650 kg m 3 no other parameters such as bed friction or vegetation were applied the model is set to run for a period of 1800 s as a short term simulation 3 3 hydrodynamic validation this section is devoted to the comparison of the two numerical hydrodynamic models to the experimental wave data obtained in the experimental flume of section 3 1 mean wave height profiles were calculated over the short term storm simulation for both optimorph and xbeach and compared to the mean wave height of the experimental model the latter was calculated using the measures taken by the gauges of the flume fig 2 shows that the hydrodynamic module of both optimorph red and xbeach blue are both comparable with respect to the experimental measurements green excluding as is often the case the second point at x 6 m xbeach demonstrates a close qualitative fit over the 10 22 m section of the flume whereas optimorph excels at the coast 21 27 m with a near perfect fit with the experimental data despite the simplicity of the hydrodynamic model used by optimorph the resulting wave height is of the same order of magnitude over the cross shore profile than that measured during the flume experiment which indicates that the resulting beach profile would be comparable with regard to the forcing energy driving the morphodynamic response 3 4 numerical results of the morphodynamic simulations the optimorph model was applied to the configuration of the copter experiment of section 3 1 and the resulting beach profile is shown by the red profile in fig 3 a the main observation is the decrease of 2 5 cm in height of the sandbar at x 9 m we observe a slight lowering of the sea bottom adjacent to the wave maker and a slight increase at the plateau situated at 15 25 m no mobility is observed at the coast when comparing the results provided by optimorph red with that of xbeach blue and the experimental data green as shown on fig 3 a we observe that the red beach profile provided by the optimorph model shows a general quantitative agreement when compared to the experimental data as does the xbeach morphological module in fact both models produce profiles close to the experimental data over the plateau located at 15 25 m from the wave maker fig 3 c at the shore optimorph matches the experimental data whereas xbeach shows a vertically difference of up to 3 cm at x 27 m fig 3 d discrepancies on the part of both models occur in the area surrounding the tip of the sandbar as both optimorph and xbeach fail to predict the shoreward shift of the sandbar fig 3 b the experimental data show that the height of the sandbar remains unchanged with regards to the initial profile both sandbars have a height of 0 375 m however the sandbar resulting from the experimental simulation has moved towards the coast an occurrence that neither numerical model was able to predict as such this new model based on wave energy minimization shows potential when compared to xbeach in the case of short term simulations 4 discussion 4 1 robustness analysis of the convergence in time and space of the hydrodynamic model we computed a reference optimorph simulation using a very small coupling time of 0 05 s which is much smaller than what is usually used in hydro morphodynamic simulations the simulation was performed with the original bathymetric profile of the copter experiment and the forcings of the wave maker this simulation provides a reference computed sea bed ψ r e f t f x at some given time t f we would like to see the convergence toward this reference solution of various other optimorph simulations with different decreasing time steps from this series of simulations we quantify a residual error with l 2 norm as e l 2 ψ r e f ψ l 2 in m we performed 10 simulations with time steps ranging in 0 05 160 s and we get the results described in fig 4 a in order to analyze the convergences in space and time we choose respectively a reference coupling time of t c o u p l 3 s and a spatial step size δ x 1 m t c o u p l 3 s corresponds to the kind of time steps we would like to use in simulations but we will use larger spatial resolution in practice the results in fig 4 show first order illustrated by the continuous line convergence rates in both time and space to understand why a coupling time of 3 s is interesting for computing efficiency it is useful to look at the c f l stability condition analysis for the shallow water saint venant model the analysis provides a typical upper bound for the time step of the form δ t min i δ x 2 max i u i g h i δ x 2 max i u 0 g h 0 where subscript i indicates the mesh node which means that the minimum is taken over all the nodes of the mesh in our situation it correspond to the off shore position subscript i 0 typical values in our simulation are u 0 10 m s 1 δ x 1 m h 0 55 m and g 9 81 m s 2 this gives us δ t 0 04 s which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than our reference time step of δ t 3 s in addition the costs of one iteration of the saint venant and optimorph models are comparable 4 2 parameter robustness analysis one of the advantages of the optimorph model is the low number of morphodynamic hyper parameters required at the present time optimorph requires two hyper parameters the mobility parameter υ and the maximal slope parameter m slope here an assessment on these parameters is conducted in fig 3 e three simulations were performed in identical settings with changes made solely to the mobility parameter initially this parameter υ has a value of 5 1 0 6 m s kg 1 fig 3 e shows no significant difference despite a 50 increase υ 7 5 1 0 6 m s kg 1 orange or decrease υ 2 5 1 0 6 m s kg 1 light blue of υ with regard to the baseline beach profile black similar conclusion can be deduced for the maximal slope parameter m slope whose reference value here is 0 2 the corresponding parameter of xbeach is wetslp described in the xbeach manual as the critical avalanching slope under water and is also set to 0 2 in fig 3 f we observe little difference between the reference seabed black the seabed resulting from a 50 increase m slope 0 3 orange and the seabed resulting from a 50 decrease m slope 0 1 light blue the only apparent discrepancy can be found at x 28 m where the bottom slope is at its steepest and therefore the sand slope constraint is more prone to be active the reduction of the critical angle of repose results naturally in a less steep slope the robustness of optimorph in relation to both the mobility parameter and the slope parameter despite a significant increase or decrease of their value is apparent further simulations show that the robustness of these parameters is not specific to this particular flume configuration but can be observed regardless of the initial configuration 4 3 mid term simulations this section is devoted to a medium term behavior of optimorph the main question being is this numerical model capable of creating an equilibrium state after being subjected to a great number of repeated events five forcing scenarios lasting either 2 or 6 days were applied to the same initial seabed in the same parametric configuration the current optimorph code is in python typically using time steps of 1 s simulating a day of forcing requires about 1 5 h on a 2 ghz pc computer each time iteration gathering the steps presented in this paper requires therefore about 63 ms regarding section 4 1 we could use 3 s time step and divide the simulation time by 3 an analysis of the resulting beach profiles is performed as well as their behavior throughout the simulation the latter is achieved through a comparative study of four time series focusing on 1 the vertical evolution of bottom elevation at the tip of the sandbar 2 the vertical evolution of bottom elevation at a point of the plateau 3 the distance between the wave maker and the onset of the sea bottom and 4 the location of the shoreline position applying optimorph over a longer time series leads to the results of fig 5 the two 2 day forcing scenarios are shown in fig 5 a and b in both cases we observe that the resulting beach profiles in fig 5 f are subjected to the destruction of the sandbar and have a tendency to evolve progressively towards an equilibrium beach profile u s army corps of engineers 2002 simulations over a 6 day period were conducted to confirm this tendency these scenarios are depicted in fig 5 c d and e the resulting profiles given in fig 5 f show once again the destruction of the sandbar the elevation of the plateau and some erosion at the shoreline furthermore all three tend towards an equilibrium state this is confirmed by the four time series analysis presented in fig 5 g h i and j the vertical elevation of the seabed at both points p1 and p2 show initial variations over the first 2 days a decrease in the case of p1 cf fig 5 h and an increase in the case of p2 cf fig 5 i however both studies show a stabilization of the sea bottom elevation over the last 4 days of the 6 day period similar conclusions can be drawn regarding the length of the zone containing no sediment adjacent to the wave maker cf fig 5 g an initial increase between 2 and 3 meters can be observed with stability achieved in the later stages of the simulations finally fig 5 j shows the evolution of the shoreline position initially found at x 28 3 m all scenarios provoke a retreat of the shoreline 0 4 m in scenario 3 0 3 m in scenario 4 and 2 m in scenario 5 the shorelines of the latter two converge whereas scenario 3 shows an abrupt advance of the shoreline at day 5 with an attempt to return back to its stable state of x 30 m the seabed has been flattened the sandbar has been destroyed and erosion can be observed at the coast grasso et al 2011 this tendency to evolve towards an equilibrium state dean and dalrymple 2004 is consistent with the choice of morphogenic and constant storm like forcing conditions the comparisons made between the two 2 day simulations and the three 6 day simulations in this quite limited configuration also reveal the little influence heritage has on the morphodynamic response both scenarios 1 and 2 have a comparable cumulative incoming wave energy density e 1 16 0 t ρ g h 0 2 d t of 0 0591 j m 2 the resulting beach profiles evolve towards similar profiles reduction of the sandbar increase of elevation of the plateau and erosion at the coast despite two different forcing conditions similar conclusions can be drawn regarding the 6 day simulations where the cumulative energy density of all three is equal to 0 177 j m 2 5 conclusions optimorph shows potential as a fast robust and low complexity morphodynamic model involving only two hyper parameters despite using a basic hydrodynamic model for the description of the complex coupling of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes we can nevertheless observe that a numerical model based on an optimization theory works effectively with comparable results to a state of the art hydro morphodynamic model requiring the tuning of dozens of hyper parameters mid term simulations also show typical morphodynamic behavior with the tendency of the seabed to evolve towards an equilibrium state these results demonstrate the tremendous potential of optimorph a constrained energy minimization morphodynamic model declaration of competing interest the

thanks to european funds in the framework of optibeach project and cnrs france funds in the framework of the french miti program appendix mathematical developments in this section we detail some of the mathematical results needed in the implementation of the optimorph model specifically the calculation of the gradient of the cost function j eq 8 with regard to the sea bottom elevation ψ which in turn requires the gradient of the wave height function eq 7 with regard to ψ with the current choice of hydrodynamic model this can be achieved analytically with more sophisticated hydrodynamic models this is not always possible in these cases if the source code of the model is available the calculation of the gradient can be performed using automatic differentiation of programs griewank and walther 2008 hascoet and pascual 2004 directly providing a computer program for the gradient a 1 gradient of the cost function with respect to sea bottom elevation optimorph requires the evaluation of gradient of the functional j with respect to the sea bottom elevation ψ denoted ψ j for our functional of the form j h ψ x involving dependencies with respect to hydrodynamic quantities h this sensitivity is given by a 1 ψ j h j ψ h ψ h requires the linearization of the hydrodynamic model and ψ is a parametric representation of the bathymetry a 2 gradient of the wave height with respect to the sea bottom elevation this section is devoted to the calculation of the gradient of the wave height h given by 7 with regards to the sea bottom elevation ψ and denoted ψ h being as h h 0 ψ the derivation of the third line of 7 with regards to ψ is immediate the calculation of the gradient of the first line of 7 is analogous to that of the second it remains to differentiate the second line of 7 with regards to ψ observing that the chain rule yields for all x t ω s 0 t f with x d w a 2 ψ h x t h 0 w x t ψ k s x t ψ h 0 w x t k s x t and that the term ψ h 0 w x t can be determined iteratively using ψ h 0 0 it remains to determine ψ k s x t injecting the definitions of n c and c g given in 4 yields a 3 k s tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 2 for the sake of simplicity let u tanh k h

23776,this paper focuses on a new approach to describe coastal morphodynamics based on optimization theory and more specifically on the assumption that a sandy beach profile evolves in order to minimize a wave related function the choice of which depends on what is considered the driving force behind the coastal morphodynamic processes considered the numerical model derived from this theory uses a gradient descent method and allows us to account for physical constraints such as sand conservation in wave flume experiments hence the model automatically adapts to either wave flume or open sea settings and only involves two hyper parameters a sand mobility and a critical angle of repose the ability of optimorph to model cross shore beach morphodynamics is illustrated on a flume configuration comparison of the beach profile changes computed with optimorph with experimental data as well as the results from the coastal morphodynamic software xbeach demonstrates the potential of a model by wave energy minimization keywords hydro morphodynamics optimization model validation coastal variational approach energy minimization optimal transport waves data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction optimization theory is the study of the evolution of a system while searching systematically for the minimum of a function derived from physical properties of the system in this paper we have applied this approach to coastal dynamics with our primary objective to simulate the interactions between the waves and the sea bottom along a cross shore profile using mathematical optimization theory isèbe et al 2014 isebe et al 2008 isèbe et al 2008 bouharguane et al 2010 bouharguane and mohammadi 2012 mohammadi and bouharguane 2011 mohammadi and bouchette 2014 mohammadi 2017 cook et al 2021 we have designed a model that describes the evolution of the sea bottom while taking into account the coupling between morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes this study focuses on a theoretical and numerical approach to the modeling of this coupling based on the assumption that the beach profile adapts to minimize a certain wave related function the choice of this function determines the driving force behind the morphological evolution of the beach profile this optimization problem is subjected to a certain number of constraints allowing for a more accurate description of the morphodynamic evolution this study is accompanied by the development of a numerical hydro morphodynamic model which has the advantages of being fast robust and of low complexity the model was given the name optimorph the paper starts with a description of the simple hydrodynamic model used to calculate the driving forces behind the morphodynamic processes then we provide a description of the morphodynamic model optimorph based on wave energy minimization with the purpose of validating optimorph we compare the results of the numerical simulation with that of experimental data acquired in a flume experiment we also compare the model to another nearshore hydro morphodynamic model xbeach roelvink et al 2009 to see how it fares against existing hydro morphodynamic models xbeach being considered to be quite a reputable model in the coastal dynamic community zimmermann et al 2012 bugajny et al 2013 williams et al 2015 1 1 state of the art numerical models of morphodynamic processes are seen as a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the evolution of the sediment transport of the morphology over time in coastal areas different morphodynamic models exist in the literature ranging from empirical models de vriend et al 1994 gravens 1997 kana et al 1999 ruessink and terwindt 2000 to process based models the latter can be sorted into several categories such as i profile evolution models larson and kraus 1989 larson et al 1990 nairn and southgate 1993 which use only cross shore transport ii rules based models storms et al 2002 mccarroll et al 2021 based on a number of rules such as brunn s rule bruun 1954 iii 2d morphological models fleming and hunt 1977 latteux 1980 coeffe and pechon 1982 yamaguchi and nishioka 1985 watanabe et al 1986 maruyama and takagi 1988 wang et al 1993 johnson et al 1995 nicholson et al 1997 roelvink et al 2009 which use depth averaged wave and current equations to model the sediment transport while neglecting the vertical variations of wave derived parameters as well as iv 3d and quasi 3d models roelvink et al 1994 lesser et al 2004 roelvink et al 1995 briand and kamphuis 1993 zyserman and johnson 2002 ding et al 2006 droenen and deigaard 2007 which determine the sediment evolution using both horizontal and vertical variations of the wave derived parameters the optimorph model described in this paper is based on optimal control in the past the use of optimization theory has primarily been used in the design of coastal defense structures whether in the design of ports and offshore breakwaters isebe et al 2008 isèbe et al 2008 optimal control has already been considered for the modeling of shallow water morphodynamics based on the assumption that the seabed acts as a flexible structure and adapts to a certain hydrodynamic quantity mohammadi and bouharguane 2011 bouharguane et al 2010 these studies were based on somewhat theoretical developments with no direct relationship with real case studies our objectives in this work is to produce a physically robust numerical morphodynamic model based on optimal control and to validate it using numerical data from well established morphodynamics software as well as wave flume experiments 1 2 hypotheses optimorph is based on a certain number of assumptions first since the model is based on the minimization of a cost function some hypotheses must be made regarding the choice of this function this function which originates from a physical quantity must be directly linked to the elevation of the seabed in the current version of the model we set the quantity to be minimized as the energy of shoaling waves this implies that the sea bottom reacts to the state of the waves by minimizing the energy of shoaling waves other assumptions assess the behavior of the sea bottom and originate from general observations in particular the bed load sediment transport is controlled by the orbital displacement of water particles soulsby 1987 thus a greater sediment mobility has to be considered in shallower waters another natural observation concerns the slope of the seabed which cannot be overly steep without an avalanching process occurring reineck and singh 1973 last in an experimental wave flume the quantity of sand must remain constant over time with no inflow or outflow of sand to alter the sand stock 2 theoretical developments 2 1 modeling framework for the sake of simplicity we present the principle of morphodynamics by optimization in a one dimensional setting this enables us to compare the numerical results based on this theory with experimental flume data however no assumptions are made regarding the dimension of the problem and as a result it is straightforward to extend this theory to a two dimensional configuration we consider a coordinate system composed of a horizontal axis x and a vertical axis z we denote ω 0 x max the domain of the cross shore profile of the active coastal zone where x 0 is a fixed point in deep water where no significant change in bottom elevation can occur and x max is an arbitrary point at the shore beyond the shoreline as shown by fig 1 the elevation of the sea bottom is a one dimensional positive function defined by ψ ω 0 t f ψ r where 0 t f is the duration of the simulation s and ψ is the set of physical parameters describing the characteristics of the beach profile in order to model the evolution over time of ψ and given the assumption that ψ changes over time in response to the energy of shoaling waves a description of the surface waves is needed 2 2 hydrodynamic model the literature on hydrodynamic models is vast murray 2007 however our main focus in this work is a on the morphodynamic part of the approach and b on providing evidence of the ability of optimization to perform robust morphodynamic prediction even under weakly constrained hydrodynamics so we present the procedures with a hydrodynamic model as simple as possible that is based on the linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 2004 a very basic shoaling equation and some geometrical breaking parameter it has the advantage of being easy to differentiate compared to more sophisticated models that would need automatic differentiation hascoet and pascual 2004 mohammadi and bouharguane 2011 or huge additional numerical developments this numerical implementation has a significantly short run time as shown by the convergence results of section 4 1 this model has the advantage of expressing wave height as an explicit function of the bottom elevation which leads to rapid calculations of the morphodynamics let h m be the depth of the water from a mean water level h 0 at the point where waves are generated cf fig 1 ocean waves here assumed monochromatic are characterized by phase velocity c m s 1 group velocity c g m s 1 and wave number k m 1 determined by the linear dispersion relation 1 where σ is the pulsation of the waves s 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 1 σ 2 g k tanh k h we define ω s as the time dependent subset of ω over which the waves shoal and ω b the subset of ω over which the waves break cf fig 1 munk s breaking criterion munk 1949 enables us to define ω s t x ω h x t h x t γ and ω b t x ω h x t h x t γ where γ is a wave breaking index then we have 2 h x t h 0 t k s x t the height of the waves h over the cross shore profile is inspired by the shoaling eq 2 where h 0 t is the deep water wave height and k s is a shoaling coefficient given by 3 k s 1 2 c 0 c g 1 2 where c 0 is the deep water wave velocity and 4 n c c g c c 0 tanh k h c g 1 2 c 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h instead of considering that waves depend solely on offshore wave height h 0 this model suggests that shoaling waves are decreasingly influenced by seawards waves the greater the distance the less effect it has on the present wave height as such we introduce a weighting function w assuming that the maximal distance of local spatial dependency of a wave is denoted d w the weighting function over the maximal distance d w is given by w 0 d w r such that w 0 1 w d w 0 and decreases exponentially eq 2 for shoaling wave height becomes eq 5 where h 0 w is defined by 6 5 h x t h 0 w x t k s x t 6 h 0 w x t 1 x x x w x y d y x x x w x y h y k y d y eq 5 applies only to the shoaling nearshore dependent waves of ω s significant wave height over the cross shore profile h ω r is defined by 7 where α x x d w over 0 d w to allow a smooth transition between offshore and nearshore dependent waves 7 2 3 morphodynamic model by wave energy minimization the evolution of the sea bottom is assumed to be driven by the minimization of a cost function j j s m 1 recalling the hypotheses made in section 1 2 the shape of the beach profile is determined by the minimization of the potential energy of shoaling waves for all t 0 t f 8 j ψ t 1 16 t t c o u p l t ω s ρ w g h 2 ψ x τ d x d τ where h denotes the height of the waves over the cross shore profile m ρ w is water density kg m 3 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 t c o u p l s defines the coupling time interval between hydrodynamic and morphodynamic models so that we have t f t c o u p l iterations in order to describe the evolution of the beach profile whose initial state is given by ψ 0 we assume that the sea bottom elevation ψ in its effort to minimize j verifies the following dynamics 9 ψ t υ λ d ψ t 0 ψ 0 where ψ t is the evolution of the bottom elevation over time m s 1 υ is a measure of the sand mobility expressed in m s kg 1 λ measures the excitation of the seabed by the orbital motion of water waves and d is the direction of the descent j s m 2 which indicates the manner in which the sea bottom changes the approach involves two parameters with clear physical interpretation the first υ takes into account the physical characteristics of the sand and represents the mobility of the sediment simulations with varying υ that reflect variations of the d 50 grain diameter from 0 25 mm to 2 mm were performed changes in the beach profile were observed but no significant alteration of the trends in beach profile evolution through time the asymptotic behavior of the simulations remains the same although the velocity at which a given profile is reached changes further explanation of the nature of the υ parameter will be given at a later stage of the model development the second parameter λ is a local function which represents the influence of the relative water depth k h on the beach profile dynamics and is defined after the term describing the vertical attenuation of the velocity potential according to linear wave theory soulsby 1987 10 λ ω 0 h 0 r x z cosh k x h x h 0 z cosh k x h x in unconstrained circumstances for instance if a total sand volume constraint does not need to be enforced we set d ψ j which indicates a direction for local minimization of j with regards to ψ the calculation of ψ j is described in appendix a 1 however constraints are added to the model to incorporate more physics and to deliver more realistic results while driving forces behind the morphological evolution of the beach profile are described by the minimization of the cost function j secondary processes are expressed by constraints in the interest of simplicity we have adopted two physical constraints though more can be introduced if necessary the first concerns the local slope of the bottom depending on the composition of the sediment the bottom slope is bounded by a grain dependent threshold m slope dean and dalrymple 2004 this is conveyed by the following constraint on the local bottom slope 11 ψ x m slope the dimensionless parameter m slope represents the critical angle of repose of the sediment this angle is based on observed angles in natural beach environments which are often between 0 01 and 0 2 bascom 1951 vos et al 2020 short 1996 we have considered the observed critical angle of 0 2 a second example concerns the sand stock in the case of an experimental flume in a flume the quantity of sand must be constant over time as given by 12 contrarily to an open sea configuration where sand can be transported between the nearshore zone and a domain beyond the closure water depth where sediment is lost definitely for beach morphodynamics hattori and kawamata 1980 quick 1991 this constraint can be written as 12 ω ψ t x d x ω ψ 0 x d x t 0 t f this constraint is necessary for verifying and validating the numerical model with the wave flume experimental data 3 numerical application in this section we present the numerical results produced by the optimorph model for validation purposes the resulting beach profile is compared to experimental data acquired during a flume experiment we also conduct a comparative analysis between the beach profiles produced experimentally by optimorph and by xbeach with the aim of assessing how optimorph holds up against existing hydro morphodynamic models a brief description of the experiment is provided as well the xbeach model 3 1 description of the experiment the experimental observations have been collected as part of the copter project and a series of laboratory wave flume experiments were performed in order to investigate the morphodynamic impact of introducing solid geotextile tubes in the nearshore bouchette 2017 we use the part of the experiment run without tubes that was devoted to the description of the natural evolution of the beach profile under various wave conditions time and length scale ratio are set to 1 3 and 1 10 respectively to that of the field a flume measuring 36 m long 0 55 m wide and 1 3 m deep is equipped with a wave maker and gauges measuring the elevation of the water surface from which wave properties are derived artificial particles are placed inside the flume representing the mobile sea bottom and an ultrasonic gauge is used to measure the experimental beach profile the experimental beach profile described in fig 1 is subjected to a series of 30 minute storm climates among which a typical moderate storm event at the scale of the flume with a significant wave height and period of h s 135 mm and t s 2 5 s 3 2 xbeach model xbeach is an open source process based model developed by deltares unesco ihe and delft university of technology to simulate the hydro morphodynamic processes in coastal areas roelvink et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2012 bugajny et al 2013 williams et al 2015 in brief xbeach uses four interconnected modules to model near shore processes daly 2009 roelvink et al 2010 the two hydrodynamic modules consist of the short wave module and the flow module the first is based on wave action equations holthuijsen et al 1989 and incorporates breaking dissipation roelvink 1993 and wave current interactions while the latter is governed by shallow water equations andrews and mcintyre 1978 walstra et al 2000 one of the two morphodynamic modules is the sediment transport module based on the equilibrium sediment concentration equation soulsby 1997 and a depth averaged advection diffusion equation galappatti and vreugdenhil 1985 the other is the morphology module which concerns seabed transformations such as the evolution of the sea bottom and avalanching for the simulations the domain ω is defined over 32 m with a uniform subdivision of 320 cells the incoming wave boundary condition is provided using a jonswap wave spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 with a significant wave height of h m0 0 015 m and a peak frequency at f p 0 4 s 1 the breaker model uses the roelvink formulation roelvink 1993 with a breaker coefficient of γ 0 4 a power n 15 and a wave dissipation coefficient of 0 5 these parameters were calibrated using the hydrodynamic data produced during the physical flume experiment concerning sediment parameters the d 50 coefficient is set as 0 0006 and the porosity is 2650 kg m 3 no other parameters such as bed friction or vegetation were applied the model is set to run for a period of 1800 s as a short term simulation 3 3 hydrodynamic validation this section is devoted to the comparison of the two numerical hydrodynamic models to the experimental wave data obtained in the experimental flume of section 3 1 mean wave height profiles were calculated over the short term storm simulation for both optimorph and xbeach and compared to the mean wave height of the experimental model the latter was calculated using the measures taken by the gauges of the flume fig 2 shows that the hydrodynamic module of both optimorph red and xbeach blue are both comparable with respect to the experimental measurements green excluding as is often the case the second point at x 6 m xbeach demonstrates a close qualitative fit over the 10 22 m section of the flume whereas optimorph excels at the coast 21 27 m with a near perfect fit with the experimental data despite the simplicity of the hydrodynamic model used by optimorph the resulting wave height is of the same order of magnitude over the cross shore profile than that measured during the flume experiment which indicates that the resulting beach profile would be comparable with regard to the forcing energy driving the morphodynamic response 3 4 numerical results of the morphodynamic simulations the optimorph model was applied to the configuration of the copter experiment of section 3 1 and the resulting beach profile is shown by the red profile in fig 3 a the main observation is the decrease of 2 5 cm in height of the sandbar at x 9 m we observe a slight lowering of the sea bottom adjacent to the wave maker and a slight increase at the plateau situated at 15 25 m no mobility is observed at the coast when comparing the results provided by optimorph red with that of xbeach blue and the experimental data green as shown on fig 3 a we observe that the red beach profile provided by the optimorph model shows a general quantitative agreement when compared to the experimental data as does the xbeach morphological module in fact both models produce profiles close to the experimental data over the plateau located at 15 25 m from the wave maker fig 3 c at the shore optimorph matches the experimental data whereas xbeach shows a vertically difference of up to 3 cm at x 27 m fig 3 d discrepancies on the part of both models occur in the area surrounding the tip of the sandbar as both optimorph and xbeach fail to predict the shoreward shift of the sandbar fig 3 b the experimental data show that the height of the sandbar remains unchanged with regards to the initial profile both sandbars have a height of 0 375 m however the sandbar resulting from the experimental simulation has moved towards the coast an occurrence that neither numerical model was able to predict as such this new model based on wave energy minimization shows potential when compared to xbeach in the case of short term simulations 4 discussion 4 1 robustness analysis of the convergence in time and space of the hydrodynamic model we computed a reference optimorph simulation using a very small coupling time of 0 05 s which is much smaller than what is usually used in hydro morphodynamic simulations the simulation was performed with the original bathymetric profile of the copter experiment and the forcings of the wave maker this simulation provides a reference computed sea bed ψ r e f t f x at some given time t f we would like to see the convergence toward this reference solution of various other optimorph simulations with different decreasing time steps from this series of simulations we quantify a residual error with l 2 norm as e l 2 ψ r e f ψ l 2 in m we performed 10 simulations with time steps ranging in 0 05 160 s and we get the results described in fig 4 a in order to analyze the convergences in space and time we choose respectively a reference coupling time of t c o u p l 3 s and a spatial step size δ x 1 m t c o u p l 3 s corresponds to the kind of time steps we would like to use in simulations but we will use larger spatial resolution in practice the results in fig 4 show first order illustrated by the continuous line convergence rates in both time and space to understand why a coupling time of 3 s is interesting for computing efficiency it is useful to look at the c f l stability condition analysis for the shallow water saint venant model the analysis provides a typical upper bound for the time step of the form δ t min i δ x 2 max i u i g h i δ x 2 max i u 0 g h 0 where subscript i indicates the mesh node which means that the minimum is taken over all the nodes of the mesh in our situation it correspond to the off shore position subscript i 0 typical values in our simulation are u 0 10 m s 1 δ x 1 m h 0 55 m and g 9 81 m s 2 this gives us δ t 0 04 s which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than our reference time step of δ t 3 s in addition the costs of one iteration of the saint venant and optimorph models are comparable 4 2 parameter robustness analysis one of the advantages of the optimorph model is the low number of morphodynamic hyper parameters required at the present time optimorph requires two hyper parameters the mobility parameter υ and the maximal slope parameter m slope here an assessment on these parameters is conducted in fig 3 e three simulations were performed in identical settings with changes made solely to the mobility parameter initially this parameter υ has a value of 5 1 0 6 m s kg 1 fig 3 e shows no significant difference despite a 50 increase υ 7 5 1 0 6 m s kg 1 orange or decrease υ 2 5 1 0 6 m s kg 1 light blue of υ with regard to the baseline beach profile black similar conclusion can be deduced for the maximal slope parameter m slope whose reference value here is 0 2 the corresponding parameter of xbeach is wetslp described in the xbeach manual as the critical avalanching slope under water and is also set to 0 2 in fig 3 f we observe little difference between the reference seabed black the seabed resulting from a 50 increase m slope 0 3 orange and the seabed resulting from a 50 decrease m slope 0 1 light blue the only apparent discrepancy can be found at x 28 m where the bottom slope is at its steepest and therefore the sand slope constraint is more prone to be active the reduction of the critical angle of repose results naturally in a less steep slope the robustness of optimorph in relation to both the mobility parameter and the slope parameter despite a significant increase or decrease of their value is apparent further simulations show that the robustness of these parameters is not specific to this particular flume configuration but can be observed regardless of the initial configuration 4 3 mid term simulations this section is devoted to a medium term behavior of optimorph the main question being is this numerical model capable of creating an equilibrium state after being subjected to a great number of repeated events five forcing scenarios lasting either 2 or 6 days were applied to the same initial seabed in the same parametric configuration the current optimorph code is in python typically using time steps of 1 s simulating a day of forcing requires about 1 5 h on a 2 ghz pc computer each time iteration gathering the steps presented in this paper requires therefore about 63 ms regarding section 4 1 we could use 3 s time step and divide the simulation time by 3 an analysis of the resulting beach profiles is performed as well as their behavior throughout the simulation the latter is achieved through a comparative study of four time series focusing on 1 the vertical evolution of bottom elevation at the tip of the sandbar 2 the vertical evolution of bottom elevation at a point of the plateau 3 the distance between the wave maker and the onset of the sea bottom and 4 the location of the shoreline position applying optimorph over a longer time series leads to the results of fig 5 the two 2 day forcing scenarios are shown in fig 5 a and b in both cases we observe that the resulting beach profiles in fig 5 f are subjected to the destruction of the sandbar and have a tendency to evolve progressively towards an equilibrium beach profile u s army corps of engineers 2002 simulations over a 6 day period were conducted to confirm this tendency these scenarios are depicted in fig 5 c d and e the resulting profiles given in fig 5 f show once again the destruction of the sandbar the elevation of the plateau and some erosion at the shoreline furthermore all three tend towards an equilibrium state this is confirmed by the four time series analysis presented in fig 5 g h i and j the vertical elevation of the seabed at both points p1 and p2 show initial variations over the first 2 days a decrease in the case of p1 cf fig 5 h and an increase in the case of p2 cf fig 5 i however both studies show a stabilization of the sea bottom elevation over the last 4 days of the 6 day period similar conclusions can be drawn regarding the length of the zone containing no sediment adjacent to the wave maker cf fig 5 g an initial increase between 2 and 3 meters can be observed with stability achieved in the later stages of the simulations finally fig 5 j shows the evolution of the shoreline position initially found at x 28 3 m all scenarios provoke a retreat of the shoreline 0 4 m in scenario 3 0 3 m in scenario 4 and 2 m in scenario 5 the shorelines of the latter two converge whereas scenario 3 shows an abrupt advance of the shoreline at day 5 with an attempt to return back to its stable state of x 30 m the seabed has been flattened the sandbar has been destroyed and erosion can be observed at the coast grasso et al 2011 this tendency to evolve towards an equilibrium state dean and dalrymple 2004 is consistent with the choice of morphogenic and constant storm like forcing conditions the comparisons made between the two 2 day simulations and the three 6 day simulations in this quite limited configuration also reveal the little influence heritage has on the morphodynamic response both scenarios 1 and 2 have a comparable cumulative incoming wave energy density e 1 16 0 t ρ g h 0 2 d t of 0 0591 j m 2 the resulting beach profiles evolve towards similar profiles reduction of the sandbar increase of elevation of the plateau and erosion at the coast despite two different forcing conditions similar conclusions can be drawn regarding the 6 day simulations where the cumulative energy density of all three is equal to 0 177 j m 2 5 conclusions optimorph shows potential as a fast robust and low complexity morphodynamic model involving only two hyper parameters despite using a basic hydrodynamic model for the description of the complex coupling of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes we can nevertheless observe that a numerical model based on an optimization theory works effectively with comparable results to a state of the art hydro morphodynamic model requiring the tuning of dozens of hyper parameters mid term simulations also show typical morphodynamic behavior with the tendency of the seabed to evolve towards an equilibrium state these results demonstrate the tremendous potential of optimorph a constrained energy minimization morphodynamic model declaration of competing interest the

thanks to european funds in the framework of optibeach project and cnrs france funds in the framework of the french miti program appendix mathematical developments in this section we detail some of the mathematical results needed in the implementation of the optimorph model specifically the calculation of the gradient of the cost function j eq 8 with regard to the sea bottom elevation ψ which in turn requires the gradient of the wave height function eq 7 with regard to ψ with the current choice of hydrodynamic model this can be achieved analytically with more sophisticated hydrodynamic models this is not always possible in these cases if the source code of the model is available the calculation of the gradient can be performed using automatic differentiation of programs griewank and walther 2008 hascoet and pascual 2004 directly providing a computer program for the gradient a 1 gradient of the cost function with respect to sea bottom elevation optimorph requires the evaluation of gradient of the functional j with respect to the sea bottom elevation ψ denoted ψ j for our functional of the form j h ψ x involving dependencies with respect to hydrodynamic quantities h this sensitivity is given by a 1 ψ j h j ψ h ψ h requires the linearization of the hydrodynamic model and ψ is a parametric representation of the bathymetry a 2 gradient of the wave height with respect to the sea bottom elevation this section is devoted to the calculation of the gradient of the wave height h given by 7 with regards to the sea bottom elevation ψ and denoted ψ h being as h h 0 ψ the derivation of the third line of 7 with regards to ψ is immediate the calculation of the gradient of the first line of 7 is analogous to that of the second it remains to differentiate the second line of 7 with regards to ψ observing that the chain rule yields for all x t ω s 0 t f with x d w a 2 ψ h x t h 0 w x t ψ k s x t ψ h 0 w x t k s x t and that the term ψ h 0 w x t can be determined iteratively using ψ h 0 0 it remains to determine ψ k s x t injecting the definitions of n c and c g given in 4 yields a 3 k s tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 2 for the sake of simplicity let u tanh k h

23777,modeling studies and observations show that the thermohaline properties of the north west european shelf seas nwess are sensitive to surface wind and heat flux forcing as well as river outflows that transport fresh water from land to the ocean in previous studies it was assumed that the variability of the thermohaline properties in response to river outflow could be adequately sampled with a high resolution submesoscale permitting long term i e 30 year deterministic hindcast in this study we assume that the statistical distribution of the river forcing rather than the time series of forcing itself is adequately constrained by a 28 year history 1991 to 2018 of river forcing created specifically for our domain in this way we created an ensemble of 10 lower resolution 7 km short term i e 2 5 years hindcast models that are forced with randomly perturbed river outflows and an ensemble of surface fluxes from the 10 member ecmwf era5 reanalysis the test ensemble as well with a companion ensemble that is forced with the era5 surface forcing fluxes but unperturbed river outflows the base ensemble for the june 2016 through december 2018 time period in both ensembles the modeled evolution of 25 hour averaged to partially filter out tides temperature and salinity is realistic with peaks in summer for sea surface temperature and in winter for salinity and annual amplitudes that are comparable to those found in other studies of the nwess the increased mean and standard deviation of the sea surface and bottom salinity in the test ensemble are partly an artifact of the assumption that the errors in river forcing have a log normal distribution that mimics the episodic nature of river outflow with a positive mean and an asymmetrical shape with a long tail toward large values for surface density the standard deviation in the test ensemble was below 0 5 kg m3 covering an areal extent larger than that for the base ensemble throughout the year the annual cycle of the areal extent of density in that range had a peak in summer and minima in winter in phase with that of the river outflow forcing overall the effect of uncertain river forcing on the thermohaline properties in this study is small in order to understand the true impact of river forcings better temporal and spatial observations of river outflow are needed keywords regional modeling

references therein regions of freshwater input especially in near shore regions also called rofi are very important to the biota especially where shelf sea water is oligotrophic because rivers transport biologically important nutrients including iron phosphate and nitrogen along with land borne contaminants and sediments to date observations of river inflow have been spatially and temporally sparse at the same time the ability of a single prognostic model to accurately forecast the shelf sea state is constrained by uncertainties in sub surface parameterizations boundary and surface forcing the bottom drag coefficient and by the sparseness of temperature and salinity observations particularly below the surface most of the theoretical and laboratory experiments agree on the basic plume dynamics and structure e g horner devine et al 2015 including the introduction of several nondimensional scales that help categorize individual river outflow types e g garvine 1995 horner devine et al 2006 poggioli and horner devine 2018 jamshidi and johnson 2019a b basdurak et al 2020 spicer et al 2021 our 7 km grid domain of the nwess does not resolve all of the length scales that are present in a plume wake nor the full set of small rivers e g with outlets in uk specifically there are no internal tides in our model such as found in mesoscale permitting models of the nwess guihou et al 2017 however there is considerable value in understanding the effect of uncertain river forcing in our amm7 domain as part of a broader effort considering those of other uncertain forcings as mentioned above especially as our model is an operational ocean forecasting model used at the uk met office if river forcing is important then we will need to increase the density of observations the purpose of this study is to understand the impact of variations in river flow pulses as well as surface flux forcings on the temperature and salinity in the north west european shelf seas nwess the nwess have been studied extensively e g huthnance et al 2022 but the relationship between thermal and haline response to surface river fluxes needs to be better understood here we investigate the ensemble statistics from a set of realistic prognostic models we explore the effects of uncertain surface forcing fluxes and river forcing on the temperature and salinity we use a 28 year history 1991 through 2018 of daily river inflow from a total of 172 river inlets to build an ensemble of river forcings with realistic statistics these ensembles are used to force a 7 km configuration of the nwess using the nucleus for european modeling of the ocean nemo framework madec 2008 we set up two 10 member ensembles which are forced by an ensemble of 10 realistic prescribed surface flux forcing from the era5 ensemble of surface fluxes hersbach et al 2020 in the base ensemble each model was forced with unperturbed river forcing from a 28 year outflow history created specifically for our domain referred to as nowmaps for details see section 3 the subsection entitled observational river database a companion ensemble referred to as the test ensemble was modified to include the addition of realistic flow pulses in river forcing with the same statistics i e standard deviation and mean as in the nowmaps river history the base ensemble members would only be expected to exhibit realistic spread in the evolution of the temperature and salinity fields particularly below the mixed layer or for salinity at any depth work is ongoing at the met office to include additional perturbations to produce an ensemble with realistic spread e g including stochastic model physics schemes and lateral boundary conditions from a global ensemble as done int the met office global ensemble system we prioritized an investigation of river forcings because the effects of other uncertain forces were known to induce biases in the ocean state e g luneva et al 2019 our river ensemble is a preliminary framework being used here to perform sensitivity experiments and has not been optimized for any specific variable 2 model details the ensemble members employ version 3 6 of

december 2018 time period note that in this paper the analysis is based only on december 2017 through december 2018 to allow the regional model ocean physics to adjust to the surface forcing the bathymetry of our domain shown fig 1 is spatially variable supporting a wide range of hydrographic conditions from year round tidally mixed vertical homogeneity to a seasonally stratified water column in spring and or summer the geographic positioning of the united kingdom also referred to as uk allows the exchange of water between the shelf seas and the relatively warm salty atlantic water on the west and the relatively cold fresh water from the skagerrak and german bight to the east this allows the opportunity for different types of instabilities to develop including barotropic baroclinic symmetric frontogenesis and shear driven mixing it is noteworthy that the spatial density difference from east to west would have been larger if not for compensating effects for density of temperature and salinity in both of these water masses however the full spatial and temporal range of dynamics is not resolved with our 7 km resolution as the first baroclinic rossby radius is about 6 km on the shelf chelton et al 1998 holt et al 2017 specifically a field of energetic internal tides with peak temporal variability at quarter and semi diurnal as well as diurnal timescales as found in observations is absent in our model guihou et al 2017 vertical turbulent mixing is parameterized using the generic length scale scheme o dea et al 2017 luneva et al 2019 the lateral and surface boundary conditions tidal forcing and harmonic biharmonic viscosities and other model setup details are the same as in king et al 2018 3 ensemble setup two 10 member ensembles are set up to investigate the effect of uncertain river forcing on the thermohaline properties of the nwess both ensembles are forced with the prescribed 3 hourly surface heat and wind fluxes atmospheric pressure and precipitation minus evaporation from the 10 member 31 km resolution era5 ensemble described in hersbach et al 2020 so that there is a one to one correspondence between the base and test ensemble members with identical forcing the first base ensemble is forced with unperturbed nowmaps river outflow history whereas its companion test includes the addition of ensemble member dependent random daily realistic perturbations to the river outflow time series as described below both ensembles adopt the framework from an evolved prognostic i e non data assimilative tidally forced physics only version of the united kingdom meteorological office foam shelf v9 ensemble referred to as the uk met office ensemble o dea et al 2017 king et al 2018 observational river database the nowmaps river discharge data with 172 outlets are produced from an updated version of the river dataset used in lenhart et al 2010 combined with the climatology of daily discharge data from the global river discharge data base vörösmarty et al 2000 and from data prepared by the centre for ecology and hydrology as used by young and holt 2007 in other observational data sets developed for higher resolution models there were over 300 river outflow points and larger total discharge overall o dea et al 2017 graham et al 2018 the treatment of two or more closely spaced i e subgridscale small rivers as one outlet likely affects the physical evolution of the buoyant plume the two hydrographic settings can have very different physics warrick and fong 2004 warrick and farnsworth 2017 on days where observations were unavailable the nowmaps river outflow defaults to the climatological annual cycle of the available data it is worth noting that in 2018 when the nowmaps river history was compiled the observational database was incomplete of particular note there were no available data for rivers sourced in the united kingdom after 2014 this is one reason why the spatially summed river records for 2017 and 2018 are relative to other years close to the climatological mean fig 2 when this is the case the variability in the nowmaps dataset is likely underestimated the 172 river outflow timeseries in the nowmaps reanalyses are not strictly statistically independent from one another each river belongs to one of 18 river districts as shown in fig 1 of lane et al 2022 and can be grouped into 22 statistically independent catchments where the temporal cross correlation coefficient between any two river outflow records within a catchment is 0 3 this suggests that the number of degrees of freedom in the nowmaps river database about 20 is much smaller than the number of rivers the largest catchment includes the cornwall peninsula red crosses in fig 1 an area broadly covering the region from 6w to 1 1w and 50n to 51 6n with 26 rivers river perturbations for the base ensemble each member is forced with river outflow from a new daily 28 year observational reanalysis 1991 2018 created specifically for the amm7 domain at the plymouth marine laboratory as part of the nowmaps project the test ensemble is forced with realistically perturbed nowmaps rivers we assume that the daily river runoffs have a log normal distribution in time as found previously bowers et al 2012 with a very long positive tail toward large numbers to represent the episodic nature of storms 1 3 days as well as a seasonally varying nonzero mean the perturbed river runoff r is calculated in eq 1 1 l o g r l o g r l o g r σ μ where r is the observed river runoff and r is a sample from a reproducible random variable with mean μ and standard deviation σ defined for each river and year day as shown for the rhine river in fig 3 the random seed is uniquely determined for each river ensemble member and year day this allows us to assess the effect of uncertain river forcing on the hydrography by direct differencing of the test and base ensemble members in each ensemble the first member is forced with the unperturbed nowmaps river runoff reanalysis which means that they are identical and are therefore omitted from comparisons between the two ensembles as a proxy for each individual river we demonstrate that the total daily outflow spatially summed at each timestep with n 172 has a strong seasonal cycle with a maximum in the winter a secondary precipitation associated peak in spring and a minimum in summer as well as an approximate log normal distribution fig 2 notably the seasonal mean in the total daily river outflow is roughly six months out of phase with that of solar insolation this implies that freshwater input and solar insolation have competing effects on the sea surface density in winter and summer but complimentary effects during the transitional seasons justification for river perturbations the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the total outflow have strong seasonal cycles bowers et al 2012 as is characteristic for log normal distributions that of the year day mean of the total river runoff relative to the daily mean is uneven with a longer tail above the mean than below it the mean auto decorrelation time scale for the total river outflow is 2 days however the mean auto decorrelation time scale for each river with a 0 5 criterion is 7 to 15 days we subsample the total river outflow every 2 days after dividing the time series into 4 90 day periods the distribution i e frequency histogram of the total river outflow is statistically indistinguishable to that of a companion sample nsamp 10000 with the same mean and standard deviation with a kolmogorov smirnov statistic of 0 03 and a p value 0 05 the standard deviation of the river outflow shown in fig 3 for the rhine river as a function of year day based on 28 samples per day has a strong annual cycle but is also very variable at daily timescales fig 3 this is what we would expect given our small sample size fig 3 given the 15 day decorrelation timescale we take a straight 15 day average of the standard deviation timeseries so that there are 420 15 day values with n 28 to reduce and smooth the temporal variability in the river flow while maintaining the annual cycle we then fit a gaussian distribution to the histograms of the logarithm of river outflow for 420 15 day records in each month regardless of year as a demonstration of the annual variability of the statistics of the 15 day cycle we show seasonal means for the rhine of the distribution fig 4 which have been subsampled on 30 day time scales so that they are temporally statistically independent of one another the distribution is widest in the winter narrowest in the summer and somewhere in between during the transitional fall and spring season the rivers are not perfectly log normally distributed see fig 3 and might be equally modeled as a power distribution bowers et al 2012 4 characterization of on shelf seasonal cycle in base ensemble first we present output from the base ensemble we begin by considering the on shelf where bottom depth is 200 m seasonal mean of a monthly subset of partially tidally filtered 25 h records from the base ensemble figs 5 and 6 the thermohaline properties of the nwess have realistic pronounced seasonal cycles in all of the ensemble members density calculation density was calculated offline from 25 h averaged temperature and salinity using the lindström et al 2010 unesco equation of state before calculation of the standard deviation in the ensemble dimension temperature in winter the water is vertically homogeneous for salinity and temperature in spring there is an increase in sst of about 2 c in keeping with increased day length in summer the surface temperatures range from around 12 c to 19 c with the shallow waters of the nwess remaining vertically homogeneous the deeper waters exhibit a layer of warm surface water overlying the tidally mixed interior as fall approaches the surface mixed layer is then eroded as day length decreases and storms increase in frequency and intensity spring and fall are transitional periods with warm water south of 55 n along the southwest shelf break salinity in all seasons there is salty water on the west side of the uk atlantic shelf and in the irish sea and relatively fresh water fed by rivers other sources of fresh water include local precipitation and transport through the baltic boundary in general agreement with observations and models variability in sss that is attributed to wind forcing uncertainty is large on the break between the nwess and the norwegian trench davies and heaps 1980 pingree and griffiths 1980 ikeda et al 1989 the annual cycle of sss in the base ensemble is relatively small or unremarkable fig 6 the shallow year round vertically homogeneous english channel that connects the east and west water masses in the south of the domain has intermediate salinity with an east west salinity difference of about 7 ppt around the uk a swath of shallow fresh water from river inflows increases in spring and summer this probably relates to the formation of a barrier layer with stratification specifically there is westward movement of the 34 6 ppt halocline density of sea water at different times of year the temperature and salinity have additive or compensating effects on the density this is because the annual cycle for temperature is highly variable relative to that for salinity in winter cold salty waters have additive effects on the density in the western part of the domain but competing effects in the east whereas the opposite is true in summer during the transitional seasons the effects of salt and temperature are compensatory nevertheless when expressed in density equivalent units i e normalized by the temperature expansion or haline contraction coefficient the differences in the two ensembles are almost entirely attributable to salinity this is not surprising considering that any temperature difference between the two ensembles would likely be a secondary effect from e g the combination of a too shallow barrier layer and subsequent insufficient vertical mixing whereas the salinity is perturbed directly the seasonal cycle of sea surface and bottom salinity serves as a proxy for the degree of mixing not shown in winter and spring the water column is vertically homogeneous due to tidal mixing in summer and fall the north part of the north sea as far south as 55 n is weakly stratified with a fresh warm i e barrier layer on top 5 characterization of on shelf differences between ensemble means the difference in the ensemble means for sss and sst in january 2018 and july 2018 show that as expected perturbed river outflows predominantly affect the salinity without changing the temperature by much fig 7 the amplitude of this anomaly is on the order of 0 1 0 2 ppt interestingly the anomaly in the ensemble mean of sst has a patchy spatial pattern across the domain whereas the sss anomaly is tightly confined near the coast 6 characterization of on shelf variability to pulsed river forcing next we present the results of perturbing the river inflows we focus our discussion on the variability of temperature and salinity in january and july of 2018 as representative as the extrema or amplitude of the annual cycle because we started the model in june 2016 some of the summertime surface effects from the previous year i e 2017 will have had the opportunity to be mixed to depth by july 2018 we consider the standard deviation for each of these variables at the sea surface and bottom figs 8 and 9 for temperature and figs 10 and 11 for salinity overall the magnitude of the standard deviation fields for temperature and salinity are of the same order in the base and test ensembles comparing the left and right columns of each of figs 8 through 11 in winter the surface and bottom statistics are very similar compare top and bottom panels in fig 8 and in fig 10 whereas they have more pronounced differences in july compare top and bottom panels in fig 9 and in fig 11 by consideration of the direct differences of the standard deviation between the test and base ensembles we can gauge the impact of perturbing rivers on the statistics of the thermohaline properties of the nwess temperature in winter the effect of perturbing river inflow on the variability of the temperature field is on the order of 0 15 c at both the surface and the bottom as one would expect for a vertically homogeneous tidally mixed basin see colorbars for left panels in fig 8 the effect of additionally perturbing rivers results in increased variability in some areas along the west coast of scotland and the west coast of western europe right columns of fig 8 variability of sea surface temperature in the vicinity of the norwegian trench shelf can be either larger or smaller in the two ensembles the following summer the standard deviations for temperature in the test and base ensembles are enhanced particularly in the southern north sea in the region of the west coast of germany salinity year round there is a freshwater anomaly between 0 and 0 2 ppt in the ensemble mean sss for the test ensemble relative to that in the base ensemble fig 7 accompanied by seasonal variability of comparable magnitudes but different spatial patterns see left panels of fig 10 of possible evidence of summertime stratification the region of the shelf seas with the largest standard deviation for salinity is at the surface along the slope shelf of the norwegian trench fig 11 this surface peak is not present at the shelf sea floor in general the spatial patterns of the freshwater anomalies in the mean have maxima near coastlines of the uk ireland or western europe starting northward of 45 n just to the north of the border between spain and france decaying in the offshore direction these characteristics likely reflect the fact that the river inflow perturbations are drawn from a log normal distribution the assumption that the river inflows have a log normal distribution conserves natural variability but not volume of seawater the patterns in both the surface and bottom anomalies are tightly constrained to the coast of the uk and the european shelf seas this is likely in part an artifact of the combination of low horizontal resolution that inadequately resolves the dynamics of the river plumes forcing them to be surface advected horner devine et al 2015 yankovsky and chapman 1997 and to contribute to a horizontally thin geostrophic coastal current as suggested in graham et al 2018 and in part due to the fact that standard deviation of freshwater input of rivers is largest at the coastal river outlets shown in fig 1 the percentage of variability in the anomaly between the test and base ensembles relative to the base ensemble ranges from zero to 20 in winter there is virtually no difference in the hydrography because the water column is vertically homogeneous the largest values of the fractional variability are in spring and summer when there is appreciable near surface vertical stratification density over much of the domain the standard deviation in surface and bottom density is below 0 05 kg m 3 surface map shown in fig 12 however there are regions where the standard deviation in density is as high as 0 5 kg m 3 especially in july when stratification is at a maximum for both salinity and temperature the annual cycle of the total spatially summed area where standard deviation in density is in the range 0 05 to 0 5 kg m 3 is shown in fig 13 this measure shows that there is a larger area of sea surface variability in density in the test than in the base ensemble notably we consider it a metric that indicates the differing spatial extents of density variability for each ensemble in both ensembles the time series of the surface areal density variability index has maxima in june or july and minima in winter with amplitudes maximum minus minimum of 0 19 and 0 28 in the base and test ensembles fig 13 7 discussion to put our work in context with other studies in the following we will compare our ensemble statistics for sss and sst with those from 30 year non data assimilating deterministic models on the amm7 grid and also the mesoscale resolving amm15 grid from the first comparison we will show that there is a need for higher temporal and spatial density of river outflow observations from the second comparison we will conclude that the resolution of internal tides in the amm15 domain does not dramatically reduce the bias in the temporal mean for sss and sst the lack of a significant decrease in biases in sss and sst on the 1 5 km grid will suggest that resolution of the field of internal tides which represent episodic short length and time scales does not affect the associated biases by much this could indicate that most of the mixing in the amm15 model is in the vertical rather than the horizontal dimension comparisons with other modeling studies using amm7 grid as part of a progression of studies o dea et al 2017 showed that the long term temporal average of thermohaline properties in a 12 km deterministic model of the nwess had larger biases than those in a companion model on the amm7 grid and graham et al 2018 demonstrated that the biases in that same amm7 model were of larger magnitude than those of a mesoscale permitting model with 1 5 km resolution here we assume that the salinity biases have minimal temporal cumulative trend or drift in o dea et al 2017 and graham et al 2018 nonlinear feedbacks could occur via formation of a barrier layer in summer with too large freshwater anomaly at the surface coupled with too little parameterized sub gridscale vertical turbulent mixing to the extent that anomalies in our ensemble means for sss fig 7a and b and sst fig 7c and d essentially isolate the effect of river outflow forcing we can compare them to the biases in o dea et al 2017 and graham et al 2018 and ask whether they have the appropriate size and amplitude to reduce or increase the bias the answer is that the range in the magnitude of the anomaly in sss is about 10 of that in the seasonal bias shown in fig 7 of o dea et al 2017 and that of the interannual mean of fig 4 of graham et al 2018 while that of the sst is negligible ranging between 0 05 and 0 05 c whether or not the bias in the means of our anomaly in sss is of the appropriate sign to reduce biases is a function of location around the united kingdom the anomaly of the ensemble mean sss is of the correct sign to reduce the biases fig 7a and b however on the west coast of europe and along the norwegian trench the anomaly in our ensemble mean is of the same sign of the biases found in graham et al 2018 and o dea et al 2017 which taken together would act to increase the bias even further note that these anomalies in the ensemble mean of sss are likely due to differences in the river forcing employed in o dea et al 2017 see their fig 3 and the river outflow records for june 2016 through december 2018 used in our study for instance in o dea et al 2017 the spatially summed e hype rivers used to force their amm7 model were overall 18 larger than in the co4 climatology described in o dea et al 2012 additionally there was considerable variability in the spatial pattern of e hype river outflows relative to the climatology particularly there were very large discharges on the west coast of europe but smaller variability around the east part of the uk see their fig 4 whereas in 2017 and 2018 our river history is similar to the co4 climatology compare our fig 2 to fig 3 in o dea et al 2017 the range of the total freshwater outflow for e hype is between 1 2 and 3 8 m 3 s whereas that for the co4 climatological forcing between 0 8 and 2 2 m 3 s see fig 3 from o dea et al 2017 for comparison the range of river outflows in our database are somewhere in between the ehype database and co4 climatology to which it defaults when there is no available data with outflows between 0 8 and 5 m 3 s fig 2 thus we showed that relative to what was found in o dea et al 2017 smaller random perturbations in river outflow result in relatively smaller differences in sss of around 0 2ppt in summary graham et al 2018 and o dea et al 2017 found that river forcing can significantly impact the salinity properties of the ocean over a long time i e 30 year period with sss differences in the 30 year mean on the order of 1ppt see fig 13c of o dea et al 2017 between models forced with the e hype river outflows and those forced with the co4 river outflow climatology with otherwise identical setup this was larger than the effect of changing the baltic boundary condition see fig 13d of o dea et al 2017 the importance of rivers for modifying sss then depends in large part on the accuracy of the river outflow history used to force them clearly river outflow histories are currently only poorly constrained by data our study in agreement with others collectively suggest that we need to increase the temporal and spatial sampling of rivers in the nwess in addition to river outflow there are many other forcings that affect the thermohaline properties that should also be considered in tandem accordingly this work is part of a larger effort to characterize the effect of other uncertain forcings such as the bottom boundary layer drag coefficient or the lateral boundary conditions for temperature and salinity the effects of many of these forcings have been studied separately from one another e g skákala et al 2022 luneva et al 2019 more could be learned from studying their complementary cumulative effects in an ensemble framework they are likely responsible for non linear feedbacks in the thermohaline properties of the nwess comments on the choice of horizontal resolution amm7 vs amm15 grid we can also compare our anomalies in sss to those in the amm15 run as shown in figs 3 and 4 of graham et al 2018 broadly speaking the anomalies in the ensemble mean sss are weaker than the temporal mean in amm15 the amm15 1 5 km mesoscale resolving grid allows the resolution of a field of vigorous internal tides not present in amm7 the advantage of amm15 is that it resolves a wider range of dynamics and presumably also has a better representation of the transfer of kinetic energy across length scales that can occur via nonlinear interactions indeed in a comparison of observation based power spectra of thermohaline variability for timeseries from a group of moorings on the shelf break in the celtic sea with those from a 1 8 km degree regional model of the nwess guihou et al 2017 it was found that the energy peaks ranging between quarter diurnal and diurnal periods were only well resolved in amm15 see their fig 7 the advantage of our approach is that the ensemble mean and standard deviation in our sss and sst fields acknowledges the uncertainty in the forcings themselves by comparing our results to amm15 we can get a sense for the relative importance of accurate river forcing to increased horizontal resolution in this study the shorter time period of our model runs reduces any amount of cumulative drift in the model which if large could partially explain why our anomalies are so much smaller than found previously in the amm15 hindcast the challenges posed for comparisons with observational data are different from those in our short term model one key issue is that the smaller scales resolved tend to be highly energetic and episodic in nature which means that if the data and model share a feature such as vertical undulations of the thermocline that are spatially or temporally out of phase with one another the difference between them can be very large this is a huge problem for ocean data assimilative forecasts as they move toward higher resolution 8 conclusions and future work using a new 28 year i e 1993 through 2018 long daily river runoff history designed for forcing an 7 km model of the north west european shelf seas for the amm7 or atlantic margin model domain in conjunction with the hindcast version of the uk met office operational shelf seas forecasting system we quantified the effect of uncertain river forcing on the thermohaline properties in an ensemble of non assimilative hindcast ocean models for the december 2017 through december 2018 time period comparing a 10 member base ensemble with historical river forcing to a companion test ensemble that was forced with perturbed river outflows drawn from a random distribution with standard deviation and mean equal to that of the 28 year history we found only a small effect of uncertain river forcing on the ensemble mean and standard deviation of sss of the nwess by considering the direct differences between them for each ensemble member the ensemble mean and standard deviation for sss both had ranges of 0 2ppt or about 10 that of the 30 year mean from a non data assimilative deterministic hindcast model on the same grid the effect on sst was negligible the area where sea surface density was in the range between 0 05 and 0 5 kg m 3 was larger in the perturbed ensemble than in the default we explained these patterns by large differences in river forcing the ensemble framework can be used to calculate sample covariance matrices for implementation in data assimilation this work is a step toward a more useful ensemble with realistic spread across different variables which has uses in both quantifying forecast errors and in improving the data assimilation in operational forecasting systems further developments planned to the met office shelf seas ensemble forecasting systems include introducing stochastic model physics perturbations using lateral boundaries from the global ocean ensemble system and updating the surface fluxes to use the met office atmosphere ensemble work is also planned at the met office to use an improved shelf seas ensemble within a hybrid ensemble variational data assimilation scheme which combines climatological background errors with errors of the day derived from the ensemble this framework has been demonstrated in the met office global ocean forecasting systems and shown to have positive impacts lea et al 2022 further modifications to the data assimilation method currently employed in both the regional and global ocean models also known as 3d var fgat waters et al 2015 could include explicit estimation of model biases calculated by an ensemble of models which are later removed complementary efforts to improve assimilation methods in coupled physics with atmospheric forcing king et al 2019 biology skákala et al 2022 and atmosphere land ocean should continue recognizing that the open ocean and shelf seas have different dynamical regimes further work is needed in the data assimilation method application in shallow waters credit authorship contribution statement sarah e zedler

23777,modeling studies and observations show that the thermohaline properties of the north west european shelf seas nwess are sensitive to surface wind and heat flux forcing as well as river outflows that transport fresh water from land to the ocean in previous studies it was assumed that the variability of the thermohaline properties in response to river outflow could be adequately sampled with a high resolution submesoscale permitting long term i e 30 year deterministic hindcast in this study we assume that the statistical distribution of the river forcing rather than the time series of forcing itself is adequately constrained by a 28 year history 1991 to 2018 of river forcing created specifically for our domain in this way we created an ensemble of 10 lower resolution 7 km short term i e 2 5 years hindcast models that are forced with randomly perturbed river outflows and an ensemble of surface fluxes from the 10 member ecmwf era5 reanalysis the test ensemble as well with a companion ensemble that is forced with the era5 surface forcing fluxes but unperturbed river outflows the base ensemble for the june 2016 through december 2018 time period in both ensembles the modeled evolution of 25 hour averaged to partially filter out tides temperature and salinity is realistic with peaks in summer for sea surface temperature and in winter for salinity and annual amplitudes that are comparable to those found in other studies of the nwess the increased mean and standard deviation of the sea surface and bottom salinity in the test ensemble are partly an artifact of the assumption that the errors in river forcing have a log normal distribution that mimics the episodic nature of river outflow with a positive mean and an asymmetrical shape with a long tail toward large values for surface density the standard deviation in the test ensemble was below 0 5 kg m3 covering an areal extent larger than that for the base ensemble throughout the year the annual cycle of the areal extent of density in that range had a peak in summer and minima in winter in phase with that of the river outflow forcing overall the effect of uncertain river forcing on the thermohaline properties in this study is small in order to understand the true impact of river forcings better temporal and spatial observations of river outflow are needed keywords regional modeling

warrick and farnsworth 2017 and the presence of a pre existing coastal current jamshidi and johnson 2019b a for a comprehensive review of the dynamics of shelf seas see huthnance et al 2022 and references therein regions of freshwater input especially in near shore regions also called rofi are very important to the biota especially where shelf sea water is oligotrophic because rivers transport biologically important nutrients including iron phosphate and nitrogen along with land borne contaminants and sediments to date observations of river inflow have been spatially and temporally sparse at the same time the ability of a single prognostic model to accurately forecast the shelf sea state is constrained by uncertainties in sub surface parameterizations boundary and surface forcing the bottom drag coefficient and by the sparseness of temperature and salinity observations particularly below the surface most of the theoretical and laboratory experiments agree on the basic plume dynamics and structure e g horner devine et al 2015 including the introduction of several nondimensional scales that help categorize individual river outflow types e g garvine 1995 horner devine et al 2006 poggioli and horner devine 2018 jamshidi and johnson 2019a b basdurak et al 2020 spicer et al 2021 our 7 km grid domain of the nwess does not resolve all of the length scales that are present in a plume wake nor the full set of small rivers e g with outlets in uk specifically there are no internal tides in our model such as found in mesoscale permitting models of the nwess guihou et al 2017 however there is considerable value in understanding the effect of uncertain river forcing in our amm7 domain as part of a broader effort considering those of other uncertain forcings as mentioned above especially as our model is an operational ocean forecasting model used at the uk met office if river forcing is important then we will need to increase the density of observations the purpose of this study is to understand the impact of variations in river flow pulses as well as surface flux forcings on the temperature and salinity in the north west european shelf seas nwess the nwess have been studied extensively e g huthnance et al 2022 but the relationship between thermal and haline response to surface river fluxes needs to be better understood here we investigate the ensemble statistics from a set of realistic prognostic models we explore the effects of uncertain surface forcing fluxes and river forcing on the temperature and salinity we use a 28 year history 1991 through 2018 of daily river inflow from a total of 172 river inlets to build an ensemble of river forcings with realistic statistics these ensembles are used to force a 7 km configuration of the nwess using the nucleus for european modeling of the ocean nemo framework madec 2008 we set up two 10 member ensembles which are forced by an ensemble of 10 realistic prescribed surface flux forcing from the era5 ensemble of surface fluxes hersbach et al 2020 in the base ensemble each model was forced with unperturbed river forcing from a 28 year outflow history created specifically for our domain referred to as nowmaps for details see section 3 the subsection entitled observational river database a companion ensemble referred to as the test ensemble was modified to include the addition of realistic flow pulses in river forcing with the same statistics i e standard deviation and mean as in the nowmaps river history the base ensemble members would only be expected to exhibit realistic spread in the evolution of the temperature and salinity fields particularly below the mixed layer or for salinity at any depth work is ongoing at the met office to include additional perturbations to produce an ensemble with realistic spread e g including stochastic model physics schemes and lateral boundary conditions from a global ensemble as done int the met office global ensemble system we prioritized an investigation of river forcings because the effects of other uncertain forces were known to induce biases in the ocean state e g luneva et al 2019 our river ensemble is a preliminary framework being used here to perform sensitivity experiments and has not been optimized for any specific variable 2 model details the ensemble members employ version 3 6 of the nemo madec 2008 and are configured for the 7 km resolution 51 terrain following depth layer atlantic margin model domain amm7 shown in fig 1 o dea et al 2012 2017 during the june 2016 through december 2018 time period note that in this paper the analysis is based only on december 2017 through december 2018 to allow the regional model ocean physics to adjust to the surface forcing the bathymetry of our domain shown fig 1 is spatially variable supporting a wide range of hydrographic conditions from year round tidally mixed vertical homogeneity to a seasonally stratified water column in spring and or summer the geographic positioning of the united kingdom also referred to as uk allows the exchange of water between the shelf seas and the relatively warm salty atlantic water on the west and the relatively cold fresh water from the skagerrak and german bight to the east this allows the opportunity for different types of instabilities to develop including barotropic baroclinic symmetric frontogenesis and shear driven mixing it is noteworthy that the spatial density difference from east to west would have been larger if not for compensating effects for density of temperature and salinity in both of these water masses however the full spatial and temporal range of dynamics is not resolved with our 7 km resolution as the first baroclinic rossby radius is about 6 km on the shelf chelton et al 1998 holt et al 2017 specifically a field of energetic internal tides with peak temporal variability at quarter and semi diurnal as well as diurnal timescales as found in observations is absent in our model guihou et al 2017 vertical turbulent mixing is parameterized using the generic length scale scheme o dea et al 2017 luneva et al 2019 the lateral and surface boundary conditions tidal forcing and harmonic biharmonic viscosities and other model setup details are the same as in king et al 2018 3 ensemble setup two 10 member ensembles are set up to investigate the effect of uncertain river forcing on the thermohaline properties of the nwess both ensembles are forced with the prescribed 3 hourly surface heat and wind fluxes atmospheric pressure and precipitation minus evaporation from the 10 member 31 km resolution era5 ensemble described in hersbach et al 2020 so that there is a one to one correspondence between the base and test ensemble members with identical forcing the first base ensemble is forced with unperturbed nowmaps river outflow history whereas its companion test includes the addition of ensemble member dependent random daily realistic perturbations to the river outflow time series as described below both ensembles adopt the framework from an evolved prognostic i e non data assimilative tidally forced physics only version of the united kingdom meteorological office foam shelf v9 ensemble referred to as the uk met office ensemble o dea et al 2017 king et al 2018 observational river database the nowmaps river discharge data with 172 outlets are produced from an updated version of the river dataset used in lenhart et al 2010 combined with the climatology of daily discharge data from the global river discharge data base vörösmarty et al 2000 and from data prepared by the centre for ecology and hydrology as used by young and holt 2007 in other observational data sets developed for higher resolution models there were over 300 river outflow points and larger total discharge overall o dea et al 2017 graham et al 2018 the treatment of two or more closely spaced i e subgridscale small rivers as one outlet likely affects the physical evolution of the buoyant plume the two hydrographic settings can have very different physics warrick and fong 2004 warrick and farnsworth 2017 on days where observations were unavailable the nowmaps river outflow defaults to the climatological annual cycle of the available data it is worth noting that in 2018 when the nowmaps river history was compiled the observational database was incomplete of particular note there were no available data for rivers sourced in the united kingdom after 2014 this is one reason why the spatially summed river records for 2017 and 2018 are relative to other years close to the climatological mean fig 2 when this is the case the variability in the nowmaps dataset is likely underestimated the 172 river outflow timeseries in the nowmaps reanalyses are not strictly statistically independent from one another each river belongs to one of 18 river districts as shown in fig 1 of lane et al 2022 and can be grouped into 22 statistically independent catchments where the temporal cross correlation coefficient between any two river outflow records within a catchment is 0 3 this suggests that the number of degrees of freedom in the nowmaps river database about 20 is much smaller than the number of rivers the largest catchment includes the cornwall peninsula red crosses in fig 1 an area broadly covering the region from 6w to 1 1w and 50n to 51 6n with 26 rivers river perturbations for the base ensemble each member is forced with river outflow from a new daily 28 year observational reanalysis 1991 2018 created specifically for the amm7 domain at the plymouth marine laboratory as part of the nowmaps project the test ensemble is forced with realistically perturbed nowmaps rivers we assume that the daily river runoffs have a log normal distribution in time as found previously bowers et al 2012 with a very long positive tail toward large numbers to represent the episodic nature of storms 1 3 days as well as a seasonally varying nonzero mean the perturbed river runoff r is calculated in eq 1 1 l o g r l o g r l o g r σ μ where r is the observed river runoff and r is a sample from a reproducible random variable with mean μ and standard deviation σ defined for each river and year day as shown for the rhine river in fig 3 the random seed is uniquely determined for each river ensemble member and year day this allows us to assess the effect of uncertain river forcing on the hydrography by direct differencing of the test and base ensemble members in each ensemble the first member is forced with the unperturbed nowmaps river runoff reanalysis which means that they are identical and are therefore omitted from comparisons between the two ensembles as a proxy for each individual river we demonstrate that the total daily outflow spatially summed at each timestep with n 172 has a strong seasonal cycle with a maximum in the winter a secondary precipitation associated peak in spring and a minimum in summer as well as an approximate log normal distribution fig 2 notably the seasonal mean in the total daily river outflow is roughly six months out of phase with that of solar insolation this implies that freshwater input and solar insolation have competing effects on the sea surface density in winter and summer but complimentary effects during the transitional seasons justification for river perturbations the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the total outflow have strong seasonal cycles bowers et al 2012 as is characteristic for log normal distributions that of the year day mean of the total river runoff relative to the daily mean is uneven with a longer tail above the mean than below it the mean auto decorrelation time scale for the total river outflow is 2 days however the mean auto decorrelation time scale for each river with a 0 5 criterion is 7 to 15 days we subsample the total river outflow every 2 days after dividing the time series into 4 90 day periods the distribution i e frequency histogram of the total river outflow is statistically indistinguishable to that of a companion sample nsamp 10000 with the same mean and standard deviation with a kolmogorov smirnov statistic of 0 03 and a p value 0 05 the standard deviation of the river outflow shown in fig 3 for the rhine river as a function of year day based on 28 samples per day has a strong annual cycle but is also very variable at daily timescales fig 3 this is what we would expect given our small sample size fig 3 given the 15 day decorrelation timescale we take a straight 15 day average of the standard deviation timeseries so that there are 420 15 day values with n 28 to reduce and smooth the temporal variability in the river flow while maintaining the annual cycle we then fit a gaussian distribution to the histograms of the logarithm of river outflow for 420 15 day records in each month regardless of year as a demonstration of the annual variability of the statistics of the 15 day cycle we show seasonal means for the rhine of the distribution fig 4 which have been subsampled on 30 day time scales so that they are temporally statistically independent of one another the distribution is widest in the winter narrowest in the summer and somewhere in between during the transitional fall and spring season the rivers are not perfectly log normally distributed see fig 3 and might be equally modeled as a power distribution bowers et al 2012 4 characterization of on shelf seasonal cycle in base ensemble first we present output from the base ensemble we begin by considering the on shelf where bottom depth is 200 m seasonal mean of a monthly subset of partially tidally filtered 25 h records from the base ensemble figs 5 and 6 the thermohaline properties of the nwess have realistic pronounced seasonal cycles in all of the ensemble members density calculation density was calculated offline from 25 h averaged temperature and salinity using the lindström et al 2010 unesco equation of state before calculation of the standard deviation in the ensemble dimension temperature in winter the water is vertically homogeneous for salinity and temperature in spring there is an increase in sst of about 2 c in keeping with increased day length in summer the surface temperatures range from around 12 c to 19 c with the shallow waters of the nwess remaining vertically homogeneous the deeper waters exhibit a layer of warm surface water overlying the tidally mixed interior as fall approaches the surface mixed layer is then eroded as day length decreases and storms increase in frequency and intensity spring and fall are transitional periods with warm water south of 55 n along the southwest shelf break salinity in all seasons there is salty water on the west side of the uk atlantic shelf and in the irish sea and relatively fresh water fed by rivers other sources of fresh water include local precipitation and transport through the baltic boundary in general agreement with observations and models variability in sss that is attributed to wind forcing uncertainty is large on the break between the nwess and the norwegian trench davies and heaps 1980 pingree and griffiths 1980 ikeda et al 1989 the annual cycle of sss in the base ensemble is relatively small or unremarkable fig 6 the shallow year round vertically homogeneous english channel that connects the east and west water masses in the south of the domain has intermediate salinity with an east west salinity difference of about 7 ppt around the uk a swath of shallow fresh water from river inflows increases in spring and summer this probably relates to the formation of a barrier layer with stratification specifically there is westward movement of the 34 6 ppt halocline density of sea water at different times of year the temperature and salinity have additive or compensating effects on the density this is because the annual cycle for temperature is highly variable relative to that for salinity in winter cold salty waters have additive effects on the density in the western part of the domain but competing effects in the east whereas the opposite is true in summer during the transitional seasons the effects of salt and temperature are compensatory nevertheless when expressed in density equivalent units i e normalized by the temperature expansion or haline contraction coefficient the differences in the two ensembles are almost entirely attributable to salinity this is not surprising considering that any temperature difference between the two ensembles would likely be a secondary effect from e g the combination of a too shallow barrier layer and subsequent insufficient vertical mixing whereas the salinity is perturbed directly the seasonal cycle of sea surface and bottom salinity serves as a proxy for the degree of mixing not shown in winter and spring the water column is vertically homogeneous due to tidal mixing in summer and fall the north part of the north sea as far south as 55 n is weakly stratified with a fresh warm i e barrier layer on top 5 characterization of on shelf differences between ensemble means the difference in the ensemble means for sss and sst in january 2018 and july 2018 show that as expected perturbed river outflows predominantly affect the salinity without changing the temperature by much fig 7 the amplitude of this anomaly is on the order of 0 1 0 2 ppt interestingly the anomaly in the ensemble mean of sst has a patchy spatial pattern across the domain whereas the sss anomaly is tightly confined near the coast 6 characterization of on shelf variability to pulsed river forcing next we present the results of perturbing the river inflows we focus our discussion on the variability of temperature and salinity in january and july of 2018 as representative as the extrema or amplitude of the annual cycle because we started the model in june 2016 some of the summertime surface effects from the previous year i e 2017 will have had the opportunity to be mixed to depth by july 2018 we consider the standard deviation for each of these variables at the sea surface and bottom figs 8 and 9 for temperature and figs 10 and 11 for salinity overall the magnitude of the standard deviation fields for temperature and salinity are of the same order in the base and test ensembles comparing the left and right columns of each of figs 8 through 11 in winter the surface and bottom statistics are very similar compare top and bottom panels in fig 8 and in fig 10 whereas they have more pronounced differences in july compare top and bottom panels in fig 9 and in fig 11 by consideration of the direct differences of the standard deviation between the test and base ensembles we can gauge the impact of perturbing rivers on the statistics of the thermohaline properties of the nwess temperature in winter the effect of perturbing river inflow on the variability of the temperature field is on the order of 0 15 c at both the surface and the bottom as one would expect for a vertically homogeneous tidally mixed basin see colorbars for left panels in fig 8 the effect of additionally perturbing rivers results in increased variability in some areas along the west coast of scotland and the west coast of western europe right columns of fig 8 variability of sea surface temperature in the vicinity of the norwegian trench shelf can be either larger or smaller in the two ensembles the following summer the standard deviations for temperature in the test and base ensembles are enhanced particularly in the southern north sea in the region of the west coast of germany salinity year round there is a freshwater anomaly between 0 and 0 2 ppt in the ensemble mean sss for the test ensemble relative to that in the base ensemble fig 7 accompanied by seasonal variability of comparable magnitudes but different spatial patterns see left panels of fig 10 of possible evidence of summertime stratification the region of the shelf seas with the largest standard deviation for salinity is at the surface along the slope shelf of the norwegian trench fig 11 this surface peak is not present at the shelf sea floor in general the spatial patterns of the freshwater anomalies in the mean have maxima near coastlines of the uk ireland or western europe starting northward of 45 n just to the north of the border between spain and france decaying in the offshore direction these characteristics likely reflect the fact that the river inflow perturbations are drawn from a log normal distribution the assumption that the river inflows have a log normal distribution conserves natural variability but not volume of seawater the patterns in both the surface and bottom anomalies are tightly constrained to the coast of the uk and the european shelf seas this is likely in part an artifact of the combination of low horizontal resolution that inadequately resolves the dynamics of the river plumes forcing them to be surface advected horner devine et al 2015 yankovsky and chapman 1997 and to contribute to a horizontally thin geostrophic coastal current as suggested in graham et al 2018 and in part due to the fact that standard deviation of freshwater input of rivers is largest at the coastal river outlets shown in fig 1 the percentage of variability in the anomaly between the test and base ensembles relative to the base ensemble ranges from zero to 20 in winter there is virtually no difference in the hydrography because the water column is vertically homogeneous the largest values of the fractional variability are in spring and summer when there is appreciable near surface vertical stratification density over much of the domain the standard deviation in surface and bottom density is below 0 05 kg m 3 surface map shown in fig 12 however there are regions where the standard deviation in density is as high as 0 5 kg m 3 especially in july when stratification is at a maximum for both salinity and temperature the annual cycle of the total spatially summed area where standard deviation in density is in the range 0 05 to 0 5 kg m 3 is shown in fig 13 this measure shows that there is a larger area of sea surface variability in density in the test than in the base ensemble notably we consider it a metric that indicates the differing spatial extents of density variability for each ensemble in both ensembles the time series of the surface areal density variability index has maxima in june or july and minima in winter with amplitudes maximum minus minimum of 0 19 and 0 28 in the base and test ensembles fig 13 7 discussion to put our work in context with other studies in the following we will compare our ensemble statistics for sss and sst with those from 30 year non data assimilating deterministic models on the amm7 grid and also the mesoscale resolving amm15 grid from the first comparison we will show that there is a need for higher temporal and spatial density of river outflow observations from the second comparison we will conclude that the resolution of internal tides in the amm15 domain does not dramatically reduce the bias in the temporal mean for sss and sst the lack of a significant decrease in biases in sss and sst on the 1 5 km grid will suggest that resolution of the field of internal tides which represent episodic short length and time scales does not affect the associated biases by much this could indicate that most of the mixing in the amm15 model is in the vertical rather than the horizontal dimension comparisons with other modeling studies using amm7 grid as part of a progression of studies o dea et al 2017 showed that the long term temporal average of thermohaline properties in a 12 km deterministic model of the nwess had larger biases than those in a companion model on the amm7 grid and graham et al 2018 demonstrated that the biases in that same amm7 model were of larger magnitude than those of a mesoscale permitting model with 1 5 km resolution here we assume that the salinity biases have minimal temporal cumulative trend or drift in o dea et al 2017 and graham et al 2018 nonlinear feedbacks could occur via formation of a barrier layer in summer with too large freshwater anomaly at the surface coupled with too little parameterized sub gridscale vertical turbulent mixing to the extent that anomalies in our ensemble means for sss fig 7a and b and sst fig 7c and d essentially isolate the effect of river outflow forcing we can compare them to the biases in o dea et al 2017 and graham et al 2018 and ask whether they have the appropriate size and amplitude to reduce or increase the bias the answer is that the range in the magnitude of the anomaly in sss is about 10 of that in the seasonal bias shown in fig 7 of o dea et al 2017 and that of the interannual mean of fig 4 of graham et al 2018 while that of the sst is negligible ranging between 0 05 and 0 05 c whether or not the bias in the means of our anomaly in sss is of the appropriate sign to reduce biases is a function of location around the united kingdom the anomaly of the ensemble mean sss is of the correct sign to reduce the biases fig 7a and b however on the west coast of europe and along the norwegian trench the anomaly in our ensemble mean is of the same sign of the biases found in graham et al 2018 and o dea et al 2017 which taken together would act to increase the bias even further note that these anomalies in the ensemble mean of sss are likely due to differences in the river forcing employed in o dea et al 2017 see their fig 3 and the river outflow records for june 2016 through december 2018 used in our study for instance in o dea et al 2017 the spatially summed e hype rivers used to force their amm7 model were overall 18 larger than in the co4 climatology described in o dea et al 2012 additionally there was considerable variability in the spatial pattern of e hype river outflows relative to the climatology particularly there were very large discharges on the west coast of europe but smaller variability around the east part of the uk see their fig 4 whereas in 2017 and 2018 our river history is similar to the co4 climatology compare our fig 2 to fig 3 in o dea et al 2017 the range of the total freshwater outflow for e hype is between 1 2 and 3 8 m 3 s whereas that for the co4 climatological forcing between 0 8 and 2 2 m 3 s see fig 3 from o dea et al 2017 for comparison the range of river outflows in our database are somewhere in between the ehype database and co4 climatology to which it defaults when there is no available data with outflows between 0 8 and 5 m 3 s fig 2 thus we showed that relative to what was found in o dea et al 2017 smaller random perturbations in river outflow result in relatively smaller differences in sss of around 0 2ppt in summary graham et al 2018 and o dea et al 2017 found that river forcing can significantly impact the salinity properties of the ocean over a long time i e 30 year period with sss differences in the 30 year mean on the order of 1ppt see fig 13c of o dea et al 2017 between models forced with the e hype river outflows and those forced with the co4 river outflow climatology with otherwise identical setup this was larger than the effect of changing the baltic boundary condition see fig 13d of o dea et al 2017 the importance of rivers for modifying sss then depends in large part on the accuracy of the river outflow history used to force them clearly river outflow histories are currently only poorly constrained by data our study in agreement with others collectively suggest that we need to increase the temporal and spatial sampling of rivers in the nwess in addition to river outflow there are many other forcings that affect the thermohaline properties that should also be considered in tandem accordingly this work is part of a larger effort to characterize the effect of other uncertain forcings such as the bottom boundary layer drag coefficient or the lateral boundary conditions for temperature and salinity the effects of many of these forcings have been studied separately from one another e g skákala et al 2022 luneva et al 2019 more could be learned from studying their complementary cumulative effects in an ensemble framework they are likely responsible for non linear feedbacks in the thermohaline properties of the nwess comments on the choice of horizontal resolution amm7 vs amm15 grid we can also compare our anomalies in sss to those in the amm15 run as shown in figs 3 and 4 of graham et al 2018 broadly speaking the anomalies in the ensemble mean sss are weaker than the temporal mean in amm15 the amm15 1 5 km mesoscale resolving grid allows the resolution of a field of vigorous internal tides not present in amm7 the advantage of amm15 is that it resolves a wider range of dynamics and presumably also has a better representation of the transfer of kinetic energy across length scales that can occur via nonlinear interactions indeed in a comparison of observation based power spectra of thermohaline variability for timeseries from a group of moorings on the shelf break in the celtic sea with those from a 1 8 km degree regional model of the nwess guihou et al 2017 it was found that the energy peaks ranging between quarter diurnal and diurnal periods were only well resolved in amm15 see their fig 7 the advantage of our approach is that the ensemble mean and standard deviation in our sss and sst fields acknowledges the uncertainty in the forcings themselves by comparing our results to amm15 we can get a sense for the relative importance of accurate river forcing to increased horizontal resolution in this study the shorter time period of our model runs reduces any amount of cumulative drift in the model which if large could partially explain why our anomalies are so much smaller than found previously in the amm15 hindcast the challenges posed for comparisons with observational data are different from those in our short term model one key issue is that the smaller scales resolved tend to be highly energetic and episodic in nature which means that if the data and model share a feature such as vertical undulations of the thermocline that are spatially or temporally out of phase with one another the difference between them can be very large this is a huge problem for ocean data assimilative forecasts as they move toward higher resolution 8 conclusions and future work using a new 28 year i e 1993 through 2018 long daily river runoff history designed for forcing an 7 km model of the north west european shelf seas for the amm7 or atlantic margin model domain in conjunction with the hindcast version of the uk met office operational shelf seas forecasting system we quantified the effect of uncertain river forcing on the thermohaline properties in an ensemble of non assimilative hindcast ocean models for the december 2017 through december 2018 time period comparing a 10 member base ensemble with historical river forcing to a companion test ensemble that was forced with perturbed river outflows drawn from a random distribution with standard deviation and mean equal to that of the 28 year history we found only a small effect of uncertain river forcing on the ensemble mean and standard deviation of sss of the nwess by considering the direct differences between them for each ensemble member the ensemble mean and standard deviation for sss both had ranges of 0 2ppt or about 10 that of the 30 year mean from a non data assimilative deterministic hindcast model on the same grid the effect on sst was negligible the area where sea surface density was in the range between 0 05 and 0 5 kg m 3 was larger in the perturbed ensemble than in the default we explained these patterns by large differences in river forcing the ensemble framework can be used to calculate sample covariance matrices for implementation in data assimilation this work is a step toward a more useful ensemble with realistic spread across different variables which has uses in both quantifying forecast errors and in improving the data assimilation in operational forecasting systems further developments planned to the met office shelf seas ensemble forecasting systems include introducing stochastic model physics perturbations using lateral boundaries from the global ocean ensemble system and updating the surface fluxes to use the met office atmosphere ensemble work is also planned at the met office to use an improved shelf seas ensemble within a hybrid ensemble variational data assimilation scheme which combines climatological background errors with errors of the day derived from the ensemble this framework has been demonstrated in the met office global ocean forecasting systems and shown to have positive impacts lea et al 2022 further modifications to the data assimilation method currently employed in both the regional and global ocean models also known as 3d var fgat waters et al 2015 could include explicit estimation of model biases calculated by an ensemble of models which are later removed complementary efforts to improve assimilation methods in coupled physics with atmospheric forcing king et al 2019 biology skákala et al 2022 and atmosphere land ocean should continue recognizing that the open ocean and shelf seas have different dynamical regimes further work is needed in the data assimilation method application in shallow waters credit authorship contribution statement sarah e zedler

23778,an ensemble based method for wave data assimilation is implemented using significant wave height observations from the globally distributed network of sofar spotter buoys and satellite altimeters the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf method generates skillful analysis fields resulting in reduced forecast errors out to 2 5 days when used as initial conditions in a cycled wave data assimilation system the letkf method provides more physically realistic model state updates that better reflect the underlying sea state dynamics and uncertainty compared to methods such as optimal interpolation skill assessment far from any included observations and inspection of specific storm events highlight the advantages of letkf over an optimal interpolation method for data assimilation this advancement has immediate value in improving predictions of the sea state and more broadly enabling future coupled data assimilation and utilization of global surface observations across domains atmosphere wave ocean keywords wave data assimilation letkf ensemble data assimilation sofar spotter wave buoys data availability data and software specific to this study can be found at doi http dx doi org 10 5061 dryad b5mkkwhh9 1 introduction data assimilation da with global operational wave models has lagged advances in other domains despite the value of accurate wave state representation for both wave forecasting itself and coupled earth system forecasting more generally in this work we demonstrate the effective implementation of an ensemble based wave data assimilation method that is a fundamental and as of yet not broadly implemented building block to a modern coupled earth system forecasting framework the continuous development of earth system modeling frameworks for weather forecasting has enabled remarkable increases in predictive ability with major social and economic consequences kull et al 2021 this forecast skill is often attributed to a combination of improved model accuracy and observation utilization kalnay 2002 thus effectively leveraging observations in earth system modeling i e data assimilation is critically important to improving forecast skill in the wave domain the massive expansion of in situ observations provided by the sofar spotter network furthers the impact of da developments over the past 30 years the production of ensemble forecasts has become a standard activity at operational weather prediction centers buizza 2019 kalnay 2019 while operational centers generally produce atmospheric ensemble forecasts using some kind of ensemble based or hybrid ensemble variational da method kleist and ide 2015 rabier et al 2000 clayton et al 2013 operational wave forecasts have generally been produced using either basic da methods janssen et al 2005 or no da at all ncep 2022 here we aim to advance the da capabilities for operational wave forecasting to catch up with the state of the art in atmospheric and oceanic prediction while wave forecast skill improvement from da has been demonstrated lionello et al 1992 aouf et al 2006 sanchez arcilla et al 2021 smit et al 2021 houghton et al 2022 and approaches using kalman filters emmanouil et al 2012 or ensemble covariances sannasiraj et al 2006 have been successfully demonstrated this work presents the robust implementation of advanced ensemble da methods in the wave domain at a global scale and in an operational capacity the ensemble da approach is advantageous because it can better leverage the uncertainty information provided by atmospheric ensemble forecasts driving the wave forecasts further with the increasing trend toward the use of coupled forecasting systems janssen et al 2005 mehra and yang 2020 the proposed letkf wave da approach serves as a precursor to initializing a coupled numerical weather prediction system that properly leverages information about cross domain atmosphere wave ocean dynamics with the advent of a globally distributed high density hourly in situ observing network provided by sofar spotter wave buoys houghton et al 2021 in addition to satellite altimetry impacts to forecast skill from wave observations at a global scale have become feasible smit et al 2021 demonstrated a first implementation of assimilation of the global spotter wave buoy network using a simple optimal interpolation scheme to assimilate measurements of significant wave height houghton et al 2022 extended that work with an augmented optimal interpolation approach utilizing the spectral information provided by the spotter buoys frequency spectrum and fourier coefficients of the directional spectrum both schemes provided forecast skill improvements for significant wave height out to three days with additional benefits to peak and mean frequency and direction statistics for the spectral method despite clear value demonstrated by the assimilation of measurements derived from this global network there remain several challenges for skillful wave forecasting enabled by data assimilation namely efficient determination of the forecast error covariances proper update to the model state wave spectra given observations of diverse integral parameters and capacity to correct the wind forcing field based on observed errors in the wind sea in this work we describe the implementation of an ensemble based data assimilation system using the sofar spotter network and satellite altimeters with the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf hunt et al 2007 letkf combines the state dependent background error derived from an ensemble forecast with the observations and their corresponding uncertainties to produce an analysis ensemble in contrast to optimal interpolation oi where a fixed forecast error covariance length scale and structure e g gaussian is prescribed letkf produces updates in the posterior analysis reflective of underlying uncertainty further letkf allows for the simultaneous assimilation of a variety of observation types as long as an observation operator to transform the model estimate to the observation space exists and observational uncertainty can be properly parameterized in the case of a wave model significant wave height observations from buoys and satellites can be assimilated and an analysis model spectra can be calculated without any assumptions regarding the relationship between an analysis significant wave height and the corresponding spectrum in contrast in optimal interpolation frameworks the analysis is provided in the observation space therefore for significant wave height or other directional wave buoy observations some assumptions are required to return to the model space of a two dimensional frequency direction spectrum e g lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 and houghton et al 2022 this functionality of letkf becomes particularly valuable with the combination of the wave spectra observations from the spotter network and significant wave height from satellite altimeters both uniquely valuable observations that can be simultaneously assimilated in an letkf framework finally the letkf implementation is ideally suited for a coupled model infrastructure sluka et al 2016 penny et al 2019 enabling correction of the atmospheric domain based on errors observed in the wave domain a promising avenue for longer lead time improvements in the wave forecast and overall improvements in a coupled atmosphere wave system motivated by the myriad of advantages afforded by an ensemble based assimilation framework we demonstrate how the utilization of significant wave height observations from approximately 600 free drifting spotter buoys and 3 satellite platforms jason 3 saral and sentinel 6a leads to improvements in rmsd of forecasted ocean surface wave heights that can persist out to 60 h or more and improvements in biases can persist beyond that we also show specific examples demonstrating the value of state dependent forecast error covariance information and impacts on predicting swell arrival time to understand the unique aspects of letkf as a method an oi assimilation and forecasting framework is also implemented for comparative purposes sections 2 1 2 2 describe the ensemble set up and processing of observations sections 2 3 2 6 describe the letkf method and implementation choices cycled analysis set up and forecast skill assessment section 3 discusses results followed by conclusions and future work in section 4 2 methods in general the data assimilation methods are evaluated in a cycled da framework for both the deterministic oi and ensemble letkf methods every hour a one hour wave forecast or ensemble of forecasts is produced and used as the background in the assimilation step the respective update method is then applied oi or letkf and the analysis fields are then used as the initial conditions to the subsequent hour forecast 2 1 wave model ensemble the wavewatch3 ww3 model tolman et al 2019 is used to produce a 29 member ensemble wave forecast each member is identically implemented with 0 5 horizontal resolution over the global ocean and forced by an ensemble of near surface u10 wind fields from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf ensemble forecast system members 1 29 of the ecmwf atmospheric ensemble are used member 0 is the control run and not used with each wind ensemble member consistently mapped to the same wave ensemble member at every model forecast step a single deterministic sea ice area fraction forecast from the ecmwf high resolution hres forecast system is used for every wave ensemble member wave current interactions including relative wind effects are included using hycom surface currents wallcraft 2003 the ww3 model spectra are discretized with 36 equally spaced direction bins and 36 logarithmically spaced frequency bins see smit et al 2021 for full ww3 model configuration details atmospheric forcing is updated every 6 h as available from ecmwf in pre processing the zonal and meridional components of each ecmwf wind ensemble member are shifted such that the square of the ensemble mean proportional to the wind stress driving wave growth matches the square of the hres wind in order to reduce biases in the wave ensemble further the wind input source term calibration factor β m a x ardhuin et al 2010 in the ensemble wave model is reduced to 1 42 from the deterministic model value of 1 48 2 2 observation processing methods significant wave height h s observations are used from the global sofar spotter network and the altimeters on three satellites the spotter buoy is an approximately 42 cm diameter directional wave buoy that provides in near real time hourly observations of the directional wave spectrum sea surface temperature barometric pressure sound level pressure surface drift and inferred wind houghton et al 2021 bulk wave parameters are calculated on board from the directional spectrum in this work only the significant wave height is utilized in the data assimilation framework prior to each analysis cycle the spotter data is aggregated and linearly interpolated onto the hour to align with the hourly ww3 model analysis times significant wave height observations below 0 2 m above 25 m or with an hourly difference larger than 5 m are removed approximately 600 spotter observations are available each hour throughout the study satellite altimeter observations of significant wave height are utilized from the jason 3 saral and sentinel 6a platforms sentinel 6 2021 nasa jpl 2013 desai 2016 these data are ingested prior to an analysis cycle in an operational framework i e near real time therefore only approximately 50 of the total number of altimeter observations are available at the time of analysis altimeter observations are binned to the nearest hour and the mean within a 0 5 degree latitude longitude bin is stored i e forming super obs abdalla 2014 latitude longitude bins with a standard deviation of observations greater than 0 2 m are removed observations below 0 5 m above 12 m and north or south of 60 are removed to avoid ice regions a land mask is derived from the ww3 model grid and dilated by 6 grid cells to remove any observations within approximately 300 km of land lastly the altimeter observations are thinned by down sampling to every other bin to reduce redundant information processed observations are calculated and stored independently of the assimilation experiments such that all re analyses use identical observation data fig 1 illustrates spotter buoy locations at the beginning of the study along with 24 h of aggregated altimeter tracks 2 3 local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf we implement letkf following hunt et al 2007 each background wave ensemble member i e n grid points 36 frequency bins 36 direction bins is used to construct the columns of the matrix x ˆ b the ensemble perturbations are then derived as x b x ˆ b 1 t x b where x b is the background ensemble mean letkf balances the prior forecast error covariance estimated as p b 1 k 1 x b x b t with the observation error covariance r to produce an optimal estimate of the posterior analysis ensemble x a the effective kalman gain k of the letkf algorithm can be formulated compactly as 1 k x b k 1 ρ i y b t r 1 y b 1 y b t r 1 the matrix y b h x b corresponds to the ensemble of model estimates transformed to the observation space by the observation operator h which allows these states to be compared directly to observations the integer k is the number of ensemble members and the scalar ρ is a multiplicative inflation parameter used to maintain spread in the ensemble the observation error covariance matrix r describes the expected observation errors on the diagonal and the covariances between observation errors on the off diagonal following the implementation by hunt et al 2007 the kalman gain in eq 1 is a function of the model analysis error covariance which is given in the ensemble perturbation subspace as 2 p a k 1 ρ i y b t r 1 y b 1 the updated state estimate is then provided by 3 x a x b k y o h x b where y o is the set of observations and x a and x b correspond to the ensemble mean of the analysis and background respectively the updated set of ensemble perturbations in the original model space is provided by the transform operation 4 x a x b k 1 p a 1 2 the final analysis ensemble is then given as 5 x ˆ a x a 1 t x a with negative values in the analysis set to zero thus every hour the observations available are optimally incorporated to generate an analysis ensemble with a mean representing the best estimate of the true state and a standard deviation representative of model uncertainty in practice the analysis wave spectrum at a gridpoint is the weighted sum of the ensemble members with the weights determined by the letkf method see hunt et al 2007 for computationally efficient implementation details 2 3 1 implementation specifics a multiplicative inflation of 5 ρ 1 05 is used to maintain ensemble spread over cycled analysis steps every analysis update decreases the spread of the ensemble members however the multiplicative inflation and the strong response to wind forcing avoids any collapse of the wave ensemble members over time a test of relaxation to prior spread whitaker and hamill 2012 as an alternative to multiplicative inflation yielded similar results multiplicative inflation is thus chosen for simplicity an ensemble size of 29 is used to balance computational cost with achieving sufficient forecast ensemble spread an inspection of observed and modeled significant wave height indicated that the ensemble spread sufficiently spans observation values that said a larger ensemble could more reliably represent the true state and remove spurious correlations in space due to the use of finite ensemble size possible spurious correlations in space could degrade the analysis to mitigate this issue a limit on the physical distance of an observation used in the analysis is imposed i e localization the localization is applied with a weighting function that decays with distance d a maximum cutoff distance for relevant observations and an upper limit on number of observations included a horizontal length scale σ h of 800 km is used to determine the observation weight following 6 w d e 0 5 d σ h 2 a maximum cutoff distance influenced by gaspari and cohn 1999 is then derived from the horizontal length scale of 7 d m a x 2 10 3 σ h 2900 km a maximum of 5 spotter observations and 30 altimeter observations are used for analysis at any given grid point for a grid point with greater than the maximum number of observations the most proximate observations are used to derive the model estimates in the observation space h x b the model spectrum is bi linearly interpolated to the observation location and then the significant wave height h s is calculated following 8 h s 4 e f θ d f d θ where e f θ is the model state the variance density spectrum in frequency f and direction θ 2 3 2 observation error covariances data assimilation relies on balancing uncertainty in the model with uncertainty in the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state as a result a reliable estimate of uncertainty in observations relative to the model is critical spanning observational noise and representativeness errors janjić et al 2018 to that end a co location study was carried out to estimate uncertainty in spotter observations over approximately a one year period all spotter observations collected within 50 km were co located and the differences between proximate observations were aggregated a maximum separation distance of 50 km was chosen to incorporate representativeness error of the 0 5 model grid along with observational noise and yielded approximately 93 000 pairs a consistent difference in observed wave heights as a function of wave height itself is observed fig 2 specifically higher sea states resulted in larger differences between co located observations this proportional scaling of uncertainty is consistent with uncertainty associated with integrals over observed spectra young 1986 rather than instrument gps error as a result a relative observation error standard deviation is chosen within the assimilation framework the observation error is estimated unique to each observation as 6 5 of the observation value itself for spotters off diagonal observation error covariances are assumed to be zero for significant wave height simplifying the r matrix to be diagonal and increasing computational speed of the letkf algorithm a moderately higher uncertainty is attributed to the satellite altimeter of 10 motivated by observed noise in the satellite observations abdalla 2014 2 4 wave model analyses 2 4 1 letkf each ensemble member is initialized with the same model state from the free running non assimilative deterministic 0 5 model a one hour forecast is carried out for each of the ensemble members to produce a background ensemble x ˆ b the analysis step is then carried out using ensemble members 1 29 the analysis ensemble mean is then calculated and stored as the zeroth ensemble member ensemble member 0 is then driven by the deterministic ecmwf hres winds while the rest of the ensemble members are driven by their respective ensemble wind member this architecture is chosen to propagate forward a best estimate of the analysis state assuming the deterministic winds are more skillful than any individual wind ensemble member spin up of the wave ensemble is assessed with the global average standard deviation of the significant wave heights in the ensemble as a function of time and the distribution of departures y o h x ˆ b the model spread represented by the standard deviation of h s and the mean of the departures are expected to stabilize for a spun up cycled system and appear to do so after approximately two days or 48 analysis cycles 2 4 2 optimal interpolation to assess the unique impacts of the letkf assimilation technique given an equivalent set of observations a comparative cycled analysis was also run using an optimal interpolation h s oi scheme as outlined in smit et al 2021 a constant observation standard deviation of error of 0 3 m and a model error covariance scale of 0 3 m with homogeneous isotropic structure was prescribed with a correlation length scale of 300 km 2 5 wave model forecasts every six hours the deterministic wind and sea ice fields provided by ecmwf hres are used to drive three day forecasts initialized by the wave model analyses three different experiments are presented here letkf optimal interpolation oi and free running no da for letkf the best estimate ensemble mean assigned to the zeroth ensemble member is used as the initial condition to the four day forecast for oi simply the analysis field at the forecast initialization time is used for no da the 6 hour forecast from the previous forecast initialization is used the wave model is implemented identically as for the ensemble above except utilizing ecmwf hres winds and the corresponding β m a x of 1 48 therefore differences in forecast skill should be attributable to the initialization alone forecasts were initialized after a spin up of 48 analysis cycles and run from october 12 2022 to november 2 2022 2 6 forecast skill assessment forecast skill is assessed by bi linearly interpolating model significant wave height to excluded un assimilated spotter and altimeter observations bias mean error and root mean square error rmse are evaluated for significant wave height as a function of forecast lead time in addition to the globally aggregated statistics specific events are inspected to illustrate the differences between the two assimilation techniques and the non assimilative forecast 3 results the letkf data assimilation runs in the cloud on 28 cores with up to 60 gb of memory in approximately 0 4 h per hourly analysis forecast cycle 2 5 h between the 6 hourly forecast initialization and is therefore feasible to operationalize such as for the currently operational sofar wave forecast used for ship routing optimization 3 1 analysis increment the differences between the oi and letkf techniques are well illustrated by inspection of the model analysis increment x a x b fig 3 illustrates the increment in terms of significant wave height an integral property of the sea state that is physically interpretable for a large storm in the southern ocean with h s exceeding 9 m the letkf model ensemble exhibits a large spread among members or model uncertainty in the southern region of the storm illustrated with the standard deviation of h s fig 3 upper right inspection of the difference in the wave heights calculated from the model ensemble analysis and background indicate a unique spatial structure to the update this update is reflective of both the model uncertainty and the structure of the model error covariances fig 4 specifically the spotter observation in the center of the storm reported wave heights higher than the model background at the same time there exist large positive error covariances between the location of the observation and the northern portion of the storm and a negative error covariance in the southern flank of the storm orange brown shading in fig 4 as a result in the letkf analysis significant wave height is adjusted higher near to and north of the spotter observation and adjusted lower to the south this inverse update lowering waves to the south despite a positive departure in essence shifts the storm further north enabled by the model error covariances calculated from the ensemble in contrast the optimal interpolation update fig 3 lower right is a gaussian looking fit to the observations present with the largest update applied exactly at the observation location regardless of underlying sea state structure as a result rather than shifting the storm in space the overall energy of the storm is inflated within the covariance length scale of the observation further the magnitude of the model increments varies between letkf and oi 10 cm versus 40 cm respectively owing to the cycled nature of the assimilation systems and relatively constant locations of the spotter observations hour to hour each analysis step should only be a small nudge toward the true state that is applied sequentially and should be in balance with the wave model and overlying wind forcing the much larger increments associated with oi likely indicate updates that are out of balance with the model state and external forcing and as a result are destroyed with each model forecast step only to be reintroduced with each subsequent analysis 3 2 forecast time series ultimately the analysis update is sought to provide an accurate initial condition for forecasting inspection of discrete events highlights the performance of letkf versus oi and no da for forecast initialization during a high wave event around october 25 2022 to the southwest of australia the 1 day forecast provided by letkf indicates improved performance for prediction of storm arrival fig 5 displays time series at an excluded spotter location and corresponds to forecasts initialized on october 24 2022 18 00 utc at approximately october 25 13 00 utc a distinct jump in peak period is present in the observation indicating the arrival of the swell generated by the storm the no da forecast predicts the swell arrival approximately 3 h too early oi approximately 2 h early and letkf approximately 1 h early the predictions of significant wave height are offset similarly inspecting the spatial fields at the 19 hour lead time fig 5 right the letkf forecast compared to the oi forecast indicates a distinct reduction in peak period and significant wave height at the leading edge of the storm resulting in the delayed storm arrival in better agreement with the spotter observation 3 3 aggregated forecast skill in all forecasts root mean square error of h s increases as a function of forecast lead time fig 6 for the forecasts initialized by letkf and oi analyses the global rmse at short lead times 0 12 h is reduced by up to 24 compared to the non assimilative forecast at longer lead times all forecasts converge as is expected with identical forcing and model configuration when compared to satellite altimeter observations of significant wave height letkf narrowly outperforms oi at all lead times when comparing to excluded spotter observations oi outperforms letkf at the shorter lead times 0 and 6 h and otherwise follows similar trends as the altimeter comparison for longer lead times while the skill is evaluated at excluded spotters only the free drifting spotters tend to cluster and are very rarely present entirely independent of neighboring spotters see fig 1 as a result the skill at excluded spotters is more reflective of the short term impact of pulling toward observations near utilized spotters whereas the skill at excluded altimeters is likely more representative of updates to the entire ocean domain including further afield of included observations 4 discussion and conclusion for the first time an ensemble based data assimilation method for wave forecasting is implemented using observations from the global sofar spotter buoy network and satellite altimeters this implementation yields global wave forecast skill improvement over a non assimilative forecasting framework with additional improvements over optimal interpolation when inspecting individual events by utilizing the ensemble to estimate the model error covariances letkf provides an analysis increment reflective of the underlying sea state and model uncertainty in contrast to an oi method this novel capability enables physically meaningful updates to the model background such as shifting a storm in space or maintaining sharp gradients that would otherwise be smoothed by oi minor shifts in storm location or swell arrival can be of particular value for applications such as ship routing where certain vessels are highly sensitive to wave period for coastal applications variations in swell arrival time on the order of a couple hours can result in differences in coastal impacts due to combinations with tide and surge phasing consequently incremental improvements in representation and forecasting of the sea state is of particular value while letkf appears particularly skillful for discrete events it remains comparable to oi in an aggregate sense oi is a simple yet effective tool when evaluated near where the updates are occurring and in terms of rmse of significant wave height a metric that does not necessarily capture more complex features that are also of importance e g small scale structure arrival timing of large events that said

23778,an ensemble based method for wave data assimilation is implemented using significant wave height observations from the globally distributed network of sofar spotter buoys and satellite altimeters the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf method generates skillful analysis fields resulting in reduced forecast errors out to 2 5 days when used as initial conditions in a cycled wave data assimilation system the letkf method provides more physically realistic model state updates that better reflect the underlying sea state dynamics and uncertainty compared to methods such as optimal interpolation skill assessment far from any included observations and inspection of specific storm events highlight the advantages of letkf over an optimal interpolation method for data assimilation this advancement has immediate value in improving predictions of the sea state and more broadly enabling future coupled data assimilation and utilization of global surface observations across domains atmosphere wave ocean keywords wave data assimilation letkf ensemble data assimilation sofar spotter wave buoys data availability data and software specific to this study can be found at doi http dx doi org 10 5061 dryad b5mkkwhh9 1 introduction data assimilation da with global operational wave models has lagged advances in other domains despite the value of accurate wave state representation for both wave forecasting itself and coupled earth system forecasting more generally in this work we demonstrate the effective implementation of an ensemble based wave data assimilation method that is a fundamental and as of yet not broadly implemented building block to a modern coupled earth system forecasting framework the continuous development of earth system modeling frameworks for weather forecasting has enabled remarkable increases in predictive ability with major social and economic consequences kull et al 2021 this forecast skill is often attributed to a combination of improved model accuracy and observation utilization kalnay 2002 thus effectively leveraging observations in earth system modeling i e data assimilation is critically important to improving forecast skill in the wave domain the massive expansion of in situ observations provided by the sofar spotter network furthers the impact of da developments over the past 30 years the production of ensemble forecasts has become a standard activity at operational weather prediction centers buizza 2019 kalnay 2019 while operational centers generally produce atmospheric ensemble forecasts using some kind of ensemble based or hybrid ensemble variational da method kleist and ide 2015 rabier et al 2000 clayton et al 2013 operational wave forecasts have generally been produced using either basic da methods janssen et al 2005 or no da at all ncep 2022 here we aim to advance the da capabilities for operational wave forecasting to catch up with the state of the art in atmospheric and oceanic prediction while wave forecast skill improvement from da has been demonstrated lionello et al 1992 aouf et al 2006 sanchez arcilla et al 2021 smit et al 2021 houghton et al 2022 and approaches using kalman filters emmanouil et al 2012 or ensemble covariances sannasiraj et al 2006 have been successfully demonstrated this work presents the robust implementation of advanced ensemble da methods in the wave domain at a global scale and in an operational capacity the ensemble da approach is advantageous because it can better leverage the uncertainty information provided by atmospheric ensemble forecasts driving the wave forecasts further with the increasing trend toward the use of coupled forecasting systems janssen et al 2005 mehra and yang 2020 the proposed letkf wave da approach serves as a precursor to initializing a coupled numerical weather prediction system that properly leverages information about cross domain atmosphere wave ocean dynamics with the advent of a globally distributed high density hourly in situ observing network provided by sofar spotter wave buoys houghton et al 2021 in addition to satellite altimetry impacts to forecast skill from wave observations at a global scale have become feasible smit et al 2021 demonstrated a first implementation of assimilation of the global spotter wave buoy network using a simple optimal interpolation scheme to assimilate measurements of significant wave height houghton et al 2022 extended that work with an augmented optimal interpolation approach utilizing the spectral information provided by the spotter buoys frequency spectrum and fourier coefficients of the directional spectrum both schemes provided forecast skill improvements for significant wave height out to three days with additional benefits to peak and mean frequency and direction statistics for the spectral method despite clear value demonstrated by the assimilation of measurements derived from this global network there remain several challenges for skillful wave forecasting enabled by data assimilation namely efficient determination of the forecast error covariances proper update to the model state wave spectra given observations of diverse integral parameters and capacity to correct the wind forcing field based on observed errors in the wind sea in this work we describe the implementation of an ensemble based data assimilation system using the sofar spotter network and satellite altimeters with the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf hunt et al 2007 letkf combines the state dependent background error derived from an ensemble forecast with the observations and their corresponding uncertainties to produce an analysis ensemble in contrast to optimal interpolation oi where a fixed forecast error covariance length scale and structure e g gaussian is prescribed letkf produces updates in the posterior analysis reflective of underlying uncertainty further letkf allows for the simultaneous assimilation of a variety of observation types as long as an observation operator to transform the model estimate to the observation space exists and observational uncertainty can be properly parameterized in the case of a wave model significant wave height observations from buoys and satellites can be assimilated and an analysis model spectra can be calculated without any assumptions regarding the relationship between an analysis significant wave height and the corresponding spectrum in contrast in optimal interpolation frameworks the analysis is provided in the observation space therefore for significant wave height or other directional wave buoy observations some assumptions are required to return to the model space of a two dimensional frequency direction spectrum e g lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 and houghton et al 2022 this functionality of letkf becomes particularly valuable with the combination of the wave spectra observations from the spotter network and significant wave height from satellite altimeters both uniquely valuable observations that can be simultaneously assimilated in an letkf framework finally the letkf implementation is ideally suited for a coupled model infrastructure sluka et al 2016 penny et al 2019 enabling correction of the atmospheric domain based on errors observed in the wave domain a promising avenue for longer lead time improvements in the wave forecast and overall improvements in a coupled atmosphere wave system motivated by the myriad of advantages afforded by an ensemble based assimilation framework we demonstrate how the utilization of significant wave height observations from approximately 600 free drifting spotter buoys and 3 satellite platforms jason 3 saral and sentinel 6a leads to improvements in rmsd of forecasted ocean surface wave heights that can persist out to 60 h or more and improvements in biases can persist beyond that we also show specific examples demonstrating the value of state dependent forecast error covariance information and impacts on predicting swell arrival time to understand the unique aspects of letkf as a method an oi assimilation and forecasting framework is also implemented for comparative purposes sections 2 1 2 2 describe the ensemble set up and processing of observations sections 2 3 2 6 describe the letkf method and implementation choices cycled analysis set up and forecast skill assessment section 3 discusses results followed by conclusions and future work in section 4 2 methods in general the data assimilation methods are evaluated in a cycled da framework for both the deterministic oi and ensemble letkf methods every hour a one hour wave forecast or ensemble of forecasts is produced and used as the background in the assimilation step the respective update method is then applied oi or letkf and the analysis fields are then used as the initial conditions to the subsequent hour forecast 2 1 wave model ensemble the wavewatch3 ww3 model tolman et al 2019 is used to produce a 29 member ensemble wave forecast each member is identically implemented with 0 5 horizontal resolution over the global ocean and forced by an ensemble of near surface u10 wind fields from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf ensemble forecast system members 1 29 of the ecmwf atmospheric ensemble are used member 0 is the control run and not used with each wind ensemble member consistently mapped to the same wave ensemble member at every model forecast step a single deterministic sea ice area fraction forecast from the ecmwf high resolution hres forecast system is used for every wave ensemble member wave current interactions including relative wind effects are included using hycom surface currents wallcraft 2003 the ww3 model spectra are discretized with 36 equally spaced direction bins and 36 logarithmically spaced frequency bins see smit et al 2021 for full ww3 model configuration details atmospheric forcing is updated every 6 h as available from ecmwf in pre processing the zonal and meridional components of each ecmwf wind ensemble member are shifted such that the square of the ensemble mean proportional to the wind stress driving wave growth matches the square of the hres wind in order to reduce biases in the wave ensemble further the wind input source term calibration factor β m a x ardhuin et al 2010 in the ensemble wave model is reduced to 1 42 from the deterministic model value of 1 48 2 2 observation processing methods significant wave height h s observations are used from the global sofar spotter network and the altimeters on three satellites the spotter buoy is an approximately 42 cm diameter directional wave buoy that provides in near real time hourly observations of the directional wave spectrum sea surface temperature barometric pressure sound level pressure surface drift and inferred wind houghton et al 2021 bulk wave parameters are calculated on board from the directional spectrum in this work only the significant wave height is utilized in the data assimilation framework prior to each analysis cycle the spotter data is aggregated and linearly interpolated onto the hour to align with the hourly ww3 model analysis times significant wave height observations below 0 2 m above 25 m or with an hourly difference larger than 5 m are removed approximately 600 spotter observations are available each hour throughout the study satellite altimeter observations of significant wave height are utilized from the jason 3 saral and sentinel 6a platforms sentinel 6 2021 nasa jpl 2013 desai 2016 these data are ingested prior to an analysis cycle in an operational framework i e near real time therefore only approximately 50 of the total number of altimeter observations are available at the time of analysis altimeter observations are binned to the nearest hour and the mean within a 0 5 degree latitude longitude bin is stored i e forming super obs abdalla 2014 latitude longitude bins with a standard deviation of observations greater than 0 2 m are removed observations below 0 5 m above 12 m and north or south of 60 are removed to avoid ice regions a land mask is derived from the ww3 model grid and dilated by 6 grid cells to remove any observations within approximately 300 km of land lastly the altimeter observations are thinned by down sampling to every other bin to reduce redundant information processed observations are calculated and stored independently of the assimilation experiments such that all re analyses use identical observation data fig 1 illustrates spotter buoy locations at the beginning of the study along with 24 h of aggregated altimeter tracks 2 3 local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf we implement letkf following hunt et al 2007 each background wave ensemble member i e n grid points 36 frequency bins 36 direction bins is used to construct the columns of the matrix x ˆ b the ensemble perturbations are then derived as x b x ˆ b 1 t x b where x b is the background ensemble mean letkf balances the prior forecast error covariance estimated as p b 1 k 1 x b x b t with the observation error covariance r to produce an optimal estimate of the posterior analysis ensemble x a the effective kalman gain k of the letkf algorithm can be formulated compactly as 1 k x b k 1 ρ i y b t r 1 y b 1 y b t r 1 the matrix y b h x b corresponds to the ensemble of model estimates transformed to the observation space by the observation operator h which allows these states to be compared directly to observations the integer k is the number of ensemble members and the scalar ρ is a multiplicative inflation parameter used to maintain spread in the ensemble the observation error covariance matrix r describes the expected observation errors on the diagonal and the covariances between observation errors on the off diagonal following the implementation by hunt et al 2007 the kalman gain in eq 1 is a function of the model analysis error covariance which is given in the ensemble perturbation subspace as 2 p a k 1 ρ i y b t r 1 y b 1 the updated state estimate is then provided by 3 x a x b k y o h x b where y o is the set of observations and x a and x b correspond to the ensemble mean of the analysis and background respectively the updated set of ensemble perturbations in the original model space is provided by the transform operation 4 x a x b k 1 p a 1 2 the final analysis ensemble is then given as 5 x ˆ a x a 1 t x a with negative values in the analysis set to zero thus every hour the observations available are optimally incorporated to generate an analysis ensemble with a mean representing the best estimate of the true state and a standard deviation representative of model uncertainty in practice the analysis wave spectrum at a gridpoint is the weighted sum of the ensemble members with the weights determined by the letkf method see hunt et al 2007 for computationally efficient implementation details 2 3 1 implementation specifics a multiplicative inflation of 5 ρ 1 05 is used to maintain ensemble spread over cycled analysis steps every analysis update decreases the spread of the ensemble members however the multiplicative inflation and the strong response to wind forcing avoids any collapse of the wave ensemble members over time a test of relaxation to prior spread whitaker and hamill 2012 as an alternative to multiplicative inflation yielded similar results multiplicative inflation is thus chosen for simplicity an ensemble size of 29 is used to balance computational cost with achieving sufficient forecast ensemble spread an inspection of observed and modeled significant wave height indicated that the ensemble spread sufficiently spans observation values that said a larger ensemble could more reliably represent the true state and remove spurious correlations in space due to the use of finite ensemble size possible spurious correlations in space could degrade the analysis to mitigate this issue a limit on the physical distance of an observation used in the analysis is imposed i e localization the localization is applied with a weighting function that decays with distance d a maximum cutoff distance for relevant observations and an upper limit on number of observations included a horizontal length scale σ h of 800 km is used to determine the observation weight following 6 w d e 0 5 d σ h 2 a maximum cutoff distance influenced by gaspari and cohn 1999 is then derived from the horizontal length scale of 7 d m a x 2 10 3 σ h 2900 km a maximum of 5 spotter observations and 30 altimeter observations are used for analysis at any given grid point for a grid point with greater than the maximum number of observations the most proximate observations are used to derive the model estimates in the observation space h x b the model spectrum is bi linearly interpolated to the observation location and then the significant wave height h s is calculated following 8 h s 4 e f θ d f d θ where e f θ is the model state the variance density spectrum in frequency f and direction θ 2 3 2 observation error covariances data assimilation relies on balancing uncertainty in the model with uncertainty in the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state as a result a reliable estimate of uncertainty in observations relative to the model is critical spanning observational noise and representativeness errors janjić et al 2018 to that end a co location study was carried out to estimate uncertainty in spotter observations over approximately a one year period all spotter observations collected within 50 km were co located and the differences between proximate observations were aggregated a maximum separation distance of 50 km was chosen to incorporate representativeness error of the 0 5 model grid along with observational noise and yielded approximately 93 000 pairs a consistent difference in observed wave heights as a function of wave height itself is observed fig 2 specifically higher sea states resulted in larger differences between co located observations this proportional scaling of uncertainty is consistent with uncertainty associated with integrals over observed spectra young 1986 rather than instrument gps error as a result a relative observation error standard deviation is chosen within the assimilation framework the observation error is estimated unique to each observation as 6 5 of the observation value itself for spotters off diagonal observation error covariances are assumed to be zero for significant wave height simplifying the r matrix to be diagonal and increasing computational speed of the letkf algorithm a moderately higher uncertainty is attributed to the satellite altimeter of 10 motivated by observed noise in the satellite observations abdalla 2014 2 4 wave model analyses 2 4 1 letkf each ensemble member is initialized with the same model state from the free running non assimilative deterministic 0 5 model a one hour forecast is carried out for each of the ensemble members to produce a background ensemble x ˆ b the analysis step is then carried out using ensemble members 1 29 the analysis ensemble mean is then calculated and stored as the zeroth ensemble member ensemble member 0 is then driven by the deterministic ecmwf hres winds while the rest of the ensemble members are driven by their respective ensemble wind member this architecture is chosen to propagate forward a best estimate of the analysis state assuming the deterministic winds are more skillful than any individual wind ensemble member spin up of the wave ensemble is assessed with the global average standard deviation of the significant wave heights in the ensemble as a function of time and the distribution of departures y o h x ˆ b the model spread represented by the standard deviation of h s and the mean of the departures are expected to stabilize for a spun up cycled system and appear to do so after approximately two days or 48 analysis cycles 2 4 2 optimal interpolation to assess the unique impacts of the letkf assimilation technique given an equivalent set of observations a comparative cycled analysis was also run using an optimal interpolation h s oi scheme as outlined in smit et al 2021 a constant observation standard deviation of error of 0 3 m and a model error covariance scale of 0 3 m with homogeneous isotropic structure was prescribed with a correlation length scale of 300 km 2 5 wave model forecasts every six hours the deterministic wind and sea ice fields provided by ecmwf hres are used to drive three day forecasts initialized by the wave model analyses three different experiments are presented here letkf optimal interpolation oi and free running no da for letkf the best estimate ensemble mean assigned to the zeroth ensemble member is used as the initial condition to the four day forecast for oi simply the analysis field at the forecast initialization time is used for no da the 6 hour forecast from the previous forecast initialization is used the wave model is implemented identically as for the ensemble above except utilizing ecmwf hres winds and the corresponding β m a x of 1 48 therefore differences in forecast skill should be attributable to the initialization alone forecasts were initialized after a spin up of 48 analysis cycles and run from october 12 2022 to november 2 2022 2 6 forecast skill assessment forecast skill is assessed by bi linearly interpolating model significant wave height to excluded un assimilated spotter and altimeter observations bias mean error and root mean square error rmse are evaluated for significant wave height as a function of forecast lead time in addition to the globally aggregated statistics specific events are inspected to illustrate the differences between the two assimilation techniques and the non assimilative forecast 3 results the letkf data assimilation runs in the cloud on 28 cores with up to 60 gb of memory in approximately 0 4 h per hourly analysis forecast cycle 2 5 h between the 6 hourly forecast initialization and is therefore feasible to operationalize such as for the currently operational sofar wave forecast used for ship routing optimization 3 1 analysis increment the differences between the oi and letkf techniques are well illustrated by inspection of the model analysis increment x a x b fig 3 illustrates the increment in terms of significant wave height an integral property of the sea state that is physically interpretable for a large storm in the southern ocean with h s exceeding 9 m the letkf model ensemble exhibits a large spread among members or model uncertainty in the southern region of the storm illustrated with the standard deviation of h s fig 3 upper right inspection of the difference in the wave heights calculated from the model ensemble analysis and background indicate a unique spatial structure to the update this update is reflective of both the model uncertainty and the structure of the model error covariances fig 4 specifically the spotter observation in the center of the storm reported wave heights higher than the model background at the same time there exist large positive error covariances between the location of the observation and the northern portion of the storm and a negative error covariance in the southern flank of the storm orange brown shading in fig 4 as a result in the letkf analysis significant wave height is adjusted higher near to and north of the spotter observation and adjusted lower to the south this inverse update lowering waves to the south despite a positive departure in essence shifts the storm further north enabled by the model error covariances calculated from the ensemble in contrast the optimal interpolation update fig 3 lower right is a gaussian looking fit to the observations present with the largest update applied exactly at the observation location regardless of underlying sea state structure as a result rather than shifting the storm in space the overall energy of the storm is inflated within the covariance length scale of the observation further the magnitude of the model increments varies between letkf and oi 10 cm versus 40 cm respectively owing to the cycled nature of the assimilation systems and relatively constant locations of the spotter observations hour to hour each analysis step should only be a small nudge toward the true state that is applied sequentially and should be in balance with the wave model and overlying wind forcing the much larger increments associated with oi likely indicate updates that are out of balance with the model state and external forcing and as a result are destroyed with each model forecast step only to be reintroduced with each subsequent analysis 3 2 forecast time series ultimately the analysis update is sought to provide an accurate initial condition for forecasting inspection of discrete events highlights the performance of letkf versus oi and no da for forecast initialization during a high wave event around october 25 2022 to the southwest of australia the 1 day forecast provided by letkf indicates improved performance for prediction of storm arrival fig 5 displays time series at an excluded spotter location and corresponds to forecasts initialized on october 24 2022 18 00 utc at approximately october 25 13 00 utc a distinct jump in peak period is present in the observation indicating the arrival of the swell generated by the storm the no da forecast predicts the swell arrival approximately 3 h too early oi approximately 2 h early and letkf approximately 1 h early the predictions of significant wave height are offset similarly inspecting the spatial fields at the 19 hour lead time fig 5 right the letkf forecast compared to the oi forecast indicates a distinct reduction in peak period and significant wave height at the leading edge of the storm resulting in the delayed storm arrival in better agreement with the spotter observation 3 3 aggregated forecast skill in all forecasts root mean square error of h s increases as a function of forecast lead time fig 6 for the forecasts initialized by letkf and oi analyses the global rmse at short lead times 0 12 h is reduced by up to 24 compared to the non assimilative forecast at longer lead times all forecasts converge as is expected with identical forcing and model configuration when compared to satellite altimeter observations of significant wave height letkf narrowly outperforms oi at all lead times when comparing to excluded spotter observations oi outperforms letkf at the shorter lead times 0 and 6 h and otherwise follows similar trends as the altimeter comparison for longer lead times while the skill is evaluated at excluded spotters only the free drifting spotters tend to cluster and are very rarely present entirely independent of neighboring spotters see fig 1 as a result the skill at excluded spotters is more reflective of the short term impact of pulling toward observations near utilized spotters whereas the skill at excluded altimeters is likely more representative of updates to the entire ocean domain including further afield of included observations 4 discussion and conclusion for the first time an ensemble based data assimilation method for wave forecasting is implemented using observations from the global sofar spotter buoy network and satellite altimeters this implementation yields global wave forecast skill improvement over a non assimilative forecasting framework with additional improvements over optimal interpolation when inspecting individual events by utilizing the ensemble to estimate the model error covariances letkf provides an analysis increment reflective of the underlying sea state and model uncertainty in contrast to an oi method this novel capability enables physically meaningful updates to the model background such as shifting a storm in space or maintaining sharp gradients that would otherwise be smoothed by oi minor shifts in storm location or swell arrival can be of particular value for applications such as ship routing where certain vessels are highly sensitive to wave period for coastal applications variations in swell arrival time on the order of a couple hours can result in differences in coastal impacts due to combinations with tide and surge phasing consequently incremental improvements in representation and forecasting of the sea state is of particular value while letkf appears particularly skillful for discrete events it remains comparable to oi in an aggregate sense oi is a simple yet effective tool when evaluated near where the updates are occurring and in terms of rmse of significant wave height a metric that does not necessarily capture more complex features that are also of importance e g small scale structure arrival timing of large events that said the superior performance of letkf when compared to altimeter observations indicates the ability of letkf to provide skillful updates far from observations by leveraging understanding of the model error covariances in a way that oi fundamentally cannot do further optimization of the letkf implementation e g tuning background ensemble model skill observation error covariances localization multiplicative inflation may serve to reduce forecast errors further regardless the primary objective of the implementation presented herein is the robust ensemble based approach to enable more advanced implementations in a coupled earth system model framework an efficient and skillful letkf implementation for wave forecasting is critical for future development of coupled earth system modeling frameworks specifically with access to an ensemble the errors in the wave domain can then correct the atmospheric domain by extending the observations provided by the comprehensive global spotter network to atmospheric corrections the potential for both unique atmospheric forecast improvements and wave forecast skill improvements at longer lead times where errors are nearly entirely determined by errors in the overlying winds becomes feasible further letkf is particularly well suited to handle diverse sets of observations such as wave spectra and significant wave heights

ssh shaw et al 1999 kuo et al 2000 xie et al 2007 sea surface temperature sst ho et al 2000a b kuo et al 2000 xie et al 2007 chen et al 2012 and chlorophyll xie et al 2003 the svoc advects cold upwelled water offshore into the scs to cool off the surface temperature and plays an important role in interannual variability of the summer sst in scs xie et al 2003 numerical simulations have consistently shown that the major driving force of the svoc is the wind stress curl shaw and chao 1994 chao et al 1996 chu et al 1999 metzger 2003 wang et al 2006 cai et al 2007 gan and qu 2008 sun and lan 2021 2022 and the summer wind stress curl dipole east of vietnam is responsible for the ssh dipole structure associated with svoc metzger 2003 wang et al 2006 cai et al 2007 gan and qu 2008 furthermore wang et al 2006 investigated the formation of the ssh dipole structure using a reduced gravity model and found that the nonlinearity is crucial for the generation of the dipole structure cai et al 2007 employed a connected single layer two layer model to study the separation position of svoc and its strength their results suggested the svoc is stronger and its separation position is more northward when there is inflow via sunda shelf and vice versa chen et al 2012 on the other hand indicated that mekong river discharge and tides can also be important wind stress curl as the generation mechanism of svoc is also confirmed by observational data empirical orthogonal function eof analysis of the topex poseidon altimeter data and the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis wind stress in the scs from 1992 to 1995 demonstrate that the svoc is mainly driven by the wind stress curl shaw et al 1999 thus wind stress curl is an agreed upon consensus about the dynamics that drives the svoc there is difference among these results on the location where the svoc separates from the coast the observed separation locations have low variability mainly along 11 n 12 n ctd observation during september 1994 suggested the svoc deviates from the coastline and turns eastward between 11 n and 12 n fang et al 1998 the advanced very high resolution radiometer infrared images also indicate that the svoc veers eastward between 11 n and 12 n in mid august 1997 kuo et al 2000 the separation location in the numerical simulations varies with a much bigger range from 10 n chu et al 1999 to 11 n 14 n shaw and chao 1994 and 10 n 14 n cai et al 2007 on average the svoc and the associated dipole begins in june peaks in strength in august or september and disappears in october wang et al 2006 the hycom reanalysis monthly mean ssh in august over the period 1994 to 2015 fig 3 indicates the summer circulation east of vietnam in some years can be very different from a normal svoc summer 2010 fig 3 is a clearly anomalous summer since there is no ssh dipole east of vietnam fang et al 1998 pointed out that the anti cyclonic circulation associated with the dipole has a horizontal scale of 400 km between 110 e to 115 e their fig 3 in this research a normal svoc is thus defined as the scs ssh pattern within 110 e 115 e that satisfies these three conditions 1 a ssh dipole with cyclonic eddy to the north and anti cyclonic eddy to the south in water deeper than 500 m 2 the orientation of the dipole has to be oriented north south instead of east west and 3 the center of the anti cyclonic eddy associated with the svoc is located south of 12 n based on this definition an anomalous svoc occurred in 1995 1998 2007 2010 and 2015 the svoc in 1995 and 1998 violate condition 3 the 2007 svoc violates condition 1 the 2010 svoc violates all three conditions and the 2015 svoc violates condition 2 without these five anomalous summers the mean 17 year ssh in august indicates that the svoc and the associated dipole are strengthened compare fig 2e with fig 2d in this study we perform an eof analysis on the ssh and wind stress curl fields to reveal why the svoc is anomalous in these five years eof analyses have been applied to topex poseidon altimeter data during the period 1992 to 1995 shaw et al 1999 1992 to 1998 ho et al 2000a and 1992 to 1999 chu and fang 2003 to study the scs circulation this research differs and improves on previous studies in that 1 we focus on a smaller region east of vietnam instead of the whole scs to eliminate the dominating ssh variation over the continental shelf and focus on the dipole more details in section 3 2 our eof analysis is performed over 22 year ssh data longer than data used in these previous studies and thus should have less eof sampling errors north et al 1982 and 3 we use the local variance yu et al 2022 instead of the total variance explained by the eof modes to determine which mode is the dominant mode responsible for svoc more details in section 4 this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the numerical model configuration data assimilation method and surface forcing for the reanalysis section 3 describes the monthly mean characteristics of the ssh and wind stress curl eof analysis of the monthly ssh and wind stress curl anomalies are presented in section 4 which is followed by discussions in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 numerical model and reanalysis a 22 year global hycom reanalysis from 1994 to 2015 is used for this study hycom is a primitive equation general ocean circulation model applied to large scale marginal sea and coastal studies and the ocean model component for the present operational us navy global ocean forecast system metzger et al 2014 a detailed description of hycom physics is provided by bleck 2002 a brief description of the model setup is presented below with emphasis on the numerical aspects that are most relevant to this study there are no tides or surface waves in this reanalysis 2 1 model grids and output the hycom horizontal resolution for the reanalysis is 0 08 1 12 5 that is 9 km at the equator and 8 7 km at the latitude of svoc separation the grid is uniform cylindrical from 78 64 s 66 s mercator between 66 s 47 n and includes a bipolar patch north of 47 n providing 3 5 km grid spacing at the north pole the bathymetry is derived from 30 arc second general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco https www gebeo net three coexisting hycom vertical coordinates z coordinates in unstratified water terrain following sigma coordinates in shallow depths and isopycnal coordinates in the stratified ocean provide hycom significant advantages of an isopycnal model in the stratified ocean but allows coordinate surfaces to locally deviate from isopycnals to provide more vertical resolution near the surface and in shallow coastal regions in order to better represent the upper ocean physics chassignet et al 2003 with this unique feature hycom serves as a good tool for simulating circulations in the scs which has complex topography that covers the continental shelf and deep basin there are 41 hybrid coordinate layers vertically with potential density referenced to 2000 m the top 14 layers are always sigma z so that water shallower than 84 m is always in fixed coordinates for this study we analyze monthly ssh and wind stresses output which were interpolated to a uniform 0 08 resolution grid from the native model grid 2 2 data assimilation the data assimilation technique employed for the reanalysis is a 3d variational scheme used within the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 that takes the 24 hour model forecast as a first guess available remotely sensed sst ssh sea ice concentration and in situ observations of temperature and salinity from profiles ships marine mammals and moored and drifting buoys are all assimilated into hycom the reanalysis provides realistic ssh fields as verified by cummings and smedstad 2013 who showed the assimilated ssh field in the kuroshio region is in good agreement with independent infrared frontal analyses 2 3 initialization and surface forcing the reanalysis uses atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha and coauthors 2010 during the period 1994 to 2010 and 0 205 ncep climate forecast system version2 cfsv2 saha and coauthors 2014 from 2011 onward the surface stress formulation in the model includes both winds and the ocean surface currents yu et al 2017 the ncep 10 m wind velocities are read by hycom and the wind stress is calculated at every time step taking into account the ocean surface currents as shown below 1 τ ρ a i r c d v 10 v o v 10 v o where ρ a i r is the air density at sea level c d is the drag coefficient v 10 is the 10 m wind velocity and v o is the velocity of ocean surface currents at 1 m depth the wind stress calculated based on eq 1 is the surface stress used by hycom and is used for the eof analysis in this research the 22 year reanalysis is not continuous but separated into streams to speed up the time to solution when it was integrated most of the streams are 2 5 years long for each stream the initialization state comes from a previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis https www hycom org dataserver gofs 3pt0 reanalysis on 1 december of the previous year except the very first stream started on 1 june 1993 the previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis is also forced by the ncep cfsr and cfsv2 wind stresses directly yu et al 2015 2019 but does not include the hycom ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation when the new wind stress formulation eq 1 including ocean surface current is applied the basin wide kinetic energy takes 6 months to reach an equilibrium yu et al 2018 thus while the 2 5 year streams start on december 1 of the previous year and end after 31 months of integration i e the end of june only the last two years of output e g july 2001 to june 2003 from each 2 5 year stream are used in the analysis here 3 monthly mean model results an eof analysis is performed over data anomalies often the seasonal cycle is the most dominant signal and is removed from the data in this study we focus on the seasonal variations of the scs flow pattern and thus we only remove the 22 year mean from the data below we present the 22 year mean and standard deviation of the ssh and wind stress curl from the hycom reanalysis since the dipole structure is so important to define the svoc we focus on the area in the scs to the east of vietnam encompassing 108 115 e 8 17 n red box in figs 4 and 5 this choice is made based on the previous observations numerical simulations and the hycom reanalysis results fig 3 the 22 year mean ssh field indicates a weak cyclonic circulation occupies most of the scs deep basin fig 4a in general ssh is higher over the continental shelf except in taiwan strait in the ocean where the water depth is deeper than 500 m ssh in the southeast is higher than that in the northwest scs the spatial pattern is more similar to the winter mean ssh fig 2c than that in the summer fig 2d especially over the northern half of the deep basin this indicates the dominance of the winter circulation the areas with the highest ssh standard deviation are along the coast of china and vietnam fig 4b over the shelf where ekman dynamics dominate yu et al 2021 peaks of high ssh standard deviation in the deep basin form a band from the west of luzon at about 119 e 18 n to the east of vietnam at 14 n and extends southward to 10 n green shades in fig 4b in the domain of interest red box in fig 4b the smaller domain of interest allows an eof analysis to explain the variation of the dipole driven by wind stress curl the area with low ssh standard deviation blue and purple shades in fig 4b are mainly along shelf break and the southeast scs where topography is really complex fig 1 overall strong mean wind stress curl during the 22 year period occurs along the coast fig 5a in the deep basin wind stress curl is weaker than along the coast but mainly positive fig 5a corresponding to a basin wide cyclonic circulation fig 4a in the domain of interest strong positive wind curl occurs to the east of vietnam at 12 n and extends to 112 e from the coast areas with high standard deviation of the wind stress curl red and yellow shades in fig 5b are mainly along the coast and are co located with the strong mean wind stress curl regions there exists a northwest to southeast band purple and blue shades with low wind stress curl standard deviation from about 111 e 18 n to 118 e 10 n in the domain of interest this low wind stress curl band occur in the northeast corner of the domain 4 eof analysis to further examine the spatial and temporal variability of the ssh and wind stress we perform an eof analysis on the monthly ssh and wind stress curl anomalies monthly data anomalies are calculated by removing the 22 year mean from the monthly data sets an eof analysis finds the modes spatial patterns of the variability and the principal component time series the corresponding time variation of the mode the measure of the importance of each mode is defined by the total variance explained by the mode over the whole domain but this does not mean that the local variance explained by the mode is the same as the total variance explained at some locations the local variance explained by the mode can be much higher or lower than the total variance explained by the same mode in this section we also calculate maps of the local variance explained by the mode to determine the most dominant mode responsible for svoc we calculate the homogeneous correlation map of a mode which is defined as a map of the correlation coefficient between the mode principal component time series and the corresponding original data time series at each grid point this is a useful indicator of the spatial localization of the co varying part between the data and the mode the square of the correlation coefficient represents the local variance explained by the mode 4 1 ssh eof analysis the first three modes of the ssh contain 43 3 eof1 fig 6a 18 9 eof2 fig 7a and 13 1 table 1 of the total ssh variance respectively no other mode explains more than 10 of the total ssh variance modes 1 eof1 and 2 eof2 together explain 67 8 table 1 of the ssh variance where the dipole is fig 6c and fig 7c the third mode eof3 is not shown since it only explains 6 6 of ssh variance of the dipole no other mode explains more than 10 of ssh variation in the dipole area the eof1 fig 6a shows a basin scale ssh anomaly structure with negative values in the deep basin and positive values near the vietnamese coast oscillations are in phase over the entire deep basin while the large amplitude oscillations in shallow water near the vietnamese coast are out of phase with the deep basin dynamics to setup the ssh are different in these two regions in shallow water ssh anomaly is generated by the ekman transport yu et al 2021 2022 in deep basin ssh anomaly is associated with the basin scale gyres driven by wind stress curl shaw et al 1999 liu et al 2001 xu and oey 2015 in deep basin minima occur near zhongsha islands and there exists a recirculation around 110 75 e 11 n to the southeast of vietnam note that the principal component time series fig 6b is normalized by its magnitude so that its range is from 1 to 1 and the mode is amplified accordingly in july 2010 when the principal component is 1 the eof1 ssh anomaly is more than 20 cm near zhongsha islands and along the coast of vietnam the surface circulation corresponding to eof1 is a basin scale gyre this agrees with shaw et al 1999 ho et al 2000a b and chu et al 2003 the principal component time series fig 6b shows the seasonal variability with some intra seasonal variations the seasonal cycle is calculated after removing the intra seasonal variability by applying a lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of nine months and is positive in winter maximum in december and negative minimum in june in summer fig 8a solid line during the winter monsoon season ssh anomaly is negative in the deep basin which means a cyclonic gyre in the scs while in the summer monsoon season ssh anomaly is positive in the deep basin which implies an anti cyclonic basin scale gyre eof1 explains more than 70 of the local variance around zhongsha islands more than 50 near the vietnamese coast and about 50 between the 1000 and 2000 m isobaths from 10 n to 11 n fig 6c the two red lines in fig 6c are used to indicate the mean location of the svoc dipole these are basically the 0 52 m and 0 78 m 17 year mean ssh contours in august without the five anomalous years fig 2e as mentioned in section 1 but with the westward extent of 0 52 m contour line cut off at 109 8 e thus the location of the cyclone is only the deep water 500 m portion inside the 0 52 m contour lines since the ssh variations over continental shelf are driven by wind stress via ekman transport instead of wind stress curl that drives the svoc eof1 does not explain more than 40 of the ssh variability associated with the dipole except the western edge of the anti cyclone the area averaged ssh variation in the dipole explained by eof1 is 28 2 the eof2 fig 7a clearly shows the dipole structure with a low center in the southern domain south of 11 n and a high center in the northern domain north of 11 n this agrees well with the double gyre eof2 structure reported by chu and fang 2003 both the low and high centers have a magnitude of more than 20 cm the principal component time series fig 7b is dominated by seasonal variations too and with more intra seasonal variability than in eof1 after removing the intra seasonal variability the seasonal cycle is positive in winter and spring maximum in march and negative in summer and fall minimum in september fig 8a dashed line during winter the dipole has a cyclone to the south and an anti cyclone to the north but in the summer the dipole has the same structure as the svoc with an anti cyclone to the south and a cyclone to the north most of the ssh variability explained by eof2 is at the svoc dipole location fig 7c it explains more than 60 of the local ssh variance at the center of the cyclone and the anti cyclone other than where the dipole is eof2 explains less than 20 of the ssh variability the area averaged ssh variation explained by eof2 in the dipole is 39 6 1 4 times of that explained by eof1 even though eof1 explains more overall ssh variation eof2 is more important for driving svoc dipole so does the eof2 principal component time series tell us why there are five anomalous svoc years during 1994 to 2015 wang et al 2006 suggests that the svoc and the associated dipole begins in june peaks in strength in august or september and disappears in october the average of the eof2 principal component time series fig 7b from june to september is calculated every year and shown in fig 9a the 22 year mean is 0 27 and the standard deviation is 0 28 there are 6 years when the june to september average eof2 principal component time series is more than one standard deviation away from the mean 1994 1995 1998 2009 2010 and 2015 values in 1994 and 2009 are more negative than the mean minus one standard deviation 0 56 and thus indicate a much stronger dipole mode the other 4 years all have positive values which suggests a dipole with cyclone to the south and anti cyclone to the north opposite to the svoc dipole structure thus the svoc is anomalous in these four years the june to september average in 2007 is 0 02 which is within the one standard deviation range but almost zero thus there is almost no dipole mode in 2007 and the result is an anomalous svoc in 2007 this confirms again the importance of eof2 in maintaining the svoc 4 2 wind stress curl eof analysis the first mode of the wind stress curl explains 63 4 of the total variance fig 10a while the second mode explains 14 9 fig 12a of the total variance no other mode explains more than 10 of the total variance the largest positive and negative values of these two modes are mainly confined over the continental shelf east of vietnam the portion over the deep ocean 500 m that drives the basin scale gyre will be described in detail below the eof1 wind stress curl fig 10a mainly contains positive values to the southeast and weaker negative values to the northwest a straight line can be drawn to separate the positive and negative values from 109 e 8 n to the zhongsha islands the principal component time series fig 10b are dominated by seasonal variations mainly positive in winter and negative in the summer we also perform a real vector eof analysis kaihatu et al 1998 on the wind stress vector the eof1 wind stress explains 90 7 of the total variance fig 11a and its principal component time series fig 11b correlates with wind stress curl eof1 time series fig 10b at the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 97 and a time lag of zero except near vietnam the wind stress eof1 black arrows fig 11a shows a northeasterly pattern during winter summer the principal component time series are positive negative indicating northeasterly southwesterly thus this is monsoon mode the wind stress curl color fig 11a which is calculated from the eof1 wind stress black arrow fig 11a and mainly from the wind stress shear are almost identical to the wind stress curl eof1 fig 10a suggesting that wind stress curl eof1 is driven by the seasonal reversing monsoon after removing the intra seasonal variability of the wind stress curl principal component time series the seasonal cycle shows maximum in january and minimum in july fig 8b solid line corresponding to the seasonal reversing monsoon winds a positive principal component contributes positive wind stress curl to the southeast of the domain and negative curl to the northwest corner the principal component time series fig 10b is highly correlated with that associated to the ssh eof1 fig 6b significant to the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 76 the time lag associated with this correlation is zero which indicates a basin scale barotropic response this agrees with shaw et al 1999 positive correlation indicates that the positive wind stress curl fig 10a corresponds to negative ssh anomaly fig 6a in the deep basin and thus a cyclonic gyre so ssh eof1 is the result of the basin scale gyre driven by the wind stress curl eof1 positive negative dominating wind stress curl drives cyclonic anti cyclonic circulation in the deep basin the largest negative wind stress curl eof2 fig 12a values are mainly confined near the coast of vietnam from 11 n to 15 n and extends to the deep ocean near 12 n and 15 n these two locations match well with the two local maxima of the mean wind stress curl in august fig 2b which indicates the importance of the mode to the summer wind stress curl in the domain in the deep basin the pattern is similar to the ssh eof2 pattern fig 7a though it does not show the cyclone and anti cyclone pair it does show the dipole structure with negative values north of 9 n and positive values south of it the principal component time series fig 12b is dominated by seasonal variations mainly positive in spring and negative in summer and fall but also contains lots of intra seasonal variations negative values in summer and fall indicate negative positive wind stress curl south north of 9 n which agrees with the satellite derived wind stress curl pattern in summer wang et al 2006 the eof2 wind stress explains 6 1 of the total variance fig 13a unlike the eof1 this mode demonstrates an anticyclonic pattern fang et al 2006 identified a similar mode their eof1 fig 7 in the interannual variability of the scs winds which agrees with the finding of wang et al 2000 and appears as the southwestern most portion of the western north pacific anticyclone the interannual variability of the eof2 principal component time series fig 13b is correlated with the nino3 4 sst index with correlation coefficient equal to 0 76 when the eof2 lags the nino3 4 sst by three months not shown this agrees with fang et al 2006 and thus eof2 is the same anticyclone mode as in fang et al 2006 its principal component time series fig 13b correlates with wind stress curl eof2 time series fig 12b at the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 80 and zero time lag during spring fall the principal component time series are positive negative indicating north pacific anticyclone cyclone the wind stress curl color fig 13a calculated from the eof2 wind stress black arrow fig 13a are very similar to the wind stress curl eof2 fig 12a suggesting that wind stress curl eof2 is driven by the north pacific anticyclone cyclone the wind stress curl come from both wind stress shear and streamline curvature fig 13a after removing the intra seasonal variability the seasonal cycle of wind stress curl eof2 shows maximum in march and minimum in september fig 8b dashed line the seasonality is attributed to north pacific anticyclone cyclone transition from spring to fall the principal component time series of eof2 fig 12b and the ssh eof2 fig 7b are highly correlated the correlation coefficient is 0 43 significant to the 99 confidence level positive correlation indicates negative positive wind stress curl anomaly generates positive negative ssh anomaly the anti cyclonic cyclonic part of the dipole the time lag associated with this correlation is one month and with wind stress curl eof2 leading the ssh eof2 which represents a baroclinic response wang et al 2006 demonstrated that the dipole evolution lags behind the wind stress curl about 40 days by analyzing observational data our one month lag is in rough agreement with their finding they attribute this 40 day time lag to the time for the first baroclinic rossby wave to propagate across the southern basin of the scs near 12 n the one month lag is in good agreement with modeling studies of liu et al 2001 which indicates a one month basin crossing time of the first baroclinic rossby wave at 10 n but our analysis also shows that the ssh eof2 fig 7b and the wind stress curl eof1 fig 10b principal component time series are highly correlated the correlation coefficient of 0 66 is significant to the 99 confidence level the negative correlation indicates that the negative positive wind stress curl anomaly to the northwest southeast corresponds to positive negative ssh anomaly in the northern southern part of the dipole the time lag associated with this correlation is eight months with wind stress curl eof1 leading the ssh eof2 variation according to liu et al 2001 the basin crossing time of the first baroclinic rossby wave in scs varies from one and four months from the southern to northern basin what generates this discrepancy 4 3 baroclinic rossby wave response rossby waves are important components in large scale ocean dynamics liu et al 2001 demonstrated that the scs ssh variability is forced mainly by wind stress curl on baroclinic rossby waves the wave speed c of the free propagating first baroclinic linear rossby wave is shown below 2 c β r d 2 where β d f d y is the variation of the coriolis parameter f along latitude y and r d is the first mode baroclinic rossby radius of deformation the negative sign indicates that the rossby waves propagate westward the radius of deformation is calculated as following 3 r d g h f where h is the mean thermocline depth and g g δ ρ ρ r being the reduced gravity the mean stratification in the hycom reanalysis gives approximately 400 m of the mean thermocline depth h and 0 03 m s2 of g since β f decreases increases with latitude wave speed decreases with latitude using the same h and g the corresponding free propagating first baroclinic rossby wave speed is then 42 8 and 21 4 cm s at 10 n and 14 n in the scs respectively and the basin crossing time of the first baroclinic rossby wave in the scs is one month at 10 n and two months at 14 n rossby wave speed is estimated using the monthly ssh from the hycom reanalysis the 22 year monthly climatology is removed from the monthly ssh to generate the ssh anomaly hovmöller diagrams of the ssh anomaly along the cross section at 10 n fig 14 and 14 n fig 15 both show westward rossby wave propagation the black lines indicate westward propagating features that cross the basin in one and eight months in figs 14 and 15 respectively the phase speed of the rossby wave is estimated to be 34 9 and 5 6 cm s at 10 n and 14 n respectively the phase speed of baroclinic rossby waves in the scs at 12 n is reported to be 37 cm s xie et al 2007 the 3 7 cm s is clearly a typo of 37 cm s in xie et al 2007 our estimate of 34 9 cm s at 10 n is in rough agreement with xie et al 2007 and in northern scs phase speed of rossby waves is reported to vary from 3 to 5 cm s from 15 n to 20 n chu and fang 2003 and about 5 cm s yang and liu 2003 from 18 n to 22 n our estimate of 5 6 cm s at 14 n is in good agreement with these estimates our estimate indicates that speed of rossby wave decreases from 10 n and 14 n which agrees with theory eq 2 but both estimates are slower than the theoretical free propagating first baroclinic rossby wave speed 42 8 and 21 4 cm s at 10 n and 14 n respectively the radius of deformation for the second mode of baroclinic rossby wave outside of the tropics is r d 2 chelton et al 1998 thus the 5 6 cm s at 14 n is in good agreement of the theoretical second mode baroclinic rossby wave speed 5 4 cm s it is generally believed that the slower higher order baroclinic rossby wave modes play a lesser role in large scale ocean circulation dynamics chelton and schlax 1996 thus we think both of these are first mode baroclinic rossby waves why are they slower than the free propagating rossby waves liu et al 2001 illustrated that these waves in the scs are forced rossby waves instead of the free propagating waves as in the pacific ocean where the wind has a much larger spatial scale and does not have a highly structural wind stress curl anomaly as the monsoon wind in the scs chelton and schlax 1996 also attributed the weak westward propagation of rossby waves near the eastern boundary to the seasonal wind forcing yang and liu 2003 concluded that rossby waves in the northern scs are forced rossby waves due to the consistency between the propagation of rossby waves and the wind stress curl so these slower propagation rossby waves are forced rossby waves and this indicates that the whole scs is under the regime of forced rossby waves this is in good agreement with chelton et al 1998 in their fig 6 the first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation in the scs is less than that in the pacific at the same latitude the speed of the first baroclinic rossby wave in the scs is then slower than that in the pacific eq 2 which indicates the forced rossby waves in the scs from the above ssh eof1 represents the barotropic response to the basin scale seasonal reversing monsoon wind stress curl eof1 the ssh eof2 variation of the northern part of the dipole is mainly associated with the baroclinic response of scs to the basin scale seasonal reversing monsoon wind stress curl eof1 the ssh eof2 variation of the southern part of the dipole on the other hand is mainly associated with the baroclinic response to the monsoon wind stress curl dipole mode eof2 5 discussions 5 1 nonlinear dynamics both our analysis and wang et al 2006 indicates that the svoc dipole is driven by a dipole wind stress curl so does the anomalous svoc suggest an anomalous wind stress curl eof2 the same year since wind stress curl eof2 leads ssh eof2 by one month we generate the four month average of the wind stress curl eof2 principal component time series from may to august as shown in fig 9b the 22 year mean is 0 11 and the standard deviation is 0 18 the time series demonstrates the eof2 wind stress curl principal component is positive and one standard deviation away from the mean in 1995 1998 and 2010 this indicates that the eof2 wind stress curl in these years is positive negative south north of 9 n opposite to a normal year the negative wind stress curl north of 9 n prevents forming the ssh dipole and thus there should be an anomalous svoc in these years summer 2007 has a normal wind stress curl eof2 and should indicate a normal svoc the value in 2015 is more negative than the mean value which suggests a strong svoc yet there is also an anomalous svoc in both 2007 and 2015 we hypothesize that this is due to the nonlinear nature of the svoc wang et al 2006 demonstrated that the nonlinearity effect can be equally as important to the dipole as the wind stress curl input their experiments also indicated that the strength and location of the dipole are sensitive to the wind strength and wind direction through nonlinear processes it is possible that the wind strength and directions associated with wind stress curl in 2007 and 2015 are different than the other three years modified by higher modes 5 2 scs warming events chao et al 1996 have shown that a weaker summer monsoon leads to increased sst in the scs due to a weaker than normal surface circulation xie et al 2003 indicated the svoc advects the upwelled cold coastal water offshore to cool the scs sst in summer the disappearance of the svoc in 1998 gives rise to a strong warming sst in the interior of the scs wang et al 2006 attribute the anomalous svoc in 1995 and 1998 to the strong warm event in the scs likely due to changes in the wind field shu et al 2016 showed that the svoc disappeared in summer 2010 and the scs sst in summer 2010 was much warmer than normal in this section we examine if an anomalous svoc and the warming summer sst coexist monthly august sst anomalies from 1994 to 2015 are shown in fig 16 the sst anomaly is calculated as the august sst departure from the 22 year mean august sst a warming event is examined if the mean sst anomaly in the scs west of 120 8 e is positive mean sst anomaly in the scs is noted on each subpanel fig 16 the four strongest warming events occur in 1998 2010 1995 and 2015 the svoc is anomalous in all these 4 summers but the svoc is not anomalous in the other 4 years with warming events 2003 2009 2011 and 2014 and the mean sst anomaly in 2007 is negative a cooling event while the svoc is also anomalous there does not appear to be a direct relationship between an anomalous svoc and a warming scs sst event fan et al 2018 investigated how the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo modulates the interaction between el niño southern oscillation and the scs summer monsoon their analysis does not go farther in time than 2014 four of the 5 anomalous svoc occur before 2015 and all of these four years are characterized as both positive amo phases with a weak scs summer monsoon which suggests that interannual variability is important for the formation of the anomalous svoc we will leave this for the future research 5 3 western boundary current separation point of view previous studies also treated the svoc as the western boundary current separation from the coast shaw et al 1999 suggested that the separation of the svoc off vietnam follows the line of zero wind stress curl cai et al 2007 indicated the svoc follows geostrophic contours f h where f is the coriolis parameter and h is water depth before separation veronis 1966 investigated the nonlinear flow in wind driven ocean circulation with a barotropic model and suggested that separation is much more likely associated with baroclinic effects the pressure field associated with the western boundary current requires a high pressure region adjacent to the boundary to maintain the geostrophically balanced flow along the boundary in order for separation to occur it requires a completely different pressure distribution veronis 1966 ssh anomaly in june and september are calculated using both eof1 fig 6 and eof2 fig 7 and their corresponding seasonal cycle of the principal component time series fig 8a and are shown in fig 17 in june september the principal component time series of eof1 eof2 is at its minimum and eof2 eof1 is almost zero fig 8a thus the ssh anomaly in june september represents mainly a barotropic baroclinic response to the wind curl since eof1 eof2 ssh is the barotropic baroclinic response to the wind stress curl section 4 in june fig 17a the whole scs deep basin is a high pressure region and there is no separation in september fig 17b the baroclinic response to the wind stress curl generates the dipole and the pressure distribution is totally different than that in june and separation occurs this agrees with veronis 1966 6 conclusions in this study we investigate why the svoc is anomalous in 1995 1998 2007 2010 and 2015 using output from a 22 year 1994 2015 hycom global reanalysis based on previous observations we define a normal svoc as the ssh pattern within 110 e 115 e that satisfies all of these three conditions 1 a ssh dipole with cyclonic eddy to the north and anti cyclonic eddy to the south in water deeper than 500 m 2 the orientation of the dipole has to be oriented north south instead of east west and 3 the center of the anti cyclonic eddy associated with the svoc is located south of 12 n the reanalysis is forced with atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep cfsr dataset during the period 1994 to 2010 and 0 205 ncep cfsv2 dataset from 2011 and a wind stress formulation that takes into account the ocean surface currents we performed an eof analysis on the monthly ssh and wind stress curl to seek an answer eof analysis reveals that the ssh eof1 mode fig 6 is a basin scale gyre mode explaining 43 3 of the total variance and the eof2 fig 7 is a dipole mode explaining 18 9 of the total ssh variance in the domain but ssh eof2 is more important for the ssh variation in the svoc dipole region explaining 39 6 fig 7c of the variance while ssh eof1 explains only 28 2 fig 6c of the ssh variance in the svoc dipole region the 4 month average of the ssh eof2 principal component time series from june to september fig 9a has a mean of 0 27 and the standard deviation of 0 28 five highest values in decreasing order are in 2010 1998 1995 2015 and 2007 the coefficients in 1995 1998 2010 and 2015 are all positive which represents a dipole structure opposite to the normal svoc dipole and one standard deviation away from the 22 year mean value the value in 2007 is 0 02 close to zero indicating the dipole mode ssh eof2 almost disappeared in that year anomalous ssh eof2 in these five years leads to the anomalous svoc there are two dominant wind stress curl modes with eof1 explaining 63 4 fig 10 of the total variance and represents the seasonally reversing monsoon while eof2 explains 14 9 fig 12 of the total variance and represents the west north pacific anticyclone and cyclone in spring and fall analysis shows that ssh eof2 is driven by both wind stress curl modes and represents the ssh baroclinic response via forced rossby waves the ssh eof2 variation of the northern part of the dipole is mainly associated with the baroclinic response of scs to the basin scale seasonal reversing monsoon wind stress curl eof1 with a time lag of eight months the ssh eof2 variation of the southern part of the dipole on the other hand is mainly associated with the baroclinic response to the wind stress curl dipole mode eof2 with a time lag of one month the basin scale ssh eof1 represents the barotropic response to the basin scale wind stress curl eof1 declaration of

23779,the summer circulation in the south china sea scs often has a dipole structure associated with the eastward southeast vietnam offshore current svoc the dipole has an anti cyclone to the south and a cyclone to the north a 22 year 1994 2015 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom global reanalysis is used to study why the svoc in the scs is anomalous in summer of 1995 1998 2007 2010 and 2015 the normal svoc sea surface height ssh pattern is defined based on previous observations of the dipole associated with it an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis is performed on the monthly mean ssh and wind stress curl to seek the answer ssh eof1 and eof2 explain 43 3 and 18 9 of the total ssh variance respectively wind stress curl eof1 and eof2 explain 63 4 and 14 9 of the total variance respectively ssh eof1 is a basin scale gyre mode that represents the barotropic response to the basin scale monsoon wind stress curl eof1 ssh eof2 is a dipole mode that represents a baroclinic response to both wind stress curl eof1 and eof2 western north pacific anticyclone mode via forced baroclinic rossby waves ssh eof2 explains 39 6 of the ssh variance in the svoc dipole and is more important for the svoc formation than ssh eof1 which explains 28 2 of the svoc dipole ssh variance ssh eof2 principal component time series indicate that the summer dipole mode in 1995 1998 2010 and 2015 is associated with an anti cyclone to the north and a cyclone to the south opposite to the normal svoc dipole in 2007 the ssh eof2 is very weak with its principal component close to zero keywords

availability data is public served on hycom org and the link is provided in the manuscript 1 introduction the semi enclosed south china sea scs is the largest marginal sea in southeast asia with a maximum depth deeper than 4000 m fig 1 it connects with the western pacific ocean through the wide and deep luzon strait where the kuroshio flows northward to the east of the strait and sometimes loops and sheds eddies through it between taiwan and luzon metzger and hurlburt 1996 situated in the monsoon regime the seasonally reversing east asia monsoon winds play a prominent role in forcing the seasonally varying circulation in the scs wyrtki 1961 shaw and chao 1994 chu et al 1999 metzger 2003 strong northeasterly winds prevail over the region in winter fig 2a with a dominant positive wind stress curl in the deep basin while relatively weaker southwesterly winds dominate in summer fig 2b which turns the wind stress curl from positive to negative in the southern deep basin the wind driven basin scale upper circulation is thus mainly cyclonic in winter and anti cyclonic in summer with a strong western boundary current as indicated by the 22 year monthly mean sea surface height ssh in january fig 2c and august fig 2d from a 22 year 1994 to 2015 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom global reanalysis https www hycom org dataserver gofs 3pt1 reanalysis this reanalysis has been used to reveal the wind relaxation as the generation mechanism of the counter wind scs warm current scswc yu et al 2021 develop an empirical method to predict the scswc from wind stress with high accuracy yu et al 2022 and accurately estimate the global wind work into the ocean yu et al 2018 the reanalysis will be described in more detail in section 2 the mean august ssh indicates that the northward western boundary current off the vietnam coast turns eastward into the interior of the scs near 11 n and there exists a dipole associated with the eastward current with a well defined anti cyclonic eddy to the south and a weakly defined cyclonic eddy to the north of it fig 2d this eastward current is the southeast vietnam offshore current svoc first revealed by wyrtki 1961 it is also called the north nansha current fang et al 1998 hu et al 2000 eastward jet xie et al 2003 wang et al 2006 xie et al 2007 sun and lan 2021 2022 coastal jet gan and qu 2008 or vietnam offshore current shu et al 2016 in other papers the existence of the current was later confirmed by xu et al 1982 through analyzing 50 years of historical observational data hu et al 2000 xu et al 1982 also suggest the svoc is associated with an anti cyclonic eddy to the south and a cyclonic eddy to the north of the current the eastward svoc can be seen from ctd observations fang et al 1998 satellite observed ssh shaw et al 1999 kuo et al 2000 xie et al 2007 sea surface temperature sst ho et al 2000a b kuo et al 2000 xie et al 2007 chen et al 2012 and chlorophyll xie et al 2003 the svoc advects cold upwelled water offshore into the scs to cool off the surface temperature and plays an important role in interannual variability of the summer sst in scs xie et al 2003 numerical simulations have consistently shown that the major driving force of the svoc is the wind stress curl shaw and chao 1994 chao et al 1996 chu et al 1999 metzger 2003 wang et al 2006 cai et al 2007 gan and qu 2008 sun and lan 2021 2022 and the summer wind stress curl dipole east of vietnam is responsible for the ssh dipole structure associated with svoc metzger 2003 wang et al 2006 cai et al 2007 gan and qu 2008 furthermore wang et al 2006 investigated the formation of the ssh dipole structure using a reduced gravity model and found that the nonlinearity is crucial for the generation of the dipole structure cai et al 2007 employed a connected single layer two layer model to study the separation position of svoc and its strength their results suggested the svoc is stronger and its separation position is more northward when there is inflow via sunda shelf and vice versa chen et al 2012 on the other hand indicated that mekong river discharge and tides can also be important wind stress curl as the generation mechanism of svoc is also confirmed by observational data empirical orthogonal function eof analysis of the topex poseidon altimeter data and the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis wind stress in the scs from 1992 to 1995 demonstrate that the svoc is mainly driven by the wind stress curl shaw et al 1999 thus wind stress curl is an agreed upon consensus about the dynamics that drives the svoc there is difference among these results on the location where the svoc separates from the coast the observed separation locations have low variability mainly along 11 n 12 n ctd observation during september 1994 suggested the svoc deviates from the coastline and turns eastward between 11 n and 12 n fang et al 1998 the advanced very high resolution radiometer infrared images also indicate that the svoc veers eastward between 11 n and 12 n in mid august 1997 kuo et al 2000 the separation location in the numerical simulations varies with a much bigger range from 10 n chu et al 1999 to 11 n 14 n shaw and chao 1994 and 10 n 14 n cai et al 2007 on average the svoc and the associated dipole begins in june peaks in strength in august or september and disappears in october wang et al 2006 the hycom reanalysis monthly mean ssh in august over the period 1994 to 2015 fig 3 indicates the summer circulation east of vietnam in some years can be very different from a normal svoc summer 2010 fig 3 is a clearly anomalous summer since there is no ssh dipole east of vietnam fang et al 1998 pointed out that the anti cyclonic circulation associated with the dipole has a horizontal scale of 400 km between 110 e to 115 e their fig 3 in this research a normal svoc is thus defined as the scs ssh pattern within 110 e 115 e that satisfies these three conditions 1 a ssh dipole with cyclonic eddy to the north and anti cyclonic eddy to the south in water deeper than 500 m 2 the orientation of the dipole has to be oriented north south instead of east west and 3 the center of the anti cyclonic eddy associated with the svoc is located south of 12 n based on this definition an anomalous svoc occurred in 1995 1998 2007 2010 and 2015 the svoc in 1995 and 1998 violate condition 3 the 2007 svoc violates condition 1 the 2010 svoc violates all three conditions and the 2015 svoc violates condition 2 without these five anomalous summers the mean 17 year ssh in august indicates that the svoc and the associated dipole are strengthened compare fig 2e with fig 2d in this study we perform an eof analysis on the ssh and wind stress curl fields to reveal why the svoc is anomalous in these five years eof analyses have been applied to topex poseidon altimeter data during the period 1992 to 1995 shaw et al 1999 1992 to 1998 ho et al 2000a and 1992 to 1999 chu and fang 2003 to study the scs circulation this research differs and improves on previous studies in that 1 we focus on a smaller region east of vietnam instead of the whole scs to eliminate the dominating ssh variation over the continental shelf and focus on the dipole more details in section 3 2 our eof analysis is performed over 22 year ssh data longer than data used in these previous studies and thus should have less eof sampling errors north et al 1982 and 3 we use the local variance yu et al 2022 instead of the total variance explained by the eof modes to determine which mode is the dominant mode responsible for svoc more details in section 4 this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the numerical model configuration data assimilation method and surface forcing for the reanalysis section 3 describes the monthly mean characteristics of the ssh and wind stress curl eof analysis of the monthly ssh and wind stress curl anomalies are presented in section 4 which is followed by discussions in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 numerical model and reanalysis a 22 year global hycom reanalysis from 1994 to 2015 is used for this study hycom is a primitive equation general ocean circulation model applied to large scale marginal sea and coastal studies and the ocean model component for the present operational us navy global ocean forecast system metzger et al 2014 a detailed description of hycom physics is provided by bleck 2002 a brief description of the model setup is presented below with emphasis on the numerical aspects that are most relevant to this study there are no tides or surface waves in this reanalysis 2 1 model grids and output the hycom horizontal resolution for the reanalysis is 0 08 1 12 5 that is 9 km at the equator and 8 7 km at the latitude of svoc separation the grid is uniform cylindrical from 78 64 s 66 s mercator between 66 s 47 n and includes a bipolar patch north of 47 n providing 3 5 km grid spacing at the north pole the bathymetry is derived from 30 arc second general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco https www gebeo net three coexisting hycom vertical coordinates z coordinates in unstratified water terrain following sigma coordinates in shallow depths and isopycnal coordinates in the stratified ocean provide hycom significant advantages of an isopycnal model in the stratified ocean but allows coordinate surfaces to locally deviate from isopycnals to provide more vertical resolution near the surface and in shallow coastal regions in order to better represent the upper ocean physics chassignet et al 2003 with this unique feature hycom serves as a good tool for simulating circulations in the scs which has complex topography that covers the continental shelf and deep basin there are 41 hybrid coordinate layers vertically with potential density referenced to 2000 m the top 14 layers are always sigma z so that water shallower than 84 m is always in fixed coordinates for this study we analyze monthly ssh and wind stresses output which were interpolated to a uniform 0 08 resolution grid from the native model grid 2 2 data assimilation the data assimilation technique employed for the reanalysis is a 3d variational scheme used within the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 that takes the 24 hour model forecast as a first guess available remotely sensed sst ssh sea ice concentration and in situ observations of temperature and salinity from profiles ships marine mammals and moored and drifting buoys are all assimilated into hycom the reanalysis provides realistic ssh fields as verified by cummings and smedstad 2013 who showed the assimilated ssh field in the kuroshio region is in good agreement with independent infrared frontal analyses 2 3 initialization and surface forcing the reanalysis uses atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha and coauthors 2010 during the period 1994 to 2010 and 0 205 ncep climate forecast system version2 cfsv2 saha and coauthors 2014 from 2011 onward the surface stress formulation in the model includes both winds and the ocean surface currents yu et al 2017 the ncep 10 m wind velocities are read by hycom and the wind stress is calculated at every time step taking into account the ocean surface currents as shown below 1 τ ρ a i r c d v 10 v o v 10 v o where ρ a i r is the air density at sea level c d is the drag coefficient v 10 is the 10 m wind velocity and v o is the velocity of ocean surface currents at 1 m depth the wind stress calculated based on eq 1 is the surface stress used by hycom and is used for the eof analysis in this research the 22 year reanalysis is not continuous but separated into streams to speed up the time to solution when it was integrated most of the streams are 2 5 years long for each stream the initialization state comes from a previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis https www hycom org dataserver gofs 3pt0 reanalysis on 1 december of the previous year except the very first stream started on 1 june 1993 the previous 20 year hycom based reanalysis is also forced by the ncep cfsr and cfsv2 wind stresses directly yu et al 2015 2019 but does not include the hycom ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation when the new wind stress formulation eq 1 including ocean surface current is applied the basin wide kinetic energy takes 6 months to reach an equilibrium yu et al 2018 thus while the 2 5 year streams start on december 1 of the previous year and end after 31 months of integration i e the end of june only the last two years of output e g july 2001 to june 2003 from each 2 5 year stream are used in the analysis here 3 monthly mean model results an eof analysis is performed over data anomalies often the seasonal cycle is the most dominant signal and is removed from the data in this study we focus on the seasonal variations of the scs flow pattern and thus we only remove the 22 year mean from the data below we present the 22 year mean and standard deviation of the ssh and wind stress curl from the hycom reanalysis since the dipole structure is so important to define the svoc we focus on the area in the scs to the east of vietnam encompassing 108 115 e 8 17 n red box in figs 4 and 5 this choice is made based on the previous observations numerical simulations and the hycom reanalysis results fig 3 the 22 year mean ssh field indicates a weak cyclonic circulation occupies most of the scs deep basin fig 4a in general ssh is higher over the continental shelf except in taiwan strait in the ocean where the water depth is deeper than 500 m ssh in the southeast is higher than that in the northwest scs the spatial pattern is more similar to the winter mean ssh fig 2c than that in the summer fig 2d especially over the northern half of the deep basin this indicates the dominance of the winter circulation the areas with the highest ssh standard deviation are along the coast of china and vietnam fig 4b over the shelf where ekman dynamics dominate yu et al 2021 peaks of high ssh standard deviation in the deep basin form a band from the west of luzon at about 119 e 18 n to the east of vietnam at 14 n and extends southward to 10 n green shades in fig 4b in the domain of interest red box in fig 4b the smaller domain of interest allows an eof analysis to explain the variation of the dipole driven by wind stress curl the area with low ssh standard deviation blue and purple shades in fig 4b are mainly along shelf break and the southeast scs where topography is really complex fig 1 overall strong mean wind stress curl during the 22 year period occurs along the coast fig 5a in the deep basin wind stress curl is weaker than along the coast but mainly positive fig 5a corresponding to a basin wide cyclonic circulation fig 4a in the domain of interest strong positive wind curl occurs to the east of vietnam at 12 n and extends to 112 e from the coast areas with high standard deviation of the wind stress curl red and yellow shades in fig 5b are mainly along the coast and are co located with the strong mean wind stress curl regions there exists a northwest to southeast band purple and blue shades with low wind stress curl standard deviation from about 111 e 18 n to 118 e 10 n in the domain of interest this low wind stress curl band occur in the northeast corner of the domain 4 eof analysis to further examine the spatial and temporal variability of the ssh and wind stress we perform an eof analysis on the monthly ssh and wind stress curl anomalies monthly data anomalies are calculated by removing the 22 year mean from the monthly data sets an eof analysis finds the modes spatial patterns of the variability and the principal component time series the corresponding time variation of the mode the measure of the importance of each mode is defined by the total variance explained by the mode over the whole domain but this does not mean that the local variance explained by the mode is the same as the total variance explained at some locations the local variance explained by the mode can be much higher or lower than the total variance explained by the same mode in this section we also calculate maps of the local variance explained by the mode to determine the most dominant mode responsible for svoc we calculate the homogeneous correlation map of a mode which is defined as a map of the correlation coefficient between the mode principal component time series and the corresponding original data time series at each grid point this is a useful indicator of the spatial localization of the co varying part between the data and the mode the square of the correlation coefficient represents the local variance explained by the mode 4 1 ssh eof analysis the first three modes of the ssh contain 43 3 eof1 fig 6a 18 9 eof2 fig 7a and 13 1 table 1 of the total ssh variance respectively no other mode explains more than 10 of the total ssh variance modes 1 eof1 and 2 eof2 together explain 67 8 table 1 of the ssh variance where the dipole is fig 6c and fig 7c the third mode eof3 is not shown since it only explains 6 6 of ssh variance of the dipole no other mode explains more than 10 of ssh variation in the dipole area the eof1 fig 6a shows a basin scale ssh anomaly structure with negative values in the deep basin and positive values near the vietnamese coast oscillations are in phase over the entire deep basin while the large amplitude oscillations in shallow water near the vietnamese coast are out of phase with the deep basin dynamics to setup the ssh are different in these two regions in shallow water ssh anomaly is generated by the ekman transport yu et al 2021 2022 in deep basin ssh anomaly is associated with the basin scale gyres driven by wind stress curl shaw et al 1999 liu et al 2001 xu and oey 2015 in deep basin minima occur near zhongsha islands and there exists a recirculation around 110 75 e 11 n to the southeast of vietnam note that the principal component time series fig 6b is normalized by its magnitude so that its range is from 1 to 1 and the mode is amplified accordingly in july 2010 when the principal component is 1 the eof1 ssh anomaly is more than 20 cm near zhongsha islands and along the coast of vietnam the surface circulation corresponding to eof1 is a basin scale gyre this agrees with shaw et al 1999 ho et al 2000a b and chu et al 2003 the principal component time series fig 6b shows the seasonal variability with some intra seasonal variations the seasonal cycle is calculated after removing the intra seasonal variability by applying a lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of nine months and is positive in winter maximum in december and negative minimum in june in summer fig 8a solid line during the winter monsoon season ssh anomaly is negative in the deep basin which means a cyclonic gyre in the scs while in the summer monsoon season ssh anomaly is positive in the deep basin which implies an anti cyclonic basin scale gyre eof1 explains more than 70 of the local variance around zhongsha islands more than 50 near the vietnamese coast and about 50 between the 1000 and 2000 m isobaths from 10 n to 11 n fig 6c the two red lines in fig 6c are used to indicate the mean location of the svoc dipole these are basically the 0 52 m and 0 78 m 17 year mean ssh contours in august without the five anomalous years fig 2e as mentioned in section 1 but with the westward extent of 0 52 m contour line cut off at 109 8 e thus the location of the cyclone is only the deep water 500 m portion inside the 0 52 m contour lines since the ssh variations over continental shelf are driven by wind stress via ekman transport instead of wind stress curl that drives the svoc eof1 does not explain more than 40 of the ssh variability associated with the dipole except the western edge of the anti cyclone the area averaged ssh variation in the dipole explained by eof1 is 28 2 the eof2 fig 7a clearly shows the dipole structure with a low center in the southern domain south of 11 n and a high center in the northern domain north of 11 n this agrees well with the double gyre eof2 structure reported by chu and fang 2003 both the low and high centers have a magnitude of more than 20 cm the principal component time series fig 7b is dominated by seasonal variations too and with more intra seasonal variability than in eof1 after removing the intra seasonal variability the seasonal cycle is positive in winter and spring maximum in march and negative in summer and fall minimum in september fig 8a dashed line during winter the dipole has a cyclone to the south and an anti cyclone to the north but in the summer the dipole has the same structure as the svoc with an anti cyclone to the south and a cyclone to the north most of the ssh variability explained by eof2 is at the svoc dipole location fig 7c it explains more than 60 of the local ssh variance at the center of the cyclone and the anti cyclone other than where the dipole is eof2 explains less than 20 of the ssh variability the area averaged ssh variation explained by eof2 in the dipole is 39 6 1 4 times of that explained by eof1 even though eof1 explains more overall ssh variation eof2 is more important for driving svoc dipole so does the eof2 principal component time series tell us why there are five anomalous svoc years during 1994 to 2015 wang et al 2006 suggests that the svoc and the associated dipole begins in june peaks in strength in august or september and disappears in october the average of the eof2 principal component time series fig 7b from june to september is calculated every year and shown in fig 9a the 22 year mean is 0 27 and the standard deviation is 0 28 there are 6 years when the june to september average eof2 principal component time series is more than one standard deviation away from the mean 1994 1995 1998 2009 2010 and 2015 values in 1994 and 2009 are more negative than the mean minus one standard deviation 0 56 and thus indicate a much stronger dipole mode the other 4 years all have positive values which suggests a dipole with cyclone to the south and anti cyclone to the north opposite to the svoc dipole structure thus the svoc is anomalous in these four years the june to september average in 2007 is 0 02 which is within the one standard deviation range but almost zero thus there is almost no dipole mode in 2007 and the result is an anomalous svoc in 2007 this confirms again the importance of eof2 in maintaining the svoc 4 2 wind stress curl eof analysis the first mode of the wind stress curl explains 63 4 of the total variance fig 10a while the second mode explains 14 9 fig 12a of the total variance no other mode explains more than 10 of the total variance the largest positive and negative values of these two modes are mainly confined over the continental shelf east of vietnam the portion over the deep ocean 500 m that drives the basin scale gyre will be described in detail below the eof1 wind stress curl fig 10a mainly contains positive values to the southeast and weaker negative values to the northwest a straight line can be drawn to separate the positive and negative values from 109 e 8 n to the zhongsha islands the principal component time series fig 10b are dominated by seasonal variations mainly positive in winter and negative in the summer we also perform a real vector eof analysis kaihatu et al 1998 on the wind stress vector the eof1 wind stress explains 90 7 of the total variance fig 11a and its principal component time series fig 11b correlates with wind stress curl eof1 time series fig 10b at the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 97 and a time lag of zero except near vietnam the wind stress eof1 black arrows fig 11a shows a northeasterly pattern during winter summer the principal component time series are positive negative indicating northeasterly southwesterly thus this is monsoon mode the wind stress curl color fig 11a which is calculated from the eof1 wind stress black arrow fig 11a and mainly from the wind stress shear are almost identical to the wind stress curl eof1 fig 10a suggesting that wind stress curl eof1 is driven by the seasonal reversing monsoon after removing the intra seasonal variability of the wind stress curl principal component time series the seasonal cycle shows maximum in january and minimum in july fig 8b solid line corresponding to the seasonal reversing monsoon winds a positive principal component contributes positive wind stress curl to the southeast of the domain and negative curl to the northwest corner the principal component time series fig 10b is highly correlated with that associated to the ssh eof1 fig 6b significant to the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 76 the time lag associated with this correlation is zero which indicates a basin scale barotropic response this agrees with shaw et al 1999 positive correlation indicates that the positive wind stress curl fig 10a corresponds to negative ssh anomaly fig 6a in the deep basin and thus a cyclonic gyre so ssh eof1 is the result of the basin scale gyre driven by the wind stress curl eof1 positive negative dominating wind stress curl drives cyclonic anti cyclonic circulation in the deep basin the largest negative wind stress curl eof2 fig 12a values are mainly confined near the coast of vietnam from 11 n to 15 n and extends to the deep ocean near 12 n and 15 n these two locations match well with the two local maxima of the mean wind stress curl in august fig 2b which indicates the importance of the mode to the summer wind stress curl in the domain in the deep basin the pattern is similar to the ssh eof2 pattern fig 7a though it does not show the cyclone and anti cyclone pair it does show the dipole structure with negative values north of 9 n and positive values south of it the principal component time series fig 12b is dominated by seasonal variations mainly positive in spring and negative in summer and fall but also contains lots of intra seasonal variations negative values in summer and fall indicate negative positive wind stress curl south north of 9 n which agrees with the satellite derived wind stress curl pattern in summer wang et al 2006 the eof2 wind stress explains 6 1 of the total variance fig 13a unlike the eof1 this mode demonstrates an anticyclonic pattern fang et al 2006 identified a similar mode their eof1 fig 7 in the interannual variability of the scs winds which agrees with the finding of wang et al 2000 and appears as the southwestern most portion of the western north pacific anticyclone the interannual variability of the eof2 principal component time series fig 13b is correlated with the nino3 4 sst index with correlation coefficient equal to 0 76 when the eof2 lags the nino3 4 sst by three months not shown this agrees with fang et al 2006 and thus eof2 is the same anticyclone mode as in fang et al 2006 its principal component time series fig 13b correlates with wind stress curl eof2 time series fig 12b at the 99 confidence level with correlation coefficient of 0 80 and zero time lag during spring fall the principal component time series are positive negative indicating north pacific anticyclone cyclone the wind stress curl color fig 13a calculated from the eof2 wind stress black arrow fig 13a are very similar to the wind stress curl eof2 fig 12a suggesting that wind stress curl eof2 is driven by the north pacific anticyclone cyclone the wind stress curl come from both wind stress shear and streamline curvature fig 13a after removing the intra seasonal variability the seasonal cycle of wind stress curl eof2 shows maximum in march and minimum in september fig 8b dashed line the seasonality is attributed to north pacific anticyclone cyclone transition from spring to fall the principal component time series of eof2 fig 12b and the ssh eof2 fig 7b are highly correlated the correlation coefficient is 0 43 significant to the 99 confidence level positive correlation indicates negative positive wind stress curl anomaly generates positive negative ssh anomaly the anti cyclonic cyclonic part of the dipole the time lag associated with this correlation is one month and with wind stress curl eof2 leading the ssh eof2 which represents a baroclinic response wang et al 2006 demonstrated that the dipole evolution lags behind the wind stress curl about 40 days by analyzing observational data our one month lag is in rough agreement with their finding they attribute this 40 day time lag to the time for the first baroclinic rossby wave to propagate across the southern basin of the scs near 12 n the one month lag is in good agreement with modeling studies of liu et al 2001 which indicates a one month basin crossing time of the first baroclinic rossby wave at 10 n but our analysis also shows that the ssh eof2 fig 7b and the wind stress curl eof1 fig 10b principal component time series are highly correlated the correlation coefficient of 0 66 is significant to the 99 confidence level the negative correlation indicates that the negative positive wind stress curl anomaly to the northwest southeast corresponds to positive negative ssh anomaly in the northern southern part of the dipole the time lag associated with this correlation is eight months with wind stress curl eof1 leading the ssh eof2 variation according to liu et al 2001 the basin crossing time of the first baroclinic rossby wave in scs varies from one and four months from the southern to northern basin what generates this discrepancy 4 3 baroclinic rossby wave response rossby waves are important components in large scale ocean dynamics liu et al 2001 demonstrated that the scs ssh variability is forced mainly by wind stress curl on baroclinic rossby waves the wave speed c of the free propagating first baroclinic linear rossby wave is shown below 2 c β r d 2 where β d f d y is the variation of the coriolis parameter f along latitude y and r d is the first mode baroclinic rossby radius of deformation the negative sign indicates that the rossby waves propagate westward the radius of deformation is calculated as following 3 r d g h f where h is the mean thermocline depth and g g δ ρ ρ r being the reduced gravity the mean stratification in the hycom reanalysis gives approximately 400 m of the mean thermocline depth h and 0 03 m s2 of g since β f decreases increases with latitude wave speed decreases with latitude using the same h and g the corresponding free propagating first baroclinic rossby wave speed is then 42 8 and 21 4 cm s at 10 n and 14 n in the scs respectively and the basin crossing time of the first baroclinic rossby wave in the scs is one month at 10 n and two months at 14 n rossby wave speed is estimated using the monthly ssh from the hycom reanalysis the 22 year monthly climatology is removed from the monthly ssh to generate the ssh anomaly hovmöller diagrams of the ssh anomaly along the cross section at 10 n fig 14 and 14 n fig 15 both show westward rossby wave propagation the black lines indicate westward propagating features that cross the basin in one and eight months in figs 14 and 15 respectively the phase speed of the rossby wave is estimated to be 34 9 and 5 6 cm s at 10 n and 14 n respectively the phase speed of baroclinic rossby waves in the scs at 12 n is reported to be 37 cm s xie et al 2007 the 3 7 cm s is clearly a typo of 37 cm s in xie et al 2007 our estimate of 34 9 cm s at 10 n is in rough agreement with xie et al 2007 and in northern scs phase speed of rossby waves is reported to vary from 3 to 5 cm s from 15 n to 20 n chu and fang 2003 and about 5 cm s yang and liu 2003 from 18 n to 22 n our estimate of 5 6 cm s at 14 n is in good agreement with these estimates our estimate indicates that speed of rossby wave decreases from 10 n and 14 n which agrees with theory eq 2 but both estimates are slower than the theoretical free propagating first baroclinic rossby wave speed 42 8 and 21 4 cm s at 10 n and 14 n respectively the radius of deformation for the second mode of baroclinic rossby wave outside of the tropics is r d 2 chelton et al 1998 thus the 5 6 cm s at 14 n is in good agreement of the theoretical second mode baroclinic rossby wave speed 5 4 cm s it is generally believed that the slower higher order baroclinic rossby wave modes play a lesser role in large scale ocean circulation dynamics chelton and schlax 1996 thus we think both of these are first mode baroclinic rossby waves why are they slower than the free propagating rossby waves liu et al 2001 illustrated that these waves in the scs are forced rossby waves instead of the free propagating waves as in the pacific ocean where the wind has a much larger spatial scale and does not have a highly structural wind stress curl anomaly as the monsoon wind in the scs chelton and schlax 1996 also attributed the weak westward propagation of rossby waves near the eastern boundary to the seasonal wind forcing yang and liu 2003 concluded that rossby waves in the northern scs are forced rossby waves due to the consistency between the propagation of rossby waves and the wind stress curl so these slower propagation rossby waves are forced rossby waves and this indicates that the whole scs is under the regime of forced rossby waves this is in good agreement with chelton et al 1998 in their fig 6 the first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation in the scs is less than that in the pacific at the same latitude the speed of the first baroclinic rossby wave in the scs is then slower than that in the pacific eq 2 which indicates the forced rossby waves in the scs from the above ssh eof1 represents the barotropic response to the basin scale seasonal reversing monsoon wind stress curl eof1 the ssh eof2 variation of the northern part of the dipole is mainly associated with the baroclinic response of scs to the basin scale seasonal reversing monsoon wind stress curl eof1 the ssh eof2 variation of the southern part of the dipole on the other hand is mainly associated with the baroclinic response to the monsoon wind stress curl dipole mode eof2 5 discussions 5 1 nonlinear dynamics both our analysis and wang et al 2006 indicates that the svoc dipole is driven by a dipole wind stress curl so does the anomalous svoc suggest an anomalous wind stress curl eof2 the same year since wind stress curl eof2 leads ssh eof2 by one month we generate the four month average of the wind stress curl eof2 principal component time series from may to august as shown in fig 9b the 22 year mean is 0 11 and the standard deviation is 0 18 the time series demonstrates the eof2 wind stress curl principal component is positive and one standard deviation away from the mean in 1995 1998 and 2010 this indicates that the eof2 wind stress curl in these years is positive negative south north of 9 n opposite to a normal year the negative wind stress curl north of 9 n prevents forming the ssh dipole and thus there should be an anomalous svoc in these years summer 2007 has a normal wind stress curl eof2 and should indicate a normal svoc the value in 2015 is more negative than the mean value which suggests a strong svoc yet there is also an anomalous svoc in both 2007 and 2015 we hypothesize that this is due to the nonlinear nature of the svoc wang et al 2006 demonstrated that the nonlinearity effect can be equally as important to the dipole as the wind stress curl input their experiments also indicated that the strength and location of the dipole are sensitive to the wind strength and wind direction through nonlinear processes it is possible that the wind strength and directions associated with wind stress curl in 2007 and 2015 are different than the other three years modified by higher modes 5 2 scs warming events chao et al 1996 have shown that a weaker summer monsoon leads to increased sst in the scs due to a weaker than normal surface circulation xie et al 2003 indicated the svoc advects the upwelled cold coastal water offshore to cool the scs sst in summer the disappearance of the svoc in 1998 gives rise to a strong warming sst in the interior of the scs wang et al 2006 attribute the anomalous svoc in 1995 and 1998 to the strong warm event in the scs likely due to changes in the wind field shu et al 2016 showed that the svoc disappeared in summer 2010 and the scs sst in summer 2010 was much warmer than normal in this section we examine if an anomalous svoc and the warming summer sst coexist monthly august sst anomalies from 1994 to 2015 are shown in fig 16 the sst anomaly is calculated as the august sst departure from the 22 year mean august sst a warming event is examined if the mean sst anomaly in the scs west of 120 8 e is positive mean sst anomaly in the scs is noted on each subpanel fig 16 the four strongest warming events occur in 1998 2010 1995 and 2015 the svoc is anomalous in all these 4 summers but the svoc is not anomalous in the other 4 years with warming events 2003 2009 2011 and 2014 and the mean sst anomaly in 2007 is negative a cooling event while the svoc is also anomalous there does not appear to be a direct relationship between an anomalous svoc and a warming scs sst event fan et al 2018 investigated how the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo modulates the interaction between el niño southern oscillation and the scs summer monsoon their analysis does not go farther in time than 2014 four of the 5 anomalous svoc occur before 2015 and all of these four years are characterized as both positive amo phases with a weak scs summer monsoon which suggests that interannual variability is important for the formation of the anomalous svoc we will leave this for the future research 5 3 western boundary current separation point of view previous studies also treated the svoc as the western boundary current separation from the coast shaw et al 1999 suggested that the separation of the svoc off vietnam follows the line of zero wind stress curl cai et al 2007 indicated the svoc follows geostrophic contours f h where f is the coriolis parameter and h is water depth before separation veronis 1966 investigated the nonlinear flow in wind driven ocean circulation with a barotropic model and suggested that separation is much more likely associated with baroclinic effects the pressure field associated with the western boundary current requires a high pressure region adjacent to the boundary to maintain the geostrophically balanced flow along the boundary in order for separation to occur it requires a completely different pressure distribution veronis 1966 ssh anomaly in june and september are calculated using both eof1 fig 6 and eof2 fig 7 and their corresponding seasonal cycle of the principal component time series fig 8a and are shown in fig 17 in june september the principal component time series of eof1 eof2 is at its minimum and eof2 eof1 is almost zero fig 8a thus the ssh anomaly in june september represents mainly a barotropic baroclinic response to the wind curl since eof1 eof2 ssh is the barotropic baroclinic response to the wind stress curl section 4 in june fig 17a the whole scs deep basin is a high pressure region and there is no separation in september fig 17b the baroclinic response to the wind stress curl generates the dipole and the pressure distribution is totally different than that in june and separation occurs this agrees with veronis 1966 6 conclusions in this study we investigate why the svoc is anomalous in 1995 1998 2007 2010 and 2015 using output from a 22 year 1994 2015 hycom global reanalysis based on previous observations we define a normal svoc as the ssh pattern within 110 e 115 e that satisfies all of these three conditions 1 a ssh dipole with cyclonic eddy to the north and anti cyclonic eddy to the south in water deeper than 500 m 2 the orientation of the dipole has to be oriented north south instead of east west and 3 the center of the anti cyclonic eddy associated with the svoc is located south of 12 n the reanalysis is forced with atmospheric forcing from the 0 3125 hourly ncep cfsr dataset during the period 1994 to 2010 and 0 205 ncep cfsv2 dataset from 2011 and a wind stress formulation that takes into account the ocean surface currents we performed an eof analysis on the monthly ssh and wind stress curl to seek an answer eof analysis reveals that the ssh eof1 mode fig 6 is a basin scale gyre mode explaining 43 3 of the total variance and the eof2 fig 7 is a dipole mode explaining 18 9 of the total ssh variance in the domain but ssh eof2 is more important for the ssh variation in the svoc dipole region explaining 39 6 fig 7c of the variance while ssh eof1 explains only 28 2 fig 6c of the ssh variance in the svoc dipole region the 4 month average of the ssh eof2 principal component time series from june to september fig 9a has a mean of 0 27 and the standard deviation of 0 28 five highest values in decreasing order are in 2010 1998 1995 2015 and 2007 the coefficients in 1995 1998 2010 and 2015 are all positive which represents a dipole structure opposite to the normal svoc dipole and one standard deviation away from the 22 year mean value the value in 2007 is 0 02 close to zero indicating the dipole mode ssh eof2 almost disappeared in that year anomalous ssh eof2 in these five years leads to the anomalous svoc there are two dominant wind stress curl modes with eof1 explaining 63 4 fig 10 of the total variance and represents the seasonally reversing monsoon while eof2 explains 14 9 fig 12 of the total variance and represents the west north pacific anticyclone and cyclone in spring and fall analysis shows that ssh eof2 is driven by both wind stress curl modes and represents the ssh baroclinic response via forced rossby waves the ssh eof2 variation of the northern part of the dipole is mainly associated with the baroclinic response of scs to the basin scale seasonal reversing monsoon wind stress curl eof1 with a time lag of eight months the ssh eof2 variation of the southern part of the dipole on the other hand is mainly associated with the baroclinic response to the wind stress curl dipole mode eof2 with a time lag of one month the basin scale ssh eof1 represents the barotropic response to the basin scale wind stress curl eof1 declaration of
