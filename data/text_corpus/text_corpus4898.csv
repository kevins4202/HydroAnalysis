24490,the existing methods of pathogen control in agroecosystems are insufficiently effective against fusarium species due to the high variability and specific biology of these fungi the aim of our work was to reconstruct the kinetic mechanisms that determine the biomass of fusarium species in the agroecosystem and to find out the optimal ways to manipulate the structure of detrital food webs which would minimize the risk of fusarium contamination the studied system consisted of three components mycophagous soil nematodes the soil phase of fusarium species and winter wheat seedlings two system models were compared general based on general postulates of population dynamics and lab specific taking into account the peculiarities of the conditions of the laboratory experiment based on the results of parameter estimation and global sensitivity analysis three model parameters were identified with a strongest impact on the biomass of fusarium species 1 the reproduction rate of mycophagous nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium 2 the death rate of mycophagous nematodes and 3 the carrying capacity of fusarium species based on the results of stochastic modelling the internal variability of the biomass dynamics of fusarium species exceeded by two orders of magnitude the internal variability of abundance dynamics of mycophagous nematodes the developed model made it possible to obtain fundamentally new information about the basic mechanisms of interaction of fusarium species mycophagous nematodes and winter wheat plants and highlight the most promising mechanisms which can reduce the biomass of fusarium species in the soil keywords fusarium wilt detrital food webs identification of parameters dynamic models pathogenic microorganisms mathematical models in ecology 1 introduction in recent decades there has been an increase in the proportion of crop losses caused by soil phytopathogens savary et al 2019 from the point of view of ecological theory the observed situation can serve as an example of a decrease in the stability of a terrestrial ecosystem functioning caused by a reduced level of species diversity loreau and de mazancourt 2013 maestre et al 2012 ploughing the use of plant protection chemicals and other conventional agricultural practices significantly impair soil health and lead to decrease in the number of ecological niches in the soil block of the agroecosystems toropova et al 2017 wardle 2013 as a result a number of pathogenic soil microorganisms with low competitiveness in undisturbed ecosystems gain a significant advantage in the arable soils an example is the pathogenic fusarium species fusarium oxysporum f graminearum f sporotrichioides etc that cause fusarium wilt and fusarium head blight of a number of grain crops including winter wheat gagkaeva et al 2011 due to the high variability and specific biology of fusarium species quintana rodriguez et al 2018 smith 2007 suproniene et al 2019 existing methods for controlling this group of phytopathogens such as treating grains before sowing or plants with a fungicide crop rotation growing varieties tolerant to disease proper storage of seeds and embedding of soil do not have sufficient effectiveness against pathogenic fusarium species that usually ranges between 30 and 40 sarrocco et al 2013 at the same time by manipulating the structure of detrital food webs one can influence the soil phase of fusarium species during which these fungi behave like saprotrophic microflora and have a reduced competitive ability abawi and lorbeer 1972 marois and mitchell 1981 and also low resistance to grazing by soil fauna meyer wolfarth et al 2017 innocenti and sabatini 2018 in particular soil fungi feeding nematodes can serve as natural antagonists of fusarium species shchukovskaya et al 2014 goncharov et al 2020 however the species specific processes of interaction between soil fungi and soil invertebrates have been poorly understood due to nonlinearity and complexity of this system haarith et al 2019 jacobsen et al 2018 thakur and geisen 2019 an important reason for the absence of effective methods of controlling pathogenic fusarium species is a poor knowledge of the mechanisms driving the infestation of cereals andriuzzi and wall 2017 deckmyn et al 2020 toropova et al 2017 there is no doubt that a decrease in the total abundance of fusarium species in soil reduces the risk of infection smith 2007 in addition it is well known that during the soil phase fusarium species receives energy via both active parasitism on the underground parts of plants and occupying the ecological niche of saprotrophic fungi smith 2007 based on current theories of soil food webs adding extra food source detrital subsidy i e organic forms of carbon and nitrogen can increase the abundance species diversity and overall activity of saprotrophic mycobiota and soil invertebrate communities bonkowski 2004 hättenschwiler et al 2005 kuzyakov and gavrichkova 2010 schmidt et al 2011 fusarium species have a reduced competitive ability compared to saprotrophic soil microbiota marois and mitchell 1981 and have limited resistance to grazing by soil invertebrates meyer wolfarth et al 2017 thus addition of detrital subsidy can reduce the biomass and pathogenicity of fusarium species via transformation of the structure of detrital food web in particular in a laboratory experiment it was shown that adding detrital subsidy in the form of mulch a mixture of compost and straw significantly reduced the incidence of fusarium on winter wheat seedlings goncharov et al 2021 however in order to obtain accurate information on the nature of the observed phenomena in such a complex multicomponent system as the soil food web a systematic analysis using mathematical modelling methods is required the modern level of development of information technology makes it possible to use a broad range of diverse mathematical methods to describe complex natural systems an approach suggested in 1946 by hermann weyl weyl 1946 and associated with co ordination i e obtaining quantitative assessments of complex phenomena is still the most effective strategy for applying mathematical methods to describe complex natural systems without significant loss of information this approach combined with systems dynamics modelling has been successfully applied in a number of natural science disciplines including immunology bocharov et al 2018 bocharov and marchuk 2000 and pharmacology helmlinger et al 2017 in the case of ecology this approach will make it possible to formalize and objectively evaluate a number of important properties of terrestrial arable ecosystems which currently do not have an unambiguous definition including the ability of the soil to suppress diseases soil health and the plant immunity level larkin 2015 the development and implementation of such methods for studying ecological processes in particular for assessing the mechanisms that maintain the functional unity of terrestrial ecosystems is an important task both for theoretical ecology and for the development of new methods of biocontrol for instance a lattice based epidemic model coupled with a stochastic process has successfully described outbreaks of infectious diseases in plants orozco fuentes et al 2019 application of the epidemiological model allowed to show that increasing predation pressure in the outside host environment could be efficient biological control method against environmentally growing opportunist diseases merikanto et al 2017 mathematical models are widely used to optimize the strategy for the use of crop protection chemicals for many crops and pathogens wheat and fusarium head blight duffeck et al 2020 paul et al 2018 potato and late blight pacilly et al 2018 banana and fusarium wilt ye et al 2020 accounting for activity of soil fauna can significantly improve the quality of models describing the processes occurring in terrestrial ecosystems wardle 2013 however mathematical models of the dynamics of the interaction processes between winter wheat soil animals and fusarium species are currently absent the aim of this work was to reconstruct the key processes determining the biomass of fusarium species in the agroecosystem and to identify the optimal parameters to manipulate the structure of detrital food webs which will minimize the risk of fusarium infection to proceed with the modelling approach we assumed that 1 the biomass dynamics of fusarium species in soil can be accurately described based on data on the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the growth dynamics of wheat seedlings 2 the dynamics of the development of winter wheat seedlings is more important for describing the biomass dynamics of fusarium species than the abundance of mycophagous nematodes in section 2 we describe the data mathematical models and computational tools of their analysis section 3 presents the results of the study extensive discussion and implications of the study are covered in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset for modelling to construct the mathematical model the data of the laboratory experiment were used the purpose of that experiment was to assess the effect of detrital subsidy on soil biota the pathogenicity of fusarium species and the growth dynamics of winter wheat seedlings goncharov et al 2021 in brief each of 12 experimental units consisting of plastic boxes of 40 cm wide 60 cm long and 30 cm deep was filled with 31 kg of soil thirty winter wheat seeds were planted in each mesocosm mesocosms were assigned randomly to one of three treatments 30 days after planting the seeds the treatments were 1 control no subsidy 2 addition of a n poor detrital subsidy and 3 addition of a n rich detrital subsidy detrital subsidies were added as a 1 2 cm thick mulch laid on the soil surface the detrital subsidy consisted of shredded wheat straw and cow manure based compost samples of soil from the upper 3 cm soil layer and mulch were collected from the between row space at the start of the experiment day 0 and after 20 40 and 60 days for more details see goncharov et al 2021 data on the plant height abundance of mycophagous nematodes and biomass of fusarium species were used for mathematical modelling plant height was measured with a ruler quantitative counts of nematodes in soil and mulch samples were carried out using water extraction on berman funnels the biomass of fusarium species was measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay ivanova et al 2020 2 2 basic statistical analysis of experimental data the main statistical analysis of the data included statistical description of the results of measurements of plant height the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the biomass of fusarium species performed in three experimental regimens using the smirnov homogeneity criterion smirnov 1939 the statistical significance of adding a detrital subsidy was assessed and the belonging of measurements made in different experimental regimens to the same distribution was verified using the lilliefors criterion modification of the kolmogorov test the distribution law of observation results was determined using bartlett s test bolshev and smirnov 1965 and one way analysis of variance the presence of statistically significant differences in the dynamics of plant height the abundance of fungi feeding nematodes and the biomass of fusarium species were checked the hypothesis of statistically significant differences in the dynamics of the studied groups was tested on log transformed data statistical calculations were performed using the scipy stats library implemented in python virtanen et al 2020 2 3 modelling the growth dynamics of wheat seedlings abundance of mycophagous nematodes and biomass of fusarium species to describe the growth dynamics of winter wheat seedlings w t biomass dynamics of fusarium species f t and mycophagous nematodes n t two phenomenological mathematical models were formulated the first of them general model was based on general postulates of population dynamics bazykin 2003 and the second lab specific model considered the peculiarities of the conditions of the laboratory experiment fig 1 in the first model a so called predator prey relationship was assumed where the predators were mycophagous nematodes feeding on soil fungi including fungi of the genus fusarium the model built on general assumptions of the population dynamics of the system components fig 1a was as follows 1 d d t f t β f f t 1 f t θ f γ f n n t f t d d t n t β n n t β f n f t n t μ n n t d d t w t β w w t c w w t θ w γ w f f t a lab specific model that considers the conditions of a laboratory experiment fig 1b was represented by the system 2 d d t f t β f f t 1 f t θ f w t γ f w 2 t f t d d t n t β f n f t n t μ n n t d d t w t β w w t 1 w t θ w in the general model fig 1a fusarium species could increase their biomass regardless of the wheat height and the increase in the abundance of mycophagous nematodes depended on the biomass of fusarium species it was also assumed that the abundance of fusarium species had a negative effect on wheat growth the lab specific model fig 1b considered a number of laboratory conditions including a significant decrease in soil moisture on the 60th day of the experiment caused by a high transpiration rate in grown wheat seedlings it was also assumed that the feeding of mycophagous nematodes on fusarium species did not have a noticeable effect on the biomass of these fungi these assumptions implied the introduction of negative influence of plants on fusarium species and excluded the feedback nematodes fungi from the system the dynamics of plant growth was described using the logistic growth equation the negative influence of plants on the biomass of fusarium species was assumed to be proportional to the square of their height two mathematical models representing systems of non linear ordinary differential equations odes were formulated in accordance with the above schemes the biological meaning of the model parameters is described in tables 1 and 2 the following units of measurement of the model variables were used biomass of fungi of the genus fusarium f a u fppc m 2 number of arbitrary units of fusarium specific polysaccharide protein conjugate per square metre of 3 cm thin soil surface abundance of fungivorous nematodes n ind m 2 number of individuals per square metre of 3 cm thin soil surface height of wheat seedlings w cm 2 4 fitting models to observational data to estimate the parameters of the systems of odes 1 and 2 from the experimental data the maximum likelihood approach ml was used let us denote by y t f t n t w t the vector function of the solution by y j y tj j 1 2 3 4 and tj 0 20 40 60 the vector of data of the laboratory experiment on different days denote by the vector p the vector of parameters of models 1 or 2 since the values of these measurements had a lognormal distribution the probability density function for j th observation can be represented as follows 3 f y j p 1 y j σ 2 π exp ln y j ln y t j p 2 2 σ 2 then the total likelihood function for observations takes the form 4 φ p t j 0 20 40 60 ln y j ln y t j p 2 where 5 φ p t j 0 20 40 60 ln y j ln y t j p 2 here the expression ln y j ln y t j p is calculated as the sum of the differences of the decimal logarithms of the respective components of the vectors y j and y t j p and the variance is assumed to be the same for all data thus the problem of finding the maximum of the likelihood function 4 is reduced to the problem of minimizing the log squares functional 5 while the best estimate of the values of the model parameters corresponds to the minimum of the objective function 5 in the parameter space for the numerical identification of the model parameters the following matlab based the math works inc 2021 algorithms were used 1 the ode15s algorithm for solving the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations shampine and reichelt 1997 and 2 the nelder mead fminsearch method for solving the functional minimization problem lagarias et al 1998 the comparison of the studied models was carried out using the akaike information theoretic criterion 6 a i c 2 n p 2 ln l where n p is the number of model parameters and l is the maximum likelihood function in our case the formula can be rewritten as 7 a i c 2 n p 2 ln i 1 n d 1 y i 2 π σ 2 n d 2 exp φ p o p t 2 σ 2 2 n p 2 ln c 2 ln σ n d φ p o p t σ 2 where the constant 8 c i 1 n d 1 y i 2 π n d 2 does not depend on the choice of the model σ 2 φ p o p t n d is the estimate of the variance of the observation data and nd is the number of observational data 2 5 variation of parameters and global sensitivity analysis to study the sensitivity of the mathematical model to changes in parameters each k th parameter was varied with a step δ p k 0 001 p k in the 0 2 p k interval where p k is the estimated value of the k th parameter of the system of model equations for each parameter p k at each step with fixed optimal values of the remaining parameters a system of differential equations was solved using the ode15s algorithm used shampine and reichelt 1997 a global sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of the parameters of the model on the model variables and rank them according to their significance to this end the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc method was used marino et al 2008 the prcc was computed between two values x j x j and y y as follows 9 x j c 0 p 1 p j k c p x p y b 0 p 1 p j k b p x p where x j and y are rank transformed inputs parameters and output variables of the model for sampling parameter x j j 1 n p the latin hypercube sampling method was used marino et al 2008 this method requires fewer number of computations compared with standard monte carlo sampling parameters of the model were sampled according to the uniform distribution function 2 6 stochastic model in this section we extend the deterministic model in order to examine the impact of stochastic forcing effects by processes which are not explicitly considered in our simplified model description specifically the stochastic modelling i e the application of stochastic differential equations of itό type sdes was performed to check how strongly the observed uncertainties in the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes depend on the random fluctuations in the rates of the interaction between the components of the entire system to this end odes system 1 was transformed to the following sdes form 10 d dt f t β f f t 1 f t θ f γ fn n t f t σ f d w 1 d dt n t β n n t β fn f t n t μ n n t σ n d w 2 d dt w t β w w t c w w t θ w γ wf f t where w 1 and w 2 are standard wiener processes affecting the fluctuations in the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes respectively and σf σn are the intensities of the additive noise in the equations for the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes respectively to compute the trajectories of the sdes model the itoint algorithm from sdeint package was used aburn 2017 this algorithm is implemented in python for each of three response variables with σ f and σ n prescribed ad hoc the average of the random realizations of the model trajectories and their variance nr 100 were calculated for combination of σf and σn values sampled from some range 0 105 after that for each k th combination k 1 35 the relative variance estimates were averaged eq 11 and transformed to 0 1 range eq 12 as follows 11 d k a b s log i 1 3 e s t v a r i c t r l v a r i 3 12 d t r max d k d k max d k where d k is an average estimate of the relative variances for each of k th combination of σ f and σ n e s t v a r i is the stochastic variance of i th response variable on 60th day c t r l v a r i is the experimentally observed variance of i th response variable on 60th day the consistency index of the stochastic variance to experimental variance dtr was used to characterize a quantitative agreement between the model and empirical variances of the system dynamics it transforms to 0 1 range the individual d k values so that the value 1 stands for a perfect consistency the computed set of dtr values were used to find out the optimal combination of σ f and σ n values note that the plant height was a manifest variable that did not impact the interaction dynamics of the fusarium species and mycophagous nematodes and hence the system behaviour by this reason the stochastic perturbation was not added to the equation describing the plant height 3 results 3 1 basic statistical analysis as a result of calculating the kolmogorov smirnov statistics it was found that the addition of both types of detrital subsidies had a statistically insignificant effect on the studied parameters table a 1 due to the absence of statistically significant differences associated with the experimental regimen further modelling was carried out on the general dataset without dividing it into experimental regimens when testing the hypothesis of the normal distribution law using the lilliefors test the critical value of the kolmogorov statistic 0 24 was exceeded for the abundance of nematodes on the 20th day of the experiment and for the height of wheat seedlings on the 40th day of the experiment which was not detected when testing the hypothesis of the log normal distribution law table a 2 as a result a decision was made in favour of the second assumption about the log normal distribution of the data as a result of the application of the bartlett test the null hypothesis of equality of standard deviations during the entire observation period was rejected for the dynamics of the biomass of fusarium species and the height of wheat seedlings since the calculated statistic value was greater than the critical one table a 3 for the abundance of mycophagous nematodes no significant differences were found and for them equality of the mean values was tested using one way analysis of variance since the calculated value of the fisher criterion fk 1 62 turned out to be less than the critical fk 6 59 there was no reason to reject the null hypothesis about the equality of the mean values for abundance of fungi feeding nematodes thus a statistically significant dynamics was noted for the biomass of fusarium species and the height of wheat seedlings 3 2 fitting models to data for the general model the value of the aic coefficient was 16 5 while the value of the aic coefficient of the lab specific model was higher and amounted to 0 03 indicating a greater degree of agreement of the general model as compared to the lab specific one a visual analysis of the trajectories predicted by the models showed that the dynamics of all three components of the model system the biomass of fusarium species the abundance of fungi feeding nematodes and the height of winter wheat seedlings were more consistent for the general model fig 2 a as compared to the lab specific one fig 2b in addition the 95 confidence intervals predicted by the lab specific model for the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the height of winter wheat seedlings were too wide fig 2b fig a 1 eight out of ten parameters of the general model were determined very accurately as they had rather narrow 95 confidence intervals table 1 parameters βn reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes and сw maximum height of wheat seedlings revealed significant uncertainty i e were non identifiable by the data used amongst the seven parameters of the lab specific model only four βf θf γf βw were determined accurately table 2 the other three parameters βfn reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium species μn rate constant of natural death of fungi feeding nematodes and θw maximum height of wheat seedlings showed significant uncertainty 3 3 model sensitivity analysis according to the results of parameter variation the lab specific model of the laboratory experiment was more sensitive to changes in parameters than the general model figs 3 4 the predicted abundance values for at least one of two groups of soil organisms fusarium species or fungi feeding nematodes were sensitive to changes in five parameters β f β f n γ f n μ n and θ f of the general model fig 3 a decrease in the biomass of fusarium species was associated with an increase in the βfn parameter a decrease in the μn parameter as well as a decrease in the θ f parameter fig 3 the deviation in the abundance of mycophagous nematodes had a positive dependence on deviations in the values of the parameters β f β f n and θ f ranging from 50 to 100 of the respective values a negative association of the deviation in the abundance of mycophagous nematodes was noted for the parameters γfn and μn of the general model fig 3 changes in each of the seven parameters of the lab specific model were associated with a significant deviation from the mean of the predicted abundance of at least one of the two considered groups of soil organisms fig 4 a pronounced decrease in the biomass of fusarium species was associated with a decrease in the values of the βf and θf parameters as well as an increase in the values of the γf parameter the dependence of the deviation of the values of the abundance of mycophagous nematodes with varying all parameters of the lab specific model had an exponential form fig 4 in general in both considered models with the same deviation of parameters the amplitude of changes in the abundance in mycophagous nematodes was significantly greater than in fusarium species figs 3 4 based on the results of global sensitivity analysis the prcc values for the general table 3 and lab specific table 4 model parameters were estimated at days 20 40 and 60 separately both the estimated prcc values and the respective p values of almost all parameters of two tested models had similar values between days 20 40 and 60 in the general model the biomass of fusarium species was most associated with μ n β f n and θ f values abundance of fungi feeding nematodes had the highest association with the following parameters β f θ f β f n μ n the wheat height was most associated with γ w f β w μ n and β f n table 3 table a 4 in the lab specific model the biomass of fusarium species was associated significantly with β w γ f θ w and β f values abundance of fungi feeding nematodes had the highest association with β f β fn μ n and γ f values the wheat height was most associated with the following parameters β w θ w and β f table 4 table a 5 based on the results of global sensitivity analysis fig 5 the structure of the relationship between the residuals of partial regression of the most significant model parameters and the two response variables the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes was very similar to the sensitivity results obtained by parameter variation figs 3 4 3 4 stochastic modelling results comparison of the consistency measures of the stochastic version of the general model calculated for different values of the noise intensity allowed to identify the consistent combination of the noise intensity values as shown in fig 6 a the respective noise intensity in the equations of the biomass of fusarium species σf was 104 while the noise amplitude in the equation for the abundance of mycophagous nematodes σn was 102 the consideration of additive noise in the equations with an optimal combination of the noise intensity parameters in model eq 10 consistently reproduced the observed dynamics of variance of the three studied response variables fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of two developed models the interaction of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in the agroecosystem has a significant but still insufficiently studied effect on other elements of terrestrial ecosystems including the functional state and productivity of cultivated plants köhl et al 2007 kühn and ruess 2021 migunova and sasanelli 2021 as far as we know this work is the first successful attempt to quantitatively analyse using mathematical models the mechanism of control of pathogenic fusarium species by detrital food webs considering the community of soil mycophagous nematodes as a result of comparing the two mathematical models it was shown that the model based on general postulates of population dynamics and not considering the limitations of laboratory conditions fig 1a more accurately describes the studied three component system fig 2 results of sensitivity analysis figs 3 4 confirm a higher robustness level of the general model compared to the lab specific one which manifests itself amongst other things in the greater stability of the response variables when varying individual parameters in turn the consistency of the results of the parameter variation was confirmed by a global sensitivity analysis fig 5 table 3 and 4 comparison of the general and lab specific models allowed us to unravel both the agreement and discrepancy between the data of laboratory observations and theoretical concepts as well as to identify processes significantly affecting the dynamics of winter wheat and its pathogens however since the modelling was based on measurements obtained under laboratory conditions its results should be applied to natural agroecosystems with great care applying of the prcc method that is sensitive to non monotonic dependence between parameter and model variable marino et al 2008 is an another limitation of our study we have implemented a classical approach of mathematical biology to model the dynamics of populations in particular the processes of interaction between winter wheat fusarium species and mycophagous nematodes the obtained ml based solution of the parameter estimation problem allowed to show that including the soil living mycophagous nematodes improved the quality of the model description of the interaction processes between the winter wheat and fusarium species however a number of models have already been published that describe other important mechanisms driving the process of infection of wheat with pathogens in particular based on 3d spatial modelling it was shown that the pathogenicity of zymoseptoria tritici the causative agent of septoria leaves of wheat decreased exponentially with the height of the wheat cultivar vidal et al 2018 the underlying mechanism of this effect was related to the ecological properties of this pathogen the spore carrying droplet trajectories from the infected lower leaves cannot reach and infect upper leaves if the plant is high and the distance between lower and upper leaves is large another way of pathogen control was found by introducing a novel epidemiological model merikanto et al 2017 this model demonstrated that environmentally growing opportunist pathogens can be heavily influenced by outside host natural enemies and this can effectively be utilized in biological control of infectious diseases overall the construction of mathematical models and their calibration made it possible to agree on qualitative ideas about the control parameters of agroecosystem functioning it can be argued with some caution that the initial foundation has been created for the active expansion and development of interdisciplinary research and the implementation of a systems approach to the problems of the controlled functioning of agroecosystems using mathematical methods 4 2 biological interpretation of the optimal model comparison of the observed values and the predictions of the general model fig 2a confirmed our first suggestion data on the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the growth dynamics of wheat seedlings make it possible to accurately describe the biomass dynamics of fusarium species in soil the obtained results of varying the parameters β f n reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium species and μn rate constant of natural death of fungi feeding nematodes allowed us to propose a mechanistic explanation of the published observations on the ability of soil fungi feeding nematodes to reduce the pathogenic activity of fusarium species goncharov et al 2021 meyer wolfarth et al 2017 wolfarth et al 2015 in addition the sensitivity of changes in the biomass of fusarium species to changes in the values of all parameters of the general model turned out to be significantly lower than in fungi feeding nematodes fig 3 this result is also in good agreement with the data of numerous field trials during which the significant resistance of fusarium species to various types of influences was shown paul et al 2018 smith 2007 despite the fact that fusarium species during the laboratory experiment which served as a data source for modelling were able to parasitize on the roots of winter wheat seedlings goncharov et al 2021 the interaction between the degree of plant development expressed through the parameters β w θ w c w γ w f and the biomass of fusarium species was not significant fig 3 at the same time the abundance of fusarium species was sensitive to the parameters β f n and μ n associated with the dynamics of the abundance of mycophagous nematodes consequently our second suggestion about the greater significance of the dynamics of the growth of wheat seedlings in comparison with the dynamics of the abundance of mycophagous nematodes for describing the dynamics of the biomass of fusarium species was not confirmed a possible explanation for this result is the weak relationship between the height of wheat and the degree of development of its root system ehdaie et al 2012 figueroa bustos et al 2018 on the other hand fusarium species are well known for their low resistance to grazing by soil fauna goncharov et al 2020 including nematodes okada et al 2014 shchukovskaya et al 2014 wolfarth et al 2013 in this case our results allow us to quantify the degree of trophic relationship between soil microorganisms for example fusarium species and microfauna fungi feeding nematodes based on the data on the dynamics of their abundancies fig 3 the stochastic modelling of the random effects in the interaction processes demonstrated much larger magnitude of the resulting variability of fusarium species compared to mycophagous nematodes fig 6 this result is fully consistent with the existing views of the fundamental differences between ecological properties of soil microorganisms including fusarium species and soil animals of the microfauna size group which most mycophagous nematodes belong to indeed both biomass and activity of fusarium species as well as other soil fungi are highly sensitive to a range of biotic and abiotic factors including soil moisture ph temperature nutrients availability grazers activity smith 2007 soil fungi react quickly and strongly to changes in environmental conditions their turnover rate can be shorter that 50 days rousk and bååth 2011 while the characteristic time of a noticeable change in the abundance of soil nematodes in response to changes in environmental conditions is much longer song et al 2016 thus the calculated estimates of the internal processes related variability of the biomass of fusarium species σf 104 nematodes σn 102 and plants σ 0 can serve as the first quantitative insight into the internal variability of these groups and can be used to refine the models describing the functional structure of detrital food webs in agroecosystems de ruiter et al 1994 4 3 extension of the proposed models the results of varying the parameters made it possible to obtain fundamentally new information about the basic mechanisms of interaction of fusarium species mycophagous nematodes and winter wheat plants according to the general model data three parameters were identified that were associated with a significant decrease in the biomass of fusarium species in the soil βfn reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium species μn rate constant of natural death of fungi feeding nematodes and θf carrying capacity constant for fusarium species fig 3 table 3 these results highlight the three most promising mechanisms which can reduce the biomass of fusarium species in the soil the first two are in agreement with the use of soil mycophagous nematodes as control agents for fusarium species and these approaches have already been shown to be effective in laboratory and field conditions shchukovskaya et al 2014 however the application of this approach at a large scale is currently impossible due to the technological limitations of the method the third mechanism for controlling fusarium species in the soil looks very promising which is expressed in the decrease in the values of the parameter θf carrying capacity constant for fusarium species this mechanism underlies the use of existing fungicides against fusarium head blight however due to the significant genetic variability of pathogenic strains of fusarium species the effectiveness of such drugs usually does not exceed 30 40 musyimi et al 2012 riungu et al 2008 sarrocco et al 2013 on the other hand a decrease in the carrying capacity for the soil phase of fusarium species can be effectively implemented by increasing the activity of detrital food webs in the arable soils via adding a detrital subsidy goncharov et al 2021 further development of more complex models of agroecosystems including not only fusarium species plants and mycophagous nematodes but also other groups of soil mycobiota and fauna can provide more accurate information on the most promising areas of control of phytopathogenic microorganisms credit authorship contribution statement anton a goncharov conceptualization data curation writing original draft

24490,the existing methods of pathogen control in agroecosystems are insufficiently effective against fusarium species due to the high variability and specific biology of these fungi the aim of our work was to reconstruct the kinetic mechanisms that determine the biomass of fusarium species in the agroecosystem and to find out the optimal ways to manipulate the structure of detrital food webs which would minimize the risk of fusarium contamination the studied system consisted of three components mycophagous soil nematodes the soil phase of fusarium species and winter wheat seedlings two system models were compared general based on general postulates of population dynamics and lab specific taking into account the peculiarities of the conditions of the laboratory experiment based on the results of parameter estimation and global sensitivity analysis three model parameters were identified with a strongest impact on the biomass of fusarium species 1 the reproduction rate of mycophagous nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium 2 the death rate of mycophagous nematodes and 3 the carrying capacity of fusarium species based on the results of stochastic modelling the internal variability of the biomass dynamics of fusarium species exceeded by two orders of magnitude the internal variability of abundance dynamics of mycophagous nematodes the developed model made it possible to obtain fundamentally new information about the basic mechanisms of interaction of fusarium species mycophagous nematodes and winter wheat plants and highlight the most promising mechanisms which can reduce the biomass of fusarium species in the soil keywords fusarium wilt detrital food webs identification of parameters dynamic models pathogenic microorganisms mathematical models in ecology 1 introduction in recent decades there has been an increase in the proportion of crop losses caused by soil phytopathogens savary et al 2019 from the point of view of ecological theory the observed situation can serve as an example of a decrease in the stability of a terrestrial ecosystem functioning caused by a reduced level of species diversity loreau and de mazancourt 2013 maestre et al 2012 ploughing the use of plant protection chemicals and other conventional agricultural practices significantly impair soil health and lead to decrease in the number of ecological niches in the soil block of the agroecosystems toropova et al 2017 wardle 2013 as a result a number of pathogenic soil microorganisms with low competitiveness in undisturbed ecosystems gain a significant advantage in the arable soils an example is the pathogenic fusarium species fusarium oxysporum f graminearum f sporotrichioides etc that cause fusarium wilt and fusarium head blight of a number of grain crops including winter wheat gagkaeva et al 2011 due to the high variability and specific biology of fusarium species quintana rodriguez et al 2018 smith 2007 suproniene et al 2019 existing methods for controlling this group of phytopathogens such as treating grains before sowing or plants with a fungicide crop rotation growing varieties tolerant to disease proper storage of seeds and embedding of soil do not have sufficient effectiveness against pathogenic fusarium species that usually ranges between 30 and 40 sarrocco et al 2013 at the same time by manipulating the structure of detrital food webs one can influence the soil phase of fusarium species during which these fungi behave like saprotrophic microflora and have a reduced competitive ability abawi and lorbeer 1972 marois and mitchell 1981 and also low resistance to grazing by soil fauna meyer wolfarth et al 2017 innocenti and sabatini 2018 in particular soil fungi feeding nematodes can serve as natural antagonists of fusarium species shchukovskaya et al 2014 goncharov et al 2020 however the species specific processes of interaction between soil fungi and soil invertebrates have been poorly understood due to nonlinearity and complexity of this system haarith et al 2019 jacobsen et al 2018 thakur and geisen 2019 an important reason for the absence of effective methods of controlling pathogenic fusarium species is a poor knowledge of the mechanisms driving the infestation of cereals andriuzzi and wall 2017 deckmyn et al 2020 toropova et al 2017 there is no doubt that a decrease in the total abundance of fusarium species in soil reduces the risk of infection smith 2007 in addition it is well known that during the soil phase fusarium species receives energy via both active parasitism on the underground parts of plants and occupying the ecological niche of saprotrophic fungi smith 2007 based on current theories of soil food webs adding extra food source detrital subsidy i e organic forms of carbon and nitrogen can increase the abundance species diversity and overall activity of saprotrophic mycobiota and soil invertebrate communities bonkowski 2004 hättenschwiler et al 2005 kuzyakov and gavrichkova 2010 schmidt et al 2011 fusarium species have a reduced competitive ability compared to saprotrophic soil microbiota marois and mitchell 1981 and have limited resistance to grazing by soil invertebrates meyer wolfarth et al 2017 thus addition of detrital subsidy can reduce the biomass and pathogenicity of fusarium species via transformation of the structure of detrital food web in particular in a laboratory experiment it was shown that adding detrital subsidy in the form of mulch a mixture of compost and straw significantly reduced the incidence of fusarium on winter wheat seedlings goncharov et al 2021 however in order to obtain accurate information on the nature of the observed phenomena in such a complex multicomponent system as the soil food web a systematic analysis using mathematical modelling methods is required the modern level of development of information technology makes it possible to use a broad range of diverse mathematical methods to describe complex natural systems an approach suggested in 1946 by hermann weyl weyl 1946 and associated with co ordination i e obtaining quantitative assessments of complex phenomena is still the most effective strategy for applying mathematical methods to describe complex natural systems without significant loss of information this approach combined with systems dynamics modelling has been successfully applied in a number of natural science disciplines including immunology bocharov et al 2018 bocharov and marchuk 2000 and pharmacology helmlinger et al 2017 in the case of ecology this approach will make it possible to formalize and objectively evaluate a number of important properties of terrestrial arable ecosystems which currently do not have an unambiguous definition including the ability of the soil to suppress diseases soil health and the plant immunity level larkin 2015 the development and implementation of such methods for studying ecological processes in particular for assessing the mechanisms that maintain the functional unity of terrestrial ecosystems is an important task both for theoretical ecology and for the development of new methods of biocontrol for instance a lattice based epidemic model coupled with a stochastic process has successfully described outbreaks of infectious diseases in plants orozco fuentes et al 2019 application of the epidemiological model allowed to show that increasing predation pressure in the outside host environment could be efficient biological control method against environmentally growing opportunist diseases merikanto et al 2017 mathematical models are widely used to optimize the strategy for the use of crop protection chemicals for many crops and pathogens wheat and fusarium head blight duffeck et al 2020 paul et al 2018 potato and late blight pacilly et al 2018 banana and fusarium wilt ye et al 2020 accounting for activity of soil fauna can significantly improve the quality of models describing the processes occurring in terrestrial ecosystems wardle 2013 however mathematical models of the dynamics of the interaction processes between winter wheat soil animals and fusarium species are currently absent the aim of this work was to reconstruct the key processes determining the biomass of fusarium species in the agroecosystem and to identify the optimal parameters to manipulate the structure of detrital food webs which will minimize the risk of fusarium infection to proceed with the modelling approach we assumed that 1 the biomass dynamics of fusarium species in soil can be accurately described based on data on the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the growth dynamics of wheat seedlings 2 the dynamics of the development of winter wheat seedlings is more important for describing the biomass dynamics of fusarium species than the abundance of mycophagous nematodes in section 2 we describe the data mathematical models and computational tools of their analysis section 3 presents the results of the study extensive discussion and implications of the study are covered in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset for modelling to construct the mathematical model the data of the laboratory experiment were used the purpose of that experiment was to assess the effect of detrital subsidy on soil biota the pathogenicity of fusarium species and the growth dynamics of winter wheat seedlings goncharov et al 2021 in brief each of 12 experimental units consisting of plastic boxes of 40 cm wide 60 cm long and 30 cm deep was filled with 31 kg of soil thirty winter wheat seeds were planted in each mesocosm mesocosms were assigned randomly to one of three treatments 30 days after planting the seeds the treatments were 1 control no subsidy 2 addition of a n poor detrital subsidy and 3 addition of a n rich detrital subsidy detrital subsidies were added as a 1 2 cm thick mulch laid on the soil surface the detrital subsidy consisted of shredded wheat straw and cow manure based compost samples of soil from the upper 3 cm soil layer and mulch were collected from the between row space at the start of the experiment day 0 and after 20 40 and 60 days for more details see goncharov et al 2021 data on the plant height abundance of mycophagous nematodes and biomass of fusarium species were used for mathematical modelling plant height was measured with a ruler quantitative counts of nematodes in soil and mulch samples were carried out using water extraction on berman funnels the biomass of fusarium species was measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay ivanova et al 2020 2 2 basic statistical analysis of experimental data the main statistical analysis of the data included statistical description of the results of measurements of plant height the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the biomass of fusarium species performed in three experimental regimens using the smirnov homogeneity criterion smirnov 1939 the statistical significance of adding a detrital subsidy was assessed and the belonging of measurements made in different experimental regimens to the same distribution was verified using the lilliefors criterion modification of the kolmogorov test the distribution law of observation results was determined using bartlett s test bolshev and smirnov 1965 and one way analysis of variance the presence of statistically significant differences in the dynamics of plant height the abundance of fungi feeding nematodes and the biomass of fusarium species were checked the hypothesis of statistically significant differences in the dynamics of the studied groups was tested on log transformed data statistical calculations were performed using the scipy stats library implemented in python virtanen et al 2020 2 3 modelling the growth dynamics of wheat seedlings abundance of mycophagous nematodes and biomass of fusarium species to describe the growth dynamics of winter wheat seedlings w t biomass dynamics of fusarium species f t and mycophagous nematodes n t two phenomenological mathematical models were formulated the first of them general model was based on general postulates of population dynamics bazykin 2003 and the second lab specific model considered the peculiarities of the conditions of the laboratory experiment fig 1 in the first model a so called predator prey relationship was assumed where the predators were mycophagous nematodes feeding on soil fungi including fungi of the genus fusarium the model built on general assumptions of the population dynamics of the system components fig 1a was as follows 1 d d t f t β f f t 1 f t θ f γ f n n t f t d d t n t β n n t β f n f t n t μ n n t d d t w t β w w t c w w t θ w γ w f f t a lab specific model that considers the conditions of a laboratory experiment fig 1b was represented by the system 2 d d t f t β f f t 1 f t θ f w t γ f w 2 t f t d d t n t β f n f t n t μ n n t d d t w t β w w t 1 w t θ w in the general model fig 1a fusarium species could increase their biomass regardless of the wheat height and the increase in the abundance of mycophagous nematodes depended on the biomass of fusarium species it was also assumed that the abundance of fusarium species had a negative effect on wheat growth the lab specific model fig 1b considered a number of laboratory conditions including a significant decrease in soil moisture on the 60th day of the experiment caused by a high transpiration rate in grown wheat seedlings it was also assumed that the feeding of mycophagous nematodes on fusarium species did not have a noticeable effect on the biomass of these fungi these assumptions implied the introduction of negative influence of plants on fusarium species and excluded the feedback nematodes fungi from the system the dynamics of plant growth was described using the logistic growth equation the negative influence of plants on the biomass of fusarium species was assumed to be proportional to the square of their height two mathematical models representing systems of non linear ordinary differential equations odes were formulated in accordance with the above schemes the biological meaning of the model parameters is described in tables 1 and 2 the following units of measurement of the model variables were used biomass of fungi of the genus fusarium f a u fppc m 2 number of arbitrary units of fusarium specific polysaccharide protein conjugate per square metre of 3 cm thin soil surface abundance of fungivorous nematodes n ind m 2 number of individuals per square metre of 3 cm thin soil surface height of wheat seedlings w cm 2 4 fitting models to observational data to estimate the parameters of the systems of odes 1 and 2 from the experimental data the maximum likelihood approach ml was used let us denote by y t f t n t w t the vector function of the solution by y j y tj j 1 2 3 4 and tj 0 20 40 60 the vector of data of the laboratory experiment on different days denote by the vector p the vector of parameters of models 1 or 2 since the values of these measurements had a lognormal distribution the probability density function for j th observation can be represented as follows 3 f y j p 1 y j σ 2 π exp ln y j ln y t j p 2 2 σ 2 then the total likelihood function for observations takes the form 4 φ p t j 0 20 40 60 ln y j ln y t j p 2 where 5 φ p t j 0 20 40 60 ln y j ln y t j p 2 here the expression ln y j ln y t j p is calculated as the sum of the differences of the decimal logarithms of the respective components of the vectors y j and y t j p and the variance is assumed to be the same for all data thus the problem of finding the maximum of the likelihood function 4 is reduced to the problem of minimizing the log squares functional 5 while the best estimate of the values of the model parameters corresponds to the minimum of the objective function 5 in the parameter space for the numerical identification of the model parameters the following matlab based the math works inc 2021 algorithms were used 1 the ode15s algorithm for solving the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations shampine and reichelt 1997 and 2 the nelder mead fminsearch method for solving the functional minimization problem lagarias et al 1998 the comparison of the studied models was carried out using the akaike information theoretic criterion 6 a i c 2 n p 2 ln l where n p is the number of model parameters and l is the maximum likelihood function in our case the formula can be rewritten as 7 a i c 2 n p 2 ln i 1 n d 1 y i 2 π σ 2 n d 2 exp φ p o p t 2 σ 2 2 n p 2 ln c 2 ln σ n d φ p o p t σ 2 where the constant 8 c i 1 n d 1 y i 2 π n d 2 does not depend on the choice of the model σ 2 φ p o p t n d is the estimate of the variance of the observation data and nd is the number of observational data 2 5 variation of parameters and global sensitivity analysis to study the sensitivity of the mathematical model to changes in parameters each k th parameter was varied with a step δ p k 0 001 p k in the 0 2 p k interval where p k is the estimated value of the k th parameter of the system of model equations for each parameter p k at each step with fixed optimal values of the remaining parameters a system of differential equations was solved using the ode15s algorithm used shampine and reichelt 1997 a global sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of the parameters of the model on the model variables and rank them according to their significance to this end the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc method was used marino et al 2008 the prcc was computed between two values x j x j and y y as follows 9 x j c 0 p 1 p j k c p x p y b 0 p 1 p j k b p x p where x j and y are rank transformed inputs parameters and output variables of the model for sampling parameter x j j 1 n p the latin hypercube sampling method was used marino et al 2008 this method requires fewer number of computations compared with standard monte carlo sampling parameters of the model were sampled according to the uniform distribution function 2 6 stochastic model in this section we extend the deterministic model in order to examine the impact of stochastic forcing effects by processes which are not explicitly considered in our simplified model description specifically the stochastic modelling i e the application of stochastic differential equations of itό type sdes was performed to check how strongly the observed uncertainties in the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes depend on the random fluctuations in the rates of the interaction between the components of the entire system to this end odes system 1 was transformed to the following sdes form 10 d dt f t β f f t 1 f t θ f γ fn n t f t σ f d w 1 d dt n t β n n t β fn f t n t μ n n t σ n d w 2 d dt w t β w w t c w w t θ w γ wf f t where w 1 and w 2 are standard wiener processes affecting the fluctuations in the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes respectively and σf σn are the intensities of the additive noise in the equations for the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes respectively to compute the trajectories of the sdes model the itoint algorithm from sdeint package was used aburn 2017 this algorithm is implemented in python for each of three response variables with σ f and σ n prescribed ad hoc the average of the random realizations of the model trajectories and their variance nr 100 were calculated for combination of σf and σn values sampled from some range 0 105 after that for each k th combination k 1 35 the relative variance estimates were averaged eq 11 and transformed to 0 1 range eq 12 as follows 11 d k a b s log i 1 3 e s t v a r i c t r l v a r i 3 12 d t r max d k d k max d k where d k is an average estimate of the relative variances for each of k th combination of σ f and σ n e s t v a r i is the stochastic variance of i th response variable on 60th day c t r l v a r i is the experimentally observed variance of i th response variable on 60th day the consistency index of the stochastic variance to experimental variance dtr was used to characterize a quantitative agreement between the model and empirical variances of the system dynamics it transforms to 0 1 range the individual d k values so that the value 1 stands for a perfect consistency the computed set of dtr values were used to find out the optimal combination of σ f and σ n values note that the plant height was a manifest variable that did not impact the interaction dynamics of the fusarium species and mycophagous nematodes and hence the system behaviour by this reason the stochastic perturbation was not added to the equation describing the plant height 3 results 3 1 basic statistical analysis as a result of calculating the kolmogorov smirnov statistics it was found that the addition of both types of detrital subsidies had a statistically insignificant effect on the studied parameters table a 1 due to the absence of statistically significant differences associated with the experimental regimen further modelling was carried out on the general dataset without dividing it into experimental regimens when testing the hypothesis of the normal distribution law using the lilliefors test the critical value of the kolmogorov statistic 0 24 was exceeded for the abundance of nematodes on the 20th day of the experiment and for the height of wheat seedlings on the 40th day of the experiment which was not detected when testing the hypothesis of the log normal distribution law table a 2 as a result a decision was made in favour of the second assumption about the log normal distribution of the data as a result of the application of the bartlett test the null hypothesis of equality of standard deviations during the entire observation period was rejected for the dynamics of the biomass of fusarium species and the height of wheat seedlings since the calculated statistic value was greater than the critical one table a 3 for the abundance of mycophagous nematodes no significant differences were found and for them equality of the mean values was tested using one way analysis of variance since the calculated value of the fisher criterion fk 1 62 turned out to be less than the critical fk 6 59 there was no reason to reject the null hypothesis about the equality of the mean values for abundance of fungi feeding nematodes thus a statistically significant dynamics was noted for the biomass of fusarium species and the height of wheat seedlings 3 2 fitting models to data for the general model the value of the aic coefficient was 16 5 while the value of the aic coefficient of the lab specific model was higher and amounted to 0 03 indicating a greater degree of agreement of the general model as compared to the lab specific one a visual analysis of the trajectories predicted by the models showed that the dynamics of all three components of the model system the biomass of fusarium species the abundance of fungi feeding nematodes and the height of winter wheat seedlings were more consistent for the general model fig 2 a as compared to the lab specific one fig 2b in addition the 95 confidence intervals predicted by the lab specific model for the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the height of winter wheat seedlings were too wide fig 2b fig a 1 eight out of ten parameters of the general model were determined very accurately as they had rather narrow 95 confidence intervals table 1 parameters βn reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes and сw maximum height of wheat seedlings revealed significant uncertainty i e were non identifiable by the data used amongst the seven parameters of the lab specific model only four βf θf γf βw were determined accurately table 2 the other three parameters βfn reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium species μn rate constant of natural death of fungi feeding nematodes and θw maximum height of wheat seedlings showed significant uncertainty 3 3 model sensitivity analysis according to the results of parameter variation the lab specific model of the laboratory experiment was more sensitive to changes in parameters than the general model figs 3 4 the predicted abundance values for at least one of two groups of soil organisms fusarium species or fungi feeding nematodes were sensitive to changes in five parameters β f β f n γ f n μ n and θ f of the general model fig 3 a decrease in the biomass of fusarium species was associated with an increase in the βfn parameter a decrease in the μn parameter as well as a decrease in the θ f parameter fig 3 the deviation in the abundance of mycophagous nematodes had a positive dependence on deviations in the values of the parameters β f β f n and θ f ranging from 50 to 100 of the respective values a negative association of the deviation in the abundance of mycophagous nematodes was noted for the parameters γfn and μn of the general model fig 3 changes in each of the seven parameters of the lab specific model were associated with a significant deviation from the mean of the predicted abundance of at least one of the two considered groups of soil organisms fig 4 a pronounced decrease in the biomass of fusarium species was associated with a decrease in the values of the βf and θf parameters as well as an increase in the values of the γf parameter the dependence of the deviation of the values of the abundance of mycophagous nematodes with varying all parameters of the lab specific model had an exponential form fig 4 in general in both considered models with the same deviation of parameters the amplitude of changes in the abundance in mycophagous nematodes was significantly greater than in fusarium species figs 3 4 based on the results of global sensitivity analysis the prcc values for the general table 3 and lab specific table 4 model parameters were estimated at days 20 40 and 60 separately both the estimated prcc values and the respective p values of almost all parameters of two tested models had similar values between days 20 40 and 60 in the general model the biomass of fusarium species was most associated with μ n β f n and θ f values abundance of fungi feeding nematodes had the highest association with the following parameters β f θ f β f n μ n the wheat height was most associated with γ w f β w μ n and β f n table 3 table a 4 in the lab specific model the biomass of fusarium species was associated significantly with β w γ f θ w and β f values abundance of fungi feeding nematodes had the highest association with β f β fn μ n and γ f values the wheat height was most associated with the following parameters β w θ w and β f table 4 table a 5 based on the results of global sensitivity analysis fig 5 the structure of the relationship between the residuals of partial regression of the most significant model parameters and the two response variables the biomass of fusarium species and the abundance of mycophagous nematodes was very similar to the sensitivity results obtained by parameter variation figs 3 4 3 4 stochastic modelling results comparison of the consistency measures of the stochastic version of the general model calculated for different values of the noise intensity allowed to identify the consistent combination of the noise intensity values as shown in fig 6 a the respective noise intensity in the equations of the biomass of fusarium species σf was 104 while the noise amplitude in the equation for the abundance of mycophagous nematodes σn was 102 the consideration of additive noise in the equations with an optimal combination of the noise intensity parameters in model eq 10 consistently reproduced the observed dynamics of variance of the three studied response variables fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of two developed models the interaction of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in the agroecosystem has a significant but still insufficiently studied effect on other elements of terrestrial ecosystems including the functional state and productivity of cultivated plants köhl et al 2007 kühn and ruess 2021 migunova and sasanelli 2021 as far as we know this work is the first successful attempt to quantitatively analyse using mathematical models the mechanism of control of pathogenic fusarium species by detrital food webs considering the community of soil mycophagous nematodes as a result of comparing the two mathematical models it was shown that the model based on general postulates of population dynamics and not considering the limitations of laboratory conditions fig 1a more accurately describes the studied three component system fig 2 results of sensitivity analysis figs 3 4 confirm a higher robustness level of the general model compared to the lab specific one which manifests itself amongst other things in the greater stability of the response variables when varying individual parameters in turn the consistency of the results of the parameter variation was confirmed by a global sensitivity analysis fig 5 table 3 and 4 comparison of the general and lab specific models allowed us to unravel both the agreement and discrepancy between the data of laboratory observations and theoretical concepts as well as to identify processes significantly affecting the dynamics of winter wheat and its pathogens however since the modelling was based on measurements obtained under laboratory conditions its results should be applied to natural agroecosystems with great care applying of the prcc method that is sensitive to non monotonic dependence between parameter and model variable marino et al 2008 is an another limitation of our study we have implemented a classical approach of mathematical biology to model the dynamics of populations in particular the processes of interaction between winter wheat fusarium species and mycophagous nematodes the obtained ml based solution of the parameter estimation problem allowed to show that including the soil living mycophagous nematodes improved the quality of the model description of the interaction processes between the winter wheat and fusarium species however a number of models have already been published that describe other important mechanisms driving the process of infection of wheat with pathogens in particular based on 3d spatial modelling it was shown that the pathogenicity of zymoseptoria tritici the causative agent of septoria leaves of wheat decreased exponentially with the height of the wheat cultivar vidal et al 2018 the underlying mechanism of this effect was related to the ecological properties of this pathogen the spore carrying droplet trajectories from the infected lower leaves cannot reach and infect upper leaves if the plant is high and the distance between lower and upper leaves is large another way of pathogen control was found by introducing a novel epidemiological model merikanto et al 2017 this model demonstrated that environmentally growing opportunist pathogens can be heavily influenced by outside host natural enemies and this can effectively be utilized in biological control of infectious diseases overall the construction of mathematical models and their calibration made it possible to agree on qualitative ideas about the control parameters of agroecosystem functioning it can be argued with some caution that the initial foundation has been created for the active expansion and development of interdisciplinary research and the implementation of a systems approach to the problems of the controlled functioning of agroecosystems using mathematical methods 4 2 biological interpretation of the optimal model comparison of the observed values and the predictions of the general model fig 2a confirmed our first suggestion data on the abundance of mycophagous nematodes and the growth dynamics of wheat seedlings make it possible to accurately describe the biomass dynamics of fusarium species in soil the obtained results of varying the parameters β f n reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium species and μn rate constant of natural death of fungi feeding nematodes allowed us to propose a mechanistic explanation of the published observations on the ability of soil fungi feeding nematodes to reduce the pathogenic activity of fusarium species goncharov et al 2021 meyer wolfarth et al 2017 wolfarth et al 2015 in addition the sensitivity of changes in the biomass of fusarium species to changes in the values of all parameters of the general model turned out to be significantly lower than in fungi feeding nematodes fig 3 this result is also in good agreement with the data of numerous field trials during which the significant resistance of fusarium species to various types of influences was shown paul et al 2018 smith 2007 despite the fact that fusarium species during the laboratory experiment which served as a data source for modelling were able to parasitize on the roots of winter wheat seedlings goncharov et al 2021 the interaction between the degree of plant development expressed through the parameters β w θ w c w γ w f and the biomass of fusarium species was not significant fig 3 at the same time the abundance of fusarium species was sensitive to the parameters β f n and μ n associated with the dynamics of the abundance of mycophagous nematodes consequently our second suggestion about the greater significance of the dynamics of the growth of wheat seedlings in comparison with the dynamics of the abundance of mycophagous nematodes for describing the dynamics of the biomass of fusarium species was not confirmed a possible explanation for this result is the weak relationship between the height of wheat and the degree of development of its root system ehdaie et al 2012 figueroa bustos et al 2018 on the other hand fusarium species are well known for their low resistance to grazing by soil fauna goncharov et al 2020 including nematodes okada et al 2014 shchukovskaya et al 2014 wolfarth et al 2013 in this case our results allow us to quantify the degree of trophic relationship between soil microorganisms for example fusarium species and microfauna fungi feeding nematodes based on the data on the dynamics of their abundancies fig 3 the stochastic modelling of the random effects in the interaction processes demonstrated much larger magnitude of the resulting variability of fusarium species compared to mycophagous nematodes fig 6 this result is fully consistent with the existing views of the fundamental differences between ecological properties of soil microorganisms including fusarium species and soil animals of the microfauna size group which most mycophagous nematodes belong to indeed both biomass and activity of fusarium species as well as other soil fungi are highly sensitive to a range of biotic and abiotic factors including soil moisture ph temperature nutrients availability grazers activity smith 2007 soil fungi react quickly and strongly to changes in environmental conditions their turnover rate can be shorter that 50 days rousk and bååth 2011 while the characteristic time of a noticeable change in the abundance of soil nematodes in response to changes in environmental conditions is much longer song et al 2016 thus the calculated estimates of the internal processes related variability of the biomass of fusarium species σf 104 nematodes σn 102 and plants σ 0 can serve as the first quantitative insight into the internal variability of these groups and can be used to refine the models describing the functional structure of detrital food webs in agroecosystems de ruiter et al 1994 4 3 extension of the proposed models the results of varying the parameters made it possible to obtain fundamentally new information about the basic mechanisms of interaction of fusarium species mycophagous nematodes and winter wheat plants according to the general model data three parameters were identified that were associated with a significant decrease in the biomass of fusarium species in the soil βfn reproduction rate constant of fungi feeding nematodes due to the feeding on fusarium species μn rate constant of natural death of fungi feeding nematodes and θf carrying capacity constant for fusarium species fig 3 table 3 these results highlight the three most promising mechanisms which can reduce the biomass of fusarium species in the soil the first two are in agreement with the use of soil mycophagous nematodes as control agents for fusarium species and these approaches have already been shown to be effective in laboratory and field conditions shchukovskaya et al 2014 however the application of this approach at a large scale is currently impossible due to the technological limitations of the method the third mechanism for controlling fusarium species in the soil looks very promising which is expressed in the decrease in the values of the parameter θf carrying capacity constant for fusarium species this mechanism underlies the use of existing fungicides against fusarium head blight however due to the significant genetic variability of pathogenic strains of fusarium species the effectiveness of such drugs usually does not exceed 30 40 musyimi et al 2012 riungu et al 2008 sarrocco et al 2013 on the other hand a decrease in the carrying capacity

24491,in the absence of top down and bottom up controls herbivores eventually drive themselves to extinction by exhausting their host plants poorly mobile herbivores may experiment only local disappearance because they can recolonize intact plant patches elsewhere leaving time to previously over exploited patches to regrow however most herbivores such as winged insects are highly mobile which may prevent the formation of spatial heterogeneity we test if long distance dispersal can preclude coexistence using the invasion of box tree moth cydalima perspectalis in europe as a model system we build a lattice model and estimate the parameters with a combination of field measurements experimental data and literature sources space corresponds either to a realistic boxwood landscape in the alps or to theoretical landscapes of various sizes we find that both species persist under a large range of realistic parameter values despite a severe reduction in boxwood biomass with an alternation of outbreaks and near to extinction moth densities large landscapes are necessary for coexistence allowing the formation of spatial structure slow plant regrowth combined with long distance dispersal could drive moths to extinction because of resources depletion at the global scale even without a complete synchronization of the local dynamics the spatial dynamics leads to formation of small plant patches evenly distributed in the landscape because of a combination of local plant dispersal and global indirect competition between plants through their positive effect on moth population size coexistence is favoured by such heterogeneous landscapes because empty patches increase moth mortality during dispersal the system thus creates its own stability conditions msc 00 01 99 00 keywords source sink dynamics green world spatial asynchrony metacommunity invasive species 1 introduction in general most herbivores do not exhaust their resources because they are top down controlled by their predators hairston et al 1960 as well as bottom up limited by the defense compounds and the poor nutritional quality of plants polis 1999 however in some cases such top down and bottom up mechanisms are insufficient to regulate herbivore populations turning the green world to brown in such cases it has been suggested that the spatial dynamics of plant herbivore metacommunities may favour their coexistence wilkinson and sherratt 2016 this hypothesis builds upon long standing theoretical work which has shown that spatial structure promotes the persistence of otherwise unstable prey predator systems hassell et al 1991 comins and hassell 1996 amarasekare 2008 thanks to local extinctions followed by recolonization in line with metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics hanski and gilpin 1997 holyoak et al 2005 these theoretical predictions have received robust empirical support from experiments based on an animal prey predator system taylor 1991 as protists holyoak and lawler 1996 fox et al 2017 and field studies with arthropods nachman 1988 winder et al 2001 however there is little evidence showing that the spatial dynamics resulting from interactions between plants and herbivores leads to a green world or at least to a bi coloured world with green and brown patches many herbivorous insect populations persist thanks to metapopulation dynamics tscharntke and brandl 2004 but this persistence generally relies on other mechanisms than the depletion of plant resources for instance local extinctions can depend on patch size eber and brandl 1996 on plant resources fluctuations but for other reasons than the herbivore itself halley and dempster 1996 or on a combination of ecological succession and catastrophic events stelter et al 1997 in the well studied ragwort cinnabar moth system the moth can locally disappear following defoliation but plant patches persist myers and campbell 1976 myers 1976 although cinnabar moths contribute to local plant extinction local plant persistence ultimately depends on habitat suitability which leads to a source sink dynamic rather than to a classical metapopulation scenario van der meijden 1979 van der meijden and van der veen 1997 moreover the high dispersal ability of cinnabar moths prevents asynchronous local dynamics for the moth which rules out a metapopulation model of coexistence harrison et al 1995 van der meijden and van der veen 1997 as far as we know the only documented plant herbivore system where the plant goes locally extinct due to over exploitation comprises the apiaceae aciphylla dieffenbachii and the monophagous weevil hadramphus spinipennis two species endemic to the chatham islands new zealand increased local weevil densities are associated with local plant extinction schöps 2002 and numerical simulations have shown that spatial structure allows the persistence of the system provided that the dispersal distance of the herbivore is intermediate johst and schöps 2003 however the ecological conditions which promote the persistence of this particular system may not hold for other plant herbivore interactions in particular the weevil h spinipennis is wingless and of a large size which considerably reduces its dispersal ability either by itself by wind or by birds in contrast many insects can disperse over long distances wilson and thomas 2002 gillespie et al 2012 long distance dispersal can promote metapopulation persistence except when strong density dependence triggers local extinctions johst et al 2002 in that case long distance dispersal events synchronize local extinctions which eventually lead to the extinction of the whole metapopulation palmqvist and lundberg 1998 johst et al 2002 in plant herbivore metacommunities strong density dependence occurs when herbivores over exploit their host down to local extinction in order to test if plant herbivore metacommunities can persist despite high abilities of herbivores to disperse we study the system formed by the common european boxwood buxus sempervirens l and the invasive box tree moth cydalima perspectalis walker 1859 lepidoptera crambidae in europe this invasive species first arrived and established in germany in 2006 2007 van der straten and muus 2010 human assisted via the boxwood trade from asia van der straten and muus 2010 kenis et al 2013 bras et al 2019 then the moth rapidly spread over europe blackburn et al 2011 invading almost the entire european buxus range by 2021 as expected nacambo et al 2014 this rapid invasion suggests the occurrence of human mediated and natural long distance dispersal events moreover this species causes severe defoliation mainly because its fecundity is high and the individuals lay masses of eggs directly on the leaves thus defoliation caused by moth larvae can lead to the death of the boxwood especially when the bark is also consumed kenis et al 2013 after this possibly total defoliation boxwood can either grow back or wither completely and die if the defoliation becomes too recurrent or when bark is consumed kenis et al 2013 this harmful impact of the moth may have major economic consequences at long terms mitchell et al 2018 the local extinction of boxwood has already been observed in the nature reserve of grenzach whylen in germany kenis et al 2013 in the meantime the moth goes extinct locally after total defoliation of boxwood stands even if it grows back several years after the moth outbreak within its home range the moth which also consumes boxwood is regulated by its natural enemies wan et al 2014 and no local extinction of either plant and insect species is observed but potential european natural enemies do not significantly alter the invasive moth population dynamics kenis et al 2013 leuthardt and baur 2013 moreover although box trees contain highly toxic alkaloids ahmed et al 1988 loru et al 2000 devkota et al 2008 the moth larvae can sequester them in their body leuthardt et al 2013 thus in absence of top down and bottom up control of this invasive species the question remains will the european boxwood stands remain green in contrast to our system the question does not arise with the ragwort cinnabar and apiaceae weevil systems mentioned earlier since both insects are native and may therefore be top down controlled by local natural enemies however in north america australia and new zealand the ragwort and the cinnabar are both non native thus they are both free of top down and bottom up controls which is also different from our system cabi 2021 metacommunity dynamics with local moth extinctions followed by recolonization may be an alternative mechanism to top down and bottom up control favouring coexistence in europe in the particular context of biological invasions spatial effects have not been widely addressed melbourne et al 2007 although they may favour coexistence the metacommunity mechanism requires spatial heterogeneity among local communities which is likely because of the fairly fragmented distribution of boxwood in europe and because of the temporal shift between different patch invasion as long as the invasion does not start simultaneously in all stands the moth may disperse from its current totally defoliated stand to a green intact stand the defoliated stands may then recover and be recolonized lately thus despite local extinctions and recolonizations local fluctuations may be averaged on a large spatial scale leading to a global stationary regime called statistical stability de roos et al 1991 holyoak et al 2005 amarasekare 2008 however unlike the wingless weevil h spinipennis the highly mobile c perspectalis can fly or be transported by exogenous factors wind human activities bras et al 2019 its high mobility may prevent spatial heterogeneity and therefore precludes coexistence by spatial effects johst et al 2002 johst and schöps 2003 thus at large spatial scale three ecological scenarios are likely to occur first the moth might very quickly overexploit its host causing its own extinction but not the one of its host which in turn slowly grows back second the moth might persist long enough to exhaust its host leading to the disappearance of both species third coexistence might result from the balance between local moth extinctions and recolonizations without complete resource depletion our study focuses on the conditions that favour such coexistence based on the following hypotheses 1 long term coexistence of boxwood and moth is possible at the landscape scale through spatial stabilizing effects 1a those effects rely on asynchronous local dynamics 1b 2 despite cycles of local extinctions and recolonizations the coexistence regime is stationary at the regional scale which corresponds to statistical stability 3 dispersal is double edged very limited dispersal might prevent the colonization of green patches 3a whereas long distance dispersal may synchronize local dynamics 3b 4 the coexistence regime depends on the landscape properties in particular the landscape size and the proportion of boxwood patches in the landscape first larger landscapes favour coexistence 4a secondly the effect of the proportion of boxwood patches is uncertain since it provides more resources to the moth but also favours outbreaks and resource depletion 4b in order to address these four hypotheses we develop a population model dynamics for the boxwood and moth system first a local model reproduces the local invasion dynamics which invariably leads to moth extinction in the field then a spatially explicit model simulates the dynamics of the moth in a landscape our model is calibrated from the literature in situ measures and through mesocosm experimentation 2 study system theoretical model description 2 1 species involved boxwood and box tree moth the box tree moth cydalima perspectalis is an herbivorous lepidoptera belonging to the crambidae family mally and nuss 2010 in europe five to seven larval instars are necessary to the larvae to become pupae for about ten days before emerging as moths kawazu et al 2010 during the winter the larvae are at the beginning of their development in stages two three or even four poitou et al 2020 and form cocoons to enter in hybernaculi nacambo et al 2014 the moths live up to two weeks during which they reproduce and lay eggs on boxwood leaves the moth has a high fecundity rate with between 300 and 400 eggs laid per female in its native range and until 800 eggs in europe in masses of 5 to 30 eggs kawazu et al 2010 wan et al 2014 tabone et al 2015 in asia two to five life cycles generations are possible per year with a break during the winter when the caterpillars are dormant maruyama and shinkaji 1987 1991 in its invasion range in europe the moth completes from 2 in the north to 4 in the south generations per year nacambo et al 2014 göttig 2017 the mean intrinsic dispersal distance of moths has been estimated around ten kilometres per year van der straten and muus 2010 the moth exhibits no preference for any particular boxwood species leuthardt and baur 2013 so the common european boxwood buxus sempervirens is widely consumed as well as caucasus boxwood buxus colchica and even the rarer european species buxus balearica kenis et al 2013 these natural boxwood stands which have already undergone a major decline over the last millennia di domenico et al 2012 are now subject to this additional threat in asia c perspectalis also consumes other species including holly ilex purpurea charcoal euonymus japonicus and e alatus fortunately these species do not seem to be consumed in europe göttig 2017 despite natural regulation by native predators and parasites this moth remains a threat to ornamental boxwood in asia where its potential targets are protected by insecticides wan et al 2014 instead in europe bacillus thuringiensis is commonly used as a sustainable control method however its efficiency is offset by its low persistence and more importantly its wide target range thus current efforts are being made to develop more long term specific treatments biological control solutions are also being explored such as the use of nematodes göttig and herz 2018 and parasites from the genus trichogramma göttig and herz 2016 efforts are also being made to seek out predators and parasites from the box tree moth s area of origin that might act in areas of invasion göttig 2017 the use of pheromone traps is widespread both for monitoring and control santi et al 2015 göttig and herz 2017 but their effectiveness appears to be insufficient at a large scale even if effective control for ornamental boxwood could be introduced natural boxwood and associated ecosystems will likely suffer dramatically from the c perspectalis invasion boxwood has a fairly heterogeneous distribution in europe that consists mainly of small and fragmented stands but some large areas of continuous boxwood occur in the french pyrenees the pre alps and the jura di domenico et al 2012 it is a long lived slow growing shrub that thrives on calcareous substrate it can tolerate a wide gradient of light incidence and can therefore be found in a range of plant communities from canopy areas in heaths to under cover in forests di domenico et al 2012 it can play an important role in structuring ecosystems by trapping sediment and storing water it also influences the establishment and survival of tree species in woodland succession mitchell et al 2018 a total of 286 species are associated with the shrub including 43 fungi that are exclusively observed on boxwood mitchell et al 2018 however boxwood is scarcely predated by native species 2 2 local demographic model we start with a local model that describes the interaction between btm and its host bt at a small homogeneous spatial scale the model projects the population size m of box tree moths btm and the population density of box trees bt which are separated in two variables leaf density l and wood density w from moth generation n to n 1 this time representation is used to avoid the problem of multiple generations per year and its spatial variation however we are able to project the population of btm and bt from year to year if we know the number of generations per year in each specific location we write 1 l n 1 s l μ n f l l n l n r 0 w n w n 1 s w μ n ρ n f w w n ρ n w n m n 1 s m μ n f m m n to indicate that during the projection interval bt and btm grow and reproduce f and survive s the bt reproduction functions were constructed using a ricker model which includes the intrinsic population growth rates r f r w and the carrying capacities of the environment l m a x w m a x while the btm reproduction function is linear and only includes the fecundity of adults f and their survival s the survival of the species is determined by the consumption of leaves and bark by the btm as well as the intraspecific competition for the resource faced by btm the survival and reproduction functions f and s depend on both the current population l w m and the environmental descriptors μ and ρ environmental descriptors the environmental quality is described using the following two quantities μ n f m n α l n and ρ n l n w n the descriptor μ corresponds to the ratio between the number of leaves needed by all the larvae to fulfil their cycle complete development and the number of available leaves α is the amount of leaves needed per larva the number of larvae depends on the number of moths m n through its product by the moth fecundity f and each larva needs α leaves to complete its cycle the ratio μ thus quantifies the pressure for the resource which plays a direct role in the intensity of consumption of leaves and wood and therefore the survival of the larvae the descriptor ρ is the quantity of leaves per unit of wood this represents the level of boxwood defoliation which has an impact on the growth of the wood reproduction the increase in foliage biomass is the result of two processes the growth of leaves f l which depends on the current foliage fig 1 a and the production r 0 of new shoots by the wood after defoliation fig 1 b without herbivory the growth of leaves is limited only by senescence and its carrying capacity l m a x the leaves growth f l is represented by a ricker model of the following form f l l exp r f 1 l l m a x where r f is the intrinsic growth rate of the leaves the wood growth function f w fig 1 c crucially depends on the level of defoliation ρ which induces an allee effect indeed when leaf biomass is large ρ 1 wood grows until it reaches its carrying capacity however after an important defoliation ρ 1 branches or even proportion of trunk die reducing the amount of wood for each projection interval the intrinsic growth rate of the wood is defined as the balance between the production of new wood which critically depends on the density of leaves per unit of wood ρ and the mortality induced by severe defoliation when the density of leaves is large ρ 1 the bt is healthy and its production of wood reaches a maximum conversely when the density of leaves per unit of wood collapses due to severe defoliation the production of wood is low while the mortality increases until a maximum which forces the growth rate to be negative supporting information si for details the reproduction rate of btm fig 1 d does not suffer from density dependence and results from the product of adult fecundity f and adult survival s f m f s survival the leaves may die by senescence at rate v or be consumed by btm at a rate which increases with the pressure of btm on bt μ fig 1 e in the absence of btm 0 of leaves are consumed while if btm have saturated the environment 100 of the leaves are consumed see si for details the wood can suffer from both defoliation fig 1 c which decreases its intrinsic growth rate and bark consumption by the btm fig 1 f the wood mortality due to consumption increases with both the btm pressure μ and the bt health ρ more precisely the wood mortality saturates to d m a x when the foliage is abundant however when the foliage is small the bark consumption occurs while the superficial wood is available thus recently defoliated boxwood with small bark coverage ρ close to 0 cannot be consumed by the larvae see si for details we use a step function which allows to take into account that the consumption of superficial wood depends on the presence of available softwood and thus a certain amount of foliage survival of btm during the larval stage depends mainly on the amount of available resource per larva μ if the larva has enough available resource to complete its six stages it will evolve into a moth at a rate s m m a x while a lack of resource during its growth will cause its death the survival rate also takes into account intraspecific competition for resource caused by interference between the larvae see si for details 2 3 spatially explicit model using the local model which describes the interactions between btm and bt at small homogeneous spatial scale relevant for short time dynamics we build a cellular automaton in order to investigate the btm invasion over a regional heterogeneous landscape and long time scale indeed while the local model evaluates the moth invasion on the scale of a few generations the results with explicit space are obtained with a projection time of 1000 generations i e 500 years in the case of two generations per year landscape french alps and theoretical grid space our spatially explicit model describes the dynamics of the bt and btm on a 2 dimensional landscape composed of two types of cells habitat cells where bt can grow and urban cells where bt cannot establish in each cell with bt btm can mate and lay eggs according to the local demographic model while in cells without bt btm cannot become established after the reproduction phase btm moths disperse over the landscape to find new areas to breed and lay eggs bt can also disperse over the landscape to recolonize extinct areas simulations are initialized with a single moth invading a patch chosen at random and carried out on a maximum of 1000 iterations if no specifications are given we consider two types of landscape a schematic map of the french alps and a theoretical landscape the french alps map was obtained from field observations provided by the national alpine botanical conservatory it is composed of 570 by 351 cells of 29 hectares each about 58 000 km 2 si figure s 1 it should be noted that these data focus on natural boxwood and neglect the presence of ornamental boxwood in urban areas we focus on the french alps because detailed botanical data are available but in theory our model could be extended to the whole area of invasion this landscape allows us to investigate the potential impact of the btm in this region we also consider a more theoretical squared landscape to investigate the effect of the spatial structure on the invasion of the btm in particular we use various initial size and proportion of boxwood patches for each landscape we also calculate an aggregation index by counting the number of pairs adjacent boxwood patches in the landscape and dividing it by the maximum number of possible pairs 2 n 2 n where n is the proportion of boxwood cells harary and harborth 1976 for each landscape size and boxwood proportion we randomly generate 1000 landscapes with possibly different aggregation indices the final aggregation index equals the difference between the index of the landscape of interest and the average index of the randomly generated landscapes dispersal phase of btm we assume that btms disperse as groups of individuals and each dispersal event includes two stages 1 emigrating from birth areas and 2 searching for new areas exploration and settling to breed field observations suggest that the exploration phase is stochastic composed of frequent short distance dispersal by adult flight and rare long distance dispersal by anthropogenic action boxwood trade or long flight in situ experimentation using a flight carousel has provided a mean dispersal distance per individual of 13 km bras et al personal communication which is in accordance with the 10 km dispersal distance observed by van der straten and muus 2010 bras et al have also observed rare long distance flights in their experiments which may correspond to long distance dispersal events that we model using a fat tailed dispersal kernel to this end we use an exponential power distribution from klein et al 2006 which makes it possible to compare different shape of distribution tails while maintaining a fixed average dispersal distance for ecologically realistic calibration the tail shape parameter is 0 5 i e fat tailed dispersal kernel and the average dispersal distance is 25 cells i e 13 km in addition btms disperse as a swarm of 1000 individuals this group dispersal truly differs from classical dispersal where each individual disperses independently this dispersal behaviour may occur because btm can be attracted by volatile boxwood compounds or avoid geographical barriers or are influenced by climate conditions thus during the searching and settling phase each group of btm settles in an area located at a random distance drawn in the exponential power distribution and chosen with a random turning angle run in a uniform distribution over 0 2 π the emigration rate for each location depends on the pressure for resource μ at the birth location as long as pressure remains low the moths have the possibility to find leaves to oviposit in their birth patch and thus dispersal is weak when the resource pressure increases there is not enough boxwood available for laying eggs and adults will disperse massively to another patch in search for resource such resource dependent dispersal has also been modelled by the study of johst and schöps 2003 see si for details dispersal of bt dispersal events for bt include 1 creation of seeds and 2 dispersal of seeds to surrounding areas by wind and birds we assume that bt dispersal is very low and occurs only if the boxwood is in fairly good condition meaning that it has sufficient foliage see si for details as such the initial density of wood in a newly dispersed seedling depends on the parent patch density foliage is produced in the next generation after recolonization through the production of leaves by the wood we assume that seeds from a location are transported randomly only in the 8 surrounding cells that has previously contained bt we only make it possible for an extinct area to be recolonized by surrounding bt and we make it impossible for bt to colonize new areas 3 parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis to quantify the parameters of our model to our system study box tree and box tree moth we use three different methods 1 literature review 2 experimental measurement field data and mesocosm experiment and 3 statistical analysis 3 1 literature review from the recent literature on the box tree moth kawazu et al 2010 wan et al 2014 tabone et al 2015 we can evaluate the fecundity parameters f with a mean value of 120 and a range from 0 i e effects of oophagus predators and parasites to 300 see si for more details in addition the maximum survival rate of the caterpillar is on average 49 then combining experimental results from t defferier and e tabone from the national research institute for agriculture food and environment inrae and slansky jr and scriber 1982 we estimate the parameter α around 0 3 see si for more details from the experimental study of bras 2015 we are able to quantify the average dispersal distance of the btm α d and the tail shape parameter c 3 2 experimental results to assess some parameters describing the interactions between the two species we perform in situ measurements and a mesocosm experiment first we collect data in two boxwood areas located on the eastern slope of the epine massif in savoie 45 38 23 7 n 5 50 43 6 e and 45 41 33 2 n 5 50 56 2 e at an altitude of 500 and 630 m respectively in this area the invasion peak resulting in massive defoliation of the boxwood occurred in july and august 2016 while we sampled in march 2017 from these measurements on already defoliated area we estimate from 101 boxwoods its mortality due to leaves consumption by btm d m a x 0 74 and from 49 boxwoods its shoot production parameter r 0 5 1 0 5 see si for more details on the parameter estimates moreover from dendrometry method and statistical analysis we estimate the maximum growth rate of the wood to r w m a x 0 3 secondly we perform a mescosm experiment to model the consumption of leaves by caterpillars and the caterpillar survival with respect to the descriptor parameter μ we created a gradient for the resource pressure μ by placing varying numbers of caterpillars on the box trees the gradient have seven μ values see si for more details on the experiments and the statistical analysis 3 3 statistical analysis from the local model in order to quantify the other parameters of the model we use our local demographic model field observations show that when the box tree moth colonizes a patch its population explodes within a few generations eventually reaching a peak of density resulting in total defoliation of the boxwood stand hence no more resources are available and the box tree moth disappears from this patch this dynamics lasts for 3 to 4 years after the beginning of the invasion until the extinction of the moth when two generations are carried out per year it corresponds to 6 to 8 generations using statistical analysis we look for parameters that reproduces this qualitative behaviour and achieves plausible quantitative outputs see parameters referred as estimate in table 1 and details in si section s 1 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis first we discuss the outcome of the local demographic model although the moth population collapses for realistic parameter values as expected from the observations figure s 1 in si the model may reach a coexistence equilibrium for some parameter values in particular we look at two key parameters the moth fecundity and moth survival that may vary during the course of the outbreak in europe indeed the accommodation of native predators and parasites could reduce the survival rate of caterpillars and moth fecundity could be reduced by oophagous insects from our local demographic model we show that coexistence is only possible in a very narrow range of parameters values which are far from the actual measured values see figure s 2 in si to go further in the understanding of the coexistence behaviour we look at two connected patches which may favour coexistence in plant insect interactions kang and armbruster 2011 however our numerical simulations show only a slight expansion of the coexistence area which is far from sufficient to lead to coexistence with realistic parameters see figure s 2 in si thus we really need a spatial model to understand the invasion of the btm to further investigate the effect of bt and btm interactions and the robustness of the spatially explicit model we conduct a global sensitivity analysis of three outcomes of our model the boxwood biomass the percentage of dead boxwood cells and the probability of moth persistence for each outcomes we use the partial rank correlation coefficients prcc saltelli et al 2004 to quantify the strength of sensitivity for each of the 21 parameters and the direction of their impact on the model outcomes if the prcc is positive the parameter increases the outcome while it decreases for negative prcc we sample parameters in a wide range centred on the reference values of table 1 that remains ecologically coherent e g boxwood growth is slow we use 1786 values sampled around the reference values of table 1 for each parameter and 10 replicates per parameter values to compute the prcc see section s 4 and figure s 9 for more details and global sensitivity results 4 modelling results and discussion 4 1 spatial structure promotes coexistence while resource depletion drives to extinction hyp 1 using a spatially explicit model including local population dynamics and short to long range dispersal events we show that coexistence of the moth boxwood system occurs across a wide range of parameters at a regional scale dispersal allows box tree moth persistence in a cycle outbreak dynamic berryman 1987 through recurrent recolonization of patches that have been previously defoliated and which have had time to recover the spatial structure therefore allows coexistence in line with hypothesis 1a the coexistence mechanism is similar to the rock paper scissors game with the corresponding states patches of defoliated box tree patches of box tree with foliage and patches of box tree invaded by the moth these three states compete with each other following a circular hierarchy as defoliated box trees lose against box trees with foliage which are in turn invaded by box tree moths which finally leads to defoliated box trees similar rock paper scissors games have been described in other ecological contexts such as polymorphic bacterial strains kerr et al 2002 and plant mutualist exploiter systems szilágyi et al 2009 the sensitivity analysis si figure s 9 reveals that fecundity and survival of the box tree moth significantly reduce its persistence over the landscape thus we explore moth persistence over a larger range of fecundity and survival parameters than those estimated predation on the moth and on the caterpillars is currently low kenis et al 2013 in part because the box tree moth accumulates boxwood alkaloids in its body leuthardt and baur 2013 however native predators may become efficient to feed on the moth following phenotypic plasticity or adaptation carlsson et al 2009 native egg parasites like trichograms often used in biological control may also become able to feed on the moth thereby reducing its fecundity we find that the moth could rapidly go extinct only for very low fecundity and survival rates lower left corners of fig 2 a and f it is therefore unlikely that the accommodation of native natural enemies will trigger moth extinction elevation can also have an important influence on larvae survival and fecundity via egg survival as well as on the nutritional quality of the boxwood that controls larvae growth however we show that elevation does not change qualitatively the outcomes of the model even if it reduces the above mentioned parameters by 50 si figure s 4 since temperature may also modify larvae survival and fecundity suppo et al 2020 its effect should be similar to elevation because these parameters are correlated in addition temperature might increase the number of generations per year suppo et al 2020 this should increase the asynchrony between patches which is known to favour the coexistence of the system lastly the sensitivity analysis shows that moth persistence is significantly impacted by the boxwood productivity and survival si figure s 9 thus environmental changes induced by human exploitation climate changes or boxwood parasites should have a critical impact on the btm persistence through its effect on boxwood at local and global scale one step further hypothesis 1b postulates that long term coexistence is due to asynchronous dynamics and that moth extinction is due to the synchronization of the local dynamics if we artificially ensure that the invasion begins with a moth in each cell we observe that all boxwood stands are defoliated simultaneously and that the moth disappears globally in a dynamic of type pulse outbreak berryman 1987 perfect synchronization indeed leads to moth extinction but if all stands are initially invaded except a single one this is enough for the occurrence of desynchronization and the whole system becomes viable the asynchrony of the system results from the dispersal behaviour of moths on the one hand moths only leave severely defoliated areas which increases fragmentation of resources and on the other hand the frequency of long distance dispersal events also enhances fragmentation of resources see si fig s6 bottom these mechanisms enhance asynchronous dynamics of the system the moth can therefore disappear due to perfect synchronization with 100 of the patches invaded simultaneously however any other mechanism that globally reduces drastically the resources may also cause moth extinction indeed with high moth fecundity and survival rates upper right corners of fig 2 a and f the moth depletes the resource until its own extinction this negative effect of fecundity and survival of the btm was expected from the sensitivity analysis see f and s m a x in si figure s 9 in contrast to the results obtained with h spinipennis a dieffenbachii system our results indicate that global resource depletion is responsible for moth extinction rather than synchronization of local dynamics johst and schöps 2003 this is in line with the individual based model of uchmański 2019 who found that forest insect pests may go extinct when adult fecundity or larvae survival increase within the coexistence regime the average density of moths and the average intensity of the invasion are insensitive to moth fecundity and survival the moth either persists at the coexistence density or goes extinct fig 2 interestingly the moth population can persist even when it periodically invades 99 of the patches si figure s 5 top right provided that leaves grow back fast enough to prevent global resource depletion in this case moths invade a significant proportion of the patches even during troughs about 12 the cyclic dynamics are therefore getting closer to a permanent outbreak berryman 1987 the same process occurred in the model of uchmański 2019 where leaf growth rate was expressed by a parameter defining the number of years needed for their regeneration in his model when the leaf growth rate increased the dynamics of the cyclic outbreak was accelerated with shorter periods between peaks and troughs the system then transited to a permanent outbreak for very rapid leaf growth rates furthermore in our model a slow leaf growth rate also leads to the extinction of the insects see si figure s 5 left more generally we show that parameters improving bt survival or productivity such as wood survival or leaf productivity have a positive effect on persistence of the moth see si figure s 5 and figure s 9 however these parameters always reduce the biomass of bt over the landscape and enhance the periodic occurrence of severe outbreaks as a result we show that increasing bt survival or productivity strengthens the global instability and produces a more fragmented resource landscape 4 2 spatial structure generates periodical invasions hyp 2 we further postulate that despite local cycles of extinction and recolonization the coexistence regime is stationary at the landscape scale hypothesis 2 a phenomenon called statistical stability de roos et al 1991 holyoak et al 2005 amarasekare 2008 instead we find that the coexistence regime is periodic at the landscape scale fig 3 a a similar pattern has been observed in the h spinipennis a dieffenbachii system johst and schöps 2003 and in uchmański 2019 the global period ranges between 20 generations high leaf growth rate si figure s 8 top and 40 generations low leaf growth rate si figure s 8 bottom in contrast the invasion of a local patch lasts 5 generations when 1000 moths are introduced at once and 7 generations when a single moth colonizes the patch si figure s 5 this discrepancy between the local and global timescales suggests that periodicity at the global scale results from the combination of the local time scale and the pace of dispersal during peaks between 60 and 99 of the boxwood patches are simultaneously invaded by the moth and 1 5 during periods of minimal abundance depending on parameter values periodic travelling waves explain this pattern which have been described in prey predator systems lambin et al 1998 sherratt 2001 however such prey predator systems are locally periodic as well and long term coexistence does not require spatial structure in contrast in our study system the periodic waves emerge from the spatial structure instead of being a mere consequence of local periodicity in the context of a tritrophic model of the larch budmoth zeiraphera diniana with cyclic population dynamics johnson et al 2006 showed that over compensatory density dependence produces recurrent travelling waves in high connectivity habitats aggregated around a single focus however in this context the landscape is fixed and the local dynamics of the population is cyclic while in our model the resource landscape can change due to the plant herbivore dynamics and the local dynamics drives the moth to extinction if the mean dispersal distance is very low 1 cell on average keeping rare long distance events the amplitude of the oscillations is also very low fig 4 b and the system tends to be statistically stable 4 3 intermediate intensity of long distance dispersal prevents btm from extinction hypothesis 3 posits that asynchronous local dynamics require intermediate dispersal distance myers 1976 myers and campbell 1976 because very limited dispersal might prevent suitable boxwood patches from colonization 3a whereas very long distance dispersal may synchronize local dynamics 3b the sensitivity analysis reveals that the moth persistence significantly decreases with an increase of migration parameters i e m w m a x and α d migration rate including mortality during dispersal and mean dispersal distance si figure s 9 however with the measured parameter values we find that the long term probability of moth persistence is insensitive to dispersal distance this is shown in fig 4 a where the measured value for the production of new leaves from wood after total defoliation r 0 equals 5 1 0 3 2 3 on a log scale in that case the moths persist whatever the mean dispersal distance is 1 25 or 70 cells because boxwood produces new shoots after total defoliation fast enough to enable moth persistence even when the global leaf biomass is low meanwhile previously infected areas produce enough leaves to support another moth outbreak conversely when r 0 equals 2 1 0 3 2 7 on a log scale which may happen under climatic stress for instance it turns out that the moth does not persist when the mean dispersal distance equals 70 cells fig 3 b the moth initially invades 99 of the patches fig 3 c and reaches very high densities fig 3 d this reduces the global leaf biomass fig 3 e and the moth eventually collapses due to resource depletion in the case of coexistence fig 3 a the maximal of invaded patches is around 60 70 the maximal moth density is 3 times lower and the minimal leaf biomass is 5 times higher than in the extinction case we also find that when the mean dispersal distance is very short 1 cell on average the probability of moth persistence is not affected by the offshoot production rate because of short distance dispersal the moth does not generate periods of global invasion and intact patches are always present at the border of its slow moving invasion front in that case relatively high offshoot production rates are unnecessary as the moth populations do not rely on the new growth of recently defoliated patches in contrast when the average dispersal distance is larger e g 25 and 70 cells the probability of persistence increases with the offshoot production rate fig 4 a in such cases the moth needs to recolonize recently defoliated patches because during peaks a large proportion of patches are defoliated at the same time therefore relatively high offshoot production rates are necessary to avoid global over exploitation the influence of the mean dispersal distance on moth persistence is therefore studied with a relatively low offshoot production rate r 0 2 1 0 3 as expected by hypothesis 3b frequent long distance dispersal events lead to the extinction of the moth due to global resource depletion fig 4 b continuous line this effect of long distance dispersal was not present in uchmański 2019 this can be explained to the use of a thin tailed gaussian kernel characterized by very rare long distance dispersal events thus insect pests could not reach the distant trees which had time to regenerate after their last defoliation although the frequency of long distance dispersal events accelerates the spreading speed of propagation of the invasion fayard et al 2009 garnier 2011 we show that it truly impacts the persistence of the plant herbivore system furthermore hypothesis 3a posits that the moth goes extinct in the case of limited dispersal because it would not be able to escape over exploited patches however the fat tailed dispersal kernel prevents this phenomenon even when the mean dispersal distance is very low 1 cell the moth can persist thanks to relatively rare but still frequent enough long distance dispersal events things change when we constrain dispersal to a uniform distribution which ranges between 1 cell and a given maximum of cells in that case when the maximum number of cells is low enough up to 4 cells the moth invasion can get stuck in a landscape dead end and it disappears because of local resource depletion and not global resource depletion fig 4 b dotted line prey predator systems subject to limit cycles were also stabilized by limited dispersal in the individual based model of cuddington and yodzis 2000 where limited dispersal reduced the average predation rate and thereby avoided local instability however if dispersal is too limited the consumer can go extinct because of a drastic reduction in the rate of predation as is the case in our model when long distance dispersal events are extremely rare due to uniform dispersal kernel fig 4 b dotted line the results obtained using the fat tailed dispersal seems the most plausible indeed long distance dispersal events mediated either by wind or by human dispersal likely occur in the case of the box tree moth with a fat tailed dispersal kernel multiple invasion fronts are created far away from invaded patches because long distance dispersal events are frequent shaw 1995 this created a fragmented landscape of defoliated and intact boxwood in which the moth does not end up in a dead end such a fragmented invasion front can be observed in europe the moth was first observed in germany in 2006 2007 in the same year it spread to switzerland and the netherlands and reach france feldtrauer et al 2009 and the united kingdom salisbury et al 2012 in 2008 austria in 2009 italy bella 2013 in 2010 and portugal iran and armenia in 2016 bras et al 2019 long distance dispersal might be due to the boxwood trade between european countries and probably to a much lesser extent by the natural dispersal of moths we therefore expect that in practise only frequent long distance dispersal can lead to the extinction of the moth due to global resource depletion this mechanism is enhanced by the dispersal behaviour of the moths since moths disperse as swarms and only leave severely defoliated environments they put a strong pressure on the local environment increasing the extinction probability of the system in the context of a metapopulation these group dispersal behaviours are also known to threaten persistence because it decreases the proportion of occupied cells ray et al 1991 anderson et al 2009 jenouvrier et al 2017 however this prediction might be mitigated by a dispersal cost resulting from higher mortality encountered during a long distance flight a fertility decline with flight distance or even delayed mating effect that reduces the fitness of moth dispersing at long distance indeed those mechanisms tends to reduce the high invasion potential of the long distance dispersal events by limiting the effective dispersal distance and our model already shows that moth persistence is higher with intermediate distance dispersal moreover these ecological processes are unlikely to reduce dispersal to the extreme case of a uniform distribution at short distances and therefore do not significantly affect the persistence of the box tree moth indeed we show that a reduction of the swarm size with dispersal distance gives qualitatively unchanged results on the moth persistence si figure s 4 4 4 fragmented landscape with low amount of resource prevents extinction hyp 4 next we predict that the coexistence regime depends on the landscape characteristics in particular its size 4a and the proportion of suitable boxwood patches 4b to do so we use wrapped landscapes with no edge effect of different sizes and different proportions of randomly distributed suitable patches fig 5 a below 200 200 cells which corresponds to about 12 000 km 2 coexistence does not occur within the realistic range of parameter values because previously defoliated patches are quickly recolonized by the moth and lack time to grow back this induces a global resource collapse and drives the moth to extinction above the 200 200 threshold the larger the landscape is the more likely the coexistence occurs in line with hypothesis 4a in the previous sections we restrict our model to the french alps but we expect that long term coexistence is even more likely on the european scale because larger landscapes favour coexistence the influence of landscape size is also apparent in the real landscape with a uniform and short range dispersal kernel when the invasion begins in a relatively isolated area of the landscape coexistence is impaired by small size a priori the effect of the initial proportion of boxwood patches on coexistence is unclear 4b because on the one hand a higher proportion of suitable patches provides more resources to the moths while on the other hand it may trigger moth outbreaks which ultimately leads to resource depletion we find that the latter mechanism is on the driver s seat reducing the proportion of boxwood patches increases the probability of moth persistence fig 5 a more precisely the landscapes larger than 400 400 cells filled with less than 20 of boxwood patches almost always allow coexistence in such cases most dispersal events fail to find suitable patches lowering the moth population density which in turn leaves more time for leaves to grow back on the contrary a high proportion of suitable patches results in high moth densities which leads to global over exploitation despite a potentially higher leaf biomass thus we postulate that any environmental changes due to climate changes or human activities that reduces boxwood biomass would not necessarily drive the btm towards extinction the coexistence regime has interesting consequences on the final proportion of boxwood patches which corresponds to the initial proportion minus the proportion of complete withering patches due to over exploitation under coexistence the final proportion increases linearly with the initial proportion with a weak slope of about 0 1 whereas the slope is close to 1 in the case of moth extinction fig 5 b this indicates that the local extinction of boxwood patches is not responsible for global moth extinction instead the final proportion of boxwood patches is a long term consequence of coexistence and results from their gradual death fig 5 c during each moth outbreak a small proportion of the boxwood patches disappears due to over exploitation then right after the outbreak a few boxwood patches are recolonized from neighbouring patches only previously occupied patches can be recolonized which induces a clustered distribution of the boxwood patches as a result of clustering the aggregation index is always positive which indicates that the landscapes created by long term coexistence are more aggregated than random landscapes boxwood patches relatively isolated in the initial landscape experience larger extinction rates and create holes in the landscape in contrast areas where boxwood patches are initially more abundant persist more often which creates clusters moreover the aggregation increases with the average moth dispersal distance fig 5 d boxwood patches favour moth outbreaks increasing the boxwood patches proportion over the landscape produces severe outbreaks this induces apparent competition between boxwood patches because of their shared pest with low dispersal distance apparent competition between patches is mainly local which limits the formation of clusters instead with high dispersal distance apparent competition is global and the aggregated pattern results from the interplay between local facilitation recolonization of boxwood patches is purely local and global competition as in many spatially self structured systems kéfi et al 2007 2008 this is confirmed by simulations where boxwood recolonization is global in that case the aggregation process vanishes details not shown we further explore how the aggregation process creates boxwood clusters of different sizes for various dispersal distance to do so we start with landscapes which are initially filled with boxwood patches and run simulations after invasion by the moth at the end of the simulations we fit a power law model to the final distribution of the cluster sizes si figure s 6 top clusters smaller than 5 boxwood patches are excluded from the fit we find that small dispersal distance leads to a cluster size distribution closer to a power law than large dispersal distance when the dispersal distance is large 10 to 50 cells the cluster size distribution follows a truncated power law si figure s 6 top which indicates that large clusters are under represented large dispersal distance leads to an increase of herbivory which produces two distinct effects on the one hand it favours aggregation due to global apparent competition as discussed earlier fig 5 d on the other hand it increases the death rate of boxwood patches and thus reduces the final proportion of patches in the landscape fig 5 e this is why under large dispersal distance 10 to 50 cells the final landscapes has a fragmented aspect of equally spaced small clusters si figure s 6 bottom these regular patterns are similar to turing instabilities turing 1990 murray 2001 and result from scale dependent feedbacks which combine short distance positive feedbacks and long distance negative feedbacks rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 in the present case short distance positive feedback correspond to local facilitation of boxwood due to recruitment while apparent competition between boxwood stands because of their shared pest mirror long distance negative feedbacks several studies have investigated how spatial patterns can emerge from such scale dependent feedbacks in a variety of ecological scenarios such as plant water interactions klausmeier 1999 von hardenberg et al 2001 rietkerk et al 2002 meron et al 2004 kéfi et al 2010 plant plant interactions lejeune et al 1999 or predator prey interactions levin and segel 1976 solé and bascompte 2012 it has been shown that such spatial patterns emerge in predator prey systems when the predator has a larger dispersal capacity than the prey gurney et al 1998 de roos et al 1998 although our model differs from the classical predator prey model due to the presence of an allee effect for the prey cantrell and cosner 2004 we demonstrate that spatial patterns emerge from similar mechanisms in our context of a plant herbivore system 4 5 implications for management first the most important finding for management purposes is that the moth heavily impacts boxwood stands with the estimated parameter values we find that in the study area only 10 of the initial boxwood biomass remains after invasion fig 2 b and that 50 of the original boxwood patches completely disappear fig 2 c which represents 2414 square kilometres in the french alps however these quantitative predictions should be taken with caution in particular the sensitivity analysis si figure s 9 shows that the characteristics of boxwood are determining factors in the model so a better understanding of the biology of boxwood and its response to defoliation seems essential to gain further insights into the impact of the box tree moth invasion under low moth fecundity and high caterpillar survival the moths could persist longer in heavily defoliated patches the severe decrease in box tree biomass can impact the many species associated with boxwood as well as the ecosystem services provided by the shrub i e sediment trapping and water storage mitchell et al 2018 in stands where boxwood is severely weakened or extinguished recolonization by neighbouring patches may be prevented by pioneer plants potentially other invasive species such as buddleja davidii or ailanthus altissima in a kind of invasion meltdown process simberloff and von holle 1999 next the periodic invasion dynamics can lead to confusion regarding the persistence of the box tree moth a period of low overall abundance should not be confused with a decrease in invasion and moth control methods should take periodic invasion dynamics into account remote sensing methods may be appropriate in order to detect the few boxwood stands that provide refuge under low moth abundance kerr and ostrovsky 2003 we suggest that detecting stands of undefoliated boxwood that allow moth persistence during a period of low abundance could provide an interesting management strategy since control efforts could be increased on these particular patches finally management actions might consider preventing anthropogenic long distance dispersal however we find that only very limited dispersal could lead to moth extinction which occurs with a uniform distribution of dispersal events of no more than 4 cells fig 4 b dotted line as soon as dispersal is higher the moth could escape dead ends in the landscape and therefore persists even if anthropogenic long distance dispersal is prevented a few natural long distance dispersal events might ensure moth persistence it is therefore unlikely that management actions limiting dispersal can be able to eradicate the moth however such actions can reduce the impact on boxwood stands since we find that long distance dispersal increases the extinction rate of boxwood patches fig 5 e three scenarios may occur after the invasion of box tree moth in europe extinction of both species extinction of the moth only or coexistence our theoretical approach combined with field and experimental data suggests that coexistence is the most likely outcome with cycles of moth outbreaks and crashes coexistence comes along with a severe reduction of boxwood biomass at the landscape scale boxwood stands may therefore become closer to brown than green moth extinction can also occur which indicates that the invasion dynamics of exotic pests can be mitigated even in the absence of predators and effective plant defenses we further show that plant herbivore coexistence through spatial effects does not require poorly mobile wingless species as in our model a wide range of dispersal values result in coexistence coexistence occurs in large landscapes long distance dispersal thus requires a spatial scaling up for the persistence of the system particularly intense long distance dispersal nevertheless leads to herbivore extinction provided that plant grows back slowly in that case the herbivore depletes its resources at the global scale which leads to its own extinction even without a complete synchronization of the local dynamics finally coexistence is easier in patchy landscapes because unsuitable patches increase moth mortality during dispersal and thereby reduce the global insect population size interestingly when plants disperse locally the spatial dynamics of the system lead to the formation of such a patchy landscape with relatively small plant patches evenly distributed in the landscape the system thus creates its own stability conditions credit authorship contribution statement léo ledru developed

24491,in the absence of top down and bottom up controls herbivores eventually drive themselves to extinction by exhausting their host plants poorly mobile herbivores may experiment only local disappearance because they can recolonize intact plant patches elsewhere leaving time to previously over exploited patches to regrow however most herbivores such as winged insects are highly mobile which may prevent the formation of spatial heterogeneity we test if long distance dispersal can preclude coexistence using the invasion of box tree moth cydalima perspectalis in europe as a model system we build a lattice model and estimate the parameters with a combination of field measurements experimental data and literature sources space corresponds either to a realistic boxwood landscape in the alps or to theoretical landscapes of various sizes we find that both species persist under a large range of realistic parameter values despite a severe reduction in boxwood biomass with an alternation of outbreaks and near to extinction moth densities large landscapes are necessary for coexistence allowing the formation of spatial structure slow plant regrowth combined with long distance dispersal could drive moths to extinction because of resources depletion at the global scale even without a complete synchronization of the local dynamics the spatial dynamics leads to formation of small plant patches evenly distributed in the landscape because of a combination of local plant dispersal and global indirect competition between plants through their positive effect on moth population size coexistence is favoured by such heterogeneous landscapes because empty patches increase moth mortality during dispersal the system thus creates its own stability conditions msc 00 01 99 00 keywords source sink dynamics green world spatial asynchrony metacommunity invasive species 1 introduction in general most herbivores do not exhaust their resources because they are top down controlled by their predators hairston et al 1960 as well as bottom up limited by the defense compounds and the poor nutritional quality of plants polis 1999 however in some cases such top down and bottom up mechanisms are insufficient to regulate herbivore populations turning the green world to brown in such cases it has been suggested that the spatial dynamics of plant herbivore metacommunities may favour their coexistence wilkinson and sherratt 2016 this hypothesis builds upon long standing theoretical work which has shown that spatial structure promotes the persistence of otherwise unstable prey predator systems hassell et al 1991 comins and hassell 1996 amarasekare 2008 thanks to local extinctions followed by recolonization in line with metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics hanski and gilpin 1997 holyoak et al 2005 these theoretical predictions have received robust empirical support from experiments based on an animal prey predator system taylor 1991 as protists holyoak and lawler 1996 fox et al 2017 and field studies with arthropods nachman 1988 winder et al 2001 however there is little evidence showing that the spatial dynamics resulting from interactions between plants and herbivores leads to a green world or at least to a bi coloured world with green and brown patches many herbivorous insect populations persist thanks to metapopulation dynamics tscharntke and brandl 2004 but this persistence generally relies on other mechanisms than the depletion of plant resources for instance local extinctions can depend on patch size eber and brandl 1996 on plant resources fluctuations but for other reasons than the herbivore itself halley and dempster 1996 or on a combination of ecological succession and catastrophic events stelter et al 1997 in the well studied ragwort cinnabar moth system the moth can locally disappear following defoliation but plant patches persist myers and campbell 1976 myers 1976 although cinnabar moths contribute to local plant extinction local plant persistence ultimately depends on habitat suitability which leads to a source sink dynamic rather than to a classical metapopulation scenario van der meijden 1979 van der meijden and van der veen 1997 moreover the high dispersal ability of cinnabar moths prevents asynchronous local dynamics for the moth which rules out a metapopulation model of coexistence harrison et al 1995 van der meijden and van der veen 1997 as far as we know the only documented plant herbivore system where the plant goes locally extinct due to over exploitation comprises the apiaceae aciphylla dieffenbachii and the monophagous weevil hadramphus spinipennis two species endemic to the chatham islands new zealand increased local weevil densities are associated with local plant extinction schöps 2002 and numerical simulations have shown that spatial structure allows the persistence of the system provided that the dispersal distance of the herbivore is intermediate johst and schöps 2003 however the ecological conditions which promote the persistence of this particular system may not hold for other plant herbivore interactions in particular the weevil h spinipennis is wingless and of a large size which considerably reduces its dispersal ability either by itself by wind or by birds in contrast many insects can disperse over long distances wilson and thomas 2002 gillespie et al 2012 long distance dispersal can promote metapopulation persistence except when strong density dependence triggers local extinctions johst et al 2002 in that case long distance dispersal events synchronize local extinctions which eventually lead to the extinction of the whole metapopulation palmqvist and lundberg 1998 johst et al 2002 in plant herbivore metacommunities strong density dependence occurs when herbivores over exploit their host down to local extinction in order to test if plant herbivore metacommunities can persist despite high abilities of herbivores to disperse we study the system formed by the common european boxwood buxus sempervirens l and the invasive box tree moth cydalima perspectalis walker 1859 lepidoptera crambidae in europe this invasive species first arrived and established in germany in 2006 2007 van der straten and muus 2010 human assisted via the boxwood trade from asia van der straten and muus 2010 kenis et al 2013 bras et al 2019 then the moth rapidly spread over europe blackburn et al 2011 invading almost the entire european buxus range by 2021 as expected nacambo et al 2014 this rapid invasion suggests the occurrence of human mediated and natural long distance dispersal events moreover this species causes severe defoliation mainly because its fecundity is high and the individuals lay masses of eggs directly on the leaves thus defoliation caused by moth larvae can lead to the death of the boxwood especially when the bark is also consumed kenis et al 2013 after this possibly total defoliation boxwood can either grow back or wither completely and die if the defoliation becomes too recurrent or when bark is consumed kenis et al 2013 this harmful impact of the moth may have major economic consequences at long terms mitchell et al 2018 the local extinction of boxwood has already been observed in the nature reserve of grenzach whylen in germany kenis et al 2013 in the meantime the moth goes extinct locally after total defoliation of boxwood stands even if it grows back several years after the moth outbreak within its home range the moth which also consumes boxwood is regulated by its natural enemies wan et al 2014 and no local extinction of either plant and insect species is observed but potential european natural enemies do not significantly alter the invasive moth population dynamics kenis et al 2013 leuthardt and baur 2013 moreover although box trees contain highly toxic alkaloids ahmed et al 1988 loru et al 2000 devkota et al 2008 the moth larvae can sequester them in their body leuthardt et al 2013 thus in absence of top down and bottom up control of this invasive species the question remains will the european boxwood stands remain green in contrast to our system the question does not arise with the ragwort cinnabar and apiaceae weevil systems mentioned earlier since both insects are native and may therefore be top down controlled by local natural enemies however in north america australia and new zealand the ragwort and the cinnabar are both non native thus they are both free of top down and bottom up controls which is also different from our system cabi 2021 metacommunity dynamics with local moth extinctions followed by recolonization may be an alternative mechanism to top down and bottom up control favouring coexistence in europe in the particular context of biological invasions spatial effects have not been widely addressed melbourne et al 2007 although they may favour coexistence the metacommunity mechanism requires spatial heterogeneity among local communities which is likely because of the fairly fragmented distribution of boxwood in europe and because of the temporal shift between different patch invasion as long as the invasion does not start simultaneously in all stands the moth may disperse from its current totally defoliated stand to a green intact stand the defoliated stands may then recover and be recolonized lately thus despite local extinctions and recolonizations local fluctuations may be averaged on a large spatial scale leading to a global stationary regime called statistical stability de roos et al 1991 holyoak et al 2005 amarasekare 2008 however unlike the wingless weevil h spinipennis the highly mobile c perspectalis can fly or be transported by exogenous factors wind human activities bras et al 2019 its high mobility may prevent spatial heterogeneity and therefore precludes coexistence by spatial effects johst et al 2002 johst and schöps 2003 thus at large spatial scale three ecological scenarios are likely to occur first the moth might very quickly overexploit its host causing its own extinction but not the one of its host which in turn slowly grows back second the moth might persist long enough to exhaust its host leading to the disappearance of both species third coexistence might result from the balance between local moth extinctions and recolonizations without complete resource depletion our study focuses on the conditions that favour such coexistence based on the following hypotheses 1 long term coexistence of boxwood and moth is possible at the landscape scale through spatial stabilizing effects 1a those effects rely on asynchronous local dynamics 1b 2 despite cycles of local extinctions and recolonizations the coexistence regime is stationary at the regional scale which corresponds to statistical stability 3 dispersal is double edged very limited dispersal might prevent the colonization of green patches 3a whereas long distance dispersal may synchronize local dynamics 3b 4 the coexistence regime depends on the landscape properties in particular the landscape size and the proportion of boxwood patches in the landscape first larger landscapes favour coexistence 4a secondly the effect of the proportion of boxwood patches is uncertain since it provides more resources to the moth but also favours outbreaks and resource depletion 4b in order to address these four hypotheses we develop a population model dynamics for the boxwood and moth system first a local model reproduces the local invasion dynamics which invariably leads to moth extinction in the field then a spatially explicit model simulates the dynamics of the moth in a landscape our model is calibrated from the literature in situ measures and through mesocosm experimentation 2 study system theoretical model description 2 1 species involved boxwood and box tree moth the box tree moth cydalima perspectalis is an herbivorous lepidoptera belonging to the crambidae family mally and nuss 2010 in europe five to seven larval instars are necessary to the larvae to become pupae for about ten days before emerging as moths kawazu et al 2010 during the winter the larvae are at the beginning of their development in stages two three or even four poitou et al 2020 and form cocoons to enter in hybernaculi nacambo et al 2014 the moths live up to two weeks during which they reproduce and lay eggs on boxwood leaves the moth has a high fecundity rate with between 300 and 400 eggs laid per female in its native range and until 800 eggs in europe in masses of 5 to 30 eggs kawazu et al 2010 wan et al 2014 tabone et al 2015 in asia two to five life cycles generations are possible per year with a break during the winter when the caterpillars are dormant maruyama and shinkaji 1987 1991 in its invasion range in europe the moth completes from 2 in the north to 4 in the south generations per year nacambo et al 2014 göttig 2017 the mean intrinsic dispersal distance of moths has been estimated around ten kilometres per year van der straten and muus 2010 the moth exhibits no preference for any particular boxwood species leuthardt and baur 2013 so the common european boxwood buxus sempervirens is widely consumed as well as caucasus boxwood buxus colchica and even the rarer european species buxus balearica kenis et al 2013 these natural boxwood stands which have already undergone a major decline over the last millennia di domenico et al 2012 are now subject to this additional threat in asia c perspectalis also consumes other species including holly ilex purpurea charcoal euonymus japonicus and e alatus fortunately these species do not seem to be consumed in europe göttig 2017 despite natural regulation by native predators and parasites this moth remains a threat to ornamental boxwood in asia where its potential targets are protected by insecticides wan et al 2014 instead in europe bacillus thuringiensis is commonly used as a sustainable control method however its efficiency is offset by its low persistence and more importantly its wide target range thus current efforts are being made to develop more long term specific treatments biological control solutions are also being explored such as the use of nematodes göttig and herz 2018 and parasites from the genus trichogramma göttig and herz 2016 efforts are also being made to seek out predators and parasites from the box tree moth s area of origin that might act in areas of invasion göttig 2017 the use of pheromone traps is widespread both for monitoring and control santi et al 2015 göttig and herz 2017 but their effectiveness appears to be insufficient at a large scale even if effective control for ornamental boxwood could be introduced natural boxwood and associated ecosystems will likely suffer dramatically from the c perspectalis invasion boxwood has a fairly heterogeneous distribution in europe that consists mainly of small and fragmented stands but some large areas of continuous boxwood occur in the french pyrenees the pre alps and the jura di domenico et al 2012 it is a long lived slow growing shrub that thrives on calcareous substrate it can tolerate a wide gradient of light incidence and can therefore be found in a range of plant communities from canopy areas in heaths to under cover in forests di domenico et al 2012 it can play an important role in structuring ecosystems by trapping sediment and storing water it also influences the establishment and survival of tree species in woodland succession mitchell et al 2018 a total of 286 species are associated with the shrub including 43 fungi that are exclusively observed on boxwood mitchell et al 2018 however boxwood is scarcely predated by native species 2 2 local demographic model we start with a local model that describes the interaction between btm and its host bt at a small homogeneous spatial scale the model projects the population size m of box tree moths btm and the population density of box trees bt which are separated in two variables leaf density l and wood density w from moth generation n to n 1 this time representation is used to avoid the problem of multiple generations per year and its spatial variation however we are able to project the population of btm and bt from year to year if we know the number of generations per year in each specific location we write 1 l n 1 s l μ n f l l n l n r 0 w n w n 1 s w μ n ρ n f w w n ρ n w n m n 1 s m μ n f m m n to indicate that during the projection interval bt and btm grow and reproduce f and survive s the bt reproduction functions were constructed using a ricker model which includes the intrinsic population growth rates r f r w and the carrying capacities of the environment l m a x w m a x while the btm reproduction function is linear and only includes the fecundity of adults f and their survival s the survival of the species is determined by the consumption of leaves and bark by the btm as well as the intraspecific competition for the resource faced by btm the survival and reproduction functions f and s depend on both the current population l w m and the environmental descriptors μ and ρ environmental descriptors the environmental quality is described using the following two quantities μ n f m n α l n and ρ n l n w n the descriptor μ corresponds to the ratio between the number of leaves needed by all the larvae to fulfil their cycle complete development and the number of available leaves α is the amount of leaves needed per larva the number of larvae depends on the number of moths m n through its product by the moth fecundity f and each larva needs α leaves to complete its cycle the ratio μ thus quantifies the pressure for the resource which plays a direct role in the intensity of consumption of leaves and wood and therefore the survival of the larvae the descriptor ρ is the quantity of leaves per unit of wood this represents the level of boxwood defoliation which has an impact on the growth of the wood reproduction the increase in foliage biomass is the result of two processes the growth of leaves f l which depends on the current foliage fig 1 a and the production r 0 of new shoots by the wood after defoliation fig 1 b without herbivory the growth of leaves is limited only by senescence and its carrying capacity l m a x the leaves growth f l is represented by a ricker model of the following form f l l exp r f 1 l l m a x where r f is the intrinsic growth rate of the leaves the wood growth function f w fig 1 c crucially depends on the level of defoliation ρ which induces an allee effect indeed when leaf biomass is large ρ 1 wood grows until it reaches its carrying capacity however after an important defoliation ρ 1 branches or even proportion of trunk die reducing the amount of wood for each projection interval the intrinsic growth rate of the wood is defined as the balance between the production of new wood which critically depends on the density of leaves per unit of wood ρ and the mortality induced by severe defoliation when the density of leaves is large ρ 1 the bt is healthy and its production of wood reaches a maximum conversely when the density of leaves per unit of wood collapses due to severe defoliation the production of wood is low while the mortality increases until a maximum which forces the growth rate to be negative supporting information si for details the reproduction rate of btm fig 1 d does not suffer from density dependence and results from the product of adult fecundity f and adult survival s f m f s survival the leaves may die by senescence at rate v or be consumed by btm at a rate which increases with the pressure of btm on bt μ fig 1 e in the absence of btm 0 of leaves are consumed while if btm have saturated the environment 100 of the leaves are consumed see si for details the wood can suffer from both defoliation fig 1 c which decreases its intrinsic growth rate and bark consumption by the btm fig 1 f the wood mortality due to consumption increases with both the btm pressure μ and the bt health ρ more precisely the wood mortality saturates to d m a x when the foliage is abundant however when the foliage is small the bark consumption occurs while the superficial wood is available thus recently defoliated boxwood with small bark coverage ρ close to 0 cannot be consumed by the larvae see si for details we use a step function which allows to take into account that the consumption of superficial wood depends on the presence of available softwood and thus a certain amount of foliage survival of btm during the larval stage depends mainly on the amount of available resource per larva μ if the larva has enough available resource to complete its six stages it will evolve into a moth at a rate s m m a x while a lack of resource during its growth will cause its death the survival rate also takes into account intraspecific competition for resource caused by interference between the larvae see si for details 2 3 spatially explicit model using the local model which describes the interactions between btm and bt at small homogeneous spatial scale relevant for short time dynamics we build a cellular automaton in order to investigate the btm invasion over a regional heterogeneous landscape and long time scale indeed while the local model evaluates the moth invasion on the scale of a few generations the results with explicit space are obtained with a projection time of 1000 generations i e 500 years in the case of two generations per year landscape french alps and theoretical grid space our spatially explicit model describes the dynamics of the bt and btm on a 2 dimensional landscape composed of two types of cells habitat cells where bt can grow and urban cells where bt cannot establish in each cell with bt btm can mate and lay eggs according to the local demographic model while in cells without bt btm cannot become established after the reproduction phase btm moths disperse over the landscape to find new areas to breed and lay eggs bt can also disperse over the landscape to recolonize extinct areas simulations are initialized with a single moth invading a patch chosen at random and carried out on a maximum of 1000 iterations if no specifications are given we consider two types of landscape a schematic map of the french alps and a theoretical landscape the french alps map was obtained from field observations provided by the national alpine botanical conservatory it is composed of 570 by 351 cells of 29 hectares each about 58 000 km 2 si figure s 1 it should be noted that these data focus on natural boxwood and neglect the presence of ornamental boxwood in urban areas we focus on the french alps because detailed botanical data are available but in theory our model could be extended to the whole area of invasion this landscape allows us to investigate the potential impact of the btm in this region we also consider a more theoretical squared landscape to investigate the effect of the spatial structure on the invasion of the btm in particular we use various initial size and proportion of boxwood patches for each landscape we also calculate an aggregation index by counting the number of pairs adjacent boxwood patches in the landscape and dividing it by the maximum number of possible pairs 2 n 2 n where n is the proportion of boxwood cells harary and harborth 1976 for each landscape size and boxwood proportion we randomly generate 1000 landscapes with possibly different aggregation indices the final aggregation index equals the difference between the index of the landscape of interest and the average index of the randomly generated landscapes dispersal phase of btm we assume that btms disperse as groups of individuals and each dispersal event includes two stages 1 emigrating from birth areas and 2 searching for new areas exploration and settling to breed field observations suggest that the exploration phase is stochastic composed of frequent short distance dispersal by adult flight and rare long distance dispersal by anthropogenic action boxwood trade or long flight in situ experimentation using a flight carousel has provided a mean dispersal distance per individual of 13 km bras et al personal communication which is in accordance with the 10 km dispersal distance observed by van der straten and muus 2010 bras et al have also observed rare long distance flights in their experiments which may correspond to long distance dispersal events that we model using a fat tailed dispersal kernel to this end we use an exponential power distribution from klein et al 2006 which makes it possible to compare different shape of distribution tails while maintaining a fixed average dispersal distance for ecologically realistic calibration the tail shape parameter is 0 5 i e fat tailed dispersal kernel and the average dispersal distance is 25 cells i e 13 km in addition btms disperse as a swarm of 1000 individuals this group dispersal truly differs from classical dispersal where each individual disperses independently this dispersal behaviour may occur because btm can be attracted by volatile boxwood compounds or avoid geographical barriers or are influenced by climate conditions thus during the searching and settling phase each group of btm settles in an area located at a random distance drawn in the exponential power distribution and chosen with a random turning angle run in a uniform distribution over 0 2 π the emigration rate for each location depends on the pressure for resource μ at the birth location as long as pressure remains low the moths have the possibility to find leaves to oviposit in their birth patch and thus dispersal is weak when the resource pressure increases there is not enough boxwood available for laying eggs and adults will disperse massively to another patch in search for resource such resource dependent dispersal has also been modelled by the study of johst and schöps 2003 see si for details dispersal of bt dispersal events for bt include 1 creation of seeds and 2 dispersal of seeds to surrounding areas by wind and birds we assume that bt dispersal is very low and occurs only if the boxwood is in fairly good condition meaning that it has sufficient foliage see si for details as such the initial density of wood in a newly dispersed seedling depends on the parent patch density foliage is produced in the next generation after recolonization through the production of leaves by the wood we assume that seeds from a location are transported randomly only in the 8 surrounding cells that has previously contained bt we only make it possible for an extinct area to be recolonized by surrounding bt and we make it impossible for bt to colonize new areas 3 parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis to quantify the parameters of our model to our system study box tree and box tree moth we use three different methods 1 literature review 2 experimental measurement field data and mesocosm experiment and 3 statistical analysis 3 1 literature review from the recent literature on the box tree moth kawazu et al 2010 wan et al 2014 tabone et al 2015 we can evaluate the fecundity parameters f with a mean value of 120 and a range from 0 i e effects of oophagus predators and parasites to 300 see si for more details in addition the maximum survival rate of the caterpillar is on average 49 then combining experimental results from t defferier and e tabone from the national research institute for agriculture food and environment inrae and slansky jr and scriber 1982 we estimate the parameter α around 0 3 see si for more details from the experimental study of bras 2015 we are able to quantify the average dispersal distance of the btm α d and the tail shape parameter c 3 2 experimental results to assess some parameters describing the interactions between the two species we perform in situ measurements and a mesocosm experiment first we collect data in two boxwood areas located on the eastern slope of the epine massif in savoie 45 38 23 7 n 5 50 43 6 e and 45 41 33 2 n 5 50 56 2 e at an altitude of 500 and 630 m respectively in this area the invasion peak resulting in massive defoliation of the boxwood occurred in july and august 2016 while we sampled in march 2017 from these measurements on already defoliated area we estimate from 101 boxwoods its mortality due to leaves consumption by btm d m a x 0 74 and from 49 boxwoods its shoot production parameter r 0 5 1 0 5 see si for more details on the parameter estimates moreover from dendrometry method and statistical analysis we estimate the maximum growth rate of the wood to r w m a x 0 3 secondly we perform a mescosm experiment to model the consumption of leaves by caterpillars and the caterpillar survival with respect to the descriptor parameter μ we created a gradient for the resource pressure μ by placing varying numbers of caterpillars on the box trees the gradient have seven μ values see si for more details on the experiments and the statistical analysis 3 3 statistical analysis from the local model in order to quantify the other parameters of the model we use our local demographic model field observations show that when the box tree moth colonizes a patch its population explodes within a few generations eventually reaching a peak of density resulting in total defoliation of the boxwood stand hence no more resources are available and the box tree moth disappears from this patch this dynamics lasts for 3 to 4 years after the beginning of the invasion until the extinction of the moth when two generations are carried out per year it corresponds to 6 to 8 generations using statistical analysis we look for parameters that reproduces this qualitative behaviour and achieves plausible quantitative outputs see parameters referred as estimate in table 1 and details in si section s 1 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis first we discuss the outcome of the local demographic model although the moth population collapses for realistic parameter values as expected from the observations figure s 1 in si the model may reach a coexistence equilibrium for some parameter values in particular we look at two key parameters the moth fecundity and moth survival that may vary during the course of the outbreak in europe indeed the accommodation of native predators and parasites could reduce the survival rate of caterpillars and moth fecundity could be reduced by oophagous insects from our local demographic model we show that coexistence is only possible in a very narrow range of parameters values which are far from the actual measured values see figure s 2 in si to go further in the understanding of the coexistence behaviour we look at two connected patches which may favour coexistence in plant insect interactions kang and armbruster 2011 however our numerical simulations show only a slight expansion of the coexistence area which is far from sufficient to lead to coexistence with realistic parameters see figure s 2 in si thus we really need a spatial model to understand the invasion of the btm to further investigate the effect of bt and btm interactions and the robustness of the spatially explicit model we conduct a global sensitivity analysis of three outcomes of our model the boxwood biomass the percentage of dead boxwood cells and the probability of moth persistence for each outcomes we use the partial rank correlation coefficients prcc saltelli et al 2004 to quantify the strength of sensitivity for each of the 21 parameters and the direction of their impact on the model outcomes if the prcc is positive the parameter increases the outcome while it decreases for negative prcc we sample parameters in a wide range centred on the reference values of table 1 that remains ecologically coherent e g boxwood growth is slow we use 1786 values sampled around the reference values of table 1 for each parameter and 10 replicates per parameter values to compute the prcc see section s 4 and figure s 9 for more details and global sensitivity results 4 modelling results and discussion 4 1 spatial structure promotes coexistence while resource depletion drives to extinction hyp 1 using a spatially explicit model including local population dynamics and short to long range dispersal events we show that coexistence of the moth boxwood system occurs across a wide range of parameters at a regional scale dispersal allows box tree moth persistence in a cycle outbreak dynamic berryman 1987 through recurrent recolonization of patches that have been previously defoliated and which have had time to recover the spatial structure therefore allows coexistence in line with hypothesis 1a the coexistence mechanism is similar to the rock paper scissors game with the corresponding states patches of defoliated box tree patches of box tree with foliage and patches of box tree invaded by the moth these three states compete with each other following a circular hierarchy as defoliated box trees lose against box trees with foliage which are in turn invaded by box tree moths which finally leads to defoliated box trees similar rock paper scissors games have been described in other ecological contexts such as polymorphic bacterial strains kerr et al 2002 and plant mutualist exploiter systems szilágyi et al 2009 the sensitivity analysis si figure s 9 reveals that fecundity and survival of the box tree moth significantly reduce its persistence over the landscape thus we explore moth persistence over a larger range of fecundity and survival parameters than those estimated predation on the moth and on the caterpillars is currently low kenis et al 2013 in part because the box tree moth accumulates boxwood alkaloids in its body leuthardt and baur 2013 however native predators may become efficient to feed on the moth following phenotypic plasticity or adaptation carlsson et al 2009 native egg parasites like trichograms often used in biological control may also become able to feed on the moth thereby reducing its fecundity we find that the moth could rapidly go extinct only for very low fecundity and survival rates lower left corners of fig 2 a and f it is therefore unlikely that the accommodation of native natural enemies will trigger moth extinction elevation can also have an important influence on larvae survival and fecundity via egg survival as well as on the nutritional quality of the boxwood that controls larvae growth however we show that elevation does not change qualitatively the outcomes of the model even if it reduces the above mentioned parameters by 50 si figure s 4 since temperature may also modify larvae survival and fecundity suppo et al 2020 its effect should be similar to elevation because these parameters are correlated in addition temperature might increase the number of generations per year suppo et al 2020 this should increase the asynchrony between patches which is known to favour the coexistence of the system lastly the sensitivity analysis shows that moth persistence is significantly impacted by the boxwood productivity and survival si figure s 9 thus environmental changes induced by human exploitation climate changes or boxwood parasites should have a critical impact on the btm persistence through its effect on boxwood at local and global scale one step further hypothesis 1b postulates that long term coexistence is due to asynchronous dynamics and that moth extinction is due to the synchronization of the local dynamics if we artificially ensure that the invasion begins with a moth in each cell we observe that all boxwood stands are defoliated simultaneously and that the moth disappears globally in a dynamic of type pulse outbreak berryman 1987 perfect synchronization indeed leads to moth extinction but if all stands are initially invaded except a single one this is enough for the occurrence of desynchronization and the whole system becomes viable the asynchrony of the system results from the dispersal behaviour of moths on the one hand moths only leave severely defoliated areas which increases fragmentation of resources and on the other hand the frequency of long distance dispersal events also enhances fragmentation of resources see si fig s6 bottom these mechanisms enhance asynchronous dynamics of the system the moth can therefore disappear due to perfect synchronization with 100 of the patches invaded simultaneously however any other mechanism that globally reduces drastically the resources may also cause moth extinction indeed with high moth fecundity and survival rates upper right corners of fig 2 a and f the moth depletes the resource until its own extinction this negative effect of fecundity and survival of the btm was expected from the sensitivity analysis see f and s m a x in si figure s 9 in contrast to the results obtained with h spinipennis a dieffenbachii system our results indicate that global resource depletion is responsible for moth extinction rather than synchronization of local dynamics johst and schöps 2003 this is in line with the individual based model of uchmański 2019 who found that forest insect pests may go extinct when adult fecundity or larvae survival increase within the coexistence regime the average density of moths and the average intensity of the invasion are insensitive to moth fecundity and survival the moth either persists at the coexistence density or goes extinct fig 2 interestingly the moth population can persist even when it periodically invades 99 of the patches si figure s 5 top right provided that leaves grow back fast enough to prevent global resource depletion in this case moths invade a significant proportion of the patches even during troughs about 12 the cyclic dynamics are therefore getting closer to a permanent outbreak berryman 1987 the same process occurred in the model of uchmański 2019 where leaf growth rate was expressed by a parameter defining the number of years needed for their regeneration in his model when the leaf growth rate increased the dynamics of the cyclic outbreak was accelerated with shorter periods between peaks and troughs the system then transited to a permanent outbreak for very rapid leaf growth rates furthermore in our model a slow leaf growth rate also leads to the extinction of the insects see si figure s 5 left more generally we show that parameters improving bt survival or productivity such as wood survival or leaf productivity have a positive effect on persistence of the moth see si figure s 5 and figure s 9 however these parameters always reduce the biomass of bt over the landscape and enhance the periodic occurrence of severe outbreaks as a result we show that increasing bt survival or productivity strengthens the global instability and produces a more fragmented resource landscape 4 2 spatial structure generates periodical invasions hyp 2 we further postulate that despite local cycles of extinction and recolonization the coexistence regime is stationary at the landscape scale hypothesis 2 a phenomenon called statistical stability de roos et al 1991 holyoak et al 2005 amarasekare 2008 instead we find that the coexistence regime is periodic at the landscape scale fig 3 a a similar pattern has been observed in the h spinipennis a dieffenbachii system johst and schöps 2003 and in uchmański 2019 the global period ranges between 20 generations high leaf growth rate si figure s 8 top and 40 generations low leaf growth rate si figure s 8 bottom in contrast the invasion of a local patch lasts 5 generations when 1000 moths are introduced at once and 7 generations when a single moth colonizes the patch si figure s 5 this discrepancy between the local and global timescales suggests that periodicity at the global scale results from the combination of the local time scale and the pace of dispersal during peaks between 60 and 99 of the boxwood patches are simultaneously invaded by the moth and 1 5 during periods of minimal abundance depending on parameter values periodic travelling waves explain this pattern which have been described in prey predator systems lambin et al 1998 sherratt 2001 however such prey predator systems are locally periodic as well and long term coexistence does not require spatial structure in contrast in our study system the periodic waves emerge from the spatial structure instead of being a mere consequence of local periodicity in the context of a tritrophic model of the larch budmoth zeiraphera diniana with cyclic population dynamics johnson et al 2006 showed that over compensatory density dependence produces recurrent travelling waves in high connectivity habitats aggregated around a single focus however in this context the landscape is fixed and the local dynamics of the population is cyclic while in our model the resource landscape can change due to the plant herbivore dynamics and the local dynamics drives the moth to extinction if the mean dispersal distance is very low 1 cell on average keeping rare long distance events the amplitude of the oscillations is also very low fig 4 b and the system tends to be statistically stable 4 3 intermediate intensity of long distance dispersal prevents btm from extinction hypothesis 3 posits that asynchronous local dynamics require intermediate dispersal distance myers 1976 myers and campbell 1976 because very limited dispersal might prevent suitable boxwood patches from colonization 3a whereas very long distance dispersal may synchronize local dynamics 3b the sensitivity analysis reveals that the moth persistence significantly decreases with an increase of migration parameters i e m w m a x and α d migration rate including mortality during dispersal and mean dispersal distance si figure s 9 however with the measured parameter values we find that the long term probability of moth persistence is insensitive to dispersal distance this is shown in fig 4 a where the measured value for the production of new leaves from wood after total defoliation r 0 equals 5 1 0 3 2 3 on a log scale in that case the moths persist whatever the mean dispersal distance is 1 25 or 70 cells because boxwood produces new shoots after total defoliation fast enough to enable moth persistence even when the global leaf biomass is low meanwhile previously infected areas produce enough leaves to support another moth outbreak conversely when r 0 equals 2 1 0 3 2 7 on a log scale which may happen under climatic stress for instance it turns out that the moth does not persist when the mean dispersal distance equals 70 cells fig 3 b the moth initially invades 99 of the patches fig 3 c and reaches very high densities fig 3 d this reduces the global leaf biomass fig 3 e and the moth eventually collapses due to resource depletion in the case of coexistence fig 3 a the maximal of invaded patches is around 60 70 the maximal moth density is 3 times lower and the minimal leaf biomass is 5 times higher than in the extinction case we also find that when the mean dispersal distance is very short 1 cell on average the probability of moth persistence is not affected by the offshoot production rate because of short distance dispersal the moth does not generate periods of global invasion and intact patches are always present at the border of its slow moving invasion front in that case relatively high offshoot production rates are unnecessary as the moth populations do not rely on the new growth of recently defoliated patches in contrast when the average dispersal distance is larger e g 25 and 70 cells the probability of persistence increases with the offshoot production rate fig 4 a in such cases the moth needs to recolonize recently defoliated patches because during peaks a large proportion of patches are defoliated at the same time therefore relatively high offshoot production rates are necessary to avoid global over exploitation the influence of the mean dispersal distance on moth persistence is therefore studied with a relatively low offshoot production rate r 0 2 1 0 3 as expected by hypothesis 3b frequent long distance dispersal events lead to the extinction of the moth due to global resource depletion fig 4 b continuous line this effect of long distance dispersal was not present in uchmański 2019 this can be explained to the use of a thin tailed gaussian kernel characterized by very rare long distance dispersal events thus insect pests could not reach the distant trees which had time to regenerate after their last defoliation although the frequency of long distance dispersal events accelerates the spreading speed of propagation of the invasion fayard et al 2009 garnier 2011 we show that it truly impacts the persistence of the plant herbivore system furthermore hypothesis 3a posits that the moth goes extinct in the case of limited dispersal because it would not be able to escape over exploited patches however the fat tailed dispersal kernel prevents this phenomenon even when the mean dispersal distance is very low 1 cell the moth can persist thanks to relatively rare but still frequent enough long distance dispersal events things change when we constrain dispersal to a uniform distribution which ranges between 1 cell and a given maximum of cells in that case when the maximum number of cells is low enough up to 4 cells the moth invasion can get stuck in a landscape dead end and it disappears because of local resource depletion and not global resource depletion fig 4 b dotted line prey predator systems subject to limit cycles were also stabilized by limited dispersal in the individual based model of cuddington and yodzis 2000 where limited dispersal reduced the average predation rate and thereby avoided local instability however if dispersal is too limited the consumer can go extinct because of a drastic reduction in the rate of predation as is the case in our model when long distance dispersal events are extremely rare due to uniform dispersal kernel fig 4 b dotted line the results obtained using the fat tailed dispersal seems the most plausible indeed long distance dispersal events mediated either by wind or by human dispersal likely occur in the case of the box tree moth with a fat tailed dispersal kernel multiple invasion fronts are created far away from invaded patches because long distance dispersal events are frequent shaw 1995 this created a fragmented landscape of defoliated and intact boxwood in which the moth does not end up in a dead end such a fragmented invasion front can be observed in europe the moth was first observed in germany in 2006 2007 in the same year it spread to switzerland and the netherlands and reach france feldtrauer et al 2009 and the united kingdom salisbury et al 2012 in 2008 austria in 2009 italy bella 2013 in 2010 and portugal iran and armenia in 2016 bras et al 2019 long distance dispersal might be due to the boxwood trade between european countries and probably to a much lesser extent by the natural dispersal of moths we therefore expect that in practise only frequent long distance dispersal can lead to the extinction of the moth due to global resource depletion this mechanism is enhanced by the dispersal behaviour of the moths since moths disperse as swarms and only leave severely defoliated environments they put a strong pressure on the local environment increasing the extinction probability of the system in the context of a metapopulation these group dispersal behaviours are also known to threaten persistence because it decreases the proportion of occupied cells ray et al 1991 anderson et al 2009 jenouvrier et al 2017 however this prediction might be mitigated by a dispersal cost resulting from higher mortality encountered during a long distance flight a fertility decline with flight distance or even delayed mating effect that reduces the fitness of moth dispersing at long distance indeed those mechanisms tends to reduce the high invasion potential of the long distance dispersal events by limiting the effective dispersal distance and our model already shows that moth persistence is higher with intermediate distance dispersal moreover these ecological processes are unlikely to reduce dispersal to the extreme case of a uniform distribution at short distances and therefore do not significantly affect the persistence of the box tree moth indeed we show that a reduction of the swarm size with dispersal distance gives qualitatively unchanged results on the moth persistence si figure s 4 4 4 fragmented landscape with low amount of resource prevents extinction hyp 4 next we predict that the coexistence regime depends on the landscape characteristics in particular its size 4a and the proportion of suitable boxwood patches 4b to do so we use wrapped landscapes with no edge effect of different sizes and different proportions of randomly distributed suitable patches fig 5 a below 200 200 cells which corresponds to about 12 000 km 2 coexistence does not occur within the realistic range of parameter values because previously defoliated patches are quickly recolonized by the moth and lack time to grow back this induces a global resource collapse and drives the moth to extinction above the 200 200 threshold the larger the landscape is the more likely the coexistence occurs in line with hypothesis 4a in the previous sections we restrict our model to the french alps but we expect that long term coexistence is even more likely on the european scale because larger landscapes favour coexistence the influence of landscape size is also apparent in the real landscape with a uniform and short range dispersal kernel when the invasion begins in a relatively isolated area of the landscape coexistence is impaired by small size a priori the effect of the initial proportion of boxwood patches on coexistence is unclear 4b because on the one hand a higher proportion of suitable patches provides more resources to the moths while on the other hand it may trigger moth outbreaks which ultimately leads to resource depletion we find that the latter mechanism is on the driver s seat reducing the proportion of boxwood patches increases the probability of moth persistence fig 5 a more precisely the landscapes larger than 400 400 cells filled with less than 20 of boxwood patches almost always allow coexistence in such cases most dispersal events fail to find suitable patches lowering the moth population density which in turn leaves more time for leaves to grow back on the contrary a high proportion of suitable patches results in high moth densities which leads to global over exploitation despite a potentially higher leaf biomass thus we postulate that any environmental changes due to climate changes or human activities that reduces boxwood biomass would not necessarily drive the btm towards extinction the coexistence regime has interesting consequences on the final proportion of boxwood patches which corresponds to the initial proportion minus the proportion of complete withering patches due to over exploitation under coexistence the final proportion increases linearly with the initial proportion with a weak slope of about 0 1 whereas the slope is close to 1 in the case of moth extinction fig 5 b this indicates that the local extinction of boxwood patches is not responsible for global moth extinction instead the final proportion of boxwood patches is a long term consequence of coexistence and results from their gradual death fig 5 c during each moth outbreak a small proportion of the boxwood patches disappears due to over exploitation then right after the outbreak a few boxwood patches are recolonized from neighbouring patches only previously occupied patches can be recolonized which induces a clustered distribution of the boxwood patches as a result of clustering the aggregation index is always positive which indicates that the landscapes created by long term coexistence are more aggregated than random landscapes boxwood patches relatively isolated in the initial landscape experience larger extinction rates and create holes in the landscape in contrast areas where boxwood patches are initially more abundant persist more often which creates clusters moreover the aggregation increases with the average moth dispersal distance fig 5 d boxwood patches favour moth outbreaks increasing the boxwood patches proportion over the landscape produces severe outbreaks this induces apparent competition between boxwood patches because of their shared pest with low dispersal distance apparent competition between patches is mainly local which limits the formation of clusters instead with high dispersal distance apparent competition is global and the aggregated pattern results from the interplay between local facilitation recolonization of boxwood patches is purely local and global competition as in many spatially self structured systems kéfi et al 2007 2008 this is confirmed by simulations where boxwood recolonization is global in that case the aggregation process vanishes details not shown we further explore how the aggregation process creates boxwood clusters of different sizes for various dispersal distance to do so we start with landscapes which are initially filled with boxwood patches and run simulations after invasion by the moth at the end of the simulations we fit a power law model to the final distribution of the cluster sizes si figure s 6 top clusters smaller than 5 boxwood patches are excluded from the fit we find that small dispersal distance leads to a cluster size distribution closer to a power law than large dispersal distance when the dispersal distance is large 10 to 50 cells the cluster size distribution follows a truncated power law si figure s 6 top which indicates that large clusters are under represented large dispersal distance leads to an increase of herbivory which produces two distinct effects on the one hand it favours aggregation due to global apparent competition as discussed earlier fig 5 d on the other hand it increases the death rate of boxwood patches and thus reduces the final proportion of patches in the landscape fig 5 e this is why under large dispersal distance 10 to 50 cells the final landscapes has a fragmented aspect of equally spaced small clusters si figure s 6 bottom these regular patterns are similar to turing instabilities turing 1990 murray 2001 and result from scale dependent feedbacks which combine short distance positive feedbacks and long distance negative feedbacks rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 in the present case short distance positive feedback correspond to local facilitation of boxwood due to recruitment while apparent competition between boxwood stands because of their shared pest mirror long distance negative feedbacks several studies have investigated how spatial patterns can emerge from such scale dependent feedbacks in a variety of ecological scenarios such as plant water interactions klausmeier 1999 von hardenberg et al 2001 rietkerk et al 2002 meron et al 2004 kéfi et al 2010 plant plant interactions lejeune et al 1999 or predator prey interactions levin and segel 1976 solé and bascompte 2012 it has been shown that such spatial patterns emerge in predator prey systems when the predator has a larger dispersal capacity than the prey gurney et al 1998 de roos et al 1998 although our model differs from the classical predator prey model due to the presence of an allee effect for the prey cantrell and cosner 2004 we demonstrate that spatial patterns emerge from similar mechanisms in our context of a plant herbivore system 4 5 implications for management first the most important finding for management purposes is that the moth heavily impacts boxwood stands with the estimated parameter values we find that in the study area only 10 of the initial boxwood biomass remains after invasion fig 2 b and that 50 of the original boxwood patches completely disappear fig 2 c which represents 2414 square kilometres in the french alps however these quantitative predictions should be taken with caution in particular the sensitivity analysis si figure s 9 shows that the characteristics of boxwood are determining factors in the model so a better understanding of the biology of boxwood and its response to defoliation seems essential to gain further insights into the impact of the box tree moth invasion under low moth fecundity and high caterpillar survival the moths could persist longer in heavily defoliated patches the severe decrease in box tree biomass can impact the many species associated with boxwood as well as the ecosystem services provided by the shrub i e sediment trapping and water storage mitchell et al 2018 in stands where boxwood is severely weakened or extinguished recolonization by neighbouring patches may be prevented by pioneer plants potentially other invasive species such as buddleja davidii or ailanthus altissima in a kind of invasion meltdown process simberloff and von holle 1999 next the periodic invasion dynamics can lead to confusion regarding the persistence of the box tree moth a period of low overall abundance should not be confused with a decrease in invasion and moth control methods should take periodic invasion dynamics into account remote sensing methods may be appropriate in order to detect the few boxwood stands that provide refuge under low moth abundance kerr and ostrovsky 2003 we suggest that detecting stands of undefoliated boxwood that allow moth persistence during a period of low abundance could provide an interesting management strategy since control efforts could be increased on these particular patches finally management actions might consider preventing anthropogenic long distance dispersal however we find that only very limited dispersal could lead to moth extinction which occurs with a uniform distribution of dispersal events of no more than 4 cells fig 4 b dotted line as soon as dispersal is higher the moth could escape dead ends in the landscape and therefore persists even if anthropogenic long distance dispersal is prevented a few natural long distance dispersal events might ensure moth persistence it is therefore unlikely that management actions limiting dispersal can be able to eradicate the moth however such actions can reduce the impact on boxwood stands since we find that long distance dispersal increases the extinction rate of boxwood patches fig 5 e three scenarios may occur after the invasion of box tree moth in europe extinction of both species extinction of the moth only or coexistence our theoretical approach combined with field and experimental data suggests that coexistence is the most likely outcome with cycles of moth outbreaks and crashes coexistence comes along with a severe reduction of boxwood biomass at the landscape scale boxwood stands may therefore become closer to brown than green moth extinction can also occur which indicates that the invasion dynamics of exotic pests can be mitigated even in the absence of predators and effective plant defenses we further show that plant herbivore coexistence through spatial effects does not require poorly mobile wingless species as in our model a wide range of dispersal values result in coexistence coexistence occurs in large landscapes long distance dispersal thus requires a spatial scaling up for the persistence of the system particularly intense long distance dispersal nevertheless leads to herbivore extinction provided that plant grows back slowly in that case the herbivore depletes its resources at the global scale which leads to its own extinction even without a complete synchronization of the local dynamics finally coexistence is easier in patchy landscapes because unsuitable patches increase moth mortality during dispersal and thereby reduce the global insect population size interestingly when plants disperse locally the spatial dynamics of the system lead to the formation of such a patchy landscape with relatively small plant patches evenly distributed in the landscape the system thus creates its own stability conditions credit authorship contribution statement léo ledru developed

24492,although minerals such as gold and platinum are important for improving life their processing comes with social and environmental problems during the processing of these minerals toxic elements such as cadmium copper and chromium are released along with wastewater into the environment including soils and surface water leading to plausible migration to groundwater the removal of these elements from aqueous solutions is of utmost importance however where no remediation is implemented the ability of the soil to retain the elements and prevent migration is crucial moreover there is a need for reliable and accurate computational modelling programs that requires minimum set of experiments for calibration in order to determine the success of the sorption of elements by natural and man made adsorbents since laboratory and field experiments can be expensive time consuming and often require repetition in this study the ability of an agricultural clay soil to adsorb and retain cadmium cd copper cu and chromium cr was investigated by simulating different conditions using phreeqc which stands for ph redox equilibrium written in the c language geochemical modelling code coupled to parameter estimation pest the role of ph 2 9 on the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto generalised weak strong and super strong sites of the agricultural soil was determined and used to calibrate the model the soil was found to be effective in preventing the mobility of cd cu and cr to groundwater however the presence of competing ions and plant exudates increased their mobility phreeqc geochemical modelling code coupled with pest was found to be a quick and a reliable tool to determine the performance of natural and man made adsorbents in different conditions thus phreeqc coupled to pest is a suitable decision making tool for environmental sustainability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption efficiency computational modelling groundwater pollution parameter estimation soil toxicity 1 introduction different devices including those used in medicine require precious elements such as gold rare earth elements platinum and copper which have unique physical and chemical properties cowley 2011 hanawa 2021 thus the processing of these minerals is important for improving the quality of life including the building of infrastructure and improving the economy in many countries liu et al 2019 however their processing comes with major social and environmental problems tayebi khorami et al 2019 mining processes such as grinding and concentration of ores as well as the disposal of tailings and mine wastewater introduce waste into the environment lèbre et al 2017 this waste contains trace elements such as cadmium chromium mercury and arsenic which are toxic and hazardous okereafor et al 2019 these elements can be transported from mining operation sites by natural factors such as wind and rain as well as from mine tailings by water erosion and wind erosion to nearby areas thus soils in the vicinity of mining operations are susceptible to contamination by these elements ciccu et al 2003 li and thornton 2001 some of these soils are agricultural soils used to grow different crops including cabbage spinach carrots and potatoes amongst others thus these elements can find their way into the crops and groundwater through the soil when consumed these elements have negative effects in the body as some have carcinogenic mutagenic and or teratogenic effects fakhri et al 2017 srivastava et al 2020 groundwater is considered an important resource for both living organisms and the environment jia et al 2019 it is used for domestic purposes in households and industries as well as for irrigation in agriculture most countries around the world rely on groundwater as a main source of sustainable water supply since groundwater makes more than 98 of the available freshwater hence it should be protected from pollution caused by mining and other industries gude 2018 water quality index wqi has been widely used to determine the groundwater quality by considering different parameters such as electrical conductivity total dissolved solids ph and concentrations of cations and anions asadi et al 2020 genetic programming and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis which are artificial intelligence methods have also been used to predict groundwater quality parameters aryafar et al 2019 these are all important methods however there is a need to determine entry sources so that they can be dealt with properly moreover a good quality of groundwater or low pollution level does not mean that the groundwater will be protected throughout hence a need to determine the possibility of future pollution as different elements are introduced into the environment a lot of research has focused on coming up with methods of treating groundwater so that is of good quality but this is not enough as the pollution problem will still persist it is therefore crucial to come up with methods that can determine the probability of groundwater pollution with time especially in areas where there is mining and processing which release elements into the air soil and water bodies geochemical modelling can be implemented for this purpose where the ability of soils to prevent the migration of elements to groundwater is assessed this is because elements some of which are toxic coming from the different industries will be in contact with the soil before reaching groundwater hence the soil was considered in this study there are various techniques which have been used to remove trace elements from the soil and these include chlorination ultrasonic thermal treatment nano remediation mechanical washing and bio mineralisation baragaño et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2020 li et al 2019 park and son 2017 however there is no remediation applied in most soils due to cost and the area that must be covered especially in under developed countries hence the ability of pollution susceptible soils to retain elements and prevent their mobility to groundwater and accessibility to plants must be investigated this will give an indication of the probability of groundwater pollution in the vicinity of mining and other industries releasing waste into the environment in this study clay soil from an agricultural plot in the vicinity of platinum group elements pges mining activities was used to determine its ability to retain cadmium cd copper cu and chromium cr which are normally found in high concentrations in such regions thus the adsorption process of the soil was investigated even though cu is an essential element in living organisms it can be toxic as it can inhibit cell metabolism when its concentration exceeds the maximum allowed limit ochoa herrera et al 2011 chromium was selected in this study because it can also be toxic to living organisms cr3 has been found to interact with dna mitochondria and lysosomes in living organisms leading to decreased cell viability and other conditions which may be permanent terpilowska and siwicki 2018 moreover at higher ph cr3 can be converted to cr6 which is more toxic even in very low concentrations 0 5 mg l 1 noah et al 2020 terpilowska and siwicki 2018 cadmium has been found to be very toxic at low concentrations and the international agency for research on cancer has classified it as a category i carcinogen reyes hinojosa et al 2019 thus the accessibility of these elements from soils susceptible to their pollution must be determined to indicate the level of safety of such soils their ability to reach groundwater which is widely used in everyday activities must also be investigated to determine the level of toxicity of groundwater nickel zinc and iron can also be found in high concentrations in mining wastewaters but their effect is not as harmful as that of the analytes most companies and researchers from different fields including chemistry molecular biology engineering physics and economics are currently using computer modelling to make important environmental management decisions which are within their calibration range schuwirth et al 2019 sophisticated and integrated computer simulation models are widely used for this purpose smolentsev et al 2020 these models are particularly important because they can accurately estimate future environmental possibilities such as water scarcity mineral scarcity level of pollution and climate change phreeqc geochemical modelling modflow zonebudget groundwater vistas and geological information system are amongst those used skidmore 2017 for this study a geochemical modelling code known as phreeqc which stands for ph redox equilibrium written in the c language was calibrated and used to simulate different conditions that may affect the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto the agricultural clay soil parkhurst and appelo 2013 computer modelling was adopted in this study because laboratory and field experiments can have limitations and uncertainties such as the absolute ph of solutions and equilibrium constants besides phreeqc geochemist s workbench software can be used but it is expensive and does not contain all crucial databases for modelling for better accuracy of the results the phreeqc model was coupled to parameter estimation pest which is computer software that assists with statistical analysis of data model calibration and predictive analysis it is used where model variables need to be altered until model generated numbers fit a set of data that was observed in the laboratory or field provided that certain continuity conditions are met doherty 2015 moreover many research institutions around the world are looking for quick solutions to determine environmental toxicity posed by different industries including mining and computational modelling may be the best answer 2 materials and methods the soil used was collected at a depth 20 30 cm five sampling points in the area were considered in a fallow proportion from an agricultural plot located in rustenburg south africa fig 1 rustenburg was selected because it has a significant number of agricultural plots in the vicinity of mining areas the fruits and vegetables grown in these plots are watered using groundwater and are sold throughout south africa thus if groundwater is negatively affected by mining a larger population ingesting the fruits and vegetables can be negatively affected the soil was collected in a polypropylene container and was treated in the laboratory where it was air dried unwanted particles and substances such as stones and plant particles were removed pestle and mortar were used to break down soil lumps and a 2 mm sieve was used to sieve the soil the soil was soil was stored in a polypropylene container until required 2 1 soil characterisation the chemical composition and the mineralogy of the soil were determined using x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical netherlands and powder x ray diffraction pxrd bruker d2 phaser germany respectively fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tensor 27 bruker germany was used to identify functional groups present in the 400 4000 cm 1 range micromeritics flow prep 060 instrument aachen germany was used to determine the surface area of the soil the characterisation results were used to build the phreeqc input script 2 2 reagents and standards all the chemicals used were obtained from sigma aldrich south africa and were of analytical grade 100 mg l 1 nitrate stock solution of a mixture of cd2 cu2 and cr3 were prepared by dissolving sufficient amounts of nitrate salts in 1 l deionised water with 0 05 v v hno3 the solutions were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c 2 3 calibration of the phreeqc model 2 3 1 batch laboratory experiments batch adsorption experiments were used to calibrate the phreeqc model the effect of ph on the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto the agricultural soil was used for this purpose 0 75 g of agricultural clay soil was added to 50 ml of 10 mg l 1 solutions containing a mixture of cd cu and cr at ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 naoh and hno3 were used to adjust the ph and a ph metre was used to determine the ph mettler toledo switzerland the solutions were shaken for 3 h optimised and equilibrated using an elliptical bench top shaker labcon usa at 150 rpm the solutions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 60 s the supernatants were filtered with 0 45 µm whatman filter paper whatman uk and the concentration of the elements at equilibrium was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes icp oes was selected over inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms because the samples had high total dissolved solids tds and the elements had higher regulatory limits moreover the samples used had higher concentrations of elements which would need dilution when using icp ms and this can affect the accuracy of measurement the experiments were conducted in triplicates and the percentage relative standard deviation rsd was used to treat the results obtained where less than 5 rsd was considered the adsorption efficiency was determined using eq 1 1 a d s o r p t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c i c e c i x 100 where ci and ce mg l 1 are initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively from here phreeqc geochemical modelling code was used to simulate the adsorption of the elements at different ph regions 2 3 2 phreeqc model phreeqc is a computer modelling program written in the c and c programming languages it is designed to perform aqueous geochemical calculations where elements in the aqueous solution interact with minerals solid solutions ion exchangers and sorption surfaces kinetic reactions with rate equations determined by the user can also be modelled parkhurst and appelo 1999 some of the most important capabilities of phreeqc include the ability to calculate saturation indices and the distribution of aqueous species there are different databases such as phreeqc dat sit dat wateq dat database which are incorporated into the phreeqc model a database can be selected based on the need of the user as each contain parameters and elements with specific conditions parkhurst and appelo 1999 phreeqc geochemical modelling software version 3 was used in this study the phreeqc model keywords and their functions are shown in table s1 in order to obtain accurate simulations the conditions used in the laboratory must be specified in phreeqc the conditions ph pe concentrations of the elements temperature and the amount of water of the aqueous solutions used during the laboratory experiments can be specified under the solution keyword fig s1 in order to obtain the relationship between the surface adsorption sites and the elements equilibrium and kinetic reactions should be interconnected in this study phreeqc geochemical modelling was used to simulate the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil under different environmental conditions the adsorption sites of the agricultural clay soil were generalised and specified in the phreeqc model as weak gs w strong gs s and super strong sites gs ss where gs generalised surface fig s1 the use of generalised composite surface complexation model presents a more generic approach that is independent of the actual sorbent mosai et al 2021 this approach is especially useful when detailed mineralogy is not available the generalised surface approach ensured that all the surface active sites were accounted for thus computer models can be used to account for aspects that laboratory or field measurements cannot account for alternatively the active sites involved can be added manually onto the input scrip however not all active sites would be accounted for because they may consist of unusual combinations which require robust experiments for identification this would take more time money and therefore defeat the purpose of this study which is mainly the fast determination of the ability of adsorbents to uptake different elements solution 1 as indicated in fig s1 was run on its own to determine the speciation of the elements at different ph values this run indicated that cd2 and cu2 were the major species of cadmium and copper respectively whilst the major species of chromium were cr3 cr oh 2 cr oh 2 and cr oh 3 these species were then used to build the phreeqc input script where the reactions between the agricultural soil surface active sites and the major species were specified fig s2 equilibrium constants log k from different sources for each reaction were specified in the model the generalised active sites selected for this study were obtained by trial and error most adsorbents have weak and strong sites hence they were considered to be present in the soil phreeqc enables the programmer to specify the number of moles of active sites the surface area and the mass of the adsorbent used fig s1 these were obtained from the characterisation studies the phreeqc minteq dat database was used as it contained all the elements and other parameters being studied upon identifying the active sites major species of the elements and the equilibrium constants of the reactions phreeqc was run to obtain an output script containing the adsorption efficiencies of the elements at different ph values this was to assess if the model was calibrated at 25 c however the simulated results obtained were significantly different p 0 05 from those obtained experimentally meaning that the phreeqc model was not calibrated compared to experimental results the modelled results showed lower adsorption capacities as a result of the equilibrium constants used this was mainly due to the fact that the surface used in this study was different from the surfaces used by other authors who determined the equilibrium constants relative to the surfaces they used komárek et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 thus the log k values of the reactions had to be correctly determined to obtain the correct log k values which are specific for the agricultural soil used parameter estimation pest was coupled to the phreeqc model pest is software that assists with statistical analysis of data model calibration and forward looking analysis predictive analysis it is used when model variables have to be altered until model generated numbers fit a set of data that was observed in the laboratory or field provided that certain continuity conditions are met i e until the fit between the model output and data observed in the laboratory or field is improved in the weighted least squares doherty 2015 pest requires three types of files to run properly viz template instruction and control files the template file contains the parameters that need to be optimised i e log k values and is similar to the model input file with the exception that log k values to be adjusted by parameter names the instruction file contains information about which values to use from the output file in order to calibrate the model the pest control file is considered as the master file as it brings together the template and instruction files it contains all the parameter values to be adjusted pest optimization algorithm initial and boundary values of model parameters and observations that the model output is going to be calibrated against lin and aarts 2012 these files were prepared on a text editor and details on how these files are prepared can be obtained from the pest manual doherty 2008 after the successful calibration the phreeqc model was then used to simulate the effect of initial concentrations 2 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 soil dosage 2 10 15 20 and 30 g l 1 seasonality in terms of temperature 275 278 283 288 293 298 303 308 and 313 k competing ions co2 li k zn2 ca2 pb2 mn2 na mg2 and fe3 anions f cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 and po4 3 and plant exudates citric acid edta and acetic acid on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural clay soil 3 results 3 1 characterisation of the soil all the collected soil samples were analysed and there was no significant difference between them p 0 05 the dominant chemical components of the agricultural clay soil were determined using xrf and were found to be sio2 74 7 and al2o3 11 4 feo mgo and cao were also in significant amounts the results from pxrd also found sio2 in the form of quartz to be the dominant mineral fig s3 al2o3 montmorillonite na ca 0 3 al mg 2si4o10 oh 2 n h2o and cao were also detected thus sio2 and al2o3 formed a significant part of clay soil active sites the functional groups of the agricultural clay soil were determined with ftir and the results indicated the presence of oh stretching vibrations at 3600 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 which were ascribed to the hydroxyl groups and water molecules in the soil respectively fig 2 wójcik bania 2021 the peak at 3400 cm 1 may also be as a result of nh due to the presence of humic substances and amino acids peng et al 2017 the peak at 1658 cm 1 was ascribed to co stretching vibrations as a result of cooh from amino acids and humic substances in the soil chen et al 2020 this was also evidenced by the presence of ch bend vibrations and ch2 scissoring at 798 cm 1 and 1483 cm 1 respectively the strong peak approximately at 1000 cm 1 was due to the si o stretching vibrations which overlap with al o ahmed et al 2018 this further confirms the results obtained using xrf and pxrd these results were similar to those obtained by other researchers who characterised montmorillonite meaning that the soil was similar to other natural clay materials ahmed et al 2018 chen et al 2020 the surface area of the agricultural soil was found to be 85 m2 g 1 other chemical properties of the soil are shown in table s2 the characterisation results were used to specify the agricultural soil in the phreeqc model 3 2 calibration of the phreeqc model the effect of ph on the adsorption of cu cd and cr by the agricultural clay soil was determined experimentally and the results were used to calibrate the phreeqc model many studies have indicated that the ph has a major effect on the adsorption of different elements hence it was adopted in this study batool et al 2017 khan et al 2020 the log k values of all the reactions involved as indicated in fig s3 were accurately estimated by pest pest does this by changing the phreeqc output results until they are as close as possible to the observed laboratory measurements using a number of iterations if the modelled and measured data do not correlate p 0 05 pest will stop after reaching the maximum number of iterations this however is an indication that there is something missing in the model which could be omitted species and active sites that play a major role in adsorption the model will not be calibrated until the missing data is included table 1 shows a pest record file indicating correlation between the experimental and modelled results these results indicated that the phreeqc model was calibrated since there was no significant difference between the data p 0 05 moreover pest indicated that weak strong and super strong sites of the soil were involved in the adsorption of the elements the exclusion of any of these results will lead to a failed or statistically excluded calibration the pest determined log k values were included in the phreeqc input script and the calibrated model was used to determine the effect of ph on the adsorption of cd cu and cr the modelled results were compared with those determined from the laboratory experiments and they further concluded that the calibration was successful fig 3 the experimental and modelled results indicated that the adsorption efficiencies of cd and cu increased with increasing ph zhang et al 2021 studied the adsorption of pd2 and cd2 onto magnetic activated carbon at a ph range of 2 6 and found that the adsorption capacities were directly proportional to ph due to increasing negative character of the adsorbent thus the high concentration of h3o ions at highly acidic ph protonated the surface of the soil increasing the positive character of the soil as ph increased the surface of the soil became less positively charged and thus the affinity for positively charged elements increased with ph phreeqc indicated that the dominating species of cd and cu over a wide range of ph were cd2 and cu2 respectively hence their adsorption efficiency increased with ph fig 3a and b the low adsorption efficiency of cd and cu observed at ph 2 was due to the high positive character of the agricultural clay soil zhang et al 2021 phreeqc also indicated that at ph 9 cu oh 2 was in significant amount 40 meaning that the high adsorption efficiency observed fig 3b was due to a mixture of the adsorbed and precipitated copper fig 4 this then shows the importance of using phreeqc to determine the speciation of the elements so that the correct conclusion of the success of adsorption can be made similar results were obtained by zhou et al 2018 and mahmoud et al 2019 the dominating species of cr at acidic ph were found to be cr3 75 cr oh 2 and cr oh 2 adigun et al 2020 wang et al 2020 there was no significant difference p 0 05 on the adsorption of cr by the agricultural soil between ph 2 and ph 7 due to the dominating positively charged species in this ph region beyond ph 7 the adsorption efficiency drastically dropped because the dominating species were cr oh 3 45 and cro2 21 fig 3c the negatively charged species were repelled by the negatively charged soil surface due to high concentration of oh ions zhang et al 2021 thus beyond ph 7 cr either precipitates cr oh 3 or gets repelled leading to low adsorption capacity the observed adsorption efficiency of cr at ph 7 was due to the cr oh 2 and cr oh 2 species which were also in significant amounts moreover cr3 was converted to cr6 in the form of cro4 2 at ph 7 fig 4 wang et al 2020 therefore the mining and industrial wastewaters with ph 7 will lead to the low adsorption capacity of cu and cr which may increase their accessibility to crops and mobility to groundwater resources from this study ph 6 was selected as the optimum for the maximum adsorption of the elements by the agricultural soil 3 3 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial concentration 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 mg l 1 on the adsorption of cu cd and cr by agricultural clay soil was simulated using phreeqc geochemical modelling at ph 6 15 g l 1 and 25 c initial concentration was investigated in this study because studies have indicated that the performance of adsorbents can be highly dependant on the concentrations of the adsorbates batool et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 some of the modelled results from this study were compared with experimental results to confirm if the calibrated phreeqc model accurately simulates other conditions and it was found that the results correlate p 0 05 the results indicated that the adsorption of cd and cu was similar between 2 and 100 mg l 1 even though the cu adsorption was higher fig 5 a the adsorption of cr was only competitively higher between 2 and 20 mg l 1 after which the adsorption efficiency significantly decreased thus the adsorption of cr by the agricultural clay soil will be effective when the concentration of cr is 20 mg l 1 this means that the agricultural soil has affinity for cd and cu beyond 100 mg l 1 the adsorption of the elements drastically decreased which may be attributed to the availability of active sites khalfa et al 2021 thus the amount of soil used did not have enough active sites for the uptake of all the elements at 100 mg l 1 this means that at concentrations 100 mg l 1 15 g l 1 of the soil will be quickly occupied by the elements leading to fast saturation also this showed that the uptake of the elements by the agricultural soil is concentration dependant imamoglu and tekir 2008 assessed the adsorption of cu ii and pb ii onto activated carbon and found that the adsorption of these elements decreased as concentration increased due to the availability of insufficient adsorption sites at higher concentrations this study indicated that the adsorption of the elements was in the order cu cd cr the mobility of the elements to groundwater will increase at concentrations 100 mg l 1 this means that if the concentration of the elements reaching the soil is greater than 100 mg l 1 the soil will have to be treated in order to prevent mobility to groundwater resources moreover the study indicated that groundwater is likely to be highly affected by cr more than other elements due to its high mobility in concentrations 20 mg l 1 the results from this study alluded to the fact that the mining and other industries releasing waste into the environment should start using remediation technologies as the waste has a negative impact on the environment including groundwater whose resources are already low worldwide anand et al 2020 3 4 role of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage 2 10 15 20 and 30 g l 1 on the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto the soil surface was modelled at 10 mg l 1 initial concentration of the analytes and at ph 6 the role of adsorbent dosage was considered because studies have shown that the amount of the adsorbent controls the amount of active sites and hence the performance of the adsorbent adigun et al 2020 amarasinghe and williams 2007 the adsorption efficiency of cd and cu was not affected at all agricultural clay soil dosages fig 5b moreover there was no significant difference between the two elements p 0 05 on the contrary the adsorption efficiency of cr increased with increasing soil dosage and the adsorption efficiency was found to be 89 98 5 99 2 99 4 and 99 7 at 2 10 15 20 and 30 g l 1 the increasing adsorption efficiency of cr was due to increasing number of available sites for adsorption on the soil surface the results are consistent with obtained from other studies oskui et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the accessibility and availability of adsorption sites on the surface of the soil is controlled by adsorbent dosage thus the soil dosage must be 10 g l 1 in order to significantly and simultaneously adsorb the elements it should be noted however that as wastewater is constantly released into the soil the amount of active sites decreases which may lead to reduced accessible adsorbent dosage overtime the high adsorption efficiencies for cd and cu means that the agricultural soil has high affinity for these elements 3 5 effect of temperature on the adsorption of cu cd and cr the ability of the soil to uptake the elements may be influenced by seasonality mainly changing temperature hence the effect of temperature 275 278 283 288 293 298 303 308 and 313 k on the adsorption efficiency of cu cr and cd was simulated using phreeqc geochemical modelling and the results are presented in fig 6 akram et al 2017 khan et al 2020 the adsorption of cu was not affected by changing temperature and the maximum adsorption efficiency 99 9 was obtained at all temperatures the adsorption efficiency of cd was also high at all temperatures but slightly decreased at lower temperatures 275 293 k however statistical evaluation indicated that there was no significant difference between cd and cu most studies including batool et al 2017 kavand et al 2020 and khan et al 2020 indicated that the adsorption of cd and cu by adsorbents such activated carbon and biochar composites increased with increasing temperature the ability of the soil to significantly adsorb the elements makes the agricultural clay soil the best natural adsorbent for the elements at all seasons of the year moreover these studies show that the soil works better than commercial adsorbents the adsorption efficiency of cr decreased with temperature from 275 to 288 k but increased beyond 288 k until 303 k which was the cut off temperature the increase in adsorption efficiency was due to the increasing interaction between cr and the active sites alkherraz et al 2020 it is worth noting that even though the adsorption efficiency of cr fluctuated it was 99 for all temperatures meaning that the adsorption was significant a study by akram et al 2017 showed that the adsorption capacity of cr by biocomposite significantly decreases with increasing temperature further indicating that the agricultural clay soil works better than commercial and engineered materials this means that groundwater resources will be protected from pollution by the elements throughout the year if the concentration of cr is less than 20 mg l 1 3 6 effect of competing ions the effect of the presence of cations co2 li k zn2 ca2 pb2 mn2 na mg2 fe3 on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil was modelled at ph 6 15 g l 1 soil dosage and 10 mg l 1 of the analytes this effect was considered because the analytes exist with a host of other elements which may compete for binding sites and thus decrease the binding ability of the analytes zendelska et al 2014 the adsorption efficiencies of cu and cr were 99 and there was no significant difference between the two elements fig 7 a though the adsorption efficiencies were high a slight decrease in adsorption was observed the adsorption of cu2 was the least affected by the presence of cations and this might be due to the high electronegativity en of cu en 1 9 electronegativity of metal ions influences the strength of their adsorption ahmadijokani et al 2021 the more electronegative metal ions tend to form stronger covalent bonds with oxygen atoms which are mainly from silanol and aluminol groups on the surface of the agricultural soil elwell et al 2017 moreover the adsorption of cu2 may be through different adsorption mechanisms hence no effect on adsorption was observed amarasinghe and williams 2007 the adsorption efficiency of cd decreased with increasing concentration of competing ions in the presence of other cations cd competes with ions such as na and mg2 for the active sites of the agricultural soil zhang et al 2021 moreover these competing ions have the ability to desorb cd from the soil surface gomes et al 2001 cd is a soft lewis acid that is binding to a hard lewis base surface thus in the presence of hard lewis acids such as mg2 k and ca2 and borderline lewis acids such as zn2 and cu2 the adsorption of cd will not be highly preferred by the agricultural soil unlike cd cr3 which is a hard lewis acid cannot be easily displaced by other competing ions hence the adsorption efficiency was high this observation was also reported by gomes et al 2001 who conducted a study on competitive adsorption of heavy metals by brazillian soils and found that cr and cu were the most strongly adsorbed by the soil while cd was the least adsorbed in the presence of other competing cations though this study focused on the effect of ions on the adsorption of the analytes as they are introduced into the soil it is also important to assess the groundwater quality in the study area in order to determine if the soil active sites are still in a position to uptake elements the presence of increasing concentrations of the elements in groundwater may be an indication of exhausted actice sites the groundwater can be assessed using methods described by asadi et al 2020 and aryafar et al 2019 fig s4 shows phreeqc output file indicating agricultural clay soil active sites and analytes speciation affinity the results indicated that cd was mostly adsorbed by the weak and super strong sites of the agricultural clay soil cu on the other hand had high affinity for super strong sites whilst different species of cr were highly attracted to strong and super strong sites 3 7 effect of anions waste from mining and other industries is normally associated with anions that may interact with the analytes of interest zereini et al 2017 moreover many soils contain significant amounts of anions which can also migrate to waterbodies fallatah 2020 as a result the effect of the presence of anions f cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 and po4 3 on adsorption of cu cd and cr by the agricultural soil was simulated using phreeqc geochemical modelling more than 99 9 adsorption efficiency was obtained for cd and cu at all anions concentrations 0 000001 0 01 mol l 1 fig 7b this means that the presence of anions did not affect the adsorption of cd and cu which may also be due to the ability of some anions f and so4 2 to enhance adsorption liu et al 2018 furthermore phreeqc indicated that in the presence of anions the analyte major species 95 were in the form of cd2 cu2 and cr3 thus the analyte did not actively interact with anions e g cl that hinder adsorption otherwise the adsorption efficiency would have decreased with increasing concentration of anions liu et al 2018 only a small amount interacted with the anions hence the high adsorption efficiency observed the adsorption efficiency of cr increased with increasing concentration of anions and this may be due to the binding of some of the anions onto the soil wu et al 2019 phreeqc indicated that in presence of anions the unbound cr was in the form of crf2 cr oh 2 crh2po4 2 and cr oh 2 which increased as the concentrations of anions increased moreover the zeta potential can increase in the presence of anions i e increasing concentration of anions leads to increasing zeta potential of the soil which promotes the adsorption of the elements raza et al 2026 thus at ph 6 the elements will interact with the soil more than the anions present in the agricultural soil 3 8 effect of plant exudates when organic matter is decomposed into humus the microbial degradation occurs which converts humus into humic acids these humic acids are further degraded to low molecular weight acids such as malic oxalic acetic fumaric and citric acids naveed et al 2017 since the study area where the soil was collected is an agricultural plot it was imperative to determine the effect of plant exudates on the adsorption of the elements the effect of plant exudates citric acid and acetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil was simulated using phreeqc modelling edta was considered because it is a strong chelating agent found in industrial and household detergents king et al 2020 thus the mining and municipal wastewater can introduce edta into the agricultural soil the presence of plant exudates and edta has a significant effect on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil fig 7c the ability of the soil to adsorb reduced when plant exudates were introduced in the model the adsorption efficiencies of cd and cu significantly reduced as the concentration of plant exudates and edta increased the phreeqc output file indicated that more than 98 cd and cu were chelated by edta leading to the formation of cd edta 2 and cu edta 2 respectively these species were not in favourable forms for adsorption by the less positively charged soil at ph 6 hence a drastic decrease in adsorption was observed beyond 0 001 mol l 1 of edta 1 adsorption efficiency wu et al 2003 exposed edta to a paddy soil and monitored the desorption capacity of cd and cu from the soil they found that the concentrations of these elements increased after the exposure time and that the solubility of the elements increased leading to high bioavailability of the elements this means that cd and cu have strong interaction with edta other species such as cd citrate cu citrate cd acetate and cu acetate were also present but in small amounts the adsorption of cr in the presence of plant exudates was also low but its adsorption efficiency was 15 this adsorption was due to the available cr species which did not interact with any of the exudates and edta thus cd and cu are more susceptible to chelation than cr these results indicated that in the presence of plant exudates and edta the mobility of cd cu and cr to groundwater will increase this also means that the migration of these elements to groundwater is high in agricultural soils than in other soils due to the use of industrial and municipal wastewater 4 conclusion the ability of the agricultural soil to adsorb cd cu and cr to prevent their mobility to groundwater was investigated at different conditions using phreeqc geochemical computer modelling code coupled to pest phreeqc was able to accurately simulate the reactions occurring in soil interfaces phreeqc modelling code is an important tool to utilise in order to understand the fate and transport of elements in the environment without having to use expensive chemicals to conduct experiments which could also potentially consume a lot of time there was no significant difference between the modelled and measured results indicating that the same results from the simulations can be obtained from either field or laboratory experiments the study showed that the agricultural clay soil will adsorb cd cu and cr in contact with the soil but when other competing ions are available the adsorption of cd will reduce with the possibility of leaching to groundwater moreover the adsorption of cr by the soil will not be effective when the concentration of the element is 20 mg l 1 exudates released by plants or crops as well as edta from industrial and municipal wastewater will significantly reduce the adsorption of the elements groundwater resources in the vicinity of mining areas will be protected from trace elements pollution provided soils in the vicinity of mining plants can adsorb these elements this however may be problematic overtime due to possible exhaustion of soil active sites environmental computer models are very important as they can estimate the time it will take for soils to be exhausted by elements leading to increased mobility to groundwater this study further indicated that few laboratory or field experiments can be used to calibrate phreeqc geochemical modelling code coupled to pest in order to accurately estimate processes occurring in the environment thus computer models are the future to a sustainable environment and decision making 4 1 limitations of the study and future research the phreeqc geochemical modelling code does not take into consideration the possibility of the detachment of some elements from the soil when in contact with the analyte solution such elements may have increased the concentrations of the competing ions in solution the one dimensional transport modelling of the elements which include the advection dispersion advection dispersion and advection dispersion with diffusion into stagnant zones was not included in this study and should be investigated in the future beyond the agricultural soil used in the study there are other soil surfaces which may interact differently with the elements and should be investigated in the future using column adsorption experiments the study did not consider how long it would take for the soil active sites to be exhausted when particular concentrations of the elements are used and this is important for decision making such as the need for remediation in this study the same concentrations of the cations and anions were considered but in the real environment they exist in different concentrations therefore more studies that focus on the real concentration of each element involved in the study should be conducted the precipitates resulting from the mixture of the elements and the soil at different conditions were not taken into consideration and should be investigated in the future credit authorship contribution statement alseno k mosai conceptualization methodology software validation formal

24492,although minerals such as gold and platinum are important for improving life their processing comes with social and environmental problems during the processing of these minerals toxic elements such as cadmium copper and chromium are released along with wastewater into the environment including soils and surface water leading to plausible migration to groundwater the removal of these elements from aqueous solutions is of utmost importance however where no remediation is implemented the ability of the soil to retain the elements and prevent migration is crucial moreover there is a need for reliable and accurate computational modelling programs that requires minimum set of experiments for calibration in order to determine the success of the sorption of elements by natural and man made adsorbents since laboratory and field experiments can be expensive time consuming and often require repetition in this study the ability of an agricultural clay soil to adsorb and retain cadmium cd copper cu and chromium cr was investigated by simulating different conditions using phreeqc which stands for ph redox equilibrium written in the c language geochemical modelling code coupled to parameter estimation pest the role of ph 2 9 on the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto generalised weak strong and super strong sites of the agricultural soil was determined and used to calibrate the model the soil was found to be effective in preventing the mobility of cd cu and cr to groundwater however the presence of competing ions and plant exudates increased their mobility phreeqc geochemical modelling code coupled with pest was found to be a quick and a reliable tool to determine the performance of natural and man made adsorbents in different conditions thus phreeqc coupled to pest is a suitable decision making tool for environmental sustainability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption efficiency computational modelling groundwater pollution parameter estimation soil toxicity 1 introduction different devices including those used in medicine require precious elements such as gold rare earth elements platinum and copper which have unique physical and chemical properties cowley 2011 hanawa 2021 thus the processing of these minerals is important for improving the quality of life including the building of infrastructure and improving the economy in many countries liu et al 2019 however their processing comes with major social and environmental problems tayebi khorami et al 2019 mining processes such as grinding and concentration of ores as well as the disposal of tailings and mine wastewater introduce waste into the environment lèbre et al 2017 this waste contains trace elements such as cadmium chromium mercury and arsenic which are toxic and hazardous okereafor et al 2019 these elements can be transported from mining operation sites by natural factors such as wind and rain as well as from mine tailings by water erosion and wind erosion to nearby areas thus soils in the vicinity of mining operations are susceptible to contamination by these elements ciccu et al 2003 li and thornton 2001 some of these soils are agricultural soils used to grow different crops including cabbage spinach carrots and potatoes amongst others thus these elements can find their way into the crops and groundwater through the soil when consumed these elements have negative effects in the body as some have carcinogenic mutagenic and or teratogenic effects fakhri et al 2017 srivastava et al 2020 groundwater is considered an important resource for both living organisms and the environment jia et al 2019 it is used for domestic purposes in households and industries as well as for irrigation in agriculture most countries around the world rely on groundwater as a main source of sustainable water supply since groundwater makes more than 98 of the available freshwater hence it should be protected from pollution caused by mining and other industries gude 2018 water quality index wqi has been widely used to determine the groundwater quality by considering different parameters such as electrical conductivity total dissolved solids ph and concentrations of cations and anions asadi et al 2020 genetic programming and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis which are artificial intelligence methods have also been used to predict groundwater quality parameters aryafar et al 2019 these are all important methods however there is a need to determine entry sources so that they can be dealt with properly moreover a good quality of groundwater or low pollution level does not mean that the groundwater will be protected throughout hence a need to determine the possibility of future pollution as different elements are introduced into the environment a lot of research has focused on coming up with methods of treating groundwater so that is of good quality but this is not enough as the pollution problem will still persist it is therefore crucial to come up with methods that can determine the probability of groundwater pollution with time especially in areas where there is mining and processing which release elements into the air soil and water bodies geochemical modelling can be implemented for this purpose where the ability of soils to prevent the migration of elements to groundwater is assessed this is because elements some of which are toxic coming from the different industries will be in contact with the soil before reaching groundwater hence the soil was considered in this study there are various techniques which have been used to remove trace elements from the soil and these include chlorination ultrasonic thermal treatment nano remediation mechanical washing and bio mineralisation baragaño et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2020 li et al 2019 park and son 2017 however there is no remediation applied in most soils due to cost and the area that must be covered especially in under developed countries hence the ability of pollution susceptible soils to retain elements and prevent their mobility to groundwater and accessibility to plants must be investigated this will give an indication of the probability of groundwater pollution in the vicinity of mining and other industries releasing waste into the environment in this study clay soil from an agricultural plot in the vicinity of platinum group elements pges mining activities was used to determine its ability to retain cadmium cd copper cu and chromium cr which are normally found in high concentrations in such regions thus the adsorption process of the soil was investigated even though cu is an essential element in living organisms it can be toxic as it can inhibit cell metabolism when its concentration exceeds the maximum allowed limit ochoa herrera et al 2011 chromium was selected in this study because it can also be toxic to living organisms cr3 has been found to interact with dna mitochondria and lysosomes in living organisms leading to decreased cell viability and other conditions which may be permanent terpilowska and siwicki 2018 moreover at higher ph cr3 can be converted to cr6 which is more toxic even in very low concentrations 0 5 mg l 1 noah et al 2020 terpilowska and siwicki 2018 cadmium has been found to be very toxic at low concentrations and the international agency for research on cancer has classified it as a category i carcinogen reyes hinojosa et al 2019 thus the accessibility of these elements from soils susceptible to their pollution must be determined to indicate the level of safety of such soils their ability to reach groundwater which is widely used in everyday activities must also be investigated to determine the level of toxicity of groundwater nickel zinc and iron can also be found in high concentrations in mining wastewaters but their effect is not as harmful as that of the analytes most companies and researchers from different fields including chemistry molecular biology engineering physics and economics are currently using computer modelling to make important environmental management decisions which are within their calibration range schuwirth et al 2019 sophisticated and integrated computer simulation models are widely used for this purpose smolentsev et al 2020 these models are particularly important because they can accurately estimate future environmental possibilities such as water scarcity mineral scarcity level of pollution and climate change phreeqc geochemical modelling modflow zonebudget groundwater vistas and geological information system are amongst those used skidmore 2017 for this study a geochemical modelling code known as phreeqc which stands for ph redox equilibrium written in the c language was calibrated and used to simulate different conditions that may affect the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto the agricultural clay soil parkhurst and appelo 2013 computer modelling was adopted in this study because laboratory and field experiments can have limitations and uncertainties such as the absolute ph of solutions and equilibrium constants besides phreeqc geochemist s workbench software can be used but it is expensive and does not contain all crucial databases for modelling for better accuracy of the results the phreeqc model was coupled to parameter estimation pest which is computer software that assists with statistical analysis of data model calibration and predictive analysis it is used where model variables need to be altered until model generated numbers fit a set of data that was observed in the laboratory or field provided that certain continuity conditions are met doherty 2015 moreover many research institutions around the world are looking for quick solutions to determine environmental toxicity posed by different industries including mining and computational modelling may be the best answer 2 materials and methods the soil used was collected at a depth 20 30 cm five sampling points in the area were considered in a fallow proportion from an agricultural plot located in rustenburg south africa fig 1 rustenburg was selected because it has a significant number of agricultural plots in the vicinity of mining areas the fruits and vegetables grown in these plots are watered using groundwater and are sold throughout south africa thus if groundwater is negatively affected by mining a larger population ingesting the fruits and vegetables can be negatively affected the soil was collected in a polypropylene container and was treated in the laboratory where it was air dried unwanted particles and substances such as stones and plant particles were removed pestle and mortar were used to break down soil lumps and a 2 mm sieve was used to sieve the soil the soil was soil was stored in a polypropylene container until required 2 1 soil characterisation the chemical composition and the mineralogy of the soil were determined using x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical netherlands and powder x ray diffraction pxrd bruker d2 phaser germany respectively fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tensor 27 bruker germany was used to identify functional groups present in the 400 4000 cm 1 range micromeritics flow prep 060 instrument aachen germany was used to determine the surface area of the soil the characterisation results were used to build the phreeqc input script 2 2 reagents and standards all the chemicals used were obtained from sigma aldrich south africa and were of analytical grade 100 mg l 1 nitrate stock solution of a mixture of cd2 cu2 and cr3 were prepared by dissolving sufficient amounts of nitrate salts in 1 l deionised water with 0 05 v v hno3 the solutions were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c 2 3 calibration of the phreeqc model 2 3 1 batch laboratory experiments batch adsorption experiments were used to calibrate the phreeqc model the effect of ph on the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto the agricultural soil was used for this purpose 0 75 g of agricultural clay soil was added to 50 ml of 10 mg l 1 solutions containing a mixture of cd cu and cr at ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 naoh and hno3 were used to adjust the ph and a ph metre was used to determine the ph mettler toledo switzerland the solutions were shaken for 3 h optimised and equilibrated using an elliptical bench top shaker labcon usa at 150 rpm the solutions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 60 s the supernatants were filtered with 0 45 µm whatman filter paper whatman uk and the concentration of the elements at equilibrium was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes icp oes was selected over inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms because the samples had high total dissolved solids tds and the elements had higher regulatory limits moreover the samples used had higher concentrations of elements which would need dilution when using icp ms and this can affect the accuracy of measurement the experiments were conducted in triplicates and the percentage relative standard deviation rsd was used to treat the results obtained where less than 5 rsd was considered the adsorption efficiency was determined using eq 1 1 a d s o r p t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c i c e c i x 100 where ci and ce mg l 1 are initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively from here phreeqc geochemical modelling code was used to simulate the adsorption of the elements at different ph regions 2 3 2 phreeqc model phreeqc is a computer modelling program written in the c and c programming languages it is designed to perform aqueous geochemical calculations where elements in the aqueous solution interact with minerals solid solutions ion exchangers and sorption surfaces kinetic reactions with rate equations determined by the user can also be modelled parkhurst and appelo 1999 some of the most important capabilities of phreeqc include the ability to calculate saturation indices and the distribution of aqueous species there are different databases such as phreeqc dat sit dat wateq dat database which are incorporated into the phreeqc model a database can be selected based on the need of the user as each contain parameters and elements with specific conditions parkhurst and appelo 1999 phreeqc geochemical modelling software version 3 was used in this study the phreeqc model keywords and their functions are shown in table s1 in order to obtain accurate simulations the conditions used in the laboratory must be specified in phreeqc the conditions ph pe concentrations of the elements temperature and the amount of water of the aqueous solutions used during the laboratory experiments can be specified under the solution keyword fig s1 in order to obtain the relationship between the surface adsorption sites and the elements equilibrium and kinetic reactions should be interconnected in this study phreeqc geochemical modelling was used to simulate the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil under different environmental conditions the adsorption sites of the agricultural clay soil were generalised and specified in the phreeqc model as weak gs w strong gs s and super strong sites gs ss where gs generalised surface fig s1 the use of generalised composite surface complexation model presents a more generic approach that is independent of the actual sorbent mosai et al 2021 this approach is especially useful when detailed mineralogy is not available the generalised surface approach ensured that all the surface active sites were accounted for thus computer models can be used to account for aspects that laboratory or field measurements cannot account for alternatively the active sites involved can be added manually onto the input scrip however not all active sites would be accounted for because they may consist of unusual combinations which require robust experiments for identification this would take more time money and therefore defeat the purpose of this study which is mainly the fast determination of the ability of adsorbents to uptake different elements solution 1 as indicated in fig s1 was run on its own to determine the speciation of the elements at different ph values this run indicated that cd2 and cu2 were the major species of cadmium and copper respectively whilst the major species of chromium were cr3 cr oh 2 cr oh 2 and cr oh 3 these species were then used to build the phreeqc input script where the reactions between the agricultural soil surface active sites and the major species were specified fig s2 equilibrium constants log k from different sources for each reaction were specified in the model the generalised active sites selected for this study were obtained by trial and error most adsorbents have weak and strong sites hence they were considered to be present in the soil phreeqc enables the programmer to specify the number of moles of active sites the surface area and the mass of the adsorbent used fig s1 these were obtained from the characterisation studies the phreeqc minteq dat database was used as it contained all the elements and other parameters being studied upon identifying the active sites major species of the elements and the equilibrium constants of the reactions phreeqc was run to obtain an output script containing the adsorption efficiencies of the elements at different ph values this was to assess if the model was calibrated at 25 c however the simulated results obtained were significantly different p 0 05 from those obtained experimentally meaning that the phreeqc model was not calibrated compared to experimental results the modelled results showed lower adsorption capacities as a result of the equilibrium constants used this was mainly due to the fact that the surface used in this study was different from the surfaces used by other authors who determined the equilibrium constants relative to the surfaces they used komárek et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 thus the log k values of the reactions had to be correctly determined to obtain the correct log k values which are specific for the agricultural soil used parameter estimation pest was coupled to the phreeqc model pest is software that assists with statistical analysis of data model calibration and forward looking analysis predictive analysis it is used when model variables have to be altered until model generated numbers fit a set of data that was observed in the laboratory or field provided that certain continuity conditions are met i e until the fit between the model output and data observed in the laboratory or field is improved in the weighted least squares doherty 2015 pest requires three types of files to run properly viz template instruction and control files the template file contains the parameters that need to be optimised i e log k values and is similar to the model input file with the exception that log k values to be adjusted by parameter names the instruction file contains information about which values to use from the output file in order to calibrate the model the pest control file is considered as the master file as it brings together the template and instruction files it contains all the parameter values to be adjusted pest optimization algorithm initial and boundary values of model parameters and observations that the model output is going to be calibrated against lin and aarts 2012 these files were prepared on a text editor and details on how these files are prepared can be obtained from the pest manual doherty 2008 after the successful calibration the phreeqc model was then used to simulate the effect of initial concentrations 2 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 soil dosage 2 10 15 20 and 30

citric acid edta and acetic acid on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural clay soil 3 results 3 1 characterisation of the soil all the collected soil samples were analysed and there was no significant difference between them p 0 05 the dominant chemical components of the agricultural clay soil were determined using xrf and were found to be sio2 74 7 and al2o3 11 4 feo mgo and cao were also in significant amounts the results from pxrd also found sio2 in the form of quartz to be the dominant mineral fig s3 al2o3 montmorillonite na ca 0 3 al mg 2si4o10 oh 2 n h2o and cao were also detected thus sio2 and al2o3 formed a significant part of clay soil active sites the functional groups of the agricultural clay soil were determined with ftir and the results indicated the presence of oh stretching vibrations at 3600 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 which were ascribed to the hydroxyl groups and water molecules in the soil respectively fig 2 wójcik bania 2021 the peak at 3400 cm 1 may also be as a result of nh due to the presence of humic substances and amino acids peng et al 2017 the peak at 1658 cm 1 was ascribed to co stretching vibrations as a result of cooh from amino acids and humic substances in the soil chen et al 2020 this was also evidenced by the presence of ch bend vibrations and ch2 scissoring at 798 cm 1 and 1483 cm 1 respectively the strong peak approximately at 1000 cm 1 was due to the si o stretching vibrations which overlap with al o ahmed et al 2018 this further confirms the results obtained using xrf and pxrd these results were similar to those obtained by other researchers who characterised montmorillonite meaning that the soil was similar to other natural clay materials ahmed et al 2018 chen et al 2020 the surface area of the agricultural soil was found to be 85 m2 g 1 other chemical properties of the soil are shown in table s2 the characterisation results were used to specify the agricultural soil in the phreeqc model 3 2 calibration of the phreeqc model the effect of ph on the adsorption of cu cd and cr by the agricultural clay soil was determined experimentally and the results were used to calibrate the phreeqc model many studies have indicated that the ph has a major effect on the adsorption of different elements hence it was adopted in this study batool et al 2017 khan et al 2020 the log k values of all the reactions involved as indicated in fig s3 were accurately estimated by pest pest does this by changing the phreeqc output results until they are as close as possible to the observed laboratory measurements using a number of iterations if the modelled and measured data do not correlate p 0 05 pest will stop after reaching the maximum number of iterations this however is an indication that there is something missing in the model which could be omitted species and active sites that play a major role in adsorption the model will not be calibrated until the missing data is included table 1 shows a pest record file indicating correlation between the experimental and modelled results these results indicated that the phreeqc model was calibrated since there was no significant difference between the data p 0 05 moreover pest indicated that weak strong and super strong sites of the soil were involved in the adsorption of the elements the exclusion of any of these results will lead to a failed or statistically excluded calibration the pest determined log k values were included in the phreeqc input script and the calibrated model was used to determine the effect of ph on the adsorption of cd cu and cr the modelled results were compared with those determined from the laboratory experiments and they further concluded that the calibration was successful fig 3 the experimental and modelled results indicated that the adsorption efficiencies of cd and cu increased with increasing ph zhang et al 2021 studied the adsorption of pd2 and cd2 onto magnetic activated carbon at a ph range of 2 6 and found that the adsorption capacities were directly proportional to ph due to increasing negative character of the adsorbent thus the high concentration of h3o ions at highly acidic ph protonated the surface of the soil increasing the positive character of the soil as ph increased the surface of the soil became less positively charged and thus the affinity for positively charged elements increased with ph phreeqc indicated that the dominating species of cd and cu over a wide range of ph were cd2 and cu2 respectively hence their adsorption efficiency increased with ph fig 3a and b the low adsorption efficiency of cd and cu observed at ph 2 was due to the high positive character of the agricultural clay soil zhang et al 2021 phreeqc also indicated that at ph 9 cu oh 2 was in significant amount 40 meaning that the high adsorption efficiency observed fig 3b was due to a mixture of the adsorbed and precipitated copper fig 4 this then shows the importance of using phreeqc to determine the speciation of the elements so that the correct conclusion of the success of adsorption can be made similar results were obtained by zhou et al 2018 and mahmoud et al 2019 the dominating species of cr at acidic ph were found to be cr3 75 cr oh 2 and cr oh 2 adigun et al 2020 wang et al 2020 there was no significant difference p 0 05 on the adsorption of cr by the agricultural soil between ph 2 and ph 7 due to the dominating positively charged species in this ph region beyond ph 7 the adsorption efficiency drastically dropped because the dominating species were cr oh 3 45 and cro2 21 fig 3c the negatively charged species were repelled by the negatively charged soil surface due to high concentration of oh ions zhang et al 2021 thus beyond ph 7 cr either precipitates cr oh 3 or gets repelled leading to low adsorption capacity the observed adsorption efficiency of cr at ph 7 was due to the cr oh 2 and cr oh 2 species which were also in significant amounts moreover cr3 was converted to cr6 in the form of cro4 2 at ph 7 fig 4 wang et al 2020 therefore the mining and industrial wastewaters with ph 7 will lead to the low adsorption capacity of cu and cr which may increase their accessibility to crops and mobility to groundwater resources from this study ph 6 was selected as the optimum for the maximum adsorption of the elements by the agricultural soil 3 3 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial concentration 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 mg l 1 on the adsorption of cu cd and cr by agricultural clay soil was simulated using phreeqc geochemical modelling at ph 6 15 g l 1 and 25 c initial concentration was investigated in this study because studies have indicated that the performance of adsorbents can be highly dependant on the concentrations of the adsorbates batool et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 some of the modelled results from this study were compared with experimental results to confirm if the calibrated phreeqc model accurately simulates other conditions and it was found that the results correlate p 0 05 the results indicated that the adsorption of cd and cu was similar between 2 and 100 mg l 1 even though the cu adsorption was higher fig 5 a the adsorption of cr was only competitively higher between 2 and 20 mg l 1 after which the adsorption efficiency significantly decreased thus the adsorption of cr by the agricultural clay soil will be effective when the concentration of cr is 20 mg l 1 this means that the agricultural soil has affinity for cd and cu beyond 100 mg l 1 the adsorption of the elements drastically decreased which may be attributed to the availability of active sites khalfa et al 2021 thus the amount of soil used did not have enough active sites for the uptake of all the elements at 100 mg l 1 this means that at concentrations 100 mg l 1 15 g l 1 of the soil will be quickly occupied by the elements leading to fast saturation also this showed that the uptake of the elements by the agricultural soil is concentration dependant imamoglu and tekir 2008 assessed the adsorption of cu ii and pb ii onto activated carbon and found that the adsorption of these elements decreased as concentration increased due to the availability of insufficient adsorption sites at higher concentrations this study indicated that the adsorption of the elements was in the order cu cd cr the mobility of the elements to groundwater will increase at concentrations 100 mg l 1 this means that if the concentration of the elements reaching the soil is greater than 100 mg l 1 the soil will have to be treated in order to prevent mobility to groundwater resources moreover the study indicated that groundwater is likely to be highly affected by cr more than other elements due to its high mobility in concentrations 20 mg l 1 the results from this study alluded to the fact that the mining and other industries releasing waste into the environment should start using remediation technologies as the waste has a negative impact on the environment including groundwater whose resources are already low worldwide anand et al 2020 3 4 role of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage 2 10 15 20 and 30 g l 1 on the adsorption of cd cu and cr onto the soil surface was modelled at 10 mg l 1 initial concentration of the analytes and at ph 6 the role of adsorbent dosage was considered because studies have shown that the amount of the adsorbent controls the amount of active sites and hence the performance of the adsorbent adigun et al 2020 amarasinghe and williams 2007 the adsorption efficiency of cd and cu was not affected at all agricultural clay soil dosages fig 5b moreover there was no significant difference between the two elements p 0 05 on the contrary the adsorption efficiency of cr increased with increasing soil dosage and the adsorption efficiency was found to be 89 98 5 99 2 99 4 and 99 7 at 2 10 15 20 and 30 g l 1 the increasing adsorption efficiency of cr was due to increasing number of available sites for adsorption on the soil surface the results are consistent with obtained from other studies oskui et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the accessibility and availability of adsorption sites on the surface of the soil is controlled by adsorbent dosage thus the soil dosage must be 10 g l 1 in order to significantly and simultaneously adsorb the elements it should be noted however that as wastewater is constantly released into the soil the amount of active sites decreases which may lead to reduced accessible adsorbent dosage overtime the high adsorption efficiencies for cd and cu means that the agricultural soil has high affinity for these elements 3 5 effect of temperature on the adsorption of cu cd and cr the ability of the soil to uptake the elements may be influenced by seasonality mainly changing temperature hence the effect of temperature 275 278 283 288 293 298 303 308 and 313 k on the adsorption efficiency of cu cr and cd was simulated using phreeqc geochemical modelling and the results are presented in fig 6 akram et al 2017 khan et al 2020 the adsorption of cu was not affected by changing temperature and the maximum adsorption efficiency 99 9 was obtained at all temperatures the adsorption efficiency of cd was also high at all temperatures but slightly decreased at lower temperatures 275 293 k however statistical evaluation indicated that there was no significant difference between cd and cu most studies including batool et al 2017 kavand et al 2020 and khan et al 2020 indicated that the adsorption of cd and cu by adsorbents such activated carbon and biochar composites increased with increasing temperature the ability of the soil to significantly adsorb the elements makes the agricultural clay soil the best natural adsorbent for the elements at all seasons of the year moreover these studies show that the soil works better than commercial adsorbents the adsorption efficiency of cr decreased with temperature from 275 to 288 k but increased beyond 288 k until 303 k which was the cut off temperature the increase in adsorption efficiency was due to the increasing interaction between cr and the active sites alkherraz et al 2020 it is worth noting that even though the adsorption efficiency of cr fluctuated it was 99 for all temperatures meaning that the adsorption was significant a study by akram et al 2017 showed that the adsorption capacity of cr by biocomposite significantly decreases with increasing temperature further indicating that the agricultural clay soil works better than commercial and engineered materials this means that groundwater resources will be protected from pollution by the elements throughout the year if the concentration of cr is less than 20 mg l 1 3 6 effect of competing ions the effect of the presence of cations co2 li k zn2 ca2 pb2 mn2 na mg2 fe3 on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil was modelled at ph 6 15 g l 1 soil dosage and 10 mg l 1 of the analytes this effect was considered because the analytes exist with a host of other elements which may compete for binding sites and thus decrease the binding ability of the analytes zendelska et al 2014 the adsorption efficiencies of cu and cr were 99 and there was no significant difference between the two elements fig 7 a though the adsorption efficiencies were high a slight decrease in adsorption was observed the adsorption of cu2 was the least affected by the presence of cations and this might be due to the high electronegativity en of cu en 1 9 electronegativity of metal ions influences the strength of their adsorption ahmadijokani et al 2021 the more electronegative metal ions tend to form stronger covalent bonds with oxygen atoms which are mainly from silanol and aluminol groups on the surface of the agricultural soil elwell et al 2017 moreover the adsorption of cu2 may be through different adsorption mechanisms hence no effect on adsorption was observed amarasinghe and williams 2007 the adsorption efficiency of cd decreased with increasing concentration of competing ions in the presence of other cations cd competes with ions such as na and mg2 for the active sites of the agricultural soil zhang et al 2021 moreover these competing ions have the ability to desorb cd from the soil surface gomes et al 2001 cd is a soft lewis acid that is binding to a hard lewis base surface thus in the presence of hard lewis acids such as mg2 k and ca2 and borderline lewis acids such as zn2 and cu2 the adsorption of cd will not be highly preferred by the agricultural soil unlike cd cr3 which is a hard lewis acid cannot be easily displaced by other competing ions hence the adsorption efficiency was high this observation was also reported by gomes et al 2001 who conducted a study on competitive adsorption of heavy metals by brazillian soils and found that cr and cu were the most strongly adsorbed by the soil while cd was the least adsorbed in the presence of other competing cations though this study focused on the effect of ions on the adsorption of the analytes as they are introduced into the soil it is also important to assess the groundwater quality in the study area in order to determine if the soil active sites are still in a position to uptake elements the presence of increasing concentrations of the elements in groundwater may be an indication of exhausted actice sites the groundwater can be assessed using methods described by asadi et al 2020 and aryafar et al 2019 fig s4 shows phreeqc output file indicating agricultural clay soil active sites and analytes speciation affinity the results indicated that cd was mostly adsorbed by the weak and super strong sites of the agricultural clay soil cu on the other hand had high affinity for super strong sites whilst different species of cr were highly attracted to strong and super strong sites 3 7 effect of anions waste from mining and other industries is normally associated with anions that may interact with the analytes of interest zereini et al 2017 moreover many soils contain significant amounts of anions which can also migrate to waterbodies fallatah 2020 as a result the effect of the presence of anions f cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 and po4 3 on adsorption of cu cd and cr by the agricultural soil was simulated using phreeqc geochemical modelling more than 99 9 adsorption efficiency was obtained for cd and cu at all anions concentrations 0 000001 0 01 mol l 1 fig 7b this means that the presence of anions did not affect the adsorption of cd and cu which may also be due to the ability of some anions f and so4 2 to enhance adsorption liu et al 2018 furthermore phreeqc indicated that in the presence of anions the analyte major species 95 were in the form of cd2 cu2 and cr3 thus the analyte did not actively interact with anions e g cl that hinder adsorption otherwise the adsorption efficiency would have decreased with increasing concentration of anions liu et al 2018 only a small amount interacted with the anions hence the high adsorption efficiency observed the adsorption efficiency of cr increased with increasing concentration of anions and this may be due to the binding of some of the anions onto the soil wu et al 2019 phreeqc indicated that in presence of anions the unbound cr was in the form of crf2 cr oh 2 crh2po4 2 and cr oh 2 which increased as the concentrations of anions increased moreover the zeta potential can increase in the presence of anions i e increasing concentration of anions leads to increasing zeta potential of the soil which promotes the adsorption of the elements raza et al 2026 thus at ph 6 the elements will interact with the soil more than the anions present in the agricultural soil 3 8 effect of plant exudates when organic matter is decomposed into humus the microbial degradation occurs which converts humus into humic acids these humic acids are further degraded to low molecular weight acids such as malic oxalic acetic fumaric and citric acids naveed et al 2017 since the study area where the soil was collected is an agricultural plot it was imperative to determine the effect of plant exudates on the adsorption of the elements the effect of plant exudates citric acid and acetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil was simulated using phreeqc modelling edta was considered because it is a strong chelating agent found in industrial and household detergents king et al 2020 thus the mining and municipal wastewater can introduce edta into the agricultural soil the presence of plant exudates and edta has a significant effect on the adsorption of cd cu and cr by the agricultural soil fig 7c the ability of the soil to adsorb reduced when plant exudates were introduced in the model the adsorption efficiencies of cd and cu significantly reduced as the concentration of plant exudates and edta increased the phreeqc output file indicated that more than 98 cd and cu were chelated by edta leading to the formation of cd edta 2 and cu edta 2 respectively these species were not in favourable forms for adsorption by the less positively charged soil at ph 6 hence a drastic decrease in adsorption was observed beyond 0 001 mol l 1 of edta 1 adsorption efficiency wu et al 2003 exposed edta to a paddy soil and monitored the desorption capacity of cd and cu from the soil they found that the concentrations of these elements increased after the exposure time and that the solubility of the elements increased leading to high bioavailability of the elements this means that cd and cu have strong interaction with edta other species such as cd citrate cu citrate cd acetate and cu acetate were also present but in small amounts the adsorption of cr in the presence of plant exudates was also low but its adsorption efficiency was 15 this adsorption was due to the available cr species which did not interact with any of the exudates and edta thus cd and cu are more susceptible to chelation than cr these results indicated that in the presence of plant exudates and edta the mobility of cd cu and cr to groundwater will increase this also means that the migration of these elements to groundwater is high in agricultural soils than in other soils due to the use of industrial and municipal wastewater 4 conclusion the ability of the agricultural soil to adsorb cd cu and cr to prevent their mobility to groundwater was investigated at different conditions using phreeqc geochemical computer modelling code coupled to pest phreeqc was able to accurately simulate the reactions occurring in soil interfaces phreeqc modelling code is an important tool to utilise in order to understand the fate and transport of elements in the environment without having to use expensive chemicals to conduct experiments which could also potentially consume a lot of time there was no significant difference between the modelled and measured results indicating that the same results from the simulations can be obtained from either field or laboratory experiments the study showed that the agricultural clay soil will adsorb cd cu and cr in contact with the soil but when other competing ions are available the adsorption of cd will reduce with the possibility of leaching to groundwater moreover the adsorption of cr by the soil will not be effective when the concentration of the element is 20 mg l 1 exudates released by plants or crops as well as edta from industrial and municipal wastewater will significantly reduce the adsorption of the elements groundwater resources in the vicinity of mining areas will be protected from trace elements pollution provided soils in the vicinity of mining plants can adsorb these elements this however may be problematic overtime due to possible exhaustion of soil active sites environmental computer models are very important as they can estimate the time it will take for soils to be exhausted by elements leading to increased mobility to groundwater this study further indicated that few laboratory or field experiments can be used to calibrate phreeqc geochemical modelling code coupled to pest in order to accurately estimate processes occurring in the environment thus computer models are the future to a sustainable environment and decision making 4 1 limitations of the study and future research the phreeqc geochemical modelling code does not take into consideration the possibility of the detachment of some elements from the soil when in contact with the analyte solution such elements may have increased the concentrations of the competing ions in solution the one dimensional transport modelling of the elements which include the advection dispersion advection dispersion and advection dispersion with diffusion into stagnant zones was not included in this study and should be investigated in the future beyond the agricultural soil used in the study there are other soil surfaces which may interact differently with the elements and should be investigated in the future using column adsorption experiments the study did not consider how long it would take for the soil active sites to be exhausted when particular concentrations of the elements are used and this is important for decision making such as the need for remediation in this study the same concentrations of the cations and anions were considered but in the real environment they exist in different concentrations therefore more studies that focus on the real concentration of each element involved in the study should be conducted the precipitates resulting from the mixture of the elements and the soil at different conditions were not taken into consideration and should be investigated in the future credit authorship contribution statement alseno k mosai conceptualization methodology software validation formal

24493,graph theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities we developed the new general landscape connectivity model glcm as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans glcm is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology based measures neighbourhood habitat area ni and habitat link value li ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat the remaining ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of ecological carrying capacity for wildlife plants and animals li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region i e which is reported as summed ni across a region by virtue of providing the least cost linkages between concentrations of habitat mapped li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region s habitat network highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping stones and candidate areas for conservation and restoration due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design glcm addresses a number of criteria we list as important while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph theoretical approaches we present results for three south east australian case studies using continuous value ecological condition surfaces as input however a simple habitat non habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used glcm has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales and broader it incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes foraging dispersal and migration successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling law this approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations the operational advantages of glcm means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time series remote sensing of land cover or applied to alternative scenarios of land use ecological restoration climate projections or combinations of these keywords landscape connectivity ecological carrying capacity reporting multiple scales scaling law 1 introduction 1 1 landscape connectivity the ecological condition of a geographically defined space or location is a function of that location s ecological composition structure and function noss 1990 compared with a benchmark state gibbons and freudenberger 2006 the ecological connectivity between locations is a key determinant along with the representation of innate ecosystems margules and pressey 2000 to translating ecological condition at one spatial scale to ecological integrity at broader spatial scales i e connectivity makes a collection of habitat elements different to the sum of its parts batty and torrens 2005 drielsma et al 2018 with 2015 landscape connectivity the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches taylor et al 1993 is relevant to home range and dispersal movements seasonal migrations and climate induced shifts in species distributions baguette et al 2013 laliberté and st laurent 2020 wu 1999 these movement processes vary across species estes et al 2018 walker and salt 2012 spanning a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and functional granularities baguette and van dyck 2007 while many ecological processes remain poorly known complex or undiscovered baguette et al 2013 it is well understood that the survival of native populations in the wild relies to a large degree on connectivity between their habitats baguette et al 2013 doerr et al 2014 metzger and décamps 1997 noss 1987 zia et al 2011 while this is true in stable climatic conditions landscape connectivity performs a critical role facilitating migrations to meet the changing geography of habitat suitability due to climate change heller and zavaleta 2009 noss 1991 prober et al 2019 with habitat fragmentation and land use intensification continuing in many parts of the world and with the alarming pace of climate change maintaining landscape movement function has become a major goal of conservation plans fischer and lindenmayer 2007 prober et al 2019 watson et al 2017 worboys et al 2010 it follows that credible yet operationally practical landscape connectivity assessment is needed to inform conservation priorities and plans monitor trends in the levels of available or functional habitat and to report on the effectiveness of conservation actions in promoting habitat availability duflot et al 2018 fahrig 2013 laliberté and st laurent 2020 watson et al 2017 connectivity assessment can also act as a catalyst for community engagement in innovative conservation and land use planning meppem and gill 1998 by providing a link between local conservation action and big picture ecological processes such as broad scale and multi generational migration routes and habitat redistribution networks keeley et al 2019 regularly updated remote sensing is becoming increasingly available this opens the opportunity to operationalise workflows to produce streams of data that include connectivity assessment this allows closer monitoring of seasonal effects longer term trends and the progress of recovery from major disturbances such as australia s black summer bushfires in 2019 2020 godfree et al 2021 the distinction between structural and functional connectivity of habitats e g baguette and van dyck 2007 is often made doerr et al 2014 describes structural connectivity as anything that physically links separate populations in addition to contiguous corridors this definition includes stepping stones saura et al 2014 and more subtle habitat elements such as scattered trees or shrubs or even scattered clumps of tussock grass or coarse woody debris doerr et al 2014 critical connectivity thresholds have been demonstrated in relation to structural connectivity metzger and décamps 1997 however it is often pointed out that in practice the benefits of structural connectivity are rarely validated with empirical evidence doerr et al 2014 hodgson et al 2011 laliberté and st laurent 2020 while over emphasis on structural connectivity has been heavily critiqued hodgson et al 2011 hodgson et al 2009 moilanen 2011 it is nonetheless an enduring feature of conservation planning practice zeller et al 2020 according to baguette and van dyck 2007 functional connectivity refers to how the behaviour of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape structure and elements although functional connectivity is often aligned to the movements of individual species the relevance of the concept to higher levels of biological organisation sensu noss 1990 is less acknowledged aggregated across whole regions functional connectivity informs on the functional integrity of landscapes ludwig et al 2004 walston and hartmann 2018 woodwell 2002 close examination of the functional aspects of landscape connectivity inevitably leads to the question of connectivity for what biological entities can be genetic traits species species functional groups ecosystems or all of biodiversity thus we make the distinction here between species specific or even species process specific connectivity i e home range movements dispersals and migrations drielsma and ferrier 2009 and more broadly defined structural connectivity in the case of species specific connectivity the source destination path and movement abilities are explicitly linked to the biology of a defined species or functionally related group drielsma and ferrier 2009 drielsma et al 2016 drielsma et al 2020 scotts and drielsma 2003 broadly defined structural connectivity has been found to facilitate function more generally doerr et al 2010 1 2 analytic tools increasingly analytical tools are being deployed for mapping and reporting on landscape connectivity across regions correa ayram et al 2015 correa ayram et al 2017 least cost path analysis provides a powerful means for quantifying or mapping landscape connectivity however there are sustained concerns that this approach lacks ecological realism moilanen 2011 or should be better applied to account for functional movement processes sawyer et al 2011 zeller et al 2018 ferrarini 2014 describes two biologically improbable assumptions of using least cost paths 1 dispersers have complete knowledge of their surroundings and 2 they select the least cost route based on this information least cost path algorithms only consider the least cost route between pairs of locations ignoring both the added strength and redundancy to habitat networks provided by alternative routes moilanen 2011 and the influence of learned behaviour the application of circuit theory to landscape connectivity assessment in the program circuitscape dickson et al 2019 mcrae et al 2008 shah and mcrae 2008 overcomes the former deficiency by considering all paths between chosen endpoints however this is achieved at high computational cost per node pair path endpoints and so the number of node pairs that can feasibly be examined is limited the all paths approach works well in cases where connectivity assessment is sought between a limited number of known concentrations of habitat however the approach quickly becomes intractable in cases where extensive habitats form a fine grained heterogeneous continuum that lacks clear a priori endpoints for analysis ferrarini 2014 mcintyre and barrett 1992 wiens 1995 with et al 1997 in highly variegated environments represented by high resolution data large numbers of node pairs are required to adequately sample habitat across a region and the most pertinent nodes are not easily established environmental niche modelling of individual species provides a way to define potential distributions which can then be assessed for connectivity and individual assessments can be aggregated to represent multiple species correa ayram et al 2017 scotts and drielsma 2003 for many species and more generally within many environments it is problematic to represent large irregularly shaped patches with a single node doing this can lead to loss of information in terms of landscape heterogeneity with et al 1997 it introduces error if perfect connectivity is assumed within patches and when all parts of a patch are considered equally connected to all parts of other patches thus patch based approaches introduce a problem concerning the placement of nodes in large or irregularly shaped patches an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations has been developed uses continuous value rasters grids of species distributions drielsma and love 2021 drielsma and ferrier 2009 that approach builds on the cost benefit approach cba to measuring habitat configuration drielsma et al 2007a the cba and the spatial links tool slt drielsma et al 2007b are raster based least cost paths dijkstra 1959 graph theoretic approaches that overcome reliance on patch definition and provide a tractable solution to assessing large and complex landscape configurations the cba and spatial links tools have been used as stand alone applications for evaluating and mapping ecological carrying capacity and ecological connectivity love et al 2020 the cba approach has been integrated into species and community level persistence assessments for calculating potential occupancy and metapopulation capacity drielsma and love 2021 drielsma and ferrier 2009 an index of biodiversity persistence conservation benefits and unique diversity mapping drielsma et al 2014 drielsma et al 2020 and a measure of spatial resilience to climate change ferrier et al 2020 office of environment and heritage nsw 2016 1 3 taxonomic granularity landscape connectivity assessments that incorporate specific habitat and movement abilities of single species or a limited subset of all species are perceived to provide particular realism umbrella species are sometimes adopted as a strategy to represent many taxa using one or few high trophic level species e g baguette et al 2013 williams et al 2012 a single habitat connection can serve the needs of multiple species but characterising the entire biota using representative species will necessarily skew results towards well studied and iconic species cushman and landguth 2012 drielsma et al 2014 this concern has led to some assessments adopting hypothetical yet representative species hand et al 2014 noss 2007 or generic focal species doerr et al 2013 foster et al 2017 more generic level assessment can be helpful in two related ways firstly it can be used in lieu of the difficult task of measuring functional connectivity individually across the entirety of taxa which includes a number of species that are poorly understood or are unknown to science secondly and perhaps more aptly connectivity at the ecosystem level promotes general resilience defined as the capacity of social ecological systems to adapt or transform in response to unfamiliar unexpected and extreme shocks carpenter et al 2012 harwood et al in review however in no way do the strengths of ecosystem level or structural connectivity sensu doerr et al 2014 preclude or displace the need to explicitly address functional connectivity individually for highly valued individual species especially those at high risk of extinction in assessing landscape connectivity it is a significant challenge to adequately represent movement abilities across the full spectrum of life scaling laws help to bring order to otherwise seemingly overwhelming chaos loehle 2004 west and brown 2005 they apply to island biogeography whereby a species area curve can explain diminishing marginal gains in diversity as the area of habitat increases brown et al 2002 crawley and harral 2001 this reflects the diminishing potential for entry to a habitat patch by larger more mobile species and higher order predators with increasing patch area the concentration of diversity among invertebrate fauna and smaller plant life and the statistical chance of colonisation power law relationships have also been found to describe the distribution of body size among animals marquet et al 2005 body mass and home range size gompper and gittleman 1991 jetz et al 2004 rosten et al 2016 body size and mean average travel distance rosten et al 2016 and the frequency of movement and distance travelled by individual species ramos fernández et al 2004 1 4 towards a new way to assess landscape connectivity we set out to develop a landscape connectivity assessment approach that was generic across biodiversity we developed the new general landscape connectivity model glcm to automate connectivity assessment based on a single spatial input of pre defined land cover or ecological condition the approach adopts a fractal design founded on the self similarity of movement processes that can be assumed across spatial scales and which can be described by a power law the glcm builds a model of landscape connectivity networks comprising complex patterns through repeated application of a simple least cost path algorithm across geographic space and across spatial scales drawing on spatial data of land cover or ecological condition and a minimal set of movement related parameters in developing glcm we sought to addresses a range of criteria we find to be important or beneficial in assessing broad scale landscape connectivity at least within the context of eastern continental australia these criteria are listed in table 1 glcm combines in a scripted environment the cba and slt thereby incorporating analysis of both spatial context and link value we substantially enhanced the cba and the slt software for computation efficiency and expanded node sampling to effectively consider all feasible least cost paths across a study region glcm generates cross scale or scale agnostic measures of neighbourhood habitat area hanski 1999 and habitat link value drielsma et al 2007b it maps functional connectivity generically across multiple scales theoretically accounting for the movement abilities of multiple species and modes of movement home range dispersal and migration as such glcm provides a basis for aspects of conservation planning such as no regrets conservation actions to address loss of ecological function arising from clearing of habitat and climate change prober et al 2019 in this paper we describe the methods underlying glcm and present three case studies applied to south eastern australia to illustrate differing ways arising from how the input data is formulated in which glcm can be usefully applied these case studies have largely been described in published project reports but here we consolidate the general approach and place glcm within the broader context of landscape connectivity assessment methodologies to both inform conservation planning and to report on status and trends we argue that glcm provides a unique perspective on habitat networks that captures sufficient realism in landscape connectivity across spatial scales while providing operability that facilitates periodic updates for monitoring and reporting through the case studies we demonstrate glcm s flexibility to map connectivity networks semi generically across three structurally distinct habitat types case study 1 to generate generic landscape connectivity mapping and connectivity indicators for jurisdictional reporting for new south wales australia case study 2a and for the sydney basin bioregion of australia at higher spatial resolution case study 2b and to consider temporal and spatial connectivity in the context of climate induced shifts to environmental niches case study 3 2 methods 2 1 a dual perspective on landscape connectivity glcm combines dual perspectives on region wide habitat networks duflot et al 2018 fig 1 using a simple raster geometry to span ecological scales fig 2 neighbourhood habitat area ni is the amount of structurally connected extant habitat at each location denoted i weighted by its functional connectivity to i box 1 provides a glossary of key terms used in this paper a high value for ni indicates that for i there is high availability of connected habitat quantity and or quality presumably providing the resources that support individuals and populations of species typically found at the location ni summed across a region provides a useful indicator of the functional integrity for that region habitat link value li is the contribution of a location denoted i to the functional integrity of a study region li mapped across a region provides a visualisation of a study region s connectivity network this mapping can be used to inform the connectivity strategy priorities for improving the persistence of biodiversity by highlighting opportunities for conserving enhancing and building habitat networks between concentrations of high quality habitat baguette et al 2013 noss 1991 as ni and li are calculated across multiple scales we can assume that they encompass all forms of organism movement processes foraging dispersal and migrations ni and li originate from metapopulation ecology hanski 1999 initially they were applied to habitat represented by variably sized circular habitat patches glcm provides higher level configuration that repeatedly and systematically increments calculations of ni and li across ecological scales using standardised parameterisation ni is operationalised for raster data using the cba tool drielsma et al 2007a and li is derived using the spatial links tool drielsma et al 2007b 2 2 neighbourhood habitat area ni neighbourhood habitat area ni is calculated as 1 n i j h j w i j where hj is the amount of habitat quantity and quality of each neighbourhood cell indexed by j connected by a least cost path to i this formulation of neighbourhood habitat area is close to hanski s hanski 1999 connectivity of a patch i but here we consider habitat at the source by allowing i to equal j drielsma and love 2021 permeability to movement across a grid cell i can be calculated as w i e α d i where 1 α is the average movement ability being analysed and di is the cost distance of traversing cell i with both given in the same units in our case meters the concept of cost distance can be considered inverse to permeability i e dij 1 α ln w ij and is calculated in our case by scaling up the euclidean distance across i orthogonal grid cell size by any loss in its habitat value thus wij is a function of the amount of habitat traversed the structural component scaled relative to the movement ability being assessed the functional component once summed across j ni represents the amount of structurally connected habitat weighted by its functional connectivity to i a single petal configuration which is chosen to achieve balance between computational demand and ecological rigor drielsma et al 2007a is used throughout any given calculation of ni 2 3 habitat link value li habitat link value li is calculated based on the colonisation potential of a patch hanski 1999 2 l i j k h j h k w j k where wjk is the permeability of the habitat link connecting end nodes j and k and where grid cell i is either an end node i e i j or i k or is an element of a set of nodes that form the least cost path between the end nodes i e i j and i k habitat links are calculated as least cost paths connecting units of habitat sensu drielsma and love 2021 the value of a habitat link is derived from the overall connectivity the link provides to the habitat network based on path length and the quality of the habitat it traverses and connects as least cost paths are solved for each pair of j and k and across scales habitat link values are accumulated at each grid cell i that forms part of each link thus a grid cell s final value of li accounts for the number of traversing habitat links and the connectivity value of those links to the habitat network a habitat link may comprise a mix of environments along its path thus high li indicates a location that provides connectivity between habitats supporting ecological processes but each location along a path may not be of high habitat value itself 2 4 operationalising connectivity metrics operationally deriving ni and li both involve solving single source shortest path trees rooted at each grid cell location with least cost paths visiting every neighbourhood location within specified search constraints for ni neighbourhood locations j may either be individual grid cells within a predetermined analysis window centred on i or aggregations of those grid cells into petals drielsma et al 2007a to improve computational performance for li locations j and k are grid cells within a maximum search radius of each other beyond which paths would be irrelevant wjk approaches 0 as distance exceeds 1 a and are therefore not solved a minimum habitat threshold hmin can be used when selecting j and k to avoid solving low valued paths that are unlikely to add appreciable value to any li a moving analysis window used for ni centred on i and latter implementations of li centred on j is used to measure the connections between each grid cell as a focal grid cell out to all neighbourhood locations for each ni habitat link values are accumulated at the focal grid cell i for li values are accumulated at each grid cell forming part of the least cost path according to the colonisation potential calculated for the path 2 5 spatial inputs glcm requires up to two geospatial raster inputs land cover or ecological condition or equivalent representation of habitat ecosystem or vegetation quality data and habitat permeability respectively these represent the habitat resource or benefit at path nodes and the relative inverse perspective of cost distance to biota of traversing each location drielsma and ferrier 2006 the ecological condition grid represents each location s capacity to provide the resources necessary to support plant and animal species native to an area calculated relative to an ideal reference state for the location these measures are not produced within glcm as they re fit for purpose user defined inputs e g harwood et al 2016 love et al 2020 williams et al 2021 we employ a raster based grid data structure whereby ecological condition and habitat permeability values for each grid cell are the estimated average value within the grid cell s extent glcm then considers the grid cell s broader landscape context habitat condition and permeability can be represented simply as binary high versus low grid cell values or as for the three case studies presented below continuous valued surfaces mcintyre and barrett 1992 wiens 1995 with 2015 the spatial resolution of input rasters determines that of the combined outputs finer grain source data is preferred as it increases the potential bandwidth of ecological scales represented in the analysis allowing it to account for more local movements associated with less space demanding and less mobile species ideally habitat permeability is generated as a separate input along with ecological condition optionally permeability can be calculated within glcm by applying a linear transformation of ecological condition into cost distance as a proxy for movement ability e g see love et al 2020 in our case studies see section below a minimum cost distance assigned to highest quality habitat was set to the euclidean orthogonal grid cell size the maximum cost distance for grid cells devoid of habitat was calculated by multiplying the grid cell size by a cost ratio denoted ɛ of 2 5 permeability wi values for average movement abilities being analysed at each scale were then calculated from hi linearly scaled between these minimum and maximum cost distances the selected value of ɛ is a defining trait of any glcm analysis following parameterisations in a number of studies e g drielsma et al 2016 drielsma et al 2017 we chose a cost ratio value of ɛ 2 5 which we consider provides an acceptable balance in trading between alternative movement profiles a higher cost ratio limits exploration of higher cost regions in the grid as wij decays more rapidly resulting in lower values for ni and li a lower cost ratio allows paths to traverse higher cost regions further before their contribution to ni or li becomes insignificant potentially increasing connectedness of habitat and ultimately resulting in higher connectivity values overall to investigate if our models were overly influenced by our choice of ɛ we conducted a sensitivity analysis on case study 2 see supplementary s9 2 6 the scaling approach a simple raster geometry is employed within glcm to sample ni and li uniformly across ecological scales whereby each scale is subjected to an identical analysis in terms of analysis window dimensions number of grid cells range of grid cell permeability values and for the ni analysis the petal configuration used e g see fig 3 a sampling across spatial scales is informed by a power law such that at each successive sampling starting with the original data s finest granularity potential movement ability 1 a and grid cell size are doubled hence the spatial resolution of the analysis is systematically halved i e to coarser granularity brown et al 2002 drielsma et al 2018 see box 2 complexity is managed in this process by working with number of cells rather than geographic distance as distance units which remain constant across the spatial scales a jittering process see figure 3b and supplementary s5 was applied to all but the finest scale analysis whereby multiple shifted grid cell offsets love et al 2020 are used to resample the finest scale source data ecological condition and permeability to each coarser resolution with jittering grid cell offsets are shifted a fraction of the coarser grid cell size in both the x and y directions so that in each instance of spatial scale and offset the aggregation of source grid cells into coarser analysis grid cells is unique thus the jittering process reduces information loss that usually results when a single grid origin for resampling is chosen and it improves visual representation see table 1 by reducing the imprint of grid cell circumscription artefacts which would otherwise prevail in output maps ni and li analysis are performed independently using matching scaling parameters for each offset within each resolution love et al 2020 2 7 aggregation stage the final aggregation across scales offsets and methods ni and li is set to the source data s original finest resolution using a simple schema e g see supplementary s4 as all the required influence across scales is handled in the scaling power law approach aggregation of components requires limited standardisation to achieve the aim of equal weighting across scales we only need to account for differences in the number of offsets analysed at each resolution in the final aggregation the ecological condition surface itself is also included as a component of ni at its original resolution as it implicitly represents ni within the bounds of each grid cell assuming perfect connectivity within the grid cell wij 1 0 this equates to hi 3 results we present three case studies for comparison each has been described in separate project reports case study 1 drielsma et al 2012 case study 2 love et al 2020 and case study 3 drielsma et al 2015 the case studies cover overlapping sub continental study regions in south eastern australia see top of fig 4 they illustrate a diversity of applications as well as an evolution of the glcm approach in terms of methods data and software see table 2 zoomed in examples of spatial inputs and outputs for the three case studies are provided in fig 4 and for their complete extent in supplementary s1 s2 s3 and s8 supplementary s5 also presents an additional fine scaled analysis using case study 2 methods but is a local application for the greater sydney region to help instil landscape connectivity into the nsw greening our city program to increase the tree canopy and green cover across greater sydney by planting 1 million trees by 2022 new south wales government 2017 thus we refer to case study 2a all of nsw and case study 2b the greater sydney region details of the methods for each case study are provided in supplementary s4 s5 and s6 the three case studies are nested within a common study region comprising major urban population and growth centres surrounded by fragmented grassland and woodland habitats within an intensively farmed sheep wheat agricultural region a high diversity of ecosystems ranging from desert rangelands to sub tropical rainforests and alpine woodlands and heath over 870 national parks and public reserves in the state of new south wales an extensive network of travelling stock route reserves lentini et al 2013 extensive areas likely to be critical to carbon sequestration forestry polglase et al 2011 a key part of the great eastern ranges conservation connectivity corridor mackey et al 2010 and the gondwana rainforests and greater blue mountains unesco listed world heritage areas for each case study a suitable buffer area c 200 km was added to avoid edge artefacts arising from the analysis where necessary ecological condition data to fill the buffer extent were derived using a less rigorous methodology love et al 2020 water and sea were considered high quality ecological condition to ensure connections with coastal areas were not inappropriately devalued the ecological condition surfaces used as inputs to the three case studies were derived semi inferentially through an aggregation of information from multiple sources including remotely sensed measures of vegetation cover love et al 2020 remotely sensed foliage projective cover fpc was used to estimate a woody cover component of ecological condition raw fpc values were transformed using logistic functions with inflection points set to lower bound thresholds based on benchmarks with high perceived condition for different vegetation types ayers et al 2005 drielsma et al 2012 transformed fpc values were combined across vegetation types and further modified based on tenure land use and land cover to provide the best available indication of understory and ground cover ecological condition dillon et al 2009 case study 2a included an additional measure of stable green vegetation based on landsat derived fractional cover metrics stable green vegetation combines measures of annual mean green vegetation cover with its mean intra annual range over a 10 year period this was included in modified landscapes where it was qualitatively found to provide a useful gradient between frequently cropped or heavily grazed lands and those less intensively utilised lands which have consistently higher ground cover love et al 2020 3 1 case study 1 connections of three vegetation structural classes case study 1 see supplementary s4 for methods and s1 for results was developed to support conservation and restoration activities undertaken as part of the great eastern ranges initiative a connectivity conservation initiative focused on the great dividing range and the great escarpment which runs the length of eastern australia mackey et al 2010 in contrast to case studies 2 and 3 which considers a single generic entity case study 1 considers 3 entities of vegetation structural classes open forest closed forest and woodland case study 1 therefore involved three separate parallel analyses one for each of three vegetation structural classes 3 2 case study 2 landscape connectivity of new south wales case study 2a see supplementary s2 s5 s7 and s8 presents an assessment undertaken as part of the new south wales biodiversity indicator program in which the ecological condition indicator was further developed into indicators of ecological connectivity and ecological carrying capacity love et al 2020 using a glcm analysis at 90 m grid cell resolution case study 2a was greater in extent and finer grained compared to case study 1 the application employed a single continuous surface of ecological condition improvements to software performance after the case study 1 analysis allowed an all pairs analysis using higher resolution input data the all pairs approach generates every plausible path from every grid cell to every other grid cell within the bounds of parameterised search constraints the parameterised constraints used by the approach include a maximum search radius and maximum effective path distance beyond which least cost paths are mathematically implausible maximum attainable wij beyond the threshold is insignificant and are not generated and a minimum ecological condition threshold below which sites cannot contribute due to very low hi and are therefore not processed as path nodes case study 2 included the development of ni as a regional nsw state wide indicator of ecological carrying capacity baguette et al 2013 department of planning industry and environment nsw 2020 love et al 2020 ni is aggregated across the study region to report on the proportion of all possible original pre disturbance or benchmark connected habitat that remains denoted nr within a given habitat network or scenario 2 nr ni n i where ni is the original or benchmark ni at each location which is constant across a region but for operational purposes is calculated in order to account for edge effects near the study region boundary in case study 2a ni and li are not combined into a single spatial layer rather summed ni evaluates the total connectivity for a region and mapped li provides a graph or map of the connectivity network or can also be considered a measure of the contribution of each location to the network fig 5 focuses on a portion of the case study 2a extent showing outputs for each scale granularity combination as well as the combined output maps of the combined li output for the entire extent of case study 2a is provided in supplementary s2 and s8 case study 2b see supplementary s5 follows the general methods of case study 2a but is calculated at significantly higher spatial resolution 2 32 metres cell size 3 3 case study 3 south east australia climate change connections case study 3 drielsma et al 2017 drielsma et al 2015 and see supplementary s6 applies the li approach used in case study 1 to explicitly define habitat networks within the context of shifting ecological niches due to climate change thus this example was developed as an aid to regional climate adaptation planning by identifying candidate areas for climate ready conservation management and ecological restoration the approach is part of an active area of model development that includes employing a climate informed analogy of ni as an indicator of spatial resilience to climate change harwood et al in review 4 discussion conservation decision making is typically mired by high levels of epistemological uncertainty burgman 2005 and complexity that calls for pluralist perspectives funtowicz et al 1999 this issue is amplified when decision making is directed at vast geographic areas multitudes of biota environments interactions and uncertain futures prober et al 2019 prober et al 2017 it follows that a variety of fit for purpose assessment approaches are needed including ones that can readily generate generic assessment across broad regions the architecture of glcm circumvents the complexity of ecological systems by embracing detail in spatial data which can be readily captured with new and emerging technologies while adopting simple assumptions within a fractal framework to account for movement processes which are not well known collectively across all taxa the approach offers a useful supplement to field based assessment that can otherwise lack broad perspective rather than focusing on actual or putative species or species functional groups glcm considers a wide band of spatial scales and granularities that are reflective of a comprehensive range of biological movements cushman and landguth 2012 noss 1991 rayfield et al 2016 as such it is fit for purpose for operationalising assessment of landscape connectivity across broad regions and for setting priorities for conservation actions aimed at building general ecological resilience across regions e g jalkanen et al 2020 however this generic approach has not been developed to enable detailed planning for the conservation of individual highly threatened species the latter requires species specific parameters based on empirical evidence of individual species movement biology and ecological requirements e g landi et al 2018 4 1 the three case studies the results from the three case studies differ in a number of ways due to how each approached the problem of scale and resolution the use of ecological entities species ecosystems and in case study 3 ecological forecasting clark et al 2001 in general terms case study 1 and 3 were designed to provide regional to sub continental scale perspectives with case study 3 being configured to capture expected ecosystem migration pathways due to climate change case study 2 is a finer grained current climate scenario perspective that provides a clearer view of ecological network processes at the landscape scale than at broader scales in general the results from the three case studies highlighted the uneven distribution of connectivity remaining in the variably utilised landscape of south eastern australia reflecting the uneven impacts of land use and intensification across the study area along the coast many areas of native vegetation have been removed to accommodate urban development infrastructure and a mosaic of productive and intensive land uses native vegetation remains relatively intact along the slopes and ranges where land is more rugged where soils often have lower fertility and where a higher level of protection is afforded by extensive conservation reserves pressey et al 1996 much of the native vegetation in the more arable central part of the case study region has been highly modified or degraded or replaced with cropping and grazing systems the native vegetation that remains is often along roadsides travelling stock route reserves lentini et al 2013 riparian zones of waterways or in smaller nature reserves insights gleaned from the case studies included confirmation of the north south great eastern ranges corridor as a continental scale spine of connectivity paralleling the australian east coast and augmented with a number of often tenuous east west linkages coastal to inland that are likely to be critical for faunal climate migrations toward cooler moister coastal habitats and the critical role of large remnant patches such as the pilliga forest in the otherwise heavily fragmented central region of the new south wales state jurisdiction more detailed patterns can be discerned when the data is viewed at finer resolutions this is well illustrated by the greater sydney region assessment case study 2b which goes down to 2 metre resolution there the role of parkland street trees roads and infrastructure can be discerned case study 2 provides a rare example of how landscape connectivity is actually being monitored watson et al 2017 across a large datasets 4 2 using glcm to guide management and report on change the case studies provided a source of information for land managers and policy makers to explore how decisions and actions at local scales can support retention maintenance or strengthening of ecological networks at regional and larger scales glcm provides a data driven evaluation and visualisation of a region s complete suite of habitat networks including the relative ecological strength of links the spatial context of locations connectivity pinch points and barriers to movement although exact delineation of these features requires additional context specific interpretation these features are illustrated in example spatial products from the case study 2a analysis fig 6 provides a detailed map from an example landscape in southern nsw comprising less than 2 of the full analysis extent for case study 2a supplementary s8 provides the map for all of nsw the highlighted areas in fig 6 show examples of features which can lead to on ground targeted management actions to protect or enhance landscape connectivity these maps provide an index of the contribution of each location to landscape connectivity in their current state this information when used in conjunction with complementary information helps to highlight places where ecological restoration could be most effective in strengthening existing ecological networks 4 3 glcm and its place alongside alternative approaches glcm was designed to address ecological network function gaston 2010 generically across all biodiversity including common species and presumably unknown species which would otherwise be overlooked we argue that glcm best meets the criteria we listed in table 1 as a whole at least in respect to the demand we encounter for generic broad scale landscape connectivity assessment in nsw australia although we do not offer a systematic review of alternative methods for assessing landscape connectivity we recognise that alternative approaches can also address individual criteria to varying degrees as well as additional criteria not listed here in respect to some criteria alternative approaches can also outperform glcm for example the approach of lechner et al 2015 is superior in respect to computational speed and therefore interactivity while it doesn t recognise the variegation of landscapes that glcm can and due to computational considerations glcm draws on least cost paths only and cannot feasibly include all paths analysis as circuitscape does but for only a limited set of path nodes glcm provides an assessment of the strength of habitat links based on the quanta of habitat at link nodes and the permeability of links it does not seek to assess persistence as other complementarity based approaches do e g see drielsma et al 2014 drielsma et al 2012 ferrier and drielsma 2010 moilanen et al 2009 however glcm has been successfully integrated into one such assessment see drielsma et al 2020 each species interacts with the landscape in a unique way that cannot be understood from a portrayal of generic landscape connectivity alone e g delmas et al 2019 where the consequences of ill informed decisions can lead to extinctions more detailed information including field based observations and more biologically detailed and persistence based assessments may be needed foster et al 2016 poiani et al 2000 possingham et al 1993 taylor et al 2016 for such cases some of the authors have developed an approach drielsma and love 2021 drielsma and ferrier 2009 that also addresses most of the criteria in table 1 while it contrasts with glcm s genericism by working with individual species distribution models informed by biological data and by applying species specific movement abilities within a metapopulation persistence framework 4 4 the mathematical model the all pairs approach implemented in glcm allows for a consistent and controlled sampling of entire study regions this prevents the problem of over sampling paths in areas with a greater proportion of intact quality habitat and under sampling or ignoring degraded areas and small patches which are prevalent in many regions under sampling the low quality or highly fragmented habitat would undervalue the important marginal contributions of remnant habitat in partially cleared landscapes such as stock reserves or paddock trees in the highly fragmented nsw wheat sheep agricultural region of central nsw australia law et al 2000 lentini et al 2011 sampling bias was completely removed in the most recent version of glcm case study 2 by implementing a complete all pairs sampling strategy allowing the algorithm to resolve patterns of habitat connectivity more efficiently than with the heuristic approach adopted in case study 1 and 3 the all pairs approach is also fully deterministic which ensures repeatability and consistency across space and across any set of scenarios we expect that glcm s scaling approach along with the use of petals and jittering diminishes over reliance on single scale least cost by capturing wider links at successively coarser spatial scales and by examining all pairs of feasible nodes including multiple proximal nodes this ensures that many alternative paths relevant to different species and modes of movement are captured so while glcm does not consider all alternative paths between individual node pairs it does not do all paths it comprehensively captures potential node pairs across space and across scales 4 5 the generic approach glcm can also be applied to actual species or species groups where scale resolution and habitat quality are informed by knowledge of the biological entities chosen correa ayram et al 2017 we justify our generic approach demonstrated by the three case studies in terms of its ability to consider the otherwise intractable complexity of multiple taxa in variegated environments through time glcm provides pragmatic information in data poor settings and augments more detailed species or community level assessments which might lack geographic coverage or which are biased towards a limited set of biological entities the generic approach has implications for its use the promotion of landscape connectivity is intended to reduce pressures affecting the viability of populations generally and to ensure that ecosystem processes remain intact gaston 2010 5 conclusion glcm utilizes ecological theory to integrate habitat value with connectivity across a network it considers all pairs connectivity across a region within a computationally optimised application and is designed to operate across the full range of habitat values present in a region using continuous valued raster data this alleviates the need to define or assign weights to discrete habitat patches or make a priori judgements as to which habitat nodes to include in an analysis the approach can be applied consistently and repeatedly to large regions represented by highly granular complex models of ecological condition given sufficiently detailed input data glcm allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations glcm outputs can be used for reporting on status and trends in landscape connectivity and for contributing to broad scale conservation planning or localised actions that seek to build or strengthen habitat networks to support biodiversity persistence especially through climate change the operational advantages of glcm mean that landscape connectivity assessment can be practically updated with refined or changed inputs including time series of remotely sensed data or it can be applied to alternative scenarios of land use restoration climate projections or combinations of these 5 1 software the neighbourhood habitat area analysis for calculating ni is performed using the spatial cba tool drielsma et al 2007a and li was calculated using the spatial links tool drielsma et al 2007b both are part of a larger biodiversity tools software package that s

24493,graph theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities we developed the new general landscape connectivity model glcm as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans glcm is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology based measures neighbourhood habitat area ni and habitat link value li ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat the remaining ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of ecological carrying capacity for wildlife plants and animals li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region i e which is reported as summed ni across a region by virtue of providing the least cost linkages between concentrations of habitat mapped li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region s habitat network highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping stones and candidate areas for conservation and restoration due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design glcm addresses a number of criteria we list as important while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph theoretical approaches we present results for three south east australian case studies using continuous value ecological condition surfaces as input however a simple habitat non habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used glcm has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales and broader it incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes foraging dispersal and migration successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling law this approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations the operational advantages of glcm means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time series remote sensing of land cover or applied to alternative scenarios of land use ecological

the ecological condition of a geographically defined space or location is a function of that location s ecological composition structure and function noss 1990 compared with a benchmark state gibbons and freudenberger 2006 the ecological connectivity between locations is a key determinant along with the representation of innate ecosystems margules and pressey 2000 to translating ecological condition at one spatial scale to ecological integrity at broader spatial scales i e connectivity makes a collection of habitat elements different to the sum of its parts batty and torrens 2005 drielsma et al 2018 with 2015 landscape connectivity the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches taylor et al 1993 is relevant to home range and dispersal movements seasonal migrations and climate induced shifts in species distributions baguette et al 2013 laliberté and st laurent 2020 wu 1999 these movement processes vary across species estes et al 2018 walker and salt 2012 spanning a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and functional granularities baguette and van dyck 2007 while many ecological processes remain poorly known complex or undiscovered baguette et al 2013 it is well understood that the survival of native populations in the wild relies to a large degree on connectivity between their habitats baguette et al 2013 doerr et al 2014 metzger and décamps 1997 noss 1987 zia et al 2011 while this is true in stable climatic conditions landscape connectivity performs a critical role facilitating migrations to meet the changing geography of habitat suitability due to climate change heller and zavaleta 2009 noss 1991 prober et al 2019 with habitat fragmentation and land use intensification continuing in many parts of the world and with the alarming pace of climate change maintaining landscape movement function has become a major goal of conservation plans fischer and lindenmayer 2007 prober et al 2019 watson et al 2017 worboys et al 2010 it follows that credible yet operationally practical landscape connectivity assessment is needed to inform conservation priorities and plans monitor trends in the levels of available or functional habitat and to report on the effectiveness of conservation actions in promoting habitat availability duflot et al 2018 fahrig 2013 laliberté and st laurent 2020 watson et al 2017 connectivity assessment can also act as a catalyst for community engagement in innovative conservation and land use planning meppem and gill 1998 by providing a link between local conservation action and big picture ecological processes such as broad scale and multi generational migration routes and habitat redistribution networks keeley et al 2019 regularly updated remote sensing is becoming increasingly available this opens the opportunity to operationalise workflows to produce streams of data that include connectivity assessment this allows closer monitoring of seasonal effects longer term trends and the progress of recovery from major disturbances such as australia s black summer bushfires in 2019 2020 godfree et al 2021 the distinction between structural and functional connectivity of habitats e g baguette and van dyck 2007 is often made doerr et al 2014 describes structural connectivity as anything that physically links separate populations in addition to contiguous corridors this definition includes stepping stones saura et al 2014 and more subtle habitat elements such as scattered trees or shrubs or even scattered clumps of tussock grass or coarse woody debris doerr et al 2014 critical connectivity thresholds have been demonstrated in relation to structural connectivity metzger and décamps 1997 however it is often pointed out that in practice the benefits of structural connectivity are rarely validated with empirical evidence doerr et al 2014 hodgson et al 2011 laliberté and st laurent 2020 while over emphasis on structural connectivity has been heavily critiqued hodgson et al 2011 hodgson et al 2009 moilanen 2011 it is nonetheless an enduring feature of conservation planning practice zeller et al 2020 according to baguette and van dyck 2007 functional connectivity refers to how the behaviour of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape structure and elements although functional connectivity is often aligned to the movements of individual species the relevance of the concept to higher levels of biological organisation sensu noss 1990 is less acknowledged aggregated across whole regions functional connectivity informs on the functional integrity of landscapes ludwig et al 2004 walston and hartmann 2018 woodwell 2002 close examination of the functional aspects of landscape connectivity inevitably leads to the question of connectivity for what biological entities can be genetic traits species species functional groups ecosystems or all of biodiversity thus we make the distinction here between species specific or even species process specific connectivity i e home range movements dispersals and migrations drielsma and ferrier 2009 and more broadly defined structural connectivity in the case of species specific connectivity the source destination path and movement abilities are explicitly linked to the biology of a defined species or functionally related group drielsma and ferrier 2009 drielsma et al 2016 drielsma et al 2020 scotts and drielsma 2003 broadly defined structural connectivity has been found to facilitate function more generally doerr et al 2010 1 2 analytic tools increasingly analytical tools are being deployed for mapping and reporting on landscape connectivity across regions correa ayram et al 2015 correa ayram et al 2017 least cost path analysis provides a powerful means for quantifying or mapping landscape connectivity however there are sustained concerns that this approach lacks ecological realism moilanen 2011 or should be better applied to account for functional movement processes sawyer et al 2011 zeller et al 2018 ferrarini 2014 describes two biologically improbable assumptions of using least cost paths 1 dispersers have complete knowledge of their surroundings and 2 they select the least cost route based on this information least cost path algorithms only consider the least cost route between pairs of locations ignoring both the added strength and redundancy to habitat networks provided by alternative routes moilanen 2011 and the influence of learned behaviour the application of circuit theory to landscape connectivity assessment in the program circuitscape dickson et al 2019 mcrae et al 2008 shah and mcrae 2008 overcomes the former deficiency by considering all paths between chosen endpoints however this is achieved at high computational cost per node pair path endpoints and so the number of node pairs that can feasibly be examined is limited the all paths approach works well in cases where connectivity assessment is sought between a limited number of known concentrations of habitat however the approach quickly becomes intractable in cases where extensive habitats form a fine grained heterogeneous continuum that lacks clear a priori endpoints for analysis ferrarini 2014 mcintyre and barrett 1992 wiens 1995 with et al 1997 in highly variegated environments represented by high resolution data large numbers of node pairs are required to adequately sample habitat across a region and the most pertinent nodes are not easily established environmental niche modelling of individual species provides a way to define potential distributions which can then be assessed for connectivity and individual assessments can be aggregated to represent multiple species correa ayram et al 2017 scotts and drielsma 2003 for many species and more generally within many environments it is problematic to represent large irregularly shaped patches with a single node doing this can lead to loss of information in terms of landscape heterogeneity with et al 1997 it introduces error if perfect connectivity is assumed within patches and when all parts of a patch are considered equally connected to all parts of other patches thus patch based approaches introduce a problem concerning the placement of nodes in large or irregularly shaped patches an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations has been developed uses continuous value rasters grids of species distributions drielsma and love 2021 drielsma and ferrier 2009 that approach builds on the cost benefit approach cba to measuring habitat configuration drielsma et al 2007a the cba and the spatial links tool slt drielsma et al 2007b are raster based least cost paths dijkstra 1959 graph theoretic approaches that overcome reliance on patch definition and provide a tractable solution to assessing large and complex landscape configurations the cba and spatial links tools have been used as stand alone applications for evaluating and mapping ecological carrying capacity and ecological connectivity love et al 2020 the cba approach has been integrated into species and community level persistence assessments for calculating potential occupancy and metapopulation capacity drielsma and love 2021 drielsma and ferrier 2009 an index of biodiversity persistence conservation benefits and unique diversity mapping drielsma et al 2014

strategy to represent many taxa using one or few high trophic level species e g baguette et al 2013 williams et al 2012 a single habitat connection can serve the needs of multiple species but characterising the entire biota using representative species will necessarily skew results towards well studied and iconic species cushman and landguth 2012 drielsma et al 2014 this concern has led to some assessments adopting hypothetical yet representative species hand et al 2014 noss 2007 or generic focal species doerr et al 2013 foster et al 2017 more generic level assessment can be helpful in two related ways firstly it can be used in lieu of the difficult task of measuring functional connectivity individually across the entirety of taxa which includes a number of species that are poorly understood or are unknown to science secondly and perhaps more aptly connectivity at the ecosystem level promotes general resilience defined as the capacity of social ecological systems to adapt or transform in response to unfamiliar unexpected and extreme shocks carpenter et al 2012 harwood et al in review however in no way do the strengths of ecosystem level or structural connectivity sensu doerr et al 2014 preclude or displace the need to explicitly address functional connectivity individually for highly valued individual species especially those at high risk of extinction in assessing landscape connectivity it is a significant challenge to adequately represent movement abilities across the full spectrum of life scaling laws help to bring order to otherwise seemingly overwhelming chaos loehle 2004 west and brown 2005 they apply to island biogeography whereby a species area curve can explain diminishing marginal gains in diversity as the area of habitat increases brown et al 2002 crawley and harral 2001 this reflects the diminishing potential for entry to a habitat patch by larger more mobile species and higher order predators with increasing patch area the concentration of diversity among invertebrate fauna and smaller plant life and the statistical chance of colonisation power law relationships have also been found to describe the distribution of body size among animals marquet et al 2005 body mass and home range size gompper and gittleman 1991 jetz et al 2004 rosten et al 2016 body size and mean average travel distance rosten et al 2016 and the frequency of movement and distance travelled by individual species ramos fernández et al 2004 1 4 towards a new way to assess landscape connectivity we set out to develop a landscape connectivity assessment approach that was generic across biodiversity we developed the new general landscape connectivity model glcm to automate connectivity assessment based on a single spatial input of pre defined land cover or ecological condition the approach adopts a fractal design founded on the self similarity of movement processes that can be assumed across spatial scales and which can be described by a power law the glcm builds a model of landscape connectivity networks comprising complex patterns through repeated application of a simple least cost path algorithm across geographic space and across spatial scales drawing on spatial data of land cover or ecological condition and a minimal set of movement related parameters in developing glcm we sought to addresses a range of criteria we find to be important or beneficial in assessing broad scale landscape connectivity at least within the context of eastern continental australia these criteria are listed in table 1 glcm combines in a scripted environment the cba and slt thereby incorporating analysis of both spatial context and link value we substantially enhanced the cba and the slt software for computation efficiency and expanded node sampling to effectively consider all feasible least cost paths across a study region glcm generates cross scale or scale agnostic measures of neighbourhood habitat area hanski 1999 and habitat link value drielsma et al 2007b it maps functional connectivity generically across multiple scales theoretically accounting for the movement abilities of multiple species and modes of movement home range dispersal and migration as such glcm provides a basis for aspects of conservation planning such as no regrets conservation actions to address loss of ecological function arising from clearing of habitat and climate change prober et al 2019 in this paper we describe the methods underlying glcm and present three case studies applied to south eastern australia to illustrate differing ways arising from how the input data is formulated in which glcm can be usefully applied these case studies have largely been described in published project reports but here we consolidate the general approach and place glcm within the broader context of landscape connectivity assessment methodologies to both inform conservation planning and to report on status and trends we argue that glcm provides a unique perspective on habitat networks that captures sufficient realism in landscape connectivity across spatial scales while providing operability that facilitates periodic updates for monitoring and reporting through the case studies we demonstrate glcm s flexibility to map connectivity networks semi generically across three structurally distinct habitat types case study 1 to generate generic landscape connectivity mapping and connectivity indicators for jurisdictional reporting for new south wales australia case study 2a and for the sydney basin bioregion of australia at higher spatial resolution case study 2b and to consider temporal and spatial connectivity in the context of climate induced shifts to environmental niches case study 3 2 methods 2 1 a dual perspective on landscape connectivity glcm combines dual perspectives on region wide habitat networks duflot et al 2018 fig 1 using a simple raster geometry to span ecological scales fig 2 neighbourhood habitat area ni is the amount of structurally connected extant habitat at each location denoted i weighted by its functional connectivity to i box 1 provides a glossary of key terms used in this paper a high value for ni indicates that for i there is high availability of connected habitat quantity and or quality presumably providing the resources that support individuals and populations of species typically found at the location ni summed across a region provides a useful indicator of the functional integrity for that region habitat link value li is the contribution of a location denoted i to the functional integrity of a study region li mapped across a region provides a visualisation of a study region s connectivity network this mapping can be used to inform the connectivity strategy priorities for improving the persistence of biodiversity by highlighting opportunities for conserving enhancing and building habitat networks between concentrations of high quality habitat baguette et al 2013 noss 1991 as ni and li are calculated across multiple scales we can assume that they encompass all forms of organism movement processes foraging dispersal and migrations ni and li originate from metapopulation ecology hanski 1999 initially they were applied to habitat represented by variably sized circular habitat patches glcm provides higher level configuration that repeatedly and systematically increments calculations of ni and li across ecological scales using standardised parameterisation ni is operationalised for raster data using the cba tool drielsma et al 2007a and li is derived using the spatial links tool drielsma et al 2007b 2 2 neighbourhood habitat area ni neighbourhood habitat area ni is calculated as 1 n i j h j w i j where hj is the amount of habitat quantity and quality of each neighbourhood cell indexed by j connected by a least cost path to i this formulation of neighbourhood habitat area is close to hanski s hanski 1999 connectivity of a patch i but here we consider habitat at the source by allowing i to equal j drielsma and love 2021 permeability to movement across a grid cell i can be calculated as w i e α d i where 1 α is the average movement ability being analysed and di is the cost distance of traversing cell i with both given in the same units in our case meters the concept of cost distance can be considered inverse to permeability i e dij 1 α ln w ij and is calculated in our case by scaling up the euclidean distance across i orthogonal grid cell size by any loss in its habitat value thus wij is a function of the amount of habitat traversed the structural component scaled relative to the movement ability being assessed the functional component once summed across j ni represents the amount of structurally connected habitat weighted by its functional connectivity to i a single petal configuration which is chosen to achieve balance between computational demand and ecological rigor drielsma et al 2007a is used throughout any given calculation of ni 2 3 habitat link value li habitat link value li is calculated based on the colonisation potential of a patch hanski 1999 2 l i j k h j h k w j k where wjk is the permeability of the habitat link connecting end nodes j and k and where grid cell i is either an end node i e i j or i k or is an element of a set of nodes that form the least cost path between the end nodes i e i j and i k habitat links are calculated as least cost paths connecting units of habitat sensu drielsma and love 2021 the value of a habitat link is derived from the overall connectivity the link provides to the habitat network based on path length and the quality of the habitat it traverses and connects as least cost paths are solved for each pair of j and k and across scales habitat link values are accumulated at each grid cell i that forms part of each link thus a grid cell s final value of li accounts for the number of traversing habitat links and the connectivity value of those links to the habitat network a habitat link may comprise a mix of environments along its path thus high li indicates a location that provides connectivity between habitats supporting ecological processes but each location along a path may not be of high habitat value itself 2 4 operationalising connectivity metrics operationally deriving ni and li both involve solving single source shortest path trees rooted at each grid cell location with least cost paths visiting every neighbourhood location within specified search constraints for ni neighbourhood locations j may either be individual grid cells within a predetermined analysis window centred on i or aggregations of those grid cells into petals drielsma et al 2007a to improve computational performance for li locations j and k are grid cells within a maximum search radius of each other beyond which paths would be irrelevant wjk approaches 0 as distance exceeds 1 a and are therefore not solved a minimum habitat threshold hmin can be used when selecting j and k to avoid solving low valued paths that are unlikely to add appreciable value to any li a moving analysis window used for ni centred on i and latter implementations of li centred on j is used to measure the connections between each grid cell as a focal grid cell out to all neighbourhood locations for each ni habitat link values are accumulated at the focal grid cell i for li values are accumulated at each grid cell forming part of the least cost path according to the colonisation potential calculated for the path 2 5 spatial inputs glcm requires up to two geospatial raster inputs land cover or ecological condition or equivalent representation of habitat ecosystem or vegetation quality data and habitat permeability respectively these represent the habitat resource or benefit at path nodes and the relative inverse perspective of cost distance to biota of traversing each location drielsma and ferrier 2006 the ecological condition grid represents each location s capacity to provide the resources necessary to support plant and animal species native to an area calculated relative to an ideal reference state for the location these measures are not produced within glcm as they re fit for purpose user defined inputs e g harwood et al 2016 love et al 2020 williams et al 2021 we employ a raster based grid data structure whereby ecological condition and habitat permeability values for each grid cell are the estimated average value within the grid cell s extent glcm then considers the grid cell s broader landscape context habitat condition and permeability can be represented simply as binary high versus low grid cell values or as for the three case studies presented below continuous valued surfaces mcintyre and barrett 1992 wiens 1995 with 2015 the spatial resolution of input rasters determines that of the combined outputs finer grain source data is preferred as it increases the potential bandwidth of ecological scales represented in the analysis allowing it to account for more local movements associated with less space demanding and less mobile species ideally habitat permeability is generated as a separate input along with ecological condition optionally permeability can be calculated within glcm by applying a linear transformation of ecological condition into cost distance as a proxy for movement ability e g see love et al 2020 in our case studies see section below a minimum cost distance assigned to highest quality habitat was set to the euclidean orthogonal grid cell size the maximum cost distance for grid cells devoid of habitat was calculated by multiplying the grid cell size by a cost ratio denoted ɛ of 2 5 permeability wi values for average movement abilities being analysed at each scale were then calculated from hi linearly scaled between these minimum and maximum cost distances the selected value of ɛ is a defining trait of any glcm analysis following parameterisations in a number of studies e g drielsma et al 2016 drielsma et al 2017 we chose a cost ratio value of ɛ 2 5 which we consider provides an acceptable balance in trading between alternative movement profiles a higher cost ratio limits exploration of higher cost regions in the grid as wij decays more rapidly resulting in lower values for ni and li a lower cost ratio allows paths to traverse higher cost regions further before their contribution to ni or li becomes insignificant potentially increasing connectedness of habitat and ultimately resulting in higher connectivity values overall to investigate if our models were overly influenced by our choice of ɛ we conducted a sensitivity analysis on case study 2 see supplementary s9 2 6 the scaling approach a simple raster geometry is employed within glcm to sample ni and li uniformly across ecological scales whereby each scale is subjected to an identical analysis in terms of analysis window dimensions number of grid cells range of grid cell permeability values and for the ni analysis the petal configuration used e g see fig 3 a sampling across spatial scales is informed by a power law such that at each successive sampling starting with the original data s finest granularity potential movement ability 1 a and grid cell size are doubled hence the spatial resolution of the analysis is systematically halved i e to coarser granularity brown et al 2002 drielsma et al 2018 see box 2 complexity is managed in this process by working with number of cells rather than geographic distance as distance units which remain constant across the spatial scales a jittering process see figure 3b and supplementary s5 was applied to all but the finest scale analysis whereby multiple shifted grid cell offsets love et al 2020 are used to resample the finest scale source data ecological condition and permeability to each coarser resolution with jittering grid cell offsets are shifted a fraction of the coarser grid cell size in both the x and y directions so that in each instance of spatial scale and offset the aggregation of source grid cells into coarser analysis grid cells is unique thus the jittering process reduces information loss that usually results when a single grid origin for resampling is chosen and it improves visual representation see table 1 by reducing the imprint of grid cell circumscription artefacts which would otherwise prevail in output maps ni and li analysis are performed independently using matching scaling parameters for each offset within each resolution love et al 2020 2 7 aggregation stage the final aggregation across scales offsets and methods ni and li is set to the source data s original finest resolution using a simple schema e g see supplementary s4 as all the required influence across scales is handled in the scaling power law approach aggregation of components requires limited standardisation to achieve the aim of equal weighting across scales we only need to account for differences in the number of offsets analysed at each resolution in the final aggregation the ecological condition surface itself is also included as a component of ni at its original resolution as it implicitly represents ni within the bounds of each grid cell assuming perfect connectivity within the grid cell wij 1 0 this equates to hi 3 results we present three case studies for comparison each has been described in separate project reports case study 1 drielsma et al 2012 case study 2 love et al 2020 and case study 3 drielsma et al 2015 the case studies cover overlapping sub continental study regions in south eastern australia see top of fig 4 they illustrate a diversity of applications as well as an evolution of the glcm approach in terms of methods data and software see table 2 zoomed in examples of spatial inputs and outputs for the three case studies are provided in fig 4 and for their complete extent in supplementary s1 s2 s3 and s8 supplementary s5 also presents an additional fine scaled analysis using case study 2 methods but is a local application for the greater sydney region to help instil landscape connectivity into the nsw greening our city program to increase the tree canopy and green cover across greater sydney by planting 1 million trees by 2022 new south wales government 2017 thus we refer to case study 2a all of nsw and case study 2b the greater sydney region details of the methods for each case study are provided in supplementary s4 s5 and s6 the three case studies are nested within a common study region comprising major urban population and growth centres surrounded by fragmented grassland and woodland habitats within an intensively farmed sheep wheat agricultural region a high diversity of ecosystems ranging from desert rangelands to sub tropical rainforests and alpine woodlands and heath over 870 national parks and public reserves in the state of new south wales an extensive network of travelling stock route reserves lentini et al 2013 extensive areas likely to be critical to carbon sequestration forestry polglase et al 2011 a key part of the great eastern ranges conservation connectivity corridor mackey et al 2010 and the gondwana rainforests and greater blue mountains unesco listed world heritage areas for each case study a suitable buffer area c 200 km was added to avoid edge artefacts arising from the analysis where necessary ecological condition data to fill the buffer extent were derived using a less rigorous methodology love et al 2020 water and sea were considered high quality ecological condition to ensure connections with coastal areas were not inappropriately devalued the ecological condition surfaces used as inputs to the three case studies were derived semi inferentially through an aggregation of information from multiple sources including remotely sensed measures of vegetation cover love et al 2020 remotely sensed foliage projective cover fpc was used to estimate a woody cover component of ecological condition raw fpc values were transformed using logistic functions with inflection points set to lower bound thresholds based on benchmarks with high perceived condition for different vegetation types ayers et al 2005 drielsma et al 2012 transformed fpc values were combined across vegetation types and further modified based on tenure land use and land cover to provide the best available indication of understory and ground cover ecological condition dillon et al 2009 case study 2a included an additional measure of stable green vegetation based on landsat derived fractional cover metrics stable green vegetation combines measures of annual mean green vegetation cover with its mean intra annual range over a 10 year period this was included in modified landscapes where it was qualitatively found to provide a useful gradient between frequently cropped or heavily grazed lands and those less intensively utilised lands which have consistently higher ground cover love et al 2020 3 1 case study 1 connections of three vegetation structural classes case study 1 see supplementary s4 for methods and s1 for results was developed to support conservation and restoration activities undertaken as part of the great eastern ranges initiative a connectivity conservation initiative focused on the great dividing range and the great escarpment which runs the length of eastern australia mackey et al 2010 in contrast to case studies 2 and 3 which considers a single generic entity case study 1 considers 3 entities of vegetation structural classes open forest closed forest and woodland case study 1 therefore involved three separate parallel analyses one for each of three vegetation structural classes 3 2 case study 2 landscape connectivity of new south wales case study 2a see supplementary s2 s5 s7 and s8 presents an assessment undertaken as part of the new south wales biodiversity indicator program in which the ecological condition indicator was further developed into indicators of ecological connectivity and ecological carrying capacity love et al 2020 using a glcm analysis at 90 m grid cell resolution case study 2a was greater in extent and finer grained compared to case study 1 the application employed a single continuous surface of ecological condition improvements to software performance after the case study 1 analysis allowed an all pairs analysis using higher resolution input data the all pairs approach generates every plausible path from every grid cell to every other grid cell within the bounds of parameterised search constraints the parameterised constraints used by the approach include a maximum search radius and maximum effective path distance beyond which least cost paths are mathematically implausible maximum attainable wij beyond the threshold is insignificant and are not generated and a minimum ecological condition threshold below which sites cannot contribute due to very low hi and are therefore not processed as path nodes case study 2 included the development of ni as a regional nsw state wide indicator of ecological carrying capacity baguette et al 2013 department of planning industry and environment nsw 2020 love et al 2020 ni is aggregated across the study region to report on the proportion of all possible original pre disturbance or benchmark connected habitat that remains denoted nr within a given habitat network or scenario 2 nr ni n i where ni is the original or benchmark ni at each location which is constant across a region but for operational purposes is calculated in order to account for edge effects near the study region boundary in case study 2a ni and li are not combined into a single spatial layer rather summed ni evaluates the total connectivity for a region and mapped li provides a graph or map of the connectivity network or can also be considered a measure of the contribution of each location to the network fig 5 focuses on a portion of the case study 2a extent showing outputs for each scale granularity combination as well as the combined output maps of the combined li output for the entire extent of case study 2a is provided in supplementary s2 and s8 case study 2b see supplementary s5 follows the general methods of case study 2a but is calculated at significantly higher spatial resolution 2 32 metres cell size 3 3 case study 3 south east australia climate change connections case study 3 drielsma et al 2017 drielsma et al 2015 and see supplementary s6 applies the li approach used in case study 1 to explicitly define habitat networks within the context of shifting ecological niches due to climate change thus this example was developed as an aid to regional climate adaptation planning by identifying candidate areas for climate ready conservation management and ecological restoration the approach is part of an active area of model development that includes employing a climate informed analogy of ni as an indicator of spatial resilience to climate change harwood et al in review 4 discussion conservation decision making is typically mired by high levels of epistemological uncertainty burgman 2005 and complexity that calls for pluralist perspectives funtowicz et al 1999 this issue is amplified when decision making is directed at vast geographic areas multitudes of biota environments interactions and uncertain futures prober et al 2019 prober et al 2017 it follows that a variety of fit for purpose assessment approaches are needed including ones that can readily generate generic assessment across broad regions the architecture of glcm circumvents the complexity of ecological systems by embracing detail in spatial data which can be readily captured with new and emerging technologies while adopting simple assumptions within a fractal framework to account for movement processes which are not well known collectively across all taxa the approach offers a useful supplement to field based assessment that can otherwise lack broad perspective rather than focusing on actual or putative species or species functional groups glcm considers a wide band of spatial scales and granularities that are reflective of a comprehensive range of biological movements cushman and landguth 2012 noss 1991 rayfield et al 2016 as such it is fit for purpose for operationalising assessment of landscape connectivity across broad regions and for setting priorities for conservation actions aimed at building general ecological resilience across regions e g jalkanen et al 2020 however this generic approach has not been developed to enable detailed planning for the conservation of individual highly threatened species the latter requires species specific parameters based on empirical evidence of individual species movement biology and ecological requirements e g landi et al 2018 4 1 the three case studies the results from the three case studies differ in a number of ways due to how each approached the problem of scale and resolution the use of ecological entities species ecosystems and in case study 3 ecological forecasting clark et al 2001 in general terms case study 1 and 3 were designed to provide regional to sub continental scale perspectives with case study 3 being configured to capture expected ecosystem migration pathways due to climate change case study 2 is a finer grained current climate scenario perspective that provides a clearer view of ecological network processes at the landscape scale than at broader scales in general the results from the three case studies highlighted the uneven distribution of connectivity remaining in the variably utilised landscape of south eastern australia reflecting the uneven impacts of land use and intensification across the study area along the coast many areas of native vegetation have been removed to accommodate urban development infrastructure and a mosaic of productive and intensive land uses native vegetation remains relatively intact along the slopes and ranges where land is more rugged where soils often have lower fertility and where a higher level of protection is afforded by extensive conservation reserves pressey et al 1996 much of the native vegetation in the more arable central part of the case study region has been highly modified or degraded or replaced with cropping and grazing systems the native vegetation that remains is often along roadsides travelling stock route reserves lentini et al 2013 riparian zones of waterways or in smaller nature reserves insights gleaned from the case studies included confirmation of the north south great eastern ranges corridor as a continental scale spine of connectivity paralleling the australian east coast and augmented with a number of often tenuous east west linkages coastal to inland that are likely to be critical for faunal climate migrations toward cooler moister coastal habitats and the critical role of large remnant patches such as the pilliga forest in the otherwise heavily fragmented central region of the new south wales state jurisdiction more detailed patterns can be discerned when the data is viewed at finer resolutions this is well illustrated by the greater sydney region assessment case study 2b which goes down to 2 metre resolution there the role of parkland street trees roads and infrastructure can be discerned case study 2 provides a rare example of how landscape connectivity is actually being monitored watson et al 2017 across a large datasets 4 2 using glcm to guide management and report on change the case studies provided a source of information for land managers and policy makers to explore how decisions and actions at local scales can support retention maintenance or strengthening of ecological networks at regional and larger scales glcm provides a data driven evaluation and visualisation of a region s complete suite of habitat networks including the relative ecological strength of links the spatial context of locations connectivity pinch points and barriers to movement although exact delineation of these features requires additional context specific interpretation these features are illustrated in example spatial products from the case study 2a analysis fig 6 provides a detailed map from an example landscape in southern nsw comprising less than 2 of the full analysis extent for case study 2a supplementary s8 provides the map for all of nsw the highlighted areas in fig 6 show examples of features which can lead to on ground targeted management actions to protect or enhance landscape connectivity these maps provide an index of the contribution of each location to landscape connectivity in their current state this information when used in conjunction with complementary information helps to highlight places where ecological restoration could be most effective in strengthening existing ecological networks 4 3 glcm and its place alongside alternative approaches glcm was designed to address ecological network function gaston 2010 generically across all biodiversity including common species and presumably unknown species which would otherwise be overlooked we argue that glcm best meets the criteria we listed in table 1 as a whole at least in respect to the demand we encounter for generic broad scale landscape connectivity assessment in nsw australia although we do not offer a systematic review of alternative methods for assessing landscape connectivity we recognise that alternative approaches can also address individual criteria to varying degrees as well as additional criteria not listed here in respect to some criteria alternative approaches can also outperform glcm for example the approach of lechner et al 2015 is superior in respect to computational speed and therefore interactivity while it doesn t recognise the variegation of landscapes that glcm can and due to computational considerations glcm draws on least cost paths only and cannot feasibly include all paths analysis as circuitscape does but for only a limited set of path nodes glcm provides an assessment of the strength of habitat links based on the quanta of habitat at link nodes and the permeability of links it does not seek to assess persistence as other complementarity based approaches do e g see drielsma et al 2014 drielsma et al 2012 ferrier and drielsma 2010 moilanen et al 2009 however glcm has been successfully integrated into one such assessment see drielsma et al 2020 each species interacts with the landscape in a unique way that cannot be understood from a portrayal of generic landscape connectivity alone e g delmas et al 2019 where the consequences of ill informed decisions can lead to extinctions more detailed information including field based observations and more biologically detailed and persistence based assessments may be needed foster et al 2016 poiani et al 2000 possingham et al 1993 taylor et al 2016 for such cases some of the authors have developed an approach drielsma and love 2021 drielsma and ferrier 2009 that also addresses most of the criteria in table 1 while it contrasts with glcm s genericism by working with individual species distribution models informed by biological data and by applying species specific movement abilities within a metapopulation persistence framework 4 4 the mathematical model the all pairs approach implemented in glcm allows for a consistent and controlled sampling of entire study regions this prevents the problem of over sampling paths in areas with a greater proportion of intact quality habitat and under sampling or ignoring degraded areas and small patches which are prevalent in many regions under sampling the low quality or highly fragmented habitat would undervalue the important marginal contributions of remnant habitat in partially cleared landscapes such as stock reserves or paddock trees in the highly fragmented nsw wheat sheep agricultural region of central nsw australia law et al 2000 lentini et al 2011 sampling bias was completely removed in the most recent version of glcm case study 2 by implementing a complete all pairs sampling strategy allowing the algorithm to resolve patterns of habitat connectivity more efficiently than with the heuristic approach adopted in case study 1 and 3 the all pairs approach is also fully deterministic which ensures repeatability and consistency across space and across any set of scenarios we expect that glcm s scaling approach along with the use of petals and jittering diminishes over reliance on single scale least cost by capturing wider links at successively coarser spatial scales and by examining all pairs of feasible nodes including multiple proximal nodes this ensures that many alternative paths relevant to different species and modes of movement are captured so while glcm does not consider all alternative paths between individual node pairs it does not do all paths it comprehensively captures potential node pairs across space and across scales 4 5 the generic approach glcm can also be applied to actual species or species groups where scale resolution and habitat quality are informed by knowledge of the biological entities chosen correa ayram et al 2017 we justify our generic approach demonstrated by the three case studies in terms of its ability to consider the otherwise intractable complexity of multiple taxa in variegated environments through time glcm provides pragmatic information in data poor settings and augments more detailed species or community level assessments which might lack geographic coverage or which are biased towards a limited set of biological entities the generic approach has implications for its use the promotion of landscape connectivity is intended to reduce pressures affecting the viability of populations generally and to ensure that ecosystem processes remain intact gaston 2010 5 conclusion glcm utilizes ecological theory to integrate habitat value with connectivity across a network it considers all pairs connectivity across a region within a computationally optimised application and is designed to operate across the full range of habitat values present in a region using continuous valued raster data this alleviates the need to define or assign weights to discrete habitat patches or make a priori judgements as to which habitat nodes to include in an analysis the approach can be applied consistently and repeatedly to large regions represented by highly granular complex models of ecological condition given sufficiently detailed input data glcm allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations glcm outputs can be used for reporting on status and trends in landscape connectivity and for contributing to broad scale conservation planning or localised actions that seek to build or strengthen habitat networks to support biodiversity persistence especially through climate change the operational advantages of glcm mean that landscape connectivity assessment can be practically updated with refined or changed inputs including time series of remotely sensed data or it can be applied to alternative scenarios of land use restoration climate projections or combinations of these 5 1 software the neighbourhood habitat area analysis for calculating ni is performed using the spatial cba tool drielsma et al 2007a and li was calculated using the spatial links tool drielsma et al 2007b both are part of a larger biodiversity tools software package that s

24494,emergy synthesis es is a powerful tool to assess the sustainability of agricultural eco economic system however based on the traditional es framework tes the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices could not be reasonably compared because the real contribution of soil storage was not rationally calculated while only the emergy input derived from topsoil loss was considered this study proposed a modified es framework mes based on the logic of soil nutrient balance to reflect the contribution of soil storage in the es under different agricultural practices at farm level a field experiment of sweet maize cropping system under different fertilization practices in south china was took as a case to compare the emergy based indices under the tes and mes frameworks according to the mes framework the changes of soil nutrients including the som n p and k in the farming system were considered the emergy flows of them were calculated by involving the measured data on field the results of emergy based indices demonstrated that the mes approach could reflect the difference of cropping system under different agricultural practices at farm level meanwhile the results also indicated that the application of chemical fertilizer with biochar was the best practice for improving the sustainability of sweet maize production system in south china based on the mes approach this study was expected to promote the application of the es method on the sustainability assessment of agricultural system at the farm level graphical abstract image

interest in sustainable consumption have put a greater focus on the promotion of sustainable agriculture mazhar et al 2021 a sustainable crop production system should be an integrated eco economic process achieving greater yields with lower environmental impacts and resources consumption thus understanding the complex eco economic process requires quantitative assessments of crop production system and how different production practices affect yields and environmental variables emergy synthesis es is a widely used method to assess the sustainability of complex eco economic process in the world nowadays lei and wang 2008 lu et al 2014 mandade et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 emergy is defined as the total amount of available energy directly or indirectly put into application in the process of product or service formation odum 1996 normally all inputs of natural and purchased resources driving a system can be calculated in terms of solar emjoules sej due to the consideration of the value of environmental resources the es method is particularly suitable for analyzing the agricultural eco economic system involving both the natural environment and human economic activities chen et al et al 2006 lu et al 2009 wilfart et al 2013 yang et al 2019 during the past decades the es has been used for analyzing various agricultural systems or processes including crop farming lefroy and rydberg 2003 zhang et al 2012 houshyar et al 2018 fruit cultivation martin et al 2006 giannetti et al 2011 livestock husbandry castellini et al 2006 wang et al 2015 and integrated agriculture wu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 the majority of published papers focused on the sustainability assessment of regional agriculture development liu et al 2019 tao et al 2013 and the comparison of different agricultural production models amiri et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in recent years a few researches attempted to compare the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices including tillage measures amiri et al 2021 fertilization zeng et al 2013 moonilall et al 2020 cropping pattern hu et al 2010 yang et al 2018 and bacteria inoculum panzieri et al 2000 the previous studies made contributions for understanding the relationship between advanced practices and sustainability in agricultural field developing the application of es method into specific eco economic processes at the farm level however the traditional es method showed an obvious limit when comparing the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices unreasonable reflection of the real contribution of soil storage during emergy flows accounting in agricultural systems the farmland ecosystem was a semi natural ecosystem controlled by human improved soil management is one of the basic conditions for achieving the higher crop yield traditionally the soil contribution in the es research was only reflected by calculating the emergy input derived from topsoil loss despite the substantial importance of soil organic matter reserves fan et al 2018 the actual contribution of soil storage under different agricultural practices would not be scientifically reflected by the method in the present study the accounting framework was named as the traditional es framework tes for the macroscopic evaluation of ecological systems analysts do not usually have the measurement data of the soil state so an estimation of soil contribution based on topsoil loss is perhaps reasonable wang et al 2017 however for the comparison of cropping systems sustainability involving different agricultural practices the traditional tes approach is clearly unreasonable on the consideration of the soil contribution because almost all kinds of agricultural practices affect the properties of soil storage in other words the soil contribution under various agricultural practices should be different when accounting the emergy flows of soil in agricultural systems therefore how to calculate the contribution of soil to crop system caused by agricultural practices has become a problem that needs to be solved for the further development of es method in the assessment of agricultural systems at farm level in recent years a few studies have attempted to reflect the real contribution of soil storage when applying the es in agricultural systems bai et al 2005 calculated the emergy of soil organic matter and soil moisture in the topsoil to value agricultural land lu et al 2010 took the change of soil organic matter as an indicator to calculate soil emergy contribution in crop rotation models wang et al 2017 considered the actual change of soil organic matter content to account the emergy input of recycled biomass in circular agricultural systems similarly fan et al 2018 incorporated soil organic matter loss into a part of system investment amiri et al 2020 considered the soil organic matter loss soil mineral erosion and ground water as inputs in the emergy table however the studies just considered the contribution of soil organic matter in the es actually the soil organic matter is just one component of soil storage contributing for the crop production on farmland the changes of nutrients including nitrogen phosphorus and potassium also affect the emergy flows accounting of cropping systems which should be involved into the es method especially when the soil nutrients in farmland were significantly affected by different agricultural practices the contribution derived soil storage have to be scientifically assessed otherwise the difference of results under different agricultural practices could possibly not be reflected in the es method in this study therefore a field experiment of sweet maize cropping system under different fertilization practices in south china was took as a case to allow a discussion regarding the issue the study aimed at proposing a modified es framework to account for the emergy flows of soil nutrients and to reflect the contribution of them in agricultural systems the reason of choosing this case was that fertilization was the most typical practice of affecting the nutrient change in soil storage in specific the objectives in this study were as follows 1 modifying the accounting framework of soil nutrients in es for reflecting the influence of different agricultural practices on soil storage 2 comparing the sustainability of sweet maize production system under the different fertilization practices based on the modified es framework this study was expected to promote the application of the es method on the sustainability assessment of agricultural system at the farm level 2 methods 2 1 study site the field experiment selected in this study was carried out at ningxi experimental station in zengcheng district in guangzhou city 113 59 e 23 37 n the study region is a typical tropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 21 7 c and average solar radiation of 4 06 109 j m 2 the annual average rainfall is 1957 7 mm and the annual average wind speed is 2 3 m s 1 the initial soil properties were 5 8 g kg 1 organic matter 1 18 g kg 1 total n 1 59 g kg 1 available p and 4 38 g kg 1 available k in the top 20 cm of soil the ph was 5 79 before the experiment the region conditions were from the guangdong meteorological service gms 2019 the initial soil properties were measured in laboratory in specific the available p was measured colorimetrically after leaching with nh4f hcl and available k was measured by using flame photometry after leaching with nh4oac bao 2000 ph was measured by potentiometry sac 2018 the measure methods of other initial soil properties were described in the sections 2 5 3 and 2 5 4 2 2 experiment design the experimental design was a single factor completely random design including six treatments conventional fertilization 300 kg n ha 1 ck reduced nitrogen fertilization 150 kg n ha 1 rn and the reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung cd biogas residue br maize straw ms and biochar cb the fertilizer application amount of each treatment was shown in table 1 each treatment was repeated three times to obtain the raw data each plot covering an area of about 28 m2 4 m 7 m 2 3 farm management the experiment was performed during august to november in 2019 the variety of sweet maize selected in this experiment was huameitian 368 the maize was first raised in the tray and then transplanted into the experimental field at the three leaf stage organic materials were applied into field as base fertilizer before sweet maize transplanting mineral fertilizers were applied in accordance with the proportion of 30 as base fertilizer 35 as jointing fertilizer 30 as tapping fertilizer and 5 as strong grain fertilizer the ridge spacing in the field was 85 cm the ridge width was 65 cm and the ridge height was 10 cm two rows of maize were planted on the ridge with the hole spacing of 30 cm the crop straw of each plot was removed out from the field after harvesting other management processes were consistent with the conventional management of sweet maize cultivation in local farms 2 4 emergy synthesis 2 4 1 system diagram the first step in the es was to draw a system diagram of evaluated objective reflecting the input output process of the system as a whole this study described the energy flows of sweet maize planting system involving different fertilization practices in the fig 1 and fig 2 fig 1 presents the energy flows of the sweet maize system under different fertilization practices based on the perspective of tes framework according to this viewpoint emergy analyst normally thought that the cropping system achieved environment resources such as sunlight rain wind and soil as well as economics feedback such as fertilizers fuel and labor to generate the crop yield in actual the tes framework also presented the contribution of soil storage for crop production but only the topsoil loss was considered to reflect the process in emergy accounting process in the modified es framework mes fig 2 we emphasized the real change of the soil storage during a crop growing period soil provided nutrients for crop production the change of soil storage affected the cropping system on the same land in the following planting season in practice mineral and organic fertilizers were both applied into the farmland and become the part of the soil storage from which the crops absorbed the required nutrients as a result a portion of nutrients in the soil storage were used by the crops the other portions were left in the soil or out from the farmland through various loss paths from a system perspective the increased nutrients should be viewed as a kind of outputs of the agricultural systems because it was certainly the result of the interaction of crops and environment it should be considered for the sustainability assessment of agricultural systems otherwise the real effects of different agricultural practices on the sustainable development of agricultural systems would not be scientifically reflected by using the es because the increased nutrients in soil storage and crop yield were both generated from the same process in the same period they should be considered as the co products of cropping system based on the third emergy accounting rule odum 1996 in practice the change of soil storage under different agricultural practices could be calculated according to the difference of soil nutrients before the crop planting and harvest 2 4 2 energy and material flows accounting the second step in the es was to account for the energy materials and information flows that were inputted into the evaluated systems in this study all raw data on agricultural inputs were directly recorded from the field experiment the data on topsoil loss in the research region was obtained from published literature zhang and li 2018 a few raw data were then converted into energy flows by multiplying by suitable conversion coefficients which were from chen 2002 moreover this study paid attention on the real change of soil storage at the farm level from the es viewpoint the primary contributions of soil for cropping systems were to provide the soil nutrients mainly including the soil organic matter som nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in the present case we believed that the more detailed change of soil storage should be considered in the es when comparing the effects of different agricultural practices therefore a simple static input output balance was considered in the mes framework based on wang et al 2017 to calculate the changes of soil nutrients under different fertilization practices by the following formulas 1 i i s h ρ b f p f i ρ b o p o i where the i referred to the som soil total nitrogen sn soil total phosphorus sp and soil total potassium sk respectively the ii was the consumed amount of soil elements i during crop growth period the s was the area of farmland ha h was the depth of topsoil 0 20 m the p o i and p f i were the content of soil element before tillage and after crop harvesting in each plot g g 1 the ρ b o and ρ b f were the soil bulk density before fertilization and after crop harvesting in each plot kg m 3 in this study the contents of som sn sp and sk and soil bulk density in each plot were measured the values of them in the soil storage were possibly increased or decreased after the crops were harvested because different fertilization practices affected the nutrients dynamic of crop soil integrated system the decreased soil nutrients would be viewed as input to the cropping system while the increased soil nutrients would be viewed as the output of the system in other words the absolute value of i i would be multiplied by corresponding uev to convert into the system input if the i i was a negative value while its amount would be incorporated into the system output if the i i was a positive one in the mes framework the real change of soil storage affected by different agricultural practices could be reflected 2 4 3 emergy flows accounting the third step in the es was to develop emergy tables by summarizing all inputs in terms of solar emergy by multiplying by suitable unit emergy values uevs the uev was defined as the amount of solar emergy contained per unit of a certain type of energy or substance odum 1996 all flows of material energy and money in an eco economic system would be transformed into a unified emergy flow by the uevs in this study the updated emergy baseline 12 00 1024 sej yr 1 was selected brown et al 2016 moreover according to the calculation rule from odum 1996 half the mass of the rock was cost to produce soil in the process of weathering so the uev of rock should be multiplied by 2 as the uev of soil material thus the uev of phosphorus and potassium elements should be multiplied by 2 on the basis of the selected uev of ore for the soil organic matter and nitrogen element in soil there were the uevs calculated in existing researches the used uevs were mainly derived from the previous published papers supplementary materials table s1 2 4 4 indices the final step of the es was to calculate emergy based indices according to the ratio of inputted emergy flows of evaluated systems in this study according to the standard classifying principle wang 2016 all inputs were divided into different categories table 2 free purchased resource were based on the economic values of resources in market renewable nonrenewable resources were based on the amounts of renewable resources inputted for the generation of resources environmental economic resources referred to the resources from environment or human society respectively therein renewability factor rnf was introduced into this study to divide the inputs of the evaluated system into renewable and non renewable parts the rnf have been wield used in the es in the past years lu et al 2009 yang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 in the present case the used rnfs and their sources were presented in the table s1 as well the rnfs of organic materials and irrigation water were viewed as 1 00 because by the generating speed of them were greater than the consuming speed in the study region the environmental resources density ed purchased materials density pd emergy yield ratio eyr environmental load ratio elr emergy sustainability index esi the uev of maize uevmaize the uev of all system outputs uevsystem were the most common used emergy based indices so the present case selected them to compare the sustainability of sweet maize planting system under different fertilization practices table 3 meanwhile the increased soil contents and crop products were both considered as the co products in the cropping system thus the uev of the system s outputs was calculated based on the co products allocation rule odum 1996 the objective of calculating the indices was to compare the rationality of the assessed results under the tes and mes frameworks 2 5 sampling and measurement 2 5 1 yield ten sweet maize samples were harvested from all plots when sweet maize was ripe the harvested sweet maize was threshed air dried and weighted by electronic scale 2 5 2 soil bulk density for measuring soil bulk density ρ b of each plot two undisturbed soil cores were collected from each plot at 0 20 cm by using metal cylinders with a diameter of 5 cm height of 5 cm and total volume of 100 cm3 before fertilization and after harvesting soil cores were dried in an oven to constant weight 105 c and then ρ b was calculated for each sample using soil volume 2 5 3 soil organic carbon the soil organic carbon contents in the topsoil 0 20 cm were measured by using the walkley black method walkley and black 1934 before fertilization and after harvesting in each year for each plot 2 5 4 soil nutrients the soil nutrients were measured according to the methods in soil and agricultural chemistry analysis bao 2000 soil total n was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl method soil total p was measured colorimetrically after digestion with hclo4 h2so4 soil total k was measured using hclo4 h2so4 melting flame photometry 3 results 3 1 traditional emergy synthesis tes frameworks 3 1 1 emergy flows the emergy flows calculated based on the tes framework were shown in table 4 the total emergy t of ck was 3 90e 16 sej ha 1 in which the purchased resources p and nonrenewable resources n accounted for 77 73 and 69 29 respectively it showed that the sweet maize system was mainly driven by purchased resources and nonrenewable resources compared to the ck conventional fertilization the t of rn reduced nitrogen fertilization and ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw were decreased by 1 86 while the values of cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung br reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biogas residue and cb reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biochar were increased by 4 72 48 43 and 75 76 respectively in specific the e in the treatments were the same as that in ck the p of cd br and cb were 6 07 62 31 and 97 47 higher than that of ck while the rn and ms were both 2 39 lower than that of the ck the n of rn cd rb ms and cb were all decreased by 2 68 compared to the ck 3 1 2 emergy based indices the emergy indices calculated based on the tes framework were shown in table 5 the ed of ck was 22 27 showing a low dependence of the sweet maize cropping system on environmental resources compared to the ck the eds of rn and ms were increased by 1 89 while the values of cd br and cb were decreased by 4 50 32 63 and 43 11 respectively the pd of cd br and cb were 1 29 9 35 and 12 35 higher than that of ck while the rn and ms were both 0 54 lower than that of the ck the uevmaize of ck was 2 82e 12 sej kg 1 compared to the ck the uevmaize of br cb rn and ms were increased by 29 05 222 65 2 68 and 2 68 respectively while the value of cd was decreased by 18 08 it should be noted that only the maize yield was considered as the output of the maize cropping system in the tes framework so the values of uevsystem were not exist moreover the eyr elr and esi of ck were valued 1 287 2 256 and 0 570 respectively compared to the ck the eyrs of rn and ms were increased by 0 55 while the values of cd br and cb were decreased by 1 27 8 55 and 10 99 respectively the elrs of cd br cb rn and ms were all lower than that of ck decreasing by 2 68 72 41 respectively finally the esis of cd br ms cb and rn were 23 17 147 87 3 32 222 65 and 3 32 higher than the ck respectively the results showed that the other treatments were better than that of ck from the view of emergy based sustainability 3 2 modified emergy synthesis mes frameworks 3 2 1 emergy flows the emergy flows calculated based on the mes framework were shown in table 6 due to the consideration on nutrients balance in soil in the present case the emergy flows of environmental resources e and n were changed compared to that in the tes framework the t of ck conventional fertilization was 7 24e 16 sej ha 1 in which the e and n accounted for 58 13 and 83 46 respectively compared to the ck the t of cb reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biochar was decreased by 5 00 while the values of cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung br reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biogas residue ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw and rn reduced nitrogen fertilization were increased by 14 80 70 47 30 81 and 42 23 respectively the e of cd br ms and rn were 21 10 76 36 54 72 and 74 37 higher than that of ck while the cb was 78 81 lower than that of the ck the n of cd br ms and rn were orderly increased by 13 49 51 98 36 91 and 50 60 while the value of cd was decreased by 56 09 compared to the ck 3 2 2 emergy based indices as shown in table 5 the pd of ck was 41 87 showing that the sweet maize system was not primarily depended on purchased resources compared to the ck the ed of cb was decreased by 77 70 while the values of cd br ms and rn were decreased by 8 24 5 03 34 01 and 45 72 respectively the pd of cb was 107 86 higher than that of ck while that of cd br ms and rn were 7 61 4 79 0 87 and 31 37 lower than that of the ck for the results of uev the uevmaize of ck was 5 24e 12 sej kg 1 and the uevsystem of ck was 3 68e 12 sej kg 1 compared to the ck the uevmaize of br cb ms and rn were increased by 48 22 22 95 39 05 and 61 51 respectively while the value of cd was decreased by 10 19 moreover the uevsystem of br ms cb and rn were 48 22 39 05 22 95 and 61 51 higher than that of ck while the cb was 10 19 lower than that of the ck these results indicated that the treatment of cd was the best to improve maize production efficiency while the treatment of cb was the most productive for the whole crop soil integrated system for the sustainability indices the eyr elr and esi of ck were respectively valued 2 388 5 045 and 0 473 compared to the ck the eyr of cb was decreased by 51 89 while the values of cd br ms and rn were increased by 8 24 5 03 34 01 and 45 72 respectively the elrs of cd br and cb were 6 52 42 38 and 87 55 lower than that of ck while that of ms and rn were 36 91 and 50 60 higher than that of ck finally the esis of cd br and cb were increased by 15 79 82 28 and 286 53 while that of ms and rn were decreased by 2 12 and 3 24 compared to the ck the result illustrated that the sweet maize systems fertilized by cow dung biogas residue and maize biochar showed the higher sustainability from the emergy viewpoint 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between tes and mes frameworks in the previous literatures zhao et al 2019 viewed the fertilizer and topsoil loss as direct inputs in plant production systems wang et al 2019 recognized the existence of soil bank but took the topsoil loss as the resource consumption while considered the fertilizer as the directly inputs in the agricultural system chen et al 2021a proposed that all inputs including the soil and fertilizer entered the cropping system after an interaction but the contribution of the soil bank was still stimated by the loss of topsoil the researchers estimated the total soil input of the whole region of the evaluated system according to the average rate of soil loss in the region this approach of estimating the soil contribution for agricultural systems was reasonable in a long term stable ecosystem at the macro viewpoint however the estimation would clearly not reflect the real effects caused by different agricultural practices in the present case because the fertilization was the unique difference of the six treatments based on the tes framework the values of e were the same in all treatments and the values of n were the same in the treatments except ck conventional fertilization the eyrs of ck rn reduced nitrogen fertilization cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung and ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw had the similar values and the elrs and esis in ck rn and ms showed the small difference numerically therein the differences on the indices between the rn and ms should be pay more attention specially other indices result of them were completely equal except for the uevmaize because the maize straw was considered as the recycled flows in sweet maize system which should not be included in the outputs of systems according to the forth emergy rule brown and herendeen 1996 the difference of the uevmaize between the rn and ms were only derived from the changed yields which were on field measured in the present case however the other types of organic materials were calculated into the total emergy input flow because they were produced through other systems such as biogas and livestock systems in consequence we noticed the problem existing in the tes framework when comparing the emergy results of cropping system under different agricultural practices the effects derived from agricultural practices could not be reflected by emergy based results if the effect would be not involved into the emergy accounting framework clearly fertilization practice affected the crop yield and soil nutrients actually the change in soil storage in farmland was dramatic when adopting different agricultural practice in the tes framework only the change of crop yields under different fertilization practices could be reflected by the uev index while the comprehensive effects of the agricultural practice on sustainability could not reflected by the framework this study proposed the modified framework for considering the real contribution of soil storage in the es method for cropping systems under different agricultural practices we used the actual measured data on nutrients in the sweet maize cropping system to reflect the real change of soil storage in this part compared with the results in tes framework performed as table 5 pd and esi were less than that in original assess decreased by 0 26 62 81 but other indices were higher increased by 0 16 300 38 the emergy based indices showed that eds were increased by 1 13 300 38 compared to the result in tes framework and pds were decreased by 0 26 62 81 except for the cb treatment the indexes of other treatments were all changed dramatically indicating that the environmental resource investment increased under these fertilization practices the increased ed and pd were derived from increased e and n in the sweet maize production system it reflected the importance of soil materials in crop production in addition compared to the results obtained by the tes framework the eyrs and elrs were increased by 0 16 248 50 while esis were finally decreased by 0 26 38 91 under the mes framework it reflected that the contribution of crop cultivation to the economic system was possibly underestimated while the sustainability was possibly overestimated under the tes framework besides uevsystem did not exist in tes framework while uevsystem was appeared under mes framework also the uevmaize was changed in different degrees after using mes framework reflecting the efficiency of system output all agricultural practices such as crop rotations tillage fertilization and so on would directly or indirectly affect soil properties the mes based results reflected the reasonability of the modified es framework because mes framework showed the differences of system characteristic between different agriculture practices this assessed results based on the mes framework were also consistent with the situation of farmland problems such as land degradation liu and han 2020 and cultivated land quality degradation chen et al 2021b the results implied that the crop production system was still not in line with the sustainable development goals in conclusion we believed that the mes framework proposed in this study could reasonably and scientifically reflect the impact of agricultural practices on soil banks in cropping production systems 4 2 comparison between different fertilization practices this study compared the sustainability of sweet maize cropping system under different fertilization practices in south china based on a field experiment the study region was set in guangzhou city in guangdong province in 2018 china was the second largest producer of sweet corn in the world with a sweet corn planting area of 333 thousand hectares accounting for 25 of the global sweet maize area li and huang 2021 at the same time guangdong province was the main production area of sweet corn in china with a planting area of 120 1 thousand hectares and an annual output of 545 4 thousand tons gbs 2019 accounting for nearly one third of china s yield guangdong was also the largest consumption and export area of sweet maize in china liu 2016 in this study we selected ed pd uev eyr elr and esi to assess the sustainability of sweet maize cropping system based on the mes framework the sustainability of the system could be scientifically analyzed by the ratio of the different categories of emergy flows in the system the ed could reflect the rate of environmental resources input in the agricultural system the higher ed showed the more input density of e in the present case the ed values of cb reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biochar ck conventional fertilization br reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biogas residue cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw and rn reduced nitrogen fertilization were 12 96 58 13 60 13 61 31 68 76 71 26 respectively conversely the pd of rn ms cd br ck and cb were 28 74 31 24 38 69 39 87 41 87 and 87 04 respectively the ascending order of the pds for the treatments were opposite to that of ed because the pd reflects the degree of system dependence on external input the higher pd referred to the more dependence on purchased resources from outside of the system the result showed that the practice of cb cost more resources from economics system but that of rn get more from surrounding environment the uev of outputs produced in each treatment would also be used as the emergy index to measure the characteristics of the system under different agricultural practice the uev presented in table 5 measures the relative efficiency of a production in a system the higher the uev the more energy or substance was consumed reflecting the lower efficiency of using resources in this study in ascending order the uevsystem of cb cd ck rn br and ms were 1 12e 12 sej kg 1 3 34e 12 sej kg 1 3 68e 12 sej kg 1 5 30e 12 sej kg 1 5 32e 12 sej kg 1 and 5 43e 12 sej kg 1 respectively meanwhile the uevmaize of cd ck cb ms br and rn were 4 71e 12 sej kg 1 5 24e 12 sej kg 1 6 44e 12 sej kg 1 7 29e 12 sej kg 1 7 77e 12 sej kg 1 and 8 46e 12 sej kg 1 respectively the uev of cb and cd were lower than that of ck which demonstrated that these two fertilization practices brought the higher system efficiency the eyr reflects the ability of system to exploit local resources in outside inputs in this study the treatments in ascending order of results were cb ck br cd ms and rn the values of them were 1 145 2 388 2 508 2 585 3 201 and 3 480 respectively indicating that the ability to use local resource was reduced for the cb but were raised for other treatments meanwhile in ascending order the elrs of cb br cd ck ms and rn were 0 628 2 907 4 716 5 045 6 907 and 7 598 respectively the result of elr reflected the pressure on the environment during the operation of the studied system which indicated that rn and ms practices caused the higher pressure on surrounding than ck finally the values of esi in ascending order were 0 458 0 463 0 473 0 548 0 863 and 1 830 corresponding to the results of rn ms ck cd br and cb systems in turn this indicator showed that cb practice significantly improved system sustainability when the br and cd practices improved system sustainability in general the cb cd and br fertilization practice improved the sustainability of the sweet maize cropping system in the south china compared to the ck therein the cb treatment presented the highest sustainability of the sweet maize cropping system because of the best effect on nutrient conservation in soil the cd treatment showed the highest maize production efficiency with the increased system sustainability 5 conclusion the es was a suitable tool to assess the sustainability of agricultural eco economic systems however based on the tes framework the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices could not be reasonably compared because the real contribution of soil storage was not rationally calculated while only the emergy input derived from topsoil loss was considered this study proposed a modified approach based on the logic of soil nutrient balance exampled by fertilization field research in sweet maize cropping system in south china to reflect the contribution of soil storage in the es under different agricultural practices at farm level according to the mes framework the changes of soil nutrients including the som n p and k in the farming system were considered the emergy flows of them were calculated by involving the measured data on field as well compared to the tes framework this modified approach could reflect the difference of cropping system under different agricultural practices at farm level at the same time this study also indicated that cb treatment was the best practice for improving the sustainability of sweet maize production system in south china based on the mes framework this study would contribute to the application of the es method for assessing the

24494,emergy synthesis es is a powerful tool to assess the sustainability of agricultural eco economic system however based on the traditional es framework tes the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices could not be reasonably compared because the real contribution of soil storage was not rationally calculated while only the emergy input derived from topsoil loss was considered this study proposed a modified es framework mes based on the logic of soil nutrient balance to reflect the contribution of soil storage in the es under different agricultural practices at farm level a field experiment of sweet maize cropping system under different fertilization practices in south china was took as a case to compare the emergy based indices under the tes and mes frameworks according to the mes framework the changes of soil nutrients including the som n p and k in the farming system were considered the emergy flows of them were calculated by involving the measured data on field the results of emergy based indices demonstrated that the mes approach could reflect the difference of cropping system under different agricultural practices at farm level meanwhile the results also indicated that the application of chemical fertilizer with biochar was the best practice for improving the sustainability of sweet maize production system in south china based on the mes approach this study was expected to promote the application of the es method on the sustainability assessment of agricultural system at the farm level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords emergy sustainability modified framework soil agricultural practices 1 introduction agriculture has been now a dominant force behind many environmental threats all over the world including climate change li et al 2021 depletion of natural capital gras and caceres 2020 eutrophication dupas et al 2015 and so on global concerns on the issues along with growing public interest in sustainable consumption have put a greater focus on the promotion of sustainable agriculture mazhar et al 2021 a sustainable crop production system should be an integrated eco economic process achieving greater yields with lower environmental impacts and resources consumption thus understanding the complex eco economic process requires quantitative assessments of crop production system and how different production practices affect yields and environmental variables emergy synthesis es is a widely used method to assess the sustainability of complex eco economic process in the world nowadays lei and wang 2008 lu et al 2014 mandade et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 emergy is defined as the total amount of available energy directly or indirectly put into application in the process of product or service formation odum 1996 normally all inputs of natural and purchased resources driving a system can be calculated in terms of solar emjoules sej due to the consideration of the value of environmental resources the es method is particularly suitable for analyzing the agricultural eco economic system involving both the natural environment and human economic activities chen et al et al 2006 lu et al 2009 wilfart et al 2013 yang et al 2019 during the past decades the es has been used for analyzing various agricultural systems or processes including crop farming lefroy and rydberg 2003 zhang et al 2012 houshyar et al 2018 fruit cultivation martin et al 2006 giannetti et al 2011 livestock husbandry castellini et al 2006 wang et al 2015 and integrated agriculture wu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 the majority of published papers focused on the sustainability assessment of regional agriculture development liu et al 2019 tao et al 2013 and the comparison of different agricultural production models amiri et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in recent years a few researches attempted to compare the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices including tillage measures amiri et al 2021 fertilization zeng et al 2013 moonilall et al 2020 cropping pattern hu et al 2010 yang et al 2018 and bacteria inoculum panzieri et al 2000 the previous studies made contributions for understanding the relationship between advanced practices and sustainability in agricultural field developing the application of es method into specific eco economic processes at the farm level however the traditional es method showed an obvious limit when comparing the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices unreasonable reflection of the real contribution of soil storage during emergy flows accounting in agricultural systems the farmland ecosystem was a semi natural ecosystem controlled by human improved soil management is one of the basic conditions for achieving the higher crop yield traditionally the soil contribution in the es research was only reflected by calculating the emergy input derived from topsoil loss despite the substantial importance of soil organic matter reserves fan et al 2018 the actual contribution of soil storage under different agricultural practices would not be scientifically reflected by the method in the present study the accounting framework was named as the traditional es framework tes for the macroscopic evaluation of ecological systems analysts do not usually have the measurement data of the soil state so an estimation of soil contribution based on topsoil loss is perhaps reasonable wang et al 2017 however for the comparison of cropping systems sustainability involving different agricultural practices the traditional tes approach is clearly unreasonable on the consideration of the soil contribution because almost all kinds of agricultural practices affect the properties of soil storage in other words the soil contribution under various agricultural practices should be different when accounting the emergy flows of soil in agricultural systems therefore how to calculate the contribution of soil to crop system caused by agricultural practices has become a problem that needs to be solved for the further development of es method in the assessment of agricultural systems at farm level in recent years a few studies have attempted to reflect the real contribution of soil storage when applying the es in agricultural systems bai et al 2005 calculated the emergy of soil organic matter and soil moisture in the topsoil to value agricultural land lu et al 2010 took the change of soil organic matter as an indicator to calculate soil emergy contribution in crop rotation models wang et al 2017 considered the actual change of soil organic matter content to account the emergy input of recycled biomass in circular agricultural systems similarly fan et al 2018 incorporated soil organic matter loss into a part of system investment amiri et al 2020 considered the soil organic matter loss soil mineral erosion and ground water as inputs in the emergy table however the studies just considered the contribution of soil organic matter in the es actually the soil organic matter is just one component of soil storage contributing for the crop production on farmland the changes of nutrients including nitrogen phosphorus and potassium also affect the emergy flows accounting of cropping systems which should be involved into the es method especially when the soil nutrients in farmland were significantly affected by different agricultural practices the contribution derived soil storage have to be scientifically assessed otherwise the difference of results under different agricultural practices could possibly not be reflected in the es method in this study therefore a field experiment of sweet maize cropping system under different fertilization practices in south china was took as a case to allow a discussion regarding the issue the study aimed at proposing a modified es framework to account for the emergy flows of soil nutrients and to reflect the contribution of them in agricultural systems the reason of choosing this case was that fertilization was the most typical practice of affecting the nutrient change in soil storage in specific the objectives in this study were as follows 1 modifying the accounting framework of soil nutrients in es for reflecting the influence of different agricultural practices on soil storage 2 comparing the sustainability of sweet maize production system under the different fertilization practices based on the modified es framework this study was expected to promote the application of the es method on the sustainability assessment of agricultural system at the farm level 2 methods 2 1 study site the field experiment selected in this study was carried out at ningxi experimental station in zengcheng district in guangzhou city 113 59 e 23 37 n the study region is a typical tropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 21 7 c and average solar radiation of 4 06 109 j m 2 the annual average rainfall is 1957 7 mm and the annual average wind speed is 2 3 m s 1 the initial soil properties were 5 8 g kg 1 organic matter 1 18 g kg 1 total n 1 59 g kg 1 available p and 4 38 g kg 1 available k in the top 20 cm of soil the ph was 5 79 before the experiment the region conditions were from the guangdong meteorological service gms 2019 the initial soil properties were measured in laboratory in specific the available p was measured colorimetrically after leaching with nh4f hcl and available k was measured by using flame photometry after leaching with nh4oac bao 2000 ph was measured by potentiometry sac 2018 the measure methods of other initial soil properties were described in the sections 2 5 3 and 2 5 4 2 2 experiment design the experimental design was a single factor completely random design including six treatments conventional fertilization 300 kg n ha 1 ck reduced nitrogen fertilization 150 kg n ha 1 rn and the reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung cd biogas residue br maize straw ms and biochar cb the fertilizer application amount of each treatment was shown in table 1 each treatment was repeated three times to obtain the raw data each plot covering an area of about 28 m2 4 m 7 m 2 3 farm management the experiment was performed during august to november in 2019 the variety of sweet maize selected in this experiment was huameitian 368 the maize was first raised in the tray and then transplanted into the experimental field at the three leaf stage organic materials were applied into field as base fertilizer before sweet maize transplanting mineral fertilizers were applied in accordance with the proportion of 30 as base fertilizer 35 as jointing fertilizer 30 as tapping fertilizer and 5 as strong grain fertilizer the ridge spacing in the field was 85 cm the ridge width was 65 cm and the ridge height was 10 cm two rows of maize were planted on the ridge with the hole spacing of 30 cm the crop straw of each plot was removed out from the field after harvesting other management processes were consistent with the conventional management of sweet maize cultivation in local farms 2 4 emergy synthesis 2 4 1 system diagram the first step in the es was to draw a system diagram of evaluated objective reflecting the input output process of the system as a whole this study described the energy flows of sweet maize planting system involving different fertilization practices in the fig 1 and fig 2 fig 1 presents the energy flows of the sweet maize system under different fertilization practices based on the perspective of tes framework according to this viewpoint emergy analyst normally thought that the cropping system achieved environment resources such as sunlight rain wind and soil as well as economics feedback such as fertilizers fuel and labor to generate the crop yield in actual the tes framework also presented the contribution of soil storage for crop production but only the topsoil loss was considered to reflect the process in emergy accounting process in the modified es framework mes fig 2 we emphasized the real change of the soil storage during a crop growing period soil provided nutrients for crop production the change of soil storage affected the cropping system on the same land in the following planting season in practice mineral and organic fertilizers were both applied into the farmland and become the part of the soil storage from which the crops absorbed the required nutrients as a result a portion of nutrients in the soil storage were used by the crops the other portions were left in the soil or out from the farmland through various loss paths from a system perspective the increased nutrients should be viewed as a kind of outputs of the agricultural systems because it was certainly the result of the interaction of crops and environment it should be considered for the sustainability assessment of agricultural systems otherwise the real effects of different agricultural practices on the sustainable development of agricultural systems would not be scientifically reflected by using the es because the increased nutrients in soil storage and crop yield were both generated from the same process in the same period they should be considered as the co products of cropping system based on the third emergy accounting rule odum 1996 in practice the change of soil storage under different agricultural practices could be calculated according to the difference of soil nutrients before the crop planting and harvest 2 4 2 energy and material flows accounting the second step in the es was to account for the energy materials and information flows that were inputted into the evaluated systems in this study all raw data on agricultural inputs were directly recorded from the field experiment the data on topsoil loss in the research region was obtained from published literature zhang and li 2018 a few raw data were then converted into energy flows by multiplying by suitable conversion coefficients which were from chen 2002 moreover this study paid attention on the real change of soil storage at the farm level from the es viewpoint the primary contributions of soil for cropping systems were to provide the soil nutrients mainly including the soil organic matter som nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in the present case we believed that the more detailed change of soil storage should be considered in the es when comparing the effects of different agricultural practices therefore a simple static input output balance was considered in the mes framework based on wang et al 2017 to calculate the changes of soil nutrients under different fertilization practices by the following formulas 1 i i s h ρ b f p f i ρ b o p o i where the i referred to the som soil total nitrogen sn soil total phosphorus sp and soil total potassium sk respectively the ii was the consumed amount of soil elements i during crop growth period the s was the area of farmland ha h was the depth of topsoil 0 20 m the p o i and p f i were the content of soil element before tillage and after crop harvesting in each plot g g 1 the ρ b o and ρ b f were the soil bulk density before fertilization and after crop harvesting in each plot kg m 3 in this study the contents of som sn sp and sk and soil bulk density in each plot were measured the values of them in the soil storage were possibly increased or decreased after the crops were harvested because different fertilization practices affected the nutrients dynamic of crop soil integrated system the decreased soil nutrients would be viewed as input to the cropping system while the increased soil nutrients would be viewed as the output of the system in other words the absolute value of i i would be multiplied by corresponding uev to convert into the system input if the i i was a negative value while its amount would be incorporated into the system output if the i i was a positive one in the mes framework the real change of soil storage affected by different agricultural practices could be reflected 2 4 3 emergy flows accounting the third step in the es was to develop emergy tables by summarizing all inputs in terms of solar emergy by multiplying by suitable unit emergy values uevs the uev was defined as the amount of solar emergy contained per unit of a certain type of energy or substance odum 1996 all flows of material energy and money in an eco economic system would be transformed into a unified emergy flow by the uevs in this study the updated emergy baseline 12 00 1024 sej yr 1 was selected brown et al 2016 moreover according to the calculation rule from odum 1996 half the mass of the rock was cost to produce soil in the process of weathering so the uev of rock should be multiplied by 2 as the uev of soil material thus the uev of phosphorus and potassium elements should be multiplied by 2 on the basis of the selected uev of ore for the soil organic matter and nitrogen element in soil there were the uevs calculated in existing researches the used uevs were mainly derived from the previous published papers supplementary materials table s1 2 4 4 indices the final step of the es was to calculate emergy based indices according to the ratio of inputted emergy flows of evaluated systems in this study according to the standard classifying principle wang 2016 all inputs were divided into different categories table 2 free purchased resource were based on the economic values of resources in market renewable nonrenewable resources were based on the amounts of renewable resources inputted for the generation of resources environmental economic resources referred to the resources from environment or human society respectively therein renewability factor rnf was introduced into this study to divide the inputs of the evaluated system into renewable and non renewable parts the rnf have been wield used in the es in the past years lu et al 2009 yang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 in the present case the used rnfs and their sources were presented in the table s1 as well the rnfs of organic materials and irrigation water were viewed as 1 00 because by the generating speed of them were greater than the consuming speed in the study region the environmental resources density ed purchased materials density pd emergy yield ratio eyr environmental load ratio elr emergy sustainability index esi the uev of maize uevmaize the uev of all system outputs uevsystem were the most common used emergy based indices so the present case selected them to compare the sustainability of sweet maize planting system under different fertilization practices table 3 meanwhile the increased soil contents and crop products were both considered as the co products in the cropping system thus the uev of the system s outputs was calculated based on the co products allocation rule odum 1996 the objective of calculating the indices was to compare the rationality of the assessed results under the tes and mes frameworks 2 5 sampling and measurement 2 5 1 yield ten sweet maize samples were harvested from all plots when sweet maize was ripe the harvested sweet maize was threshed air dried and weighted by electronic scale 2 5 2 soil bulk density for measuring soil bulk density ρ b of each plot two undisturbed soil cores were collected from each plot at 0 20 cm by using metal cylinders with a diameter of 5 cm height of 5 cm and total volume of 100 cm3 before fertilization and after harvesting soil cores were dried in an oven to constant weight 105 c and then ρ b was calculated for each sample using soil volume 2 5 3 soil organic carbon the soil organic carbon contents in the topsoil 0 20 cm were measured by using the walkley black method walkley and black 1934 before fertilization and after harvesting in each year for each plot 2 5 4 soil nutrients the soil nutrients were measured according to the methods in soil and agricultural chemistry analysis bao 2000 soil total n was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl method soil total p was measured colorimetrically after digestion with hclo4 h2so4 soil total k was measured using hclo4 h2so4 melting flame photometry 3 results 3 1 traditional emergy synthesis tes frameworks 3 1 1 emergy flows the emergy flows calculated based on the tes framework were shown in table 4 the total emergy t of ck was 3 90e 16 sej ha 1 in which the purchased resources p and nonrenewable resources n accounted for 77 73 and 69 29 respectively it showed that the sweet maize system was mainly driven by purchased resources and nonrenewable resources compared to the ck conventional fertilization the t of rn reduced nitrogen fertilization and ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw were decreased by 1 86 while the values of cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung br reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biogas residue and cb reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biochar were increased by 4 72 48 43 and 75 76 respectively in specific the e in the treatments were the same as that in ck the p of cd br and cb were 6 07 62 31 and 97 47 higher than that of ck while the rn and ms were both 2 39 lower than that of the ck the n of rn cd rb ms and cb were all decreased by 2 68 compared to the ck 3 1 2 emergy based indices the emergy indices calculated based on the tes framework were shown in table 5 the ed of ck was 22 27 showing a low dependence of the sweet maize cropping system on environmental resources compared to the ck the eds of rn and ms were increased by 1 89 while the values of cd br and cb were decreased by 4 50 32 63 and 43 11 respectively the pd of cd br and cb were 1 29 9 35 and 12 35 higher than that of ck while the rn and ms were both 0 54 lower than that of the ck the uevmaize of ck was 2 82e 12 sej kg 1 compared to the ck the uevmaize of br cb rn and ms were increased by 29 05 222 65 2 68 and 2 68 respectively while the value of cd was decreased by 18 08 it should be noted that only the maize yield was considered as the output of the maize cropping system in the tes framework so the values of uevsystem were not exist moreover the eyr elr and esi of ck were valued 1 287 2 256 and 0 570 respectively compared to the ck the eyrs of rn and ms were increased by 0 55 while the values of cd br and cb were decreased by 1 27 8 55 and 10 99 respectively the elrs of cd br cb rn and ms were all lower than that of ck decreasing by 2 68 72 41 respectively finally the esis of cd br ms cb and rn were 23 17 147 87 3 32 222 65 and 3 32 higher than the ck respectively the results showed that the other treatments were better than that of ck from the view of emergy based sustainability 3 2 modified emergy synthesis mes frameworks 3 2 1 emergy flows the emergy flows calculated based on the mes framework were shown in table 6 due to the consideration on nutrients balance in soil in the present case the emergy flows of environmental resources e and n were changed compared to that in the tes framework the t of ck conventional fertilization was 7 24e 16 sej ha 1 in which the e and n accounted for 58 13 and 83 46 respectively compared to the ck the t of cb reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biochar was decreased by 5 00 while the values of cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung br reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biogas residue ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw and rn reduced nitrogen fertilization were increased by 14 80 70 47 30 81 and 42 23 respectively the e of cd br ms and rn were 21 10 76 36 54 72 and 74 37 higher than that of ck while the cb was 78 81 lower than that of the ck the n of cd br ms and rn were orderly increased by 13 49 51 98 36 91 and 50 60 while the value of cd was decreased by 56 09 compared to the ck 3 2 2 emergy based indices as shown in table 5 the pd of ck was 41 87 showing that the sweet maize system was not primarily depended on purchased resources compared to the ck the ed of cb was decreased by 77 70 while the values of cd br ms and rn were decreased by 8 24 5 03 34 01 and 45 72 respectively the pd of cb was 107 86 higher than that of ck while that of cd br ms and rn were 7 61 4 79 0 87 and 31 37 lower than that of the ck for the results of uev the uevmaize of ck was 5 24e 12 sej kg 1 and the uevsystem of ck was 3 68e 12 sej kg 1 compared to the ck the uevmaize of br cb ms and rn were increased by 48 22 22 95 39 05 and 61 51 respectively while the value of cd was decreased by 10 19 moreover the uevsystem of br ms cb and rn were 48 22 39 05 22 95 and 61 51 higher than that of ck while the cb was 10 19 lower than that of the ck these results indicated that the treatment of cd was the best to improve maize production efficiency while the treatment of cb was the most productive for the whole crop soil integrated system for the sustainability indices the eyr elr and esi of ck were respectively valued 2 388 5 045 and 0 473 compared to the ck the eyr of cb was decreased by 51 89 while the values of cd br ms and rn were increased by 8 24 5 03 34 01 and 45 72 respectively the elrs of cd br and cb were 6 52 42 38 and 87 55 lower than that of ck while that of ms and rn were 36 91 and 50 60 higher than that of ck finally the esis of cd br and cb were increased by 15 79 82 28 and 286 53 while that of ms and rn were decreased by 2 12 and 3 24 compared to the ck the result illustrated that the sweet maize systems fertilized by cow dung biogas residue and maize biochar showed the higher sustainability from the emergy viewpoint 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between tes and mes frameworks in the previous literatures zhao et al 2019 viewed the fertilizer and topsoil loss as direct inputs in plant production systems wang et al 2019 recognized the existence of soil bank but took the topsoil loss as the resource consumption while considered the fertilizer as the directly inputs in the agricultural system chen et al 2021a proposed that all inputs including the soil and fertilizer entered the cropping system after an interaction but the contribution of the soil bank was still stimated by the loss of topsoil the researchers estimated the total soil input of the whole region of the evaluated system according to the average rate of soil loss in the region this approach of estimating the soil contribution for agricultural systems was reasonable in a long term stable ecosystem at the macro viewpoint however the estimation would clearly not reflect the real effects caused by different agricultural practices in the present case because the fertilization was the unique difference of the six treatments based on the tes framework the values of e were the same in all treatments and the values of n were the same in the treatments except ck conventional fertilization the eyrs of ck rn reduced nitrogen fertilization cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung and ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw had the similar values and the elrs and esis in ck rn and ms showed the small difference numerically therein the differences on the indices between the rn and ms should be pay more attention specially other indices result of them were completely equal except for the uevmaize because the maize straw was considered as the recycled flows in sweet maize system which should not be included in the outputs of systems according to the forth emergy rule brown and herendeen 1996 the difference of the uevmaize between the rn and ms were only derived from the changed yields which were on field measured in the present case however the other types of organic materials were calculated into the total emergy input flow because they were produced through other systems such as biogas and livestock systems in consequence we noticed the problem existing in the tes framework when comparing the emergy results of cropping system under different agricultural practices the effects derived from agricultural practices could not be reflected by emergy based results if the effect would be not involved into the emergy accounting framework clearly fertilization practice affected the crop yield and soil nutrients actually the change in soil storage in farmland was dramatic when adopting different agricultural practice in the tes framework only the change of crop yields under different fertilization practices could be reflected by the uev index while the comprehensive effects of the agricultural practice on sustainability could not reflected by the framework this study proposed the modified framework for considering the real contribution of soil storage in the es method for cropping systems under different agricultural practices we used the actual measured data on nutrients in the sweet maize cropping system to reflect the real change of soil storage in this part compared with the results in tes framework performed as table 5 pd and esi were less than that in original assess decreased by 0 26 62 81 but other indices were higher increased by 0 16 300 38 the emergy based indices showed that eds were increased by 1 13 300 38 compared to the result in tes framework and pds were decreased by 0 26 62 81 except for the cb treatment the indexes of other treatments were all changed dramatically indicating that the environmental resource investment increased under these fertilization practices the increased ed and pd were derived from increased e and n in the sweet maize production system it reflected the importance of soil materials in crop production in addition compared to the results obtained by the tes framework the eyrs and elrs were increased by 0 16 248 50 while esis were finally decreased by 0 26 38 91 under the mes framework it reflected that the contribution of crop cultivation to the economic system was possibly underestimated while the sustainability was possibly overestimated under the tes framework besides uevsystem did not exist in tes framework while uevsystem was appeared under mes framework also the uevmaize was changed in different degrees after using mes framework reflecting the efficiency of system output all agricultural practices such as crop rotations tillage fertilization and so on would directly or indirectly affect soil properties the mes based results reflected the reasonability of the modified es framework because mes framework showed the differences of system characteristic between different agriculture practices this assessed results based on the mes framework were also consistent with the situation of farmland problems such as land degradation liu and han 2020 and cultivated land quality degradation chen et al 2021b the results implied that the crop production system was still not in line with the sustainable development goals in conclusion we believed that the mes framework proposed in this study could reasonably and scientifically reflect the impact of agricultural practices on soil banks in cropping production systems 4 2 comparison between different fertilization practices this study compared the sustainability of sweet maize cropping system under different fertilization practices in south china based on a field experiment the study region was set in guangzhou city in guangdong province in 2018 china was the second largest producer of sweet corn in the world with a sweet corn planting area of 333 thousand hectares accounting for 25 of the global sweet maize area li and huang 2021 at the same time guangdong province was the main production area of sweet corn in china with a planting area of 120 1 thousand hectares and an annual output of 545 4 thousand tons gbs 2019 accounting for nearly one third of china s yield guangdong was also the largest consumption and export area of sweet maize in china liu 2016 in this study we selected ed pd uev eyr elr and esi to assess the sustainability of sweet maize cropping system based on the mes framework the sustainability of the system could be scientifically analyzed by the ratio of the different categories of emergy flows in the system the ed could reflect the rate of environmental resources input in the agricultural system the higher ed showed the more input density of e in the present case the ed values of cb reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biochar ck conventional fertilization br reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with biogas residue cd reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with cow dung ms reduced nitrogen fertilization associated with maize straw and rn reduced nitrogen fertilization were 12 96 58 13 60 13 61 31 68 76 71 26 respectively conversely the pd of rn ms cd br ck and cb were 28 74 31 24 38 69 39 87 41 87 and 87 04 respectively the ascending order of the pds for the treatments were opposite to that of ed because the pd reflects the degree of system dependence on external input the higher pd referred to the more dependence on purchased resources from outside of the system the result showed that the practice of cb cost more resources from economics system but that of rn get more from surrounding environment the uev of outputs produced in each treatment would also be used as the emergy index to measure the characteristics of the system under different agricultural practice the uev presented in table 5 measures the relative efficiency of a production in a system the higher the uev the more energy or substance was consumed reflecting the lower efficiency of using resources in this study in ascending order the uevsystem of cb cd ck rn br and ms were 1 12e 12 sej kg 1 3 34e 12 sej kg 1 3 68e 12 sej kg 1 5 30e 12 sej kg 1 5 32e 12 sej kg 1 and 5 43e 12 sej kg 1 respectively meanwhile the uevmaize of cd ck cb ms br and rn were 4 71e 12 sej kg 1 5 24e 12 sej kg 1 6 44e 12 sej kg 1 7 29e 12 sej kg 1 7 77e 12 sej kg 1 and 8 46e 12 sej kg 1 respectively the uev of cb and cd were lower than that of ck which demonstrated that these two fertilization practices brought the higher system efficiency the eyr reflects the ability of system to exploit local resources in outside inputs in this study the treatments in ascending order of results were cb ck br cd ms and rn the values of them were 1 145 2 388 2 508 2 585 3 201 and 3 480 respectively indicating that the ability to use local resource was reduced for the cb but were raised for other treatments meanwhile in ascending order the elrs of cb br cd ck ms and rn were 0 628 2 907 4 716 5 045 6 907 and 7 598 respectively the result of elr reflected the pressure on the environment during the operation of the studied system which indicated that rn and ms practices caused the higher pressure on surrounding than ck finally the values of esi in ascending order were 0 458 0 463 0 473 0 548 0 863 and 1 830 corresponding to the results of rn ms ck cd br and cb systems in turn this indicator showed that cb practice significantly improved system sustainability when the br and cd practices improved system sustainability in general the cb cd and br fertilization practice improved the sustainability of the sweet maize cropping system in the south china compared to the ck therein the cb treatment presented the highest sustainability of the sweet maize cropping system because of the best effect on nutrient conservation in soil the cd treatment showed the highest maize production efficiency with the increased system sustainability 5 conclusion the es was a suitable tool to assess the sustainability of agricultural eco economic systems however based on the tes framework the sustainability of cropping system under different agricultural practices could not be reasonably compared because the real contribution of soil storage was not rationally calculated while only the emergy input derived from topsoil loss was considered this study proposed a modified approach based on the logic of soil nutrient balance exampled by fertilization field research in sweet maize cropping system in south china to reflect the contribution of soil storage in the es under different agricultural practices at farm level according to the mes framework the changes of soil nutrients including the som n p and k in the farming system were considered the emergy flows of them were calculated by involving the measured data on field as well compared to the tes framework this modified approach could reflect the difference of cropping system under different agricultural practices at farm level at the same time this study also indicated that cb treatment was the best practice for improving the sustainability of sweet maize production system in south china based on the mes framework this study would contribute to the application of the es method for assessing the sustainability of agricultural system under different practices credit authorship contribution statement kangming tan writing original draft methodology formal analysis yuliang li formal analysis yun
