15895,agricultural runoff is a significant contributor to nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution in water bodies limited information is available about the molecular characteristics of the dissolved organic n don and p dop species in the agricultural runoff and surface waters we employed fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to investigate the changes in the molecular characteristics of don and dop at three watershed positions upstream water runoff from agricultural fields and downstream waters across three watershed locations more bioavailable compounds such as amino sugars carbohydrates lipids and proteins accounted for 5 of don and 4 31 of dop molecules whereas less bioavailable compounds such as lignin tannins condensed hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons were 95 of don and 69 96 of dop of the dissolved organic matter runoff waters from agricultural fields contained the greatest proportion of don formulas 20 25 than upstream 18 and downstream 13 14 waters indicating the presence of a greater diversity of don species in the runoff various nutrient sources present in agricultural fields such as crop residues soil organic matter and transformed fertilizers likely contributed to the diverse composition of don and dop in the runoff which were likely altered as the surface water traversed along the flow pathways in the watershed the presence of more bioavailable molecules detected in upstream compared to agricultural runoff and downstream waters suggests that photochemical and or microbial processes likely altered the characteristics of don and dop compounds the findings of this study increase our understanding of don and dop compounds lability and transformations in runoff and surface waters which may be

in runoff waters are bioavailable to phytoplankton and bacteria lewis et al 2011 sipler and bronk 2014 it is also known that harmful algal species can use don compounds and high don concentration can influence n transformations in aquatic systems lusk and toor 2016a xia et al 2013 limited attention has been given to sources of don and dop in watershed management plans due to the analytical limitations and complexity of chemical structures and classification brooker et al 2018 lusk and toor 2016a consequently there is a need to understand the molecular characteristics and biogeochemical functions e g bioavailability of don and dop in aquatic environments a growing number of studies have pointed out the significant contributions of don and dop in waters soils and sediments and their impact on the nutrient cycles in ecosystems bronk et al 2007 li et al 2018 pisani et al 2017 yang and lusk 2018 zhang et al 2021 studies have indicated a significant n loss via runoff where don accounted for 53 of total dissolved n in agricultural runoff li et al 2018 and 47 69 of total n in stormwater runoff rivers estuaries and lakes jani et al 2020b tom and deborah 2003 xia et al 2013 in most freshwater systems dop often serves as the main fraction of organic p and typically comprises 25 50 of the total p thompson and cotner 2018 in our previous study in urban catchments the seasonal load of dop was 28 and 36 of tp in stormwater runoff and outflowing pond discharges respectively yang et al 2021 further less bioavailable don and dop can serve as a major source for microorganisms when inorganic n and p is limited in aquatic environments jani et al 2020a lang et al 2013 li and brett 2013 it has been demonstrated that the molecular composition and structural characteristics of don and dop can affect their fate and transport processes in the environment brooker et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 recently ultra high resolution mass spectrometry such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been applied to characterize the molecular composition of don and dop in soil sediment and aquatic systems brooker et al 2018 lacroix et al 2021 lusk and toor 2016b for example lusk and toor 2016a 2016 b coupled bioassays with ft icr ms to assess the biodegradability and changes in the molecular composition of don in urban waters in addition brooker et al 2018 employed ft icr ms to characterize dop composition in various pollution sources and aqueous samples these studies revealed that ft icr ms could provide new insights into the molecular composition of complex organic mixtures less bioavailable compounds with high molecular weight such as terrestrial plant derived lignins and tannins have been frequently detected in agricultural runoff and watersheds which are often associated with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon glendell and brazier 2014 li et al 2018 luek et al 2020 vidon et al 2008 recent studies have reported relatively higher amounts of less bioavailable don and dop pools 80 in agricultural runoff while more bioavailable compounds such as amino sugars lipids proteins and carbohydrates accounted for a lower proportion of identified don and dop brooker et al 2018 li et al 2018 in agricultural watersheds the molecular composition of don and dop compounds can be altered by the sources hydrological conditions and abiotic and biotic interactions which would eventually affect the biogeochemical cycles of n and p zhang et al 2021 the objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the molecular composition of don and dop in an agricultural watershed along a creek from upstream to agricultural runoff and downstream waters considering that microbes in agricultural fields are likely more conditioned and poised to degrade proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates before the dissolved organic matter exit in the runoff our first hypothesis h1 was that compared to upstream and downstream the agricultural runoff would contain less bioavailable forms of don and dop in addition we expect that repeated fertilizer amendments in agricultural fields tend to favor microbial metabolism that preferentially and efficiently processes more bioavailable don and dop compared to less bioavailable forms e g lignin and tannins thus our second hypothesis h2 was that molecular diversity of less bioavailable don and dop species would increase as waters move from the upstream to the downstream we expect this because diverse less bioavailable compounds should accumulate in the downstream waters as 1 microbes preferentially degrade simpler don and dop compounds and 2 flowing waters pick up new sources of lignin and tannins from other agricultural and forested areas between upstream and downstream sites to our knowledge this is the first study that systematically investigated both don and dop lability and transformations upstream and downstream of agricultural runoff sources the findings of this study improve our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling and dynamics of don and dop in agricultural runoff and surface waters and will aid in the development of new strategies to mitigate excessive loading of n and p into water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection the study watershed has an area of 12 8 km2 and

quickchem methods 10 107 04 1 c and 10 115 01 1 v was used for inorganic n and p analysis respectively ebina et al 1983 in brief filtered water samples were analyzed for nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n total dissolved n tdn dissolved reactive p drp and total dissolved p tdp the unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total n tn and total p tp for tdn tdp tn and tp analysis samples were digested

and dop tdp drp yang et al 2021 2 3 molecular characterization using ft icr ms to determine the molecular composition of don and dop water samples collected from one event july 19 2019 were extracted and analyzed using ft icr ms this time was chosen as this represents the middle of the crop season in agricultural watersheds in the northeastern united states where corn and soybean are planted in april may and harvested in september october sub filtered water samples collected from all sampling sites were desalted and concentrated using solid phase extraction according to dittmar et al 2008

analysis software was used to convert raw spectra to a list of mass over charge ratio m z values applying ft ms peak picker module with a signal to noise ratio s n threshold of 7 and absolute intensity threshold of 100 formularity software tolić et al 2017 was used to assign chemical formulae based on the criteria described in tfaily et al 2018 the post processing principal component analysis pca and statistical analysis of the assigned don and dop formulas were conducted in microsoft excel and jmp statistical software package jmp pro 13 sas institute since our objective was to characterize the don and dop components present in the dissolved organic matter analysis of molecular formulas was separated into n containing and p containing molecules to describe the similarities and differences among upstream runoff and downstream waters for one temporal point compounds were grouped into molecular classes e g lipid protein carbohydrate lignin tannin condensed aromatic like and visualized using van krevelen diagrams according to the elemental ratios of hydrogen to carbon h c against the oxygen to carbon o c kim et al 2003 biochemical compound class boundaries are reported based on c h and o for the following h c and o c ranges lipids 0 o c 0 3 and 1 5 h c 2 5 proteins 0 3 o c 0 55 and 1 5 h c 2 3 amino sugars 0 55 o c 0 7 and 1 5 h c 2 2 carbohydrates 0 7 o c

general identified molecular formulas are considered more bioavailable with h c 1 5 and less bioavailable with h c 1 5 koch and dittmar 2006 similarly molecules with higher o c values are more oxygenated than molecules with lower o c values in addition the double bond equivalent dbe aromaticity index ai and nominal oxidation state of c nosc were calculated to identify the degree of saturation aromaticity and oxidation state of don and dop bailey et al 2017 koch and dittmar 2006 stenson et al 2003 a higher dbe ai and nosc mean less saturation more aromatic and more oxidization respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal and spatial variation of dissolved n and p concentrations mean tdn and tdp concentrations across the five sampling sites july 2019 to march 2020 were 0 93 9 23 mg l and 0 04 0 41 mg l respectively with significantly p 0 05 higher concentrations in agricultural runoff r1 and r2 than upstream u and downstream d1 and d2 waters si table s1 the mean don tdn ranged from 0 28 to 0 84 across the sites and was lower in runoff 0 28 for r1 0 44 for r2 than in other waters 0 69 for u 0 59 for d1 and 0 84 for d2 the dop tdp was similar 0 45 0 47 in upstream and downstream waters and lowest in r1 0 20 and highest in r2 0 61 the abundance of don and dop in upstream and downstream waters implies the important role of organic n and p forms in surface waters further the concentrations of don in runoff 2 45 2 77 mg l were significantly p 0 5 greater than upstream 0 60 mg l and downstream 0 75 0 77 mg l indicating agricultural runoff is an important contributor of don these results align with other studies that observed the dominance of don in streams and estuarine waters jani and toor 2018 lusk and toor 2016a pellerin et al 2006 3 2 mass spectra of runoff and surface waters the number of identified formulas i e compounds containing c h n o s and p with the ft icr ms across the five sites ranged from 2994 to 3791 with masses of 201 1 to 711 2 da si fig s1 the assigned dissolved organic matter molecular formulas in water samples mainly consisted of cho 50 63 followed by chon 13 25 and chos 10 28 si fig s2 with 1 4 formulas assigned to chop chons chonp chosp chonsp in other words across the sites the n containing formulas chon accounted for 13 25 whereas the number of p containing formulas chop accounted for 1 of the total number of detected elemental formulas the lower proportion of chop than chon classes indicate a relatively simple molecular composition of the p containing formulas this might be due to greater abundances of n containing formulas from terrigenous and anthropogenic inputs low concentrations of dop 0 02 0 09 mg l in our water samples si table s1 than previously reported by sharma et al 2017 in runoff from cropping soils 0 52 0 12 mg l suggests a rapid turnover of dop in our watershed sites it is also possible that a part of dop may have been degraded and adsorbed to sediments along the creek as previous studies have pointed out that ditch sediment may function as a sink of dissolved p collins et al 2016 the results of the pca in our study showed that all detected dissolved organic matter compounds including those containing n and p in upstream u and agricultural runoff r1 and r2 were more closely related in terms of overall molecular composition but were less related compared to the dissolved organic matter in downstream waters d1 and d2 that were more closely related to each other fig 2 a recent ft icr ms studies of dissolved organic matter in soil and sediment environments using pca have successfully demonstrated similarities or differences between samples that can be linked to environmental or experimental factors hawkes et al 2016 wilmoth et al 2021 the overall dissolved organic matter profiles in our study most likely reflect their geographical location which give rise to the observed similarities and differences between sample groups identified in the pca for example the upstream and runoff sites geographically are closer together and from agricultural lands whereas the downstream sites are further away closer to each other and receive runoff from other land uses such as forested areas we found that the distance between samples and their respective land types contribute to shaping dissolved organic matter molecular profiles within the watershed and that this is important for uncovering the mechanisms that determine the composition and transformations of c n and p across the watershed 3 3 molecular characteristics of don the heteroatom class of n containing molecules across the sites was in the order of chon 77 92 chons 4 18 chonsp 1 5 chonp 1 4 which is similar to those reported in agricultural runoff and groundwater li et al 2018 nai et al 2020 in addition the percent of chons chonsp and chonp varied across the sites 8 23 which implies heterogeneity of don among the sampling sites all detected n containing molecules shown in the van krevelen diagram indicate our samples were comprised mainly of lignin like compounds 62 74 followed by condensed hydrocarbons 14 25 and tannins 8 12 fig 2b proteins accounted for only 0 8 2 of the assigned n containing molecules whereas amino sugars unsaturated hydrocarbons and lipids accounted for 1 indicating that 5 of total n containing molecules in our samples were more bioavailable in the n containing molecules the predominance of the lignin like compounds 62 74 was similar to previous studies of agricultural runoff 61 li et al 2018 lakes 75 80 liu et al 2020 and urban streams and rivers 70 80 lusk and toor 2016a zhang et al 2021 the greatest proportion of n containing formulas in runoff samples r1 and r2 20 and 25 than upstream u 18 and downstream d1 and d2 13 and 14 suggested that the composition of don in the runoff was more diverse likely due to presence and contributions of various don sources e g crop residues soil organic matter transformed fertilizer products in the agricultural soils this corresponded with the results of don concentrations which were 4 times greater p 0 05 in the runoff 2 45 2 77 mg l than in upstream and downstream waters 0 60 0 77 mg l si table s1 the impacts of agricultural activities and crop species on the proportion of n containing compounds have been reported in previous studies li et al 2018 nai et al 2020 for example the presence of legumes e g soybeans and crop residues in the fields where we collected the runoff samples could potentially lead to an increase in don losses from agricultural lands oelmann et al 2007 these results suggest that agricultural runoff is an important contributor to don and diversity of n containing compounds which can significantly affect water quality in downstream water bodies 3 4 molecular characteristics of dop the assigned p containing formulas mainly consisted of chonsp 25 85 followed by chonp 7 68 chop 0 39 and chosp 0 2 4 the dominant molecular class of the p containing molecules varied across the sites with the upstream and runoff sites containing a greater proportion of lignin like compounds and the downstream sites containing a greater proportion of condensed hydrocarbons fig 2c more specifically most of the dop compounds were present in lignin 51 proteins 26 and unsaturated hydrocarbons 10 in the upstream waters in the runoff lignin constituted 53 of the dop compounds in r1 site followed by amino sugars carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons 40 whereas lignin constituted 70 of the dop molecules in r2 site followed by condensed hydrocarbons and proteins 20 condensed hydrocarbons were the dominant dop compound in both downstream sites 48 in d2 and 90 in d1 followed by proteins 10 in d1 site and lignin 48 in d2 site overall our data showed high variability in the composition of p containing formulas across the sites with more bioavailable compounds amino sugars carbohydrates lipids and proteins accounting for 4 31 of dop molecules whereas less bioavailable compounds lignin tannins condensed hydrocarbons unsaturated hydrocarbons accounted for 69 96 of dop molecules this finding is in line with brooker et al 2018 who reported that less bioavailable forms of dop such as lignin and tannin like compounds were dominant 80 in agricultural runoff and river samples further a relatively higher proportion of more bioavailable compounds in dop 4 13 than don 5 molecules suggested that dop is generally more bioavailable biodegradable in our samples 3 5 variations in unique don and dop composition in this study the upstream runoff and downstream waters shared 21 of all assigned don formulas indicating that 79 of all detected formulas varied among the different sites in contrast no dop formulas were observed to be shared among the sites likely due to the relatively low levels of site specific dop in our samples 1 of the p containing formulas in dissolved organic matter to further assess don and dop molecular variation across the sites the van krevelen diagrams of unique don and dop formulas not shared among the sites were screened in fig 3 this section focuses most of our discussion on greater abundances of unique n containing formulas in our samples at each site the unique don pool comprised 69 to 233 different molecular formulas representing 5 18 of total don compounds across the sites the diversity of unique don molecular formulas generally increases from upstream to runoff and declines from runoff to downstream fig 3a si fig s3a the van krevelen diagram showed that lignin like compounds were dominant across the sites accounting for 38 68 of unique don followed by condensed hydrocarbons 7 40 and proteins 2 13 the unique dop pool was composed of 25 30 different molecular formulas representing 40 75 of total dop across the sites similar to don the content of unique dop molecular formulas varied from upstream to downstream and was dominated by lignin like compounds 46 73 followed by condensed hydrocarbons 7 40 and proteins 0 31 fig 3b si fig s3b significantly lower ai 0 30 and nosc 0 13 and higher h c 1 26 values in the upstream site were observed for the majority of unique don species as compared to the runoff and downstream sites ai 0 32 0 44 nosc 0 21 0 37 h c 1 00 1 11 si table s3 in addition the unique don molecules with low h c 0 5 1 0 high o c 0 6 1 0 and dbe 20 were more abundant in agricultural runoff green cluster in fig 3a and some of them were absent in the downstream sites purple cluster in the runoff the formed don group mainly reflects the lower saturation of aromatic compounds with relatively high dbe such as lignin condensed hydrocarbons and tannins si fig s4a for example condensed hydrocarbons and tannins in the runoff were enriched by 14 and 12 respectively as compared to upstream water the nosc values of identified molecular classes in this study showed that amino sugars lipids proteins and unsaturated hydrocarbons were more reduced nosc 0 while lignin had an average oxidation state nosc 0 and condensed hydrocarbons and tannins were more oxidized nosc 0 si fig s5 a possible explanation for the enrichment of condensed hydrocarbons and tannins in runoff is that microbes preferentially consumed lower o c compounds e g lipids proteins leading to their increased growth and activity which further enhanced microbial degradation of plant biomass to release more oxygenated and aromatic compounds e g lignin tannins in the agricultural runoff osborne et al 2013 yao et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 this is supported by the observation that 46 of the unique don compounds in the runoff had high o c 0 5 while low o c 0 3 only accounted for 12 formation of the o deficient substances o c 0 3 to o rich substances o c 0 5 in leachate via microbial processing was also observed by yuan et al 2017 the relatively higher abundance of tannins in runoff from our study might be due to the release of phenolic acids from plants liu et al 2020 the reduced proportion of less bioavailable molecules 87 with increasing microbial derived features such as amino sugars and proteins 13 in the downstream waters indicated degradation of a portion of the n containing features during the transport in aerobic surface waters in addition the enrichment of 2 4 of amino sugars and proteins in the downstream could be due to the contributions of anthropogenic inputs e g septic effluent as 4 100 septic systems are located in the coastal bays watershed whereas 2011 and a relatively higher percentage of residential area 2 3 drains to the downstream sites septic impacted groundwater containing more protein like don features has been reported by arnold et al 2014 studies have also reported that a higher proportion of organic n leached to shallow groundwater from septic effluent arnold et al 2014 de and toor 2015 photo active compounds e g lignin are often less bioavailable whereas photo resistant compounds e g proteins tend to be more bioavailable kellerman et al 2014 the van krevelen classification showed that a relatively higher percentage of don and dop formulas fell within more bioavailable molecular regions in upstream 21 and 35 than runoff 6 and 17 and downstream 13 and 4 indicating that the unique don and dop compounds were associated with more bioavailable and photo resistant and less oxidized compounds in the upstream fig 3 si fig s3 in contrast a relatively low proportion of more bioavailable unique don and dop compounds in runoff suggests that compounds were associated with more aromatic compounds and less bioavailable sources it has been suggested that unsaturated hydrocarbons and carbohydrates are subjected to both biological and photochemical processes spence and kelleher 2016 the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons and carbohydrates was relatively lower in downstream for both unique don and dop 2 as compared to upstream and runoff 3 12 indicating that compounds that are easily biodegraded and photodegraded would be rapidly consumed in the downstream waters 3 6 sources and transformation of don and dop a dominance of lignin and condensed aromatics in agricultural and forest soils was reported in previous studies nai et al 2020 ohno et al 2014 thieme et al 2019 the greater lignin like formulas of don and dop in our samples are generally believed to originate from vascular plant materials and soil sediment derived organic matter and are mainly present due to their resistance to decomposition and availability these all sources exist in our study area as forest and agricultural land uses comprise 90 of the total watershed area fig 1 potential sources of condensed hydrocarbons sub dominant formulas of don and dop in our samples may include compounds arising due to the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter and microbial processing of lignin and tannins li et al 2018 ward et al 2013 further accumulation of soluble condensed aromatics could occur in agricultural soils and river sediments with aging in the environment hockaday et al 2007 more bioavailable components with h c 1 5 such as proteins lipids and amino sugars are likely derived from microbes or alga and could primarily reside in the soil organic matter organic fertilizers and endogenous microorganisms brooker et al 2018 feng et al 2016 osborne et al 2013 as the lignin like compounds made up the largest proportion of unique don and dop in our samples we performed kendrick mass defect kmd analysis to further analyze the composition characteristics of lignin like compounds across the sites in general the molecules with more c and h mainly decreased with an increase in kmd the formed unique don compounds in runoff were scattered displaying higher o numbers and kmd o 12 kmd 0 4 and low o number and kmd o 6 kmd 0 2 implying increases in both unsaturated with more oxidized c less bioavailable and saturated with less oxidized c more bioavailable lignin fig 4 a in contrast a large proportion of the unique don lignin like compounds in the upstream and downstream were distributed in the middle part of the kmd diagram 4 o 12 0 2 kmd 0 4 demonstrating that the formed compounds were relatively unsaturated molecules with less carboxyl groups further the distribution of m z against h c and o c plots shows that the wider distribution of m z of lignin like molecular formulas in runoff range 206 610 as compared to upstream and downstream range 300 580 especially in the lower and higher regions si fig s6 this suggested that the low molecular weight lignin derivatives 400 da in agricultural runoff can result from the degradation of larger lignin polymers and may be less bioavailable than larger oligomers 450 da ikeya et al 2015 less lignin like compounds were observed in the unique dop formulas fig 4b however a shift of dbe from upstream mean 11 8 to runoff 14 4 and downstream 13 0 suggests that transformation processes of lignin like dop compounds occurred overall the difference in lignin composition of unique don and dop among the samples implied various sources and transformation of lignin like compounds across the sites 4 conclusion we investigated the molecular character of don and dop in agricultural runoff waters in conjunction with upstream and downstream waters in a watershed we found that 96 of n containing and 69 of p containing assigned molecular formulas had h c 1 5 indicating that 1 dop compounds were more labile than don compounds and 2 more less bioavailable compounds e g lignin tannins condensed hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons were present in various water samples across the watershed we also found evidence of photochemical and or microbial processes alteration of don and dop signatures as they moved through the watershed the results showed that a relatively higher proportion of don and dop formulas were associated with more bioavailable and photo resistant compounds in upstream waters and less bioavailable compounds in the agricultural runoff to some extent due to their resistance to decomposition the less bioavailable don and dop compounds such as condensed hydrocarbons lignin and tannin like features enriched the runoff leading to their accumulation in waters the data provided evidence of the transport of don and dop compounds that exist in agricultural watersheds from runoff to downstream waters this implies that strategies to mitigate n and p losses should consider developing ways to reduce the sources of recalcitrant don and dop compounds in agricultural runoff our study provides new insights into the molecular composition of don and dop in agricultural runoff and surface waters as dissolved chemical species traverse along various flow paths across a watershed demonstrating that high resolution molecular characterization i e ft icr ms enables the identification and determination of relative abundance of key functional groups this approach advances our understanding of don and dop composition and transformations in agricultural watersheds and could be useful in source identification of organic pools of n and p in agroecosystems although this study investigated don and dop molecular composition along a creek in maryland the findings can be useful in other agricultural watersheds to understand the molecular characteristics of organic n and p compounds future studies on spatiotemporal variability in don and dop molecular composition in agricultural runoff waters would be valuable in determining the hot spots and critical contributing source areas of don and dop in agricultural landscapes finally new knowledge of molecular characterization of don and dop in various waters will enable us to better understand the

15895,agricultural runoff is a significant contributor to nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution in water bodies limited information is available about the molecular characteristics of the dissolved organic n don and p dop species in the agricultural runoff and surface waters we employed fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to investigate the changes in the molecular characteristics of don and dop at three watershed positions upstream water runoff from agricultural fields and downstream waters across three watershed locations more bioavailable compounds such as amino sugars carbohydrates lipids and proteins accounted for 5 of don and 4 31 of dop molecules whereas less bioavailable compounds such as lignin tannins condensed hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons were 95 of don and 69 96 of dop of the dissolved organic matter runoff waters from agricultural fields contained the greatest proportion of don formulas 20 25 than upstream 18 and downstream 13 14 waters indicating the presence of a greater diversity of don species in the runoff various nutrient sources present in agricultural fields such as crop residues soil organic matter and transformed fertilizers likely contributed to the diverse composition of don and dop in the runoff which were likely altered as the surface water traversed along the flow pathways in the watershed the presence of more bioavailable molecules detected in upstream compared to agricultural runoff and downstream waters suggests that photochemical and or microbial processes likely altered

p is needed to make progress in meeting the nutrient load reductions target in water bodies studies on source identification of n and p in water bodies have mainly focused on inorganic n and p forms e g nitrate and orthophosphate due to their dominance high bioavailability and contribution to harmful algal blooms paerl et al 2018 however it has been recognized that numerous bioavailable n containing compounds e g amino acids nucleic acids urea present in dissolved organic n don and p containing compounds e g nucleic acids phospholipids phosphoproteins present in dissolved organic p dop in runoff waters are bioavailable to phytoplankton and bacteria lewis et al 2011 sipler and bronk 2014 it is also known that harmful algal species can use don compounds and high don concentration can influence n transformations in aquatic systems lusk and toor 2016a xia et al 2013 limited attention has been given to sources of don and dop in watershed management plans due to the analytical limitations and complexity of chemical structures and classification brooker et al 2018 lusk and toor 2016a consequently there is a need to understand the molecular characteristics and biogeochemical functions e g bioavailability of don and dop in aquatic environments a growing number of studies have pointed out the significant contributions of don and dop in waters soils and sediments and their impact on the nutrient cycles in ecosystems bronk et al 2007 li et al 2018 pisani et al 2017 yang and lusk 2018 zhang et al 2021 studies have indicated a significant n loss via runoff where don accounted for 53 of total dissolved n in agricultural runoff li et al 2018 and 47 69 of total n in stormwater runoff rivers estuaries and lakes jani et al 2020b tom and deborah 2003 xia et al 2013 in most freshwater systems dop often serves as the main fraction of organic p and typically comprises 25 50 of the total p thompson and cotner 2018 in our previous study in urban catchments the seasonal load of dop was 28 and 36 of tp in stormwater runoff and outflowing pond discharges respectively yang et al 2021 further less bioavailable don and dop can serve as a major source for microorganisms when inorganic n and p is limited in aquatic environments jani et al 2020a lang et al 2013 li and brett 2013 it has been demonstrated that the molecular composition and structural characteristics of don and dop can affect their fate and transport processes in the environment brooker et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 recently ultra high resolution mass spectrometry such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been applied to characterize the molecular composition of don and dop in soil sediment and aquatic systems brooker et al 2018 lacroix et al 2021 lusk and toor 2016b for example lusk and toor 2016a 2016 b coupled bioassays with ft icr ms to assess the biodegradability and changes in the molecular composition of don in urban waters in addition brooker et al 2018 employed ft icr ms to characterize dop composition in various pollution sources and aqueous samples these studies revealed that ft icr ms could provide new insights into the molecular composition of complex organic mixtures less bioavailable compounds with high molecular weight such as terrestrial plant derived lignins and tannins have been frequently detected in agricultural runoff and watersheds which are often associated with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon glendell and brazier 2014 li et al 2018 luek et al 2020 vidon et al 2008 recent studies have reported relatively higher amounts of less bioavailable don and dop pools 80 in agricultural runoff while more bioavailable compounds such as amino sugars lipids proteins and carbohydrates accounted for a lower proportion of identified don and dop brooker et al 2018 li et al 2018 in agricultural watersheds the molecular composition of don and dop compounds can be altered by the sources hydrological conditions and abiotic and biotic interactions which would eventually affect the biogeochemical cycles of n and p zhang et al 2021 the objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the molecular composition of don and dop in an agricultural watershed along a creek from upstream to agricultural runoff and downstream waters considering that microbes in agricultural fields are likely more conditioned and poised to degrade proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates before the dissolved organic matter exit in the runoff our first hypothesis h1 was that compared to upstream and downstream the agricultural runoff would contain less bioavailable forms of don and dop in addition we expect that repeated fertilizer amendments in agricultural fields tend to favor microbial metabolism that preferentially and efficiently processes more bioavailable don and dop compared to less bioavailable forms e g lignin and tannins thus our second hypothesis h2 was that molecular diversity of less bioavailable don and dop species would increase as waters move from the upstream to the downstream we expect this because diverse less bioavailable compounds should accumulate in the downstream waters as 1 microbes preferentially degrade simpler don and dop compounds and 2 flowing waters pick up new sources of lignin and tannins from other agricultural and forested areas between upstream and downstream sites to our knowledge this is the first study that systematically investigated both don and dop lability and transformations upstream and downstream of agricultural runoff sources the findings of this study improve our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling and dynamics of don and dop in agricultural runoff and surface waters and will aid in the development of new strategies to mitigate excessive loading of n and p into water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection the study watershed has an area of 12 8 km2 and

2 sample processing and analysis all collected water samples were processed within 24 h of collection a portion of the collected water samples was vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter

quickchem methods 10 107 04 1 c and 10 115 01 1 v was used for inorganic n and p analysis respectively ebina et al 1983 in brief filtered water samples were analyzed for nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n total dissolved n tdn dissolved reactive p drp and total dissolved p tdp the unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total n tn and total p tp for tdn tdp tn and tp analysis samples were digested

and dop tdp drp yang et al 2021 2 3 molecular characterization using ft icr ms to determine the molecular composition of don and dop water samples collected from one event july 19 2019 were extracted and analyzed using ft icr ms this time was chosen as this represents the middle of the crop season in agricultural watersheds in the northeastern united states where corn and soybean are planted in april may and harvested in september october sub filtered water samples collected from all sampling sites were desalted and concentrated using solid phase extraction according to dittmar et al 2008

analysis software was used to convert raw spectra to a list of mass over charge ratio m z values applying ft ms peak picker module with a signal to noise ratio s n threshold of 7 and absolute intensity threshold of 100 formularity software tolić et al 2017 was used to assign chemical formulae based on the criteria described in tfaily et al 2018 the post processing principal component analysis pca and statistical analysis of the assigned don and dop formulas were conducted in microsoft excel and jmp statistical software package jmp pro 13 sas institute since our objective was to characterize the don and dop components present in the dissolved organic matter analysis of molecular formulas was separated into n containing and p containing molecules to describe the similarities and differences among upstream runoff and downstream waters for one temporal point compounds were grouped into molecular classes e g lipid protein carbohydrate lignin tannin condensed aromatic like and visualized using van krevelen diagrams according to the elemental ratios of hydrogen to carbon h c against the oxygen to carbon o c kim et al 2003 biochemical compound class boundaries are reported based on c h and o for the following h c and o c ranges lipids 0 o c 0 3 and 1 5 h c 2 5 proteins 0 3 o c 0 55 and 1 5 h c 2 3 amino sugars 0 55 o c 0 7 and 1 5 h c 2 2 carbohydrates 0 7 o c

general identified molecular formulas are considered more bioavailable with h c 1 5 and less bioavailable with h c 1 5 koch and dittmar 2006 similarly molecules with higher o c values are more oxygenated than molecules with lower o c values in addition the double bond equivalent dbe aromaticity index ai and nominal oxidation state of c nosc were calculated to identify the degree of saturation aromaticity and oxidation state of don and dop bailey et al 2017 koch and dittmar 2006 stenson et al 2003 a higher dbe ai and nosc mean less saturation more aromatic and more oxidization respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal and spatial variation of dissolved n and p concentrations mean tdn and tdp concentrations across the five sampling sites july 2019 to march 2020 were 0 93 9 23 mg l and 0 04 0 41 mg l respectively with significantly p 0 05 higher concentrations in agricultural runoff r1 and r2 than upstream u and downstream d1 and d2 waters si table s1 the mean don tdn ranged from 0 28 to 0 84 across the sites and was lower in runoff 0 28 for r1 0 44 for r2 than in other waters 0 69 for u 0 59 for d1 and 0 84 for d2 the dop tdp was similar 0 45 0 47 in upstream and downstream waters and lowest in r1 0 20 and highest in r2 0 61 the abundance of don and dop in upstream and downstream waters implies the important role of organic n and p forms in surface waters further the concentrations of don in runoff 2 45 2 77 mg l were significantly p 0 5 greater than upstream 0 60 mg l and downstream 0 75 0 77 mg l indicating agricultural runoff is an important contributor of don these results align with other studies that observed the dominance of don in streams and estuarine waters jani and toor 2018 lusk and toor 2016a pellerin et al 2006 3 2 mass spectra of runoff and surface waters the number of identified formulas i e compounds containing c h n o s and p with the ft icr ms across the five sites ranged from 2994 to 3791 with masses of 201 1 to 711 2 da si fig s1 the assigned dissolved organic matter molecular formulas in water samples mainly consisted of cho 50 63 followed by chon 13 25 and chos 10 28 si fig s2 with 1 4 formulas assigned to chop chons chonp chosp chonsp in other words across the sites the n containing formulas chon accounted for 13 25 whereas the number of p containing formulas chop accounted for 1 of the total number of detected elemental formulas the lower proportion of chop than chon classes indicate a relatively simple molecular composition of the p containing formulas this might be due to greater abundances of n containing formulas from terrigenous and anthropogenic inputs low concentrations of dop 0 02 0 09 mg l in our water samples si table s1 than previously reported by sharma et al 2017 in runoff from cropping soils 0 52 0 12 mg l suggests a rapid turnover of dop in our watershed sites it is also possible that a part of dop may have been degraded and adsorbed to sediments along the creek as previous studies have pointed out that ditch sediment may function as a sink of dissolved p collins et al 2016 the results of the pca in our study showed that all detected dissolved organic matter compounds including those containing n and p in upstream u and agricultural runoff r1 and r2 were more closely related in terms of overall molecular composition but were less related compared to the dissolved organic matter in downstream waters d1 and d2 that were more closely related to each other fig 2 a recent ft icr ms studies of dissolved organic matter in soil and sediment environments using pca have successfully demonstrated similarities or differences between samples that can be linked to environmental or experimental factors hawkes et al 2016 wilmoth et al 2021 the overall dissolved organic matter profiles in our study most likely reflect their geographical location which give rise to the observed similarities and differences between sample groups identified in the pca for example the upstream and runoff sites geographically are closer together and from agricultural lands whereas the downstream sites are further away closer to each other and receive runoff from other land uses such as forested areas we found that the distance between samples and their respective land types contribute to shaping dissolved organic matter molecular profiles within the watershed and that this is important for uncovering the mechanisms that determine the composition and transformations of c n and p across the watershed 3 3 molecular characteristics of don the heteroatom class of n containing molecules across the sites was in the order of chon 77 92 chons 4 18 chonsp 1 5 chonp 1 4 which is similar to those reported in agricultural runoff and groundwater li et al 2018 nai et al 2020 in addition the percent of chons chonsp and chonp varied across the sites 8 23 which implies heterogeneity of don among the sampling sites all detected n containing molecules shown in the van krevelen diagram indicate our samples were comprised mainly of lignin like compounds 62 74 followed by condensed hydrocarbons 14 25 and tannins 8 12 fig 2b proteins accounted for only 0 8 2 of the assigned n containing molecules whereas amino sugars unsaturated hydrocarbons and lipids accounted for 1 indicating that 5 of total n containing molecules in our samples were more bioavailable in the n containing molecules the predominance of the lignin like compounds 62 74 was similar to previous studies of agricultural runoff 61 li et al 2018 lakes 75 80 liu et al 2020 and urban streams and rivers 70 80 lusk and toor 2016a zhang et al 2021 the greatest proportion of n containing formulas in runoff samples r1 and r2 20 and 25 than upstream u 18 and downstream d1 and d2 13 and 14 suggested that the composition of don in the runoff was more diverse likely due to presence and contributions of various don sources e g crop residues soil organic matter transformed fertilizer products in the agricultural soils this corresponded with the results of don concentrations which were 4 times greater p 0 05 in the runoff 2 45 2 77 mg l than in upstream and downstream waters 0 60 0 77 mg l si table s1 the impacts of agricultural activities and crop species on the proportion of n containing compounds have been reported in previous studies li et al 2018 nai et al 2020 for example the presence of legumes e g soybeans and crop residues in the fields where we collected the runoff samples could potentially lead to an increase in don losses from agricultural lands oelmann et al 2007 these results suggest that agricultural runoff is an important contributor to don and diversity of n containing compounds which can significantly affect water quality in downstream water bodies 3 4 molecular characteristics of dop the assigned p containing formulas mainly consisted of chonsp 25 85 followed by chonp 7 68 chop 0 39 and chosp 0 2 4 the dominant molecular class of the p containing molecules varied across the sites with the upstream and runoff sites containing a greater proportion of lignin like compounds and the downstream sites containing a greater proportion of condensed hydrocarbons fig 2c more specifically most of the dop compounds were present in lignin 51 proteins 26 and unsaturated hydrocarbons 10 in the upstream waters in the runoff lignin constituted 53 of the dop compounds in r1 site followed by amino sugars carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons 40 whereas lignin constituted 70 of the dop molecules in r2 site followed by condensed hydrocarbons and proteins 20 condensed hydrocarbons were the dominant dop compound in both downstream sites 48 in d2 and 90 in d1 followed by proteins 10 in d1 site and lignin 48 in d2 site overall our data showed high variability in the composition of p containing formulas across the sites with more bioavailable compounds amino sugars carbohydrates lipids and proteins accounting for 4 31 of dop molecules whereas less bioavailable compounds lignin tannins condensed hydrocarbons unsaturated hydrocarbons accounted for 69 96 of dop molecules this finding is in line with brooker et al 2018 who reported that less bioavailable forms of dop such as lignin and tannin like compounds were dominant 80 in agricultural runoff and river samples further a relatively higher proportion of more bioavailable compounds in dop 4 13 than don 5 molecules suggested that dop is generally more bioavailable biodegradable in our samples 3 5 variations in unique don and dop composition in this study the upstream runoff and downstream waters shared 21 of all assigned don formulas indicating that 79 of all detected formulas varied among the different sites in contrast no dop formulas were observed to be shared among the sites likely due to the relatively low levels of site specific dop in our samples 1 of the p containing formulas in dissolved organic matter to further assess don and dop molecular variation across the sites the van krevelen diagrams of unique don and dop formulas not shared among the sites were screened in fig 3 this section focuses most of our discussion on greater abundances of unique n containing formulas in our samples at each site the unique don pool comprised 69 to 233 different molecular formulas representing 5 18 of total don compounds across the sites the diversity of unique don molecular formulas generally increases from upstream to runoff and declines from runoff to downstream fig 3a si fig s3a the van krevelen diagram showed that lignin like compounds were dominant across the sites accounting for 38 68 of unique don followed by condensed hydrocarbons 7 40 and proteins 2 13 the unique dop pool was composed of 25 30 different molecular formulas representing 40 75 of total dop across the sites similar to don the content of unique dop molecular formulas varied from upstream to downstream and was dominated by lignin like compounds 46 73 followed by condensed hydrocarbons 7 40 and proteins 0 31 fig 3b si fig s3b significantly lower ai 0 30 and nosc 0 13 and higher h c 1 26 values in the upstream site were observed for the majority of unique don species as compared to the runoff and downstream sites ai 0 32 0 44 nosc 0 21 0 37 h c 1 00 1 11 si table s3 in addition the unique don molecules with low h c 0 5 1 0 high o c 0 6 1 0 and dbe 20 were more abundant in agricultural runoff green cluster in fig 3a and some of them were absent in the downstream sites purple cluster in the runoff the formed don group mainly reflects the lower saturation of aromatic compounds with relatively high dbe such as lignin condensed hydrocarbons and tannins si fig s4a for example condensed hydrocarbons and tannins in the runoff were enriched by 14 and 12 respectively as compared to upstream water the nosc values of identified molecular classes in this study showed that amino sugars lipids proteins and unsaturated hydrocarbons were more reduced nosc 0 while lignin had an average oxidation state nosc 0 and condensed hydrocarbons and tannins were more oxidized nosc 0 si fig s5 a possible explanation for the enrichment of condensed hydrocarbons and tannins in runoff is that microbes preferentially consumed lower o c compounds e g lipids proteins leading to their increased growth and activity which further enhanced microbial degradation of plant biomass to release more oxygenated and aromatic compounds e g lignin tannins in the agricultural runoff osborne et al 2013 yao et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 this is supported by the observation that 46 of the unique don compounds in the runoff had high o c 0 5 while low o c 0 3 only accounted for 12 formation of the o deficient substances o c 0 3 to o rich substances o c 0 5 in leachate via microbial processing was also observed by yuan et al 2017 the relatively higher abundance of tannins in runoff from our study might be due to the release of phenolic acids from plants liu et al 2020 the reduced proportion of less bioavailable molecules 87 with increasing microbial derived features such as amino sugars and proteins 13 in the downstream waters indicated degradation of a portion of the n containing features during the transport in aerobic surface waters in addition the enrichment of 2 4 of amino sugars and proteins in the downstream could be due to the contributions of anthropogenic inputs e g septic effluent as 4 100 septic systems are located in the coastal bays watershed whereas 2011 and a relatively higher percentage of residential area 2 3 drains to the downstream sites septic impacted groundwater containing more protein like don features has been reported by arnold et al 2014 studies have also reported that a higher proportion of organic n leached to shallow groundwater from septic effluent arnold et al 2014 de and toor 2015 photo active compounds e g lignin are often less bioavailable whereas photo resistant compounds e g proteins tend to be more bioavailable kellerman et al 2014 the van krevelen classification showed that a relatively higher percentage of don and dop formulas fell within more bioavailable molecular regions in upstream 21 and 35 than runoff 6 and 17 and downstream 13 and 4 indicating that the unique don and dop compounds were associated with more bioavailable and photo resistant and less oxidized compounds in the upstream fig 3 si fig s3 in contrast a relatively low proportion of more bioavailable unique don and dop compounds in runoff suggests that compounds were associated with more aromatic compounds and less bioavailable sources it has been suggested that unsaturated hydrocarbons and carbohydrates are subjected to both biological and photochemical processes spence and kelleher 2016 the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons and carbohydrates was relatively lower in downstream for both unique don and dop 2 as compared to upstream and runoff 3 12 indicating that compounds that are easily biodegraded and photodegraded would be rapidly consumed in the downstream waters 3 6 sources and transformation of don and dop a dominance of lignin and condensed aromatics in agricultural and forest soils was reported in previous studies nai et al 2020 ohno et al 2014 thieme et al 2019 the greater lignin like formulas of don and dop in our samples are generally believed to originate from vascular plant materials and soil sediment derived organic matter and are mainly present due to their resistance to decomposition and availability these all sources exist in our study area as forest and agricultural land uses comprise 90 of the total watershed area fig 1 potential sources of condensed hydrocarbons sub dominant formulas of don and dop in our samples may include compounds arising due to the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter and microbial processing of lignin and tannins li et al 2018 ward et al 2013 further accumulation of soluble condensed aromatics could occur in agricultural soils and river sediments with aging in the environment hockaday et al 2007 more bioavailable components with h c 1 5 such as proteins lipids and amino sugars are likely derived from microbes or alga and could primarily reside in the soil organic matter organic fertilizers and endogenous microorganisms brooker et al 2018 feng et al 2016 osborne et al 2013 as the lignin like compounds made up the largest proportion of unique don and dop in our samples we performed kendrick mass defect kmd analysis to further analyze the composition characteristics of lignin like compounds across the sites in general the molecules with more c and h mainly decreased with an increase in kmd the formed unique don compounds in runoff were scattered displaying higher o numbers and kmd o 12 kmd 0 4 and low o number and kmd o 6 kmd 0 2 implying increases in both unsaturated with more oxidized c less bioavailable and saturated with less oxidized c more bioavailable lignin fig 4 a in contrast a large proportion of the unique don lignin like compounds in the upstream and downstream were distributed in the middle part of the kmd diagram 4 o 12 0 2 kmd 0 4 demonstrating that the formed compounds were relatively unsaturated molecules with less carboxyl groups further the distribution of m z against h c and o c plots shows that the wider distribution of m z of lignin like molecular formulas in runoff range 206 610 as compared to upstream and downstream range 300 580 especially in the lower and higher regions si fig s6 this suggested that the low molecular weight lignin derivatives 400 da in agricultural runoff can result from the degradation of larger lignin polymers and may be less bioavailable than larger oligomers 450 da ikeya et al 2015 less lignin like compounds were observed in the unique dop formulas fig 4b however a shift of dbe from upstream mean 11 8 to runoff 14 4 and downstream 13 0 suggests that transformation processes of lignin like dop compounds occurred overall the difference in lignin composition of unique don and dop among the samples implied various sources and transformation of lignin like compounds across the sites 4 conclusion we investigated the molecular character of don and dop in agricultural runoff waters in conjunction with upstream and downstream waters in a watershed we found that 96 of n containing and 69 of p containing assigned molecular formulas had h c 1 5 indicating that 1 dop compounds were more labile than don compounds and 2 more less bioavailable compounds e g lignin tannins condensed hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons were present in various water samples across the watershed we also found evidence of photochemical and or microbial processes alteration of don and dop signatures as they moved through the watershed the results showed that a relatively higher proportion of don and dop formulas were associated with more bioavailable and photo resistant compounds in upstream waters and less bioavailable compounds in the agricultural runoff to some extent due to their resistance to decomposition the less bioavailable don and dop compounds such as condensed hydrocarbons lignin and tannin like features enriched the runoff leading to their accumulation in waters the data provided evidence of the transport of don and dop compounds that exist in agricultural watersheds from runoff to downstream waters this implies that strategies to mitigate n and p losses should consider developing ways to reduce the sources of recalcitrant don and dop compounds in agricultural runoff our study provides new insights into the molecular composition of don and dop in agricultural runoff and surface waters as dissolved chemical species traverse along various flow paths across a watershed demonstrating that high resolution molecular characterization i e ft icr ms enables the identification and determination of relative abundance of key functional groups this approach advances our understanding of don and dop composition and transformations in agricultural watersheds and could be useful in source identification of organic pools of n and p in agroecosystems although this study investigated don and dop molecular composition along a creek in maryland the findings can be useful in other agricultural watersheds to understand the molecular characteristics of organic n and p compounds future studies on spatiotemporal variability in don and dop molecular composition in agricultural runoff waters would be valuable in determining the hot spots and critical contributing source areas of don and dop in agricultural landscapes finally new knowledge of molecular characterization of don and dop in various waters will enable us to better understand the

15896,aquaculture provides livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people but it also forms a significant source of plastic litter that poses a serious hazard to aquatic ecosystems how to assess and subsequently manage plastic loads from aquaculture is a pending and pressing issue for aquaculture sustainability and an important concern for water environment monitoring and management in this study we developed the first framework for estimating plastic litter from aquaculture by combining data from satellite remote sensing drones questionnaires and in situ measurements by acquiring multidimensional human and nature and multiscale centimeter to basin scale data this framework helped us understand the aquaculture farming patterns and its spatial and temporal evolution and thus estimate the plastic load it generates and suggest effective management approaches applying this framework we assessed the marine plastic load from oyster floating raft farming in the maowei sea a typical mariculture bay in china with an increasing farming area approximately 3840 tons of plastic waste is expected to be discharged into the sea in the next four years the average service life of a floating raft without improvements in aquaculture waste management strengthening governance timely plastic removal innovative replacement and transforming farmers behavior patterns are recommended as the subsequent measures for plastic management this framework can be extended to other regions and other aquaculture patterns and is applicable to local regional and global aquaculture plastic litter assessments it is a source based method for evaluating plastic pollution that is more conducive to subsequent plastic management than traditional post contamination environmental monitoring in the context of the global expansion of mariculture and the global commitment to action to combat plastic pollution this approach could play a critical role in the investigation and management of plastic waste in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic load source of microplastics aquaculture satellite remote sensing uav 1 introduction plastic is the most common organic synthetic polymer material in people s daily lives because of its low cost light weight versatility and durability since the 1950s commercial production of plastics has grown exponentially and as market demand continues to grow global annual plastic production has climbed from 2 to 368 million metric tons mt by 2019 plasticseurope 2020 while the amount of plastic products used for recycling is slowly increasing this increase is outpaced by the amount of postconsumer plastic waste accumulating in landfills or the natural environment due to collection costs and technological limitations geyer et al 2017 if current trends continue approximately 12 000 mt of plastic waste will be released into landfills or the natural environment by 2050 geyer et al 2017 with the global average annual discharge of plastic waste reaching 265 mt by 2060 lebreton and andrady 2019 with the surge in the production and use of plastics the ocean a sink for many anthropogenic pollutants is increasingly threatened by plastic litter ten percent of all plastic debris ends up in the oceans bergmann et al 2015 currently the amount of plastic in the ocean exceeds 150 mt and the annual volume of macroplastic and primary microplastic waste entering the ocean is approximately 8 and 1 5 mt respectively boucher and friot 2017 jambeck et al 2015 without effective measures and actions the annual flow of plastic into the ocean could increase 2 6 times by 2040 lau et al 2020 plastic waste dominates the composition of marine debris accounting for 60 80 of the total marine debris and up to 90 99 9 in some areas derraik 2002 lebreton et al 2018 moore 2008 large scale and highly concentrated plastic accumulations have been found in the subtropical gyres of the pacific

prata et al 2021 rochman et al 2016 seeley et al 2020 sridharan et al 2021 tetu et al 2019 troost et al 2018 of course marine plastic pollution is also a severe public health concern microplastics in seafood can produce direct particulate toxicity chemical toxicity and microbial hazards trigger inflammatory responses and disrupt intestinal flora when consumed by humans barboza et al 2020 barboza

plastic litter has been suggested as a planetary boundary threat galloway et al 2017 jahnke et al 2017 villarrubia gómez et al 2018 in 2019 the united nations included plastics as hazardous waste and it is important to strengthen the management of these materials source control and management are cost effective means of combating plastic pollution and require the investigation of sources of pollution and an estimate of the potential environmental loads they generate the major sources of plastic litter leaking into the ocean include land and ocean based sources where domestic industrial and fishing activities represent the most prominent contributors andrady 2011 boucher and friot 2017 derraik 2002 law 2017 li et al 2016 significant progress has been made in estimating and predicting land based plastic loads and in informing strategies to mitigate and manage plastic litter inputs from land into the ocean jambeck et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 however quantitative statistics on ocean based plastic waste e g fisheries and aquaculture are still lacking huntington 2019 lusher et al 2017 marine aquaculture is heavily dependent on the use of plastics e g foam floats buoys ropes and nets and will likely continue to be in the foreseeable future as humans increasingly rely on oceans for food unfortunately discarded and abandoned plastic items form a significant source of marine plastic pollution our previous studies have confirmed the presence of high levels of microplastic contamination in the aquatic environment and organisms in the maowei sea and its adjacent waters zhu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019b the microplastic abundance in this area is higher than that of inflowing rivers revealing the potential contribution of mariculture to microplastics zhu et al 2019b therefore we conducted this study to assess the environmental load of plastics from aquaculture in the maowei sea here we also propose a novel approach to evaluate the plastic waste load from aquaculture by integrating data from satellite remote sensing uavs unoccupied aerial vehicles in situ measurements and questionnaire surveys to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate the contribution of aquaculture to plastic waste taking this as a starting point we expect that the methodology and framework of this study can be extended to other aquaculture industries and can thus advance the assessment and management of aquaculture plastic waste globally 2 material and methods 2 1 research area the maowei sea located in the northern part of the beibu gulf south china sea is a semienclosed bay with a total area of approximately 135 km2 fig 1 a it is fed by the qin dalan and maoling rivers and is connected to the beibu gulf through a narrow outlet its shoreline is surrounded by large areas of natural mangroves or wetlands and is rich in fishery resources zhu et al 2019b the unique ecological environment and natural resources have made it an important natural spawning and breeding ground for oysters in china the maowei sea has been used for mariculture for more than 50 years and has become a typical oyster farming bay of china fig 1b c 2 2 questionnaire survey and in situ field measurements to understand the environmental load of plastics from oyster farming in the maowei sea we interviewed oyster farmers with questionnaires fig 1a and conducted field surveys with the assistance of uavs fig 1d before and after the interviews of primary interest was the methodology adopted for oyster farming how plastic is used therein how plastic might leak into the environment and thus the potential environmental plastic load from oyster farming 2 2 1 presurvey the purpose of the presurvey was to have a preliminary understanding of the state of maowei sea oyster farming and to improve the framing of the final questionnaire in our previous study of microplastics in the maowei sea zhu et al 2019b we conducted a detailed survey of the entire area and its inlet rivers at that time we understood that maowei sea mariculture was dominated by a considerable scale of floating oyster rafts as seen from the satellite fig 1b and uav images fig 1c this survey further revealed that the rapidly growing number of floating rafts heavily relies on plastic products e g foam floats and ropes and that improper disposal of plastic products poses the threat of plastic pollution to the aquatic environment fig 1e 2 2 2 questionnaire the interview format was designed following standard lek local ecological knowledge interview techniques davis and wagner 2003 wang et al 2016 white et al 2005 and was based on a presurvey focusing on the use of plastics in floating oyster raft aquaculture the respondents were all farmers currently engaged in oyster culture from different households in 13 different villages around the maowei sea fig 1a with varying age and experience we believe they are representative of a broader sample of maowei sea oyster farmers in terms of ecological knowledge and experience as part of a questionnaire on broader topics questions included their age years of oyster farming mode of farming species of oysters farmed floating raft area floating raft materials and amount used floating raft life cycle and how they are disposed of once reaching the end of their service life and the farmers level of awareness of government policies related to eco aquaculture all of the informants were informed of the study and gave informed consent after a standardized interview 2 2 3 follow up field survey we conducted a follow up field survey to investigate the maowei sea oyster aquaculture industry and the plastic components used in its floating rafts after observation and measurement we drew a schematic diagram of a grid cell of an oyster farming floating raft based on its structural composition which is locally known as longkou fig 2 a we identified the plastic items used in floating raft culture and described them in the diagram fig 2b the construction of the raft is basically standardized with the skeleton consisting of 5 9 m long fir beams or moso bamboo poles and the joints or intersections fixed with polyethylene ropes the bunding ropes fig 2b1 rafts are floated by cuboid floating blocks polystyrene foam blocks enclosed in a polyethylene plastic bag 38 50 100 cm fig 2b4 and each grid cell contains 2 to 4 plastic blocks oysters are secured to polyethylene ropes suspension ropes fig 2b3 and are suspended in bunches from the raft s skeleton for culture strengthening ropes fig 2 b2 enhance the stability of the raft spanning the length of the long axis and are attached at both ends to anchors that are submerged in the water we randomly selected 10 different rafts and measured and calculated the total weight of each plastic component and the weight per unit area to validate the questionnaire data 1 first the length and width of each individual raft were measured manually to calculate their area s r i and different plastic ropes were sampled and measured to obtain their individual lengths l i length of individual suspension ropes bundling ropes per knot and individual strengthening ropes 2 then we obtained samples of different materials from farmers and weighed individual foam blocks plastic bags wrapped around the foam blocks and different plastic ropes per unit length m u i 3 afterward we obtained uav images of the entire raft fig 1e to count the number of all plastic components n r i number of floating blocks tie knots of bundling rope oyster string suspension ropes and strengthening ropes and to calculate the length of different ropes of a raft l r i l i n r i length of bundling strengthening and suspension ropes for individual floating rafts 4 finally we calculated the mass of plastic used for individual floating rafts blocks m r i m u i n r i ropes m r i m u i l r i and the mass of plastic units per area m s i m r i s r i 2 2 4 evaluation of potential plastic input per unit area per year without considering sudden damage to the rafts e g caused by marine disasters such as typhoons or the need for additional repairs when the service life t y of the floating rafts is over different respondents dispose of them in different ways with some of these farmers choosing to discard them directly into the marine environment we calculated the discarded disposal percentage d based on the questionnaire and calculated the average amount of plastic discarded per square meter of raft m s d the calculation was as follows the amount of plastic used in each floating raft m r i was divided by its area s r i averaged m s and then multiplied by the plastic discard rate d m s i 1 n m ri s ri n m s d m s d i 1 n m r i s r i n d then the average annual disposal of plastic components per square meter m s d y of a floating raft during the service life t y of the raft should be m s d y m s d t y i 1 n m r i s r i n t y d 2 3 satellite remote sensing analysis and calculation of the potential plastic load here we extracted remote sensing information of oyster culture floating rafts in the maowei sea based on the worldview 2 and gf 2 satellite and uav image data the technical flow is shown in fig 3 we used worldview ii as the data source to obtain remote sensing information on oyster culture floating rafts in 2011 which provided 0 5 m panchromatic images and 1 8 m resolution multispectral images then the gram schmidt method laben and brower 2000 in envi 5 3 software exelis visual information solutions boulder co usa which is a high fidelity remote sensing image fusion method was used to fuse 0 5 m panchromatic data and 1 8 m multispectral data to ensure the consistency of spectral information before and after image fusion the fused multispectral image can better maintain the spectral characteristics of the original multispectral image and the spatial resolution has been improved we acquired remote sensing information of the 2018 floating rafts based on gf 2 satellite data which provide 1 m panchromatic and 4 m resolution multispectral images feature submeter spatial resolution high positional accuracy and fast attitude maneuvering capability we also employed the gram schmidt method to merge the acquired 1 m panchromatic data and 4 m multispectral data and the fusion resulted in a high resolution color image with a resolution of 1 m owing to the difference in the resolution of remote sensing data between the two years we resampled the satellite image of 2011 with the envi 5 3 resize tool to obtain the 1 m satellite image with the same resolution as that of 2018 for classification it was necessary to establish interpretation markers which were selected based on a combination of color size shape texture and other features on the satellite images in this study the reading markers mainly included three categories water mangroves and floating rafts having obtained high resolution floating raft satellite images and interpretation marks we then classified the satellite images of the two periods with the supervised classification algorithm of envi 5 3 we evaluated the accuracy of the classification results using the confusion matrix method kappa index congalton 1991 and the results showed that the classification accuracy was 82 15 for floating rafts with uncertain classification results field verification was carried out using uav aerial photography finally arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca usa was used for statistical analyses to map the distribution of floating rafts in the maowei sea in 2011 and 2018 using the area of floating rafts s t in the maowei sea in 2018 extracted from remote sensing data we estimated the total weight m t of the different plastic components the weight that could be discarded into the environment m t d and the average annual discarded amount m t d y for all floating rafts across the whole sea area the calculations are as follows m t m s s t m t d m t d m t d y m t d t y m s s t d t y i 1 n m r i s r i s t d n t y 2 4 data analysis data analyses were performed using spss version 25 ibm corp armonk ny the mann whitney u test was used to examine the relationship between questionnaire data and on site measurement data spearman s correlation method was used to test the correlation between the raft area and the amount of different plastic components curve estimation was used to investigate the relationship between the amount of plastic components and the raft area and to screen the best fit regression model 3 results 3 1 oyster farming situation a total of 74 valid questionnaires were obtained from 13 villages the respondents ages ranged from 26 to 61 years mean sd 43 39 8 31 and the respondents had been engaged in oyster farming for 2 to 36 years 10 86 7 28 fig 4 a they all farmed in the maowei sea and the oyster species farmed was mainly crassostrea hongkongensis eight of the respondents also farmed c ariakensis and two also farmed c sikamea in terms of oyster farming methods 97 of the respondents 72 farmers adopted floating raft culture and the remaining 3 2 farmers used the stake method inserting concrete stakes on the tidal flats of the two oyster farming models the stake method did not use plastic products so we investigated only the plastic products used in the floating raft method 3 2 the amount of different plastic components in floating raft culture the data showed a diversity in the size of the floating rafts s r i ranging from 175 5 to 2250 m2 fig 4b the number of floating foam blocks n r i used in a single floating raft ranged from 45 to 480 the same number as the polyethylene plastic film wrapped around them the lengths l r i of the strengthening ropes and suspension ropes ranged from 40 to 1000 m and 2250 m to 27000 m respectively which when converted into units of mass m r i were 74 793 kg foam blocks 16 169 kg wrapping films 8 193 kg strengthening ropes and 10 123 kg suspension ropes fig 4b the average amount of material per unit floating raft area m s was as follows foam 0 355 0 057 kg m2 film 0 076 0 012 kg m2 strengthening rope 0 099 0 016 kg m2 and suspension rope 0 059 0 003 kg m2 table 1 the results of the mann whitney u test showed that the distribution of the questionnaire data was consistent with the field measurements fig 4c supplementary material table s1 the amount of polyethylene bundling ropes used for lashing the skeleton was mainly calculated based on in situ measurement primarily because respondents were uncertain about the length or mass of the bundling rope they used the measured data showed that the average length of individual tie knots l i of different rafts ranged from 3 62 m to 6 28 m the number of knots n r i for individual rafts ranged from 2640 to 6468 the total length of bundling ropes for individual rafts l r i was 14714 29441 m the mass ranged from 67 kg to 134 kg fig 4b and the average amount of budling ropes used per unit area m s was 0 085 kg m2 for all measured rafts fig 4c the results of the questionnaire and field measurements showed that the amount of plastic components used increased as the floating raft area increased fig 4b and the correlations were significant at p 0 01 fig 4b supplementary material table s2 the results of the curve estimation showed that the power model fig 5 had the highest r squared value supplementary material table s3 and fig s1 and showed the best fit when interpreting the relationship between each plastic component and the area of the floating raft the regression equations are as follows foam blocks y 0 887 x0 870 r2 0 798 p 0 001 film y 0 189 x0 870 r2 0 798 p 0 001 strengthening rope y 0 005 x1 422 r2 0 921 p 0 001 and suspension rope y 0 057 x1 004 r2 0 947 p 0 001 where y represents the mass of the different plastic components of a raft and x represents the area of the raft 3 3 life span of floating rafts and oyster harvesting cycle the questionnaire showed that the service time t y of the floating rafts including foam floating blocks wrapping films strengthening ropes and bundling ropes was 2 7 years mean 4 0 0 9 y median 4 y mode 4 y fig 4d when this usage threshold is reached approximately 49 35 of the respondents fig 4e will choose to dispose of their rafts directly into the marine environment with the plastic components on them the life span of suspension ropes t y is independent of the floating raft and is correlated with the maturation and sale of the oysters when farmed oysters are sold 1 5 years from larvae to market sale the suspension ropes are all released into the environment different farmers harvest different rounds of oysters range 1 6 mean 2 1 median 2 mode 2 over the lifecycle of their raft therefore based on the mode 2 suspension ropes will be discarded twice during the lifetime of a floating raft 3 4 spatial and temporal variation in floating rafts and the plastic load to calculate the plastic load from oyster farming throughout the maowei sea and to analyze its spatial and temporal variation patterns we calculated the total area of floating rafts s t in the maowei sea in 2011 and 2018 extracted by satellite remote sensing fig 6 the area of the floating raft increased from 336 28 hectares 1 hectare 10 000 m2 in 2011 to 916 08 hectares in 2018 an increase of 579 80 hectares or 172 the average annual increase was 82 83 hectares spatially the pattern of oyster farming changed greatly with the largest expansion area in the qinzhou port area located in the southern part of the maowei sea and the estuaries of inflowing rivers especially the mouth of the qin river based on the area of oyster floating raft aquaculture in the maowei sea in 2018 the amount of plastic components used across the sea area m t was 6 17 106 kg table 1 when the rafts reach the end of their service life 1 60 106 kg of foams 3 40 105 kg of wrapping films 4 45 105 kg of strengthening ropes 3 79 105 kg of bundling ropes and 1 08 106 kg of suspension ropes a total of 3 84 106 kg of plastic waste m t d will be discarded into the marine environment table 1 if the life span of the raft t y is 4 years the average amount of plastic released into the sea is 9 61 105 kg per year with an average inflow of approximately 0 105 kg per square meter per year table 1 without changes in the total floating raft area and management practices 9 61 106 kg 9 610 tons of plastic waste will be discarded into the maowei sea from 2021 to 2030 and 28 830 tons will be discarded by 2050 3 5 management suggestions based on the investigation of farmers and their floating raft culture we propose the following recommendations for reducing the environmental plastic load from aquaculture 1 strengthening governance among the respondents nearly 77 fig 4f were not aware of the government s policy on ecological farming indicating that governments still need to strengthen their efforts in farming regulation and policy dissemination 2 plastic removal approximately 49 of respondents fig 4e chose to abandon decommissioned floating rafts directly in the marine environment and some abandoned rafts were visible in the sea fig 2e and urgently need to be cleaned up especially before the plastic parts on them become microplastics 3 replacement the service life of floating rafts is mostly 4 years but can be only 2 years for some rafts fig 4d it is necessary to replace the current materials through technological innovation to improve the service life of floating rafts or recycle related materials and ultimately reduce the environmental release of plastic waste products 4 transformation of farmers behavior most farmers do not understand the concept and policy of ecological aquaculture and do not regulate their plastic emissions reflecting their current lack of ecological awareness of sustainable development there is an urgent need to provide them with relevant ecological education cultivate their awareness of environmental protection and eventually transform their behavior patterns 3 6 generalization of the framework for assessing the plastic load we outlined the framework that guided this study to quantify the environmental plastic load of oyster floating raft culture and interpreted its feasibility to be extended to other aquaculture patterns fig 7 the research framework was based on integrating satellite remote sensing uavs questionnaires and field measurements to obtain multidimensional human and nature and multiscale centimeter to basin scale data to understand the spatial and temporal distribution and evolution of aquaculture calculate its plastic load and thus propose management measures the framework included the following five key aspects 1 acquisition of aquaculture information at different spatial and temporal scales through satellite remote sensing to understand the distribution area size and historical changes among other factors 2 uav remote sensing was used to quickly and precisely acquire high resolution aquaculture images of different areas to assist manual measurements and improve the efficiency of field surveys 3 questionnaire surveys of aquaculture farmers were conducted to understand the ecological knowledge related to aquaculture including culture patterns use of plastic components use and management of aquaculture equipment and ecological awareness of farmers to provide data support for subsequent assessment and management of plastic loads 4 field surveys and measurements were conducted to deconstruct aquaculture patterns identify and measure plastic components used understand their use patterns and calculate their usage per unit area 5 data integration was performed to calculate the potential plastic load from aquaculture for the whole target area regression equations were constructed between the aquaculture area and different plastic component usages to optimize the plastic load calculation method adapting this framework researchers can analyze the plastic load of open water cages and longline aquacultures fig 7 first researchers need to investigate aquaculture through farmer questionnaires or field measurements to understand the type of plastic components e g floating collars buoys ropes and nets amount used cycle time and waste disposal or recycling methods subsequently the plastic components used in aquaculture need to be standardized by calculating the average amount used and discarded per unit area or length finally after acquiring the area of culture cages or the length of the longline for the whole survey area using drones or satellite remote sensing the potential plastic load from aquaculture in the area can then be assessed 4 discussion plastic products are widely used in aquaculture because of their durability reliability and resistance to abrasion and rust in the water environment which makes aquaculture a source of plastic pollution globally aquaculture production more than tripled between 1997 and 2017 from 34 mt to 112 mt evolving from a relatively minor to a mainstream role in the global food system naylor et al 2021a and is expected to continue to expand in the future to meet the growing food demand costello et al 2020 golden et al 2021 naylor et al 2021b this will be accompanied by increased production application and discharge of plastic products by this industry worldwide thus there is an urgent need to establish a methodology to assess plastic litter generated by this industry and to conduct a global assessment and management it is also recommended that the evaluation of environmental plastic loads from aquaculture be incorporated into aquaculture risk analysis systems and into aquaculture sustainable development strategies in the context of the high levels of microplastic contamination detected in the waters sediments and organisms of the maowei sea and its adjacent waters xue et al 2020 zhu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019b we conducted this study with integrated satellite remote sensing uavs questionnaires and field measurements in an attempt to determine whether and how oyster farming in the maowei sea contributes to environmental plastic loads the results showed that oyster aquaculture in the maowei sea was dominated by floating raft culture in which plastic components polystyrene foam blocks polyethylene plastic films polyethylene strengthening ropes bundling ropes and suspension ropes formed a source of plastic pollution as the rafts reached the end of their service life a total of 6 17 106 kg 6 170 tons of plastic items were used for floating rafts throughout the maowei sea in 2018 with 3 84 106 kg 3840 tons of plastic waste to be released into the environment in the next four years table 1 excluding changes in the floating raft area and management practices the oyster farming industry in the maowei sea discharges approximately 9 61 105 kg 961 tons of plastic litter per year from 2021 to 2030 9 610 tons of plastic waste will be disposed of in the maowei sea if the increase in the total area of floating rafts follows the 2011 to 2018 trend average 82 83 hectares per year then the inflow of plastic litter will be even higher in the future these data indicate that the annual output of plastic waste from aquaculture in the maowei sea has approached the contribution of a river e g danube river or rhine river in one year lebreton et al 2017 lechner et al 2014 indicating that we may have underestimated the amount of plastics from marine sources limited by the paucity of marine source data or assessment methods in previous studies it is commonly assumed that 80 of plastic waste in the ocean comes from land based sources jang et al 2020 li et al 2016 or from the top 5 schmidt et al 2017 162 lebreton et al 2017 or 1656 meijer et al 2021 rivers the three studies had different methodologies and different results but this study suggests that the above estimates may be adjusted again when the global aquaculture plastic load is estimated more importantly it is worth raising our concern and taking timely action to avoid more plastics from aquaculture entering the ocean and turning into unmanageable small particles of microplastics leading to more ecological hazards the chinese government has issued the plastic pollution control action plan for the 14th five year plan to strengthen the whole chain of plastic pollution management providing an opportunity to implement actions in an effort to promote plastic control in the aquaculture industry this study opens a new avenue of exploration for the assessment of plastics from marine sources although the potential amount of plastic waste from aquaculture is relatively large it is promising that the pre assessment and management measures proposed in this study can largely reduce the leakage of these plastic wastes the current study assesses the environmental plastic load from aquaculture before plastic waste is imported into the environment and we believe it has three important implications for future research first it provides a paradigmatic framework for the assessment of plastics from aquaculture it is well known that ocean sourced plastic waste from fisheries and aquaculture whether macroplastics mesoplastics or microplastics has direct impacts on marine organisms and habitats bringer et al 2021a gilman et al 2021 jang et al 2020 macfadyen et al 2009 perez venegas et al 2021 wilcox et al 2015 however there are few figures available thus far on the contribution of aquaculture to the marine plastic load let alone globally assessed data huntington 2019 lusher et al 2017 making it possible to underestimate the amount of ocean sourced plastics and underestimate the threat they pose thereby weakening the ecological development and regulation of this industry the difficulty in estimation is mainly because there is no effective monitoring system at aquaculture farms and the amount of plastic leakage varies from farm to farm e g depending on farming patterns material usage and management huntington 2019 lusher et al 2017 we argue that despite the diversity of aquaculture patterns the use of plastic components types and amounts used for each pattern can be standardized modularized and converted into a regression function of the farmed area the size of the aquaculture area can be easily obtained by monitoring the marker components e g floating rafts buoys foams flags floating collars handrails of farming equipment on the water surface by remote sensing techniques which have transformed ecological studies by providing a spatial and temporal view of ecological phenomena anderson and gaston 2013 in addition by using farmer questionnaires researchers can determine the lifespan or life cycle of plastic parts and how they are disposed of when they are decommissioned and turned into plastic waste further calculating the amount of these parts that enter the marine environment second compared with traditional studies based on environmental monitoring data to identify the source of pollution this study evaluates plastic pollution from the source which is more conducive to plastic waste management in terms of technology and cost risk analysis in aquaculture has been extensively studied arthur et al 2009 gephart et al 2021 but risk assessments associated with plastic losses are relatively scarce previous studies on the detection of microplastics in the marine environment and organisms have highlighted aquaculture as one of the sources of plastic pollution bringer et al 2021b chen et al 2018 jang et al 2020 xue et al 2020 zhu et al 2019b playing an active role in the evaluation of the post release impacts of plastics but lagging behind in terms of the governance of plastic pollution when relying on environmental monitoring data for management pollution has become a reality plastic items have undergone migration fragmentation and chemical decomposition their distribution has expanded particle size has decreased potential hazards have increased for example aged styrofoams pose potential dioxin like risks to marine life chen et al 2019 and accordingly the difficulty and technical needs of pollution management have increased in contrast this study advocates assessing the sources of pollutants before they are released into the environment plastic waste discarded during aquaculture can be reduced through interventions in farmer behavior e g by developing policies or science education to raise ecological awareness among farmers reducing direct discards of plastic parts during oyster raft decommissioning and enhancing plastic management we believe this approach to plastic management would be cost effective third and finally during questionnaire surveys researchers can provide science education to improve farmers knowledge about plastic waste and ecological aquaculture thus beginning the plastic waste management process at the start of the study we learned from our interactions with farmers that they are willing to improve their management of plastic waste from floating rafts when they understand the ecological hazards of casually disposing of them in the ocean this raises the question for researchers and managers of how to provide farmers with knowledge innovative technical products and or financial support to manage and control plastic waste generated by their industry the right incentives can raise the ecological awareness of aquaculture farmers and can also encourage them to prevent waste entering the ocean and to collect what is present already other data show that there is currently large scale oyster aquaculture in china 1400 km2 80 of global production but fewer than 10 of oyster farmers have aquaculture permits or licenses yang et al 2021 therefore it is also particularly important to develop laws or regulations to regulate the use of the sea to regulate aquaculture to promote equitable justice and to achieve a balance between farmers livelihoods and ecological conservation however the development of these management methods and the implementation of management practices both need to be based on an understanding of aquaculture farmers and their farming status questionnaire research is an effective method for achieving this goal it should be noted that this study only focused on one aquaculture mode as the scale of global aquaculture increases and farming patterns diversify the research framework fig 7 needs to be further adapted and extended this study used satellite remote sensing and drones to assess the area of culture thus the method will not be applicable if it is not possible to determine the area of a certain culture pattern from the water surface however there will not be too many such cases of field farming because farmers usually mark their farming areas with obvious signs to facilitate their own identification and prevent conflicts with other marine activities further work should include what plastic products are used in different forms of aquaculture the main causes and pathways by which these plastics are introduced into the marine environment and management measures to prevent plastics from being discarded into the environment 5 conclusions the rapidly growing aquaculture industry plays an important role in global food security but at the same time it poses a pressing issue of environmental plastic pollution in response to the current situation whereby the amount of plastic litter produced by aquaculture is difficult to evaluate and regional and global data are missing we propose the first framework for evaluating plastic waste from aquaculture using this framework we assessed plastic loads from oyster aquaculture in the maowei sea it was projected that in the absence of effective management and intervention measures the input of plastic waste including polystyrene foams and polyethylene ropes from oyster farming in the maowei sea could reach 961 tons per year close to the annual input of plastics from a river measures such as enhanced governance plastic removal replacement and conversion of farmer behavior are recommended for timely implementation to reduce the input of plastics from aquaculture the framework integrates satellite remote sensing drones questionnaires and field measurements and can be extended to other aquaculture patterns representing an important advance in plastic load assessment methods the framework takes the source of pollution as the entry point for research assesses plastic waste before it enters the environment and involves interaction with aquaculture farmers which will be more conducive for subsequent management actions with the present study as a starting point we hope to promote the assessment and management of plastic litter from aquaculture globally and the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry data

15896,aquaculture provides livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people but it also forms a significant source of plastic litter that poses a serious hazard to aquatic ecosystems how to assess and subsequently manage plastic loads from aquaculture is a pending and pressing issue for aquaculture sustainability and an important concern for water environment monitoring and management in this study we developed the first framework for estimating plastic litter from aquaculture by combining data from satellite remote sensing drones questionnaires and in situ measurements by acquiring multidimensional human and nature and multiscale centimeter to basin scale data this framework helped us understand the aquaculture farming patterns and its spatial and temporal evolution and thus estimate the plastic load it generates and suggest effective management approaches applying this framework we assessed the marine plastic load from oyster floating raft farming in the maowei sea a typical mariculture bay in china with an increasing farming area approximately 3840 tons of plastic waste is expected to be discharged into the sea in the next four years the average service life of a floating raft without improvements in aquaculture waste management strengthening governance timely plastic removal innovative replacement and transforming farmers behavior patterns are recommended as the subsequent measures for plastic management this framework can be extended to other regions and other aquaculture patterns and is applicable to local regional and global aquaculture plastic litter assessments it is a source based method for evaluating plastic pollution that is more conducive to subsequent plastic management than traditional post contamination environmental monitoring in the context of the global expansion of mariculture and the global commitment to action to combat plastic pollution this approach could play a critical role in the investigation and management of plastic waste in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic load source of microplastics aquaculture satellite remote sensing uav 1 introduction plastic is the most common organic synthetic polymer material in people s daily lives because of its low cost light weight versatility and durability since the 1950s commercial production of plastics has grown exponentially and as market demand continues to grow global annual plastic production has climbed from 2 to 368 million metric tons mt by 2019 plasticseurope 2020 while the amount of plastic products used for recycling is slowly increasing this increase is outpaced by the amount of postconsumer plastic waste accumulating in landfills or the natural environment due to collection costs and technological limitations geyer et al 2017 if current trends continue approximately 12 000 mt of plastic waste will be released into landfills or the natural environment by 2050 geyer et al 2017 with the global average annual discharge of plastic waste reaching 265 mt by 2060 lebreton and andrady 2019 with the surge in the production and use of plastics the ocean a sink for many anthropogenic pollutants is increasingly threatened by plastic litter ten percent of all plastic debris ends up in the oceans bergmann et al 2015 currently the amount of plastic in the ocean exceeds 150 mt and the annual volume of macroplastic and primary microplastic waste entering the ocean is approximately 8 and 1 5 mt respectively boucher and friot 2017 jambeck et al 2015 without effective measures and actions the annual flow of plastic into the ocean could increase 2 6 times by 2040 lau et al 2020 plastic waste dominates the composition of marine debris accounting for 60 80 of the total marine

prata et al 2021 rochman et al 2016 seeley et al 2020 sridharan et al 2021 tetu et al 2019 troost et al 2018 of course marine plastic pollution is also a severe public health concern microplastics in

plastic litter has been suggested as a planetary boundary threat galloway et al 2017 jahnke et al 2017 villarrubia gómez et al 2018 in 2019 the united nations included plastics as hazardous waste and it is important to strengthen the management of these materials source control and management are cost effective means of combating plastic pollution and require the investigation of sources of pollution and an estimate of the potential environmental loads they generate the major sources of plastic litter leaking into the ocean include land and ocean based sources where domestic industrial and fishing activities represent the most prominent contributors andrady 2011 boucher and friot 2017 derraik 2002 law 2017 li et al 2016 significant progress has been made in estimating and predicting land based plastic loads and in informing strategies to mitigate and manage plastic litter inputs from land into the ocean jambeck et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 however quantitative statistics on ocean based plastic waste e g fisheries and aquaculture are still lacking huntington 2019 lusher et al 2017 marine aquaculture is heavily dependent on the use of plastics e g foam floats buoys ropes and nets and will likely continue to be in the foreseeable future as humans increasingly rely on oceans for food unfortunately discarded and abandoned plastic items form a significant source of marine plastic pollution our previous studies have confirmed the presence of high levels of microplastic contamination in the aquatic environment and organisms in the maowei sea and its adjacent waters zhu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019b the microplastic abundance in this area is higher than that of inflowing rivers revealing the potential contribution of mariculture to microplastics zhu et al 2019b therefore we conducted this study to assess the environmental load of plastics from aquaculture in the maowei sea here we also propose a novel approach to evaluate the plastic waste load from aquaculture by integrating data from satellite remote sensing uavs unoccupied aerial vehicles in situ measurements and questionnaire surveys to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate the contribution of aquaculture to plastic waste taking this as a starting point we expect that the methodology and framework of this study can be extended to other aquaculture industries and can thus advance the assessment and management of aquaculture plastic waste globally 2 material and methods 2 1 research area the maowei sea located in the northern part of the beibu gulf south china sea is a semienclosed bay with a total area of approximately 135 km2 fig 1 a it is fed by the qin dalan and maoling rivers and is connected to the beibu gulf through a narrow outlet its shoreline is surrounded by large areas of natural mangroves or wetlands and is rich in fishery resources zhu et al 2019b the unique ecological environment and natural resources have made it an important natural spawning and breeding ground for oysters in china the maowei sea has been used for mariculture for more than 50 years and has become a typical oyster farming bay of china fig 1b c 2 2 questionnaire survey and in situ field measurements to understand the environmental load of plastics from oyster farming in the maowei sea we interviewed oyster farmers with questionnaires fig 1a and conducted field surveys with the assistance of uavs fig 1d before and after the interviews of primary interest was the methodology adopted for oyster farming how plastic is used therein how plastic might leak into the environment and thus the potential environmental plastic load from oyster farming 2 2 1 presurvey the purpose of the presurvey was to have a preliminary understanding of the state of maowei sea oyster farming and to improve the framing of the final questionnaire in our previous study of microplastics in the maowei sea zhu et al 2019b we conducted a detailed survey of the entire area and its inlet rivers at that time we understood that maowei sea mariculture was dominated by a considerable scale of floating oyster rafts as seen from the satellite fig 1b and uav images fig 1c this survey further revealed that the rapidly growing number of floating rafts heavily relies on plastic products e g foam floats and ropes and that improper disposal of plastic products poses the threat of plastic pollution to the aquatic environment fig 1e 2 2 2 questionnaire the interview format was designed following standard lek local ecological knowledge interview techniques davis and wagner 2003 wang et al 2016 white et al 2005 and was based on a presurvey focusing on the use of plastics in floating oyster raft aquaculture the respondents were all farmers currently engaged in oyster culture from different households in 13 different villages around the maowei sea fig 1a with varying age and experience we believe they are representative of a broader sample of maowei sea oyster farmers in terms of ecological knowledge and experience as part of a questionnaire on broader topics questions included their age years of oyster farming mode of farming species of oysters farmed floating raft area floating raft materials and amount used floating raft life cycle and how they are disposed of once reaching the end of their service life and the farmers level of awareness of government policies related to eco aquaculture all of the informants were informed of the study and gave informed consent after a standardized interview 2 2 3 follow up field survey we conducted a follow up field survey to investigate the maowei sea oyster aquaculture industry and the plastic components used in its floating rafts after observation and measurement we drew a schematic diagram of a grid cell of an oyster farming floating raft based on its structural composition which is locally known as longkou fig 2 a we identified the plastic items used in floating raft culture and described them in the diagram fig 2b the construction of the raft is basically standardized with the skeleton consisting of 5 9 m long fir beams or moso bamboo poles and the joints or intersections fixed with polyethylene ropes the bunding ropes fig 2b1 rafts are floated by cuboid floating blocks polystyrene foam blocks enclosed in a polyethylene plastic bag 38 50 100 cm fig 2b4 and each grid cell contains 2 to 4 plastic blocks oysters are secured to polyethylene ropes suspension ropes fig 2b3 and are suspended in bunches from the raft s skeleton for culture strengthening ropes fig 2 b2 enhance the stability of the raft spanning the length of the long axis and are attached at both ends to anchors that are submerged in the water we randomly selected 10 different rafts and measured and calculated the total weight of each plastic component and the weight per unit area to validate the questionnaire data 1 first the length and width of each individual raft were measured manually to calculate their area s r i and different plastic ropes were sampled and measured to obtain their individual lengths l i length of individual suspension ropes bundling ropes per knot and individual strengthening ropes 2 then we obtained samples of different materials from farmers and weighed individual foam blocks plastic bags wrapped around the foam blocks and different plastic ropes per unit length m u i 3 afterward we obtained uav images of the entire raft fig 1e to count the number of all plastic components n r i number of floating blocks tie knots of bundling rope oyster string suspension ropes and strengthening ropes and to calculate the length of different ropes of a raft l r i l i n r i length of bundling strengthening and suspension ropes for individual floating rafts 4 finally we calculated the mass of plastic used for individual floating rafts blocks m r i m u i n r i ropes m r i m u i l r i and the mass of plastic units per area m s i m r i s r i 2 2 4 evaluation of potential plastic input per unit area per year without considering sudden damage to the rafts e g caused by marine disasters such as typhoons or the need for additional repairs when the service life t y of the floating rafts is over different respondents dispose of them in different ways with some of these farmers choosing to discard them directly into the marine environment we calculated the discarded disposal percentage d based on the questionnaire and calculated the average amount of plastic discarded per square meter of raft m s d the calculation was as follows the amount of plastic used in each floating raft m r i was divided by its area s r i averaged m s and then multiplied by the plastic discard rate d m s i 1 n m ri s ri n m s d m s d i 1 n m r i s r i n d then the average annual disposal of plastic components per square meter m s d y of a floating raft during the service life t y of the raft should be m s d y m s d t y i 1 n m r i s r i n t y d 2 3 satellite remote sensing analysis and calculation of the potential plastic load here we extracted remote sensing information of oyster culture floating rafts in the maowei sea based on the worldview 2 and gf 2 satellite and uav image data the technical flow is shown in fig 3 we used worldview ii as the data source to obtain remote sensing information on oyster culture floating rafts in 2011 which provided 0 5 m panchromatic images and 1 8 m resolution multispectral images then the gram schmidt method laben and brower 2000 in envi 5 3 software exelis visual information solutions boulder co usa which is a high fidelity remote sensing image fusion method was used to fuse 0 5 m panchromatic data and 1 8 m multispectral data to ensure the consistency of spectral information before and after image fusion the fused multispectral image can better maintain the spectral characteristics of the original multispectral image and the spatial resolution has been improved we acquired remote sensing information of the 2018 floating rafts based on gf 2 satellite data which provide 1 m panchromatic and 4 m resolution multispectral images feature submeter spatial resolution high positional accuracy and fast attitude maneuvering capability we also employed the gram schmidt method to merge the acquired 1 m panchromatic data and 4 m multispectral data and the fusion resulted in a high resolution color image with a resolution of 1 m owing to the difference in the resolution of remote sensing data between the two years we resampled the satellite image of 2011 with the envi 5 3 resize tool to obtain the 1 m satellite image with the same resolution as that of 2018 for classification it was necessary to establish interpretation markers which were selected based on a combination of color size shape texture and other features on the satellite images in this study the reading markers mainly included three categories water mangroves and floating rafts having obtained high resolution floating raft satellite images and interpretation marks we then classified the satellite images of the two periods with the supervised classification algorithm of envi 5 3 we evaluated the accuracy of the classification results using the confusion matrix method kappa index congalton 1991 and the results showed that the classification accuracy was 82 15 for floating rafts with uncertain classification results field verification was carried out using uav aerial photography finally arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca usa was used for statistical analyses to map the distribution of floating rafts in the maowei sea in 2011 and 2018 using the area of floating rafts s t in the maowei sea in 2018 extracted from remote sensing data we estimated the total weight m t of the different plastic components the weight that could be discarded into the environment m t d and the average annual discarded amount m t d y for all floating rafts across the whole sea area the calculations are as follows m t m s s t m t d m t d m t d y m t d t y m s s t d t y i 1 n m r i s r i s t d n t y 2 4 data analysis data analyses were performed using spss version 25 ibm corp armonk ny the mann whitney u test was used to examine the relationship between questionnaire data and on site measurement data spearman s correlation method was used to test the correlation between the raft area and the amount of different plastic components curve estimation was used to investigate the relationship between the amount of plastic components and the raft area and to screen the best fit regression model 3 results 3 1 oyster farming situation a total of 74 valid questionnaires were obtained from 13 villages the respondents ages ranged from 26 to 61 years mean sd 43 39 8 31 and the respondents had been engaged in oyster farming for 2 to 36 years 10 86 7 28 fig 4 a they all farmed in the maowei sea and the oyster species farmed was mainly crassostrea hongkongensis eight of the respondents also farmed c ariakensis and two also farmed c sikamea in terms of oyster farming methods 97 of the respondents 72 farmers adopted floating raft culture and the remaining 3 2 farmers used the stake method inserting concrete stakes on the tidal flats of the two oyster farming models the stake method did not use plastic products so we investigated only the plastic products used in the floating raft method 3 2 the amount of different plastic components in floating raft culture the data showed a diversity in the size of the floating rafts s r i ranging from 175 5 to 2250 m2 fig 4b the number of floating foam blocks n r i used in a single floating raft ranged from 45 to 480 the same number as the polyethylene plastic film wrapped around them the lengths l r i of the strengthening ropes and suspension ropes ranged from 40 to 1000 m and 2250 m to 27000 m respectively which when converted into units of mass m r i were 74 793 kg foam blocks 16 169 kg wrapping films 8 193 kg strengthening ropes and 10 123 kg suspension ropes fig 4b the average amount of material per unit floating raft area m s was as follows foam 0 355 0 057 kg m2 film 0 076 0 012 kg m2 strengthening rope 0 099 0 016 kg m2 and suspension rope 0 059 0 003 kg m2 table 1 the results of the mann whitney u test showed that the distribution of the questionnaire data was consistent with the field measurements fig 4c supplementary material table s1 the amount of polyethylene bundling ropes used for lashing the skeleton was mainly calculated based on in situ measurement primarily because respondents were uncertain about the length or mass of the bundling rope they used the measured data showed that the average length of individual tie knots l i of different rafts ranged from 3 62 m to 6 28 m the number of knots n r i for individual rafts ranged from 2640 to 6468 the total length of bundling ropes for individual rafts l r i was 14714 29441 m the mass ranged from 67 kg to 134 kg fig 4b and the average amount of budling ropes used per unit area m s was 0 085 kg m2 for all measured rafts fig 4c the results of the questionnaire and field measurements showed that the amount of plastic components used increased as the floating raft area increased fig 4b and the correlations were significant at p 0 01 fig 4b supplementary material table s2 the results of the curve estimation showed that the power model fig 5 had the highest r squared value supplementary material table s3 and fig s1 and showed the best fit when interpreting the relationship between each plastic component and the area of the floating raft the regression equations are as follows foam blocks y 0 887 x0 870 r2 0 798 p 0 001 film y 0 189 x0 870 r2 0 798 p 0 001 strengthening rope y 0 005 x1 422 r2 0 921 p 0 001 and suspension rope y 0 057 x1 004 r2 0 947 p 0 001 where y represents the mass of the different plastic components of a raft and x represents the area of the raft 3 3 life span of floating rafts and oyster harvesting cycle the questionnaire showed that the service time t y of the floating rafts including foam floating blocks wrapping films strengthening ropes and bundling ropes was 2 7 years mean 4 0 0 9 y median 4 y mode 4 y fig 4d when this usage threshold is reached approximately 49 35 of the respondents fig 4e will choose to dispose of their rafts directly into the marine environment with the plastic components on them the life span of suspension ropes t y is independent of the floating raft and is correlated with the maturation and sale of the oysters when farmed oysters are sold 1 5 years from larvae to market sale the suspension ropes are all released into the environment different farmers harvest different rounds of oysters range 1 6 mean 2 1 median 2 mode 2 over the lifecycle of their raft therefore based on the mode 2 suspension ropes will be discarded twice during the lifetime of a floating raft 3 4 spatial and temporal variation in floating rafts and the plastic load to calculate the plastic load from oyster farming throughout the maowei sea and to analyze its spatial and temporal variation patterns we calculated the total area of floating rafts s t in the maowei sea in 2011 and 2018 extracted by satellite remote sensing fig 6 the area of the floating raft increased from 336 28 hectares 1 hectare 10 000 m2 in 2011 to 916 08 hectares in 2018 an increase of 579 80 hectares or 172 the average annual increase was 82 83 hectares spatially the pattern of oyster farming changed greatly with the largest expansion area in the qinzhou port area located in the southern part of the maowei sea and the estuaries of inflowing rivers especially the mouth of the qin river based on the area of oyster floating raft aquaculture in the maowei sea in 2018 the amount of plastic components used across the sea area m t was 6 17 106 kg table 1 when the rafts reach the end of their service life 1 60 106 kg of foams 3 40 105 kg of wrapping films 4 45 105 kg of strengthening ropes 3 79 105 kg of bundling ropes and 1 08 106 kg of suspension ropes a total of 3 84 106 kg of plastic waste m t d will be discarded into the marine environment table 1 if the life span of the raft t y is 4 years the average amount of plastic released into the sea is 9 61 105 kg per year with an average inflow of approximately 0 105 kg per square meter per year table 1 without changes in the total floating raft area and management practices 9 61 106 kg 9 610 tons of plastic waste will be discarded into the maowei sea from 2021 to 2030 and 28 830 tons will be discarded by 2050 3 5 management suggestions based on the investigation of farmers and their floating raft culture we propose the following recommendations for reducing the environmental plastic load from aquaculture 1 strengthening governance among the respondents nearly 77 fig 4f were not aware of the government s policy on ecological farming indicating that governments still need to strengthen their efforts in farming regulation and policy dissemination 2 plastic removal approximately 49 of respondents fig 4e chose to abandon decommissioned floating rafts directly in the marine environment and some abandoned rafts were visible in the sea fig 2e and urgently need to be cleaned up especially before the plastic parts on them become microplastics 3 replacement the service life of floating rafts is mostly 4 years but can be only 2 years for some rafts fig 4d it is necessary to replace the current materials through technological innovation to improve the service life of floating rafts or recycle related materials and ultimately reduce the environmental release of plastic waste products 4 transformation of farmers behavior most farmers do not understand the concept and policy of ecological aquaculture and do not regulate their plastic emissions reflecting their current lack of ecological awareness of sustainable development there is an urgent need to provide them with relevant ecological education cultivate their awareness of environmental protection and eventually transform their behavior patterns 3 6 generalization of the framework for assessing the plastic load we outlined the framework that guided this study to quantify the environmental plastic load of oyster floating raft culture and interpreted its feasibility to be extended to other aquaculture patterns fig 7 the research framework was based on integrating satellite remote sensing uavs questionnaires and field measurements to obtain multidimensional human and nature and multiscale centimeter to basin scale data to understand the spatial and temporal distribution and evolution of aquaculture calculate its plastic load and thus propose management measures the framework included the following five key aspects 1 acquisition of aquaculture information at different spatial and temporal scales through satellite remote sensing to understand the distribution area size and historical changes among other factors 2 uav remote sensing was used to quickly and precisely acquire high resolution aquaculture images of different areas to assist manual measurements and improve the efficiency of field surveys 3 questionnaire surveys of aquaculture farmers were conducted to understand the ecological knowledge related to aquaculture including culture patterns use of plastic components use and management of aquaculture equipment and ecological awareness of farmers to provide data support for subsequent assessment and management of plastic loads 4 field surveys and measurements were conducted to deconstruct aquaculture patterns identify and measure plastic components used understand their use patterns and calculate their usage per unit area 5 data integration was performed to calculate the potential plastic load from aquaculture for the whole target area regression equations were constructed between the aquaculture area and different plastic component usages to optimize the plastic load calculation method adapting this framework researchers can analyze the plastic load of open water cages and longline aquacultures fig 7 first researchers need to investigate aquaculture through farmer questionnaires or field measurements to understand the type of plastic components e g floating collars buoys ropes and nets amount used cycle time and waste disposal or recycling methods subsequently the plastic components used in aquaculture need to be standardized by calculating the average amount used and discarded per unit area or length finally after acquiring the area of culture cages or the length of the longline for the whole survey area using drones or satellite remote sensing the potential plastic load from aquaculture in the area can then be assessed 4 discussion plastic products are widely used in aquaculture because of their durability reliability and resistance to abrasion and rust in the water environment which makes aquaculture a source of plastic pollution globally aquaculture production more than tripled between 1997 and 2017 from 34 mt to 112 mt evolving from a relatively minor to a mainstream role in the global food system naylor et al 2021a and is expected to continue to expand in the future to meet the growing food demand costello et al 2020 golden et al 2021 naylor et al 2021b this will be accompanied by increased production application and discharge of plastic products by this industry worldwide thus there is an urgent need to establish a methodology to assess plastic litter generated by this industry and to conduct a global assessment and management it is also recommended that the evaluation of environmental plastic loads from aquaculture be incorporated into aquaculture risk analysis systems and into aquaculture sustainable development strategies in the context of the high levels of microplastic contamination detected in the waters sediments and organisms of the maowei sea and its adjacent waters xue et al 2020 zhu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019b we conducted this study with integrated satellite remote sensing uavs questionnaires and field measurements in an attempt to determine whether and how oyster farming in the maowei sea contributes to environmental plastic loads the results showed that oyster aquaculture in the maowei sea was dominated by floating raft culture in which plastic components polystyrene foam blocks polyethylene plastic films polyethylene strengthening ropes bundling ropes and suspension ropes formed a source of plastic pollution as the rafts reached the end of their service life a total of 6 17 106 kg 6 170 tons of plastic items were used for floating rafts throughout the maowei sea in 2018 with 3 84 106 kg 3840 tons of plastic waste to be released into the environment in the next four years table 1 excluding changes in the floating raft area and management practices the oyster farming industry in the maowei sea discharges approximately 9 61 105 kg 961 tons of plastic litter per year from 2021 to 2030 9 610 tons of plastic waste will be disposed of in the maowei sea if the increase in the total area of floating rafts follows the 2011 to 2018 trend average 82 83 hectares per year then the inflow of plastic litter will be even higher in the future these data indicate that the annual output of plastic waste from aquaculture in the maowei sea has approached the contribution of a river e g danube river or rhine river in one year lebreton et al 2017 lechner et al 2014 indicating that we may have underestimated the amount of plastics from marine sources limited by the paucity of marine source data or assessment methods in previous studies it is commonly assumed that 80 of plastic waste in the ocean comes from land based sources jang et al 2020 li et al 2016 or from the top 5 schmidt et al 2017 162 lebreton et al 2017 or 1656 meijer et al 2021 rivers the three studies had different methodologies and different results but this study suggests that the above estimates may be adjusted again when the global aquaculture plastic load is estimated more importantly it is worth raising our concern and taking timely action to avoid more plastics from aquaculture entering the ocean and turning into unmanageable small particles of microplastics leading to more ecological hazards the chinese government has issued the plastic pollution control action plan for the 14th five year plan to strengthen the whole chain of plastic pollution management providing an opportunity to implement actions in an effort to promote plastic control in the aquaculture industry this study opens a new avenue of exploration for the assessment of plastics from marine sources although the potential amount of plastic waste from aquaculture is relatively large it is promising that the pre assessment and management measures proposed in this study can largely reduce the leakage of these plastic wastes the current study assesses the environmental plastic load from aquaculture before plastic waste is imported into the environment and we believe it has three important implications for future research first it provides a paradigmatic framework for the assessment of plastics from aquaculture it is well known that ocean sourced plastic waste from fisheries and aquaculture whether macroplastics mesoplastics or microplastics has direct impacts on marine organisms and habitats bringer et al 2021a gilman et al 2021 jang et al 2020 macfadyen et al 2009 perez venegas et al 2021 wilcox et al 2015 however there are few figures available thus far on the contribution of aquaculture to the marine plastic load let alone globally assessed data huntington 2019 lusher et al 2017 making it possible to underestimate the amount of ocean sourced plastics and underestimate the threat they pose thereby weakening the ecological development and regulation of this industry the difficulty in estimation is mainly because there is no effective monitoring system at aquaculture farms and the amount of plastic leakage varies from farm to farm e g depending on farming patterns material usage and management huntington 2019 lusher et al 2017 we argue that despite the diversity of aquaculture patterns the use of plastic components types and amounts used for each pattern can be standardized modularized and converted into a regression function of the farmed area the size of the aquaculture area can be easily obtained by monitoring the marker components e g floating rafts buoys foams flags floating collars handrails of farming equipment on the water surface by remote sensing techniques which have transformed ecological studies by providing a spatial and temporal view of ecological phenomena anderson and gaston 2013 in addition by using farmer questionnaires researchers can determine the lifespan or life cycle of plastic parts and how they are disposed of when they are decommissioned and turned into plastic waste further calculating the amount of these parts that enter the marine environment second compared with traditional studies based on environmental monitoring data to identify the source of pollution this study evaluates plastic pollution from the source which is more conducive to plastic waste management in terms of technology and cost risk analysis in aquaculture has been extensively studied arthur et al 2009 gephart et al 2021 but risk assessments associated with plastic losses are relatively scarce previous studies on the detection of microplastics in the marine environment and organisms have highlighted aquaculture as one of the sources of plastic pollution bringer et al 2021b chen et al 2018 jang et al 2020 xue et al 2020 zhu et al 2019b playing an active role in the evaluation of the post release impacts of plastics but lagging behind in terms of the governance of plastic pollution when relying on environmental monitoring data for management pollution has become a reality plastic items have undergone migration fragmentation and chemical decomposition their distribution has expanded particle size has decreased potential hazards have increased for example aged styrofoams pose potential dioxin like risks to marine life chen et al 2019 and accordingly the difficulty and technical needs of pollution management have increased in contrast this study advocates assessing the sources of pollutants before they are released into the environment plastic waste discarded during aquaculture can be reduced through interventions in farmer behavior e g by developing policies or science education to raise ecological awareness among farmers reducing direct discards of plastic parts during oyster raft decommissioning and enhancing plastic management we believe this approach to plastic management would be cost effective third and finally during questionnaire surveys researchers can provide science education to improve farmers knowledge about plastic waste and ecological aquaculture thus beginning the plastic waste management process at the start of the study we learned from our interactions with farmers that they are willing to improve their management of plastic waste from floating rafts when they understand the ecological hazards of casually disposing of them in the ocean this raises the question for researchers and managers of how to provide farmers with knowledge innovative technical products and or financial support to manage and control plastic waste generated by their industry the right incentives can raise the ecological awareness of aquaculture farmers and can also encourage them to prevent waste entering the ocean and to collect what is present already other data show that there is currently large scale oyster aquaculture in china 1400 km2 80 of global production but fewer than 10 of oyster farmers have aquaculture permits or licenses yang et al 2021 therefore it is also particularly important to develop laws or regulations to regulate the use of the sea to regulate aquaculture to promote equitable justice and to achieve a balance between farmers livelihoods and ecological conservation however the development of these management methods and the implementation of management practices both need to be based on an understanding of aquaculture farmers and their farming status questionnaire research is an effective method for achieving this goal it should be noted that this study only focused on one aquaculture mode as the scale of global aquaculture increases and farming patterns diversify the research framework fig 7 needs to be further adapted and extended this study used satellite remote sensing and drones to assess the area of culture thus the method will not be applicable if it is not possible to determine the area of a certain culture pattern from the water surface however there will not be too many such cases of field farming because farmers usually mark their farming areas with obvious signs to facilitate their own identification and prevent conflicts with other marine activities further work should include what plastic products are used in different forms of aquaculture the main causes and pathways by which these plastics are introduced into the marine environment and management measures to prevent plastics from being discarded into the environment 5 conclusions the rapidly growing aquaculture industry plays an important role in global food security but at the same time it poses a pressing issue of environmental plastic pollution in response to the current situation whereby the amount of plastic litter produced by aquaculture is difficult to evaluate and regional and global data are missing we propose the first framework for evaluating plastic waste from aquaculture using this framework we assessed plastic loads from oyster aquaculture in the maowei sea it was projected that in the absence of effective management and intervention measures the input of plastic waste including polystyrene foams and polyethylene ropes from oyster farming in the maowei sea could reach 961 tons per year close to the annual input of plastics from a river measures such as enhanced governance plastic removal replacement and conversion of farmer behavior are recommended for timely implementation to reduce the input of plastics from aquaculture the framework integrates satellite remote sensing drones questionnaires and field measurements and can be extended to other aquaculture patterns representing an important advance in plastic load assessment methods the framework takes the source of pollution as the entry point for research assesses plastic waste before it enters the environment and involves interaction with aquaculture farmers which will be more conducive for subsequent management actions with the present study as a starting point we hope to promote the assessment and management of plastic litter from aquaculture globally and the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry data

nano esi hrms enabled comprehensive pfas quantitative analysis and suspect screening applicable for rapid investigation and assessment of pfas related exposure and treatment in environmental matrixes

analysis to expedite and advance pfas analysis nano electrospray ionization nano esi represents a promising alternative for sample injection as it is reputed for high sensitivity short run time and low injection volume demand karas et al 2000 wilm and mann 1994 nano esi refers to esi that is equipped with an ultrathin emitter usually 10 100 micrometer in diameter the ultrathin emitter can be charged at high voltage kv to produce nanodroplets from samples or extracts fig s1 promoting efficient ionization and diminishing salt interference enaksha et al 2006 gremmel et al 2017 karas et al 2000 injection by nano esi can also reduce matrix effects since it creates high surface tensions and facilitates more stable and uniform spraying of sample droplets as compared to conventional esi juraschek et al 1999 karas et al 2000 notably even with a small injection volume e g 1 µl nano esi can generate a signal intensity 2 to 3 times higher than that detected by the conventional esi conducive to substantial improvement in sensitivity wilm and mann 1996 furthermore the emitter can be easily replaced for each sample to avoid cross contamination carried over from prior injections gremmel et al 2017 karas et al 2000 as there is no chromatographic separation the running time for nano esi can be as short as 1 2 min given the increasing number of newly identified pfass interest in

suspect screening detection sensitivity and accuracy of 22 target pfass table s1 including pfcas pfsas fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas ftss and hfpo da were compared between nano esi hrms and lc ms ms pfas suspect screening was conducted to profile dominant anionic and zwitterionic pfas constituents in three afff formulations and unveil the dynamics of possible pfas features along with the conventional wastewater treatment processes we also designed a streamlined 2 level classification scheme to synergize absolute quantification of target analytes and semi quantitation of suspect features for the comprehensive analysis of pfass compatible with limited availability of reference and calibration standards the development of this novel analytical approach with nano esi hrms has prominent potential to assist and promote the imminent investigation of fate behavior and exposure of pfass in water and other matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and terminology

in table s2 2 2 sample collection afff formulations three afff formulations table s3 were subsampled from three air force bases afbs and kept in 15 ml conical polypropylene centrifuge tubes prior to the analysis at new jersey institute of technology njit the first afff sample was manufactured by national foam in 1983 and collected directly from its original product container at the eglin afb the second sample was a 3 m afff product dated in 1989 and collected from the original container at the galena afb the third afff from the massachusetts military reservation cape cod ma was a 1999 version

diversity of afff formulations with different manufacturing sources wastewater samples water samples were collected from three domestic wwtps plant r p and l in northern new jersey between july and august 2020 their operation parameters are outlined in table s4 at each wwtp wastewater samples were collected in sequence from the primary influent tank after coarse filtration the aeration tank with activated sludge the secondary clarifier tank and the final effluent after disinfection designated as inf are cla and eff respectively all high density polyethylene hdpe sampling bottles were rinsed with methanol and reagent water in the lab backe et al 2013 and with wastewater samples three times at the sampling site wastewater samples were then filled into 500 ml hdpe bottles leaving no air in the headspace samples were kept in a cooler with ice during the delivery to njit and filtered through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane to remove the biomass and other suspended particles prior to the storage at 4 c to discern the amount of 22 target analytes or other interferences introduced by sampling and analytical activities field reagent blanks frbs were taken and handled along with each sample set in triplicate following the description in epa method 537 1 shoemaker 2018 more details about the wastewater sampling are provided in the si 2 3 sample preparation afff formulations all afffs were diluted with methanol by a factor of 100 000 and filtered by 0 22 μm pes membrane wastewater samples within 48 h after the sample collection all wastewater samples were repeatedly sonicated and gently mixed in their original sampling bottles as previously described backe et al 2013 subsequently solid phase extraction spe was carried out for pfas extraction from wwtp water samples following the standard epa method 537 1 with slight modification see details in si the extract 4 ml was evaporated to dryness with the constant nitrogen flow in a water bath heated at 62 and then dissolved in 1 ml methanol containing 4 water all afff and wastewater samples were spiked with the addition of 10 μl of the mixed is solution and vigorously mixed before the quantitative analysis and

gremmel et al 2017 22 target pfass were analyzed using a 1290 infinity ii hplc system in tandem with 6470a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent santa clara ca liu et al 2021 operation information of lc ms ms is detailed in the supplementary materials pfas analysis by nano esi hrms was operated by a high resolution q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo

method detection limits mdls are provided in the supplementary materials 2 5 suspect screening and analyte identification following barzen hanson s work barzen hanson et al 2017b the suspect screening method was developed to process nano esi hrms data consisting of four steps local database construction background noise removal positive hit screening and molecular structure validation a local pfas database consisting of the chemical formulae smiles structures monoisotopic molecular weights and putative monoisotopic anionic weight of 7300 pfass was constructed based on the master list of pfas substances usepa 2020 and timely updates from recent publications allred et al 2014 backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017a barzen hanson and field 2015 barzen hanson et al 2017b chen et al 2020 field et al 2017 kang et al 2020 li et al 2020 liu and mejia avendano 2013 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2020 wang et al 2020 washington et al 2020 for each sample the nano esi hrms analysis generated a list of mass species m z and their intensities as ms1 data exported by xcalibur thermofisher scientific usa from the raw hrms data file background mass species were subtracted from the samples peak list by traversal comparison between laboratory reagent blanks lrbs methanol solvent controls and samples according to the criteria listed in the supplementary materials after removing background noises mass spectra were matched with those in our local database based on a mass error threshold of 5 ppm additional criteria for screening the positive hits are listed in the supplementary materials all positive hits were gathered as a suspect screening list and ranked by the intensity with a cutoff at 105 a u ions structures were further examined based on the fragmentation patterns in ms2 data obtained by cid the confidence levels of suspect pfass were then determined following the rules indicated by schymanski et al 2014 2 6 semi quantification of suspect pfass to estimate the concentration of the suspect pfass in afff formulations a streamlined semi quantifiable sq approach was developed following previous reports allred et al 2014 backe et al 2013 jacob et al 2021 after structural examination by cid pfas analytes of interest aois see in table 2 were divided into five groups following a two level classification scheme as depicted in fig s2 in level 1 classification each pfas aoi was primarily assigned into one of the three major groups based on its terminal functional group including the sulfonate group so3 the carboxylate group coo and the amide group conh2 since terminal groups govern the ionization efficiencies in esi level 2 classification is further based on the presence of alkyl carbons particularly those adjacent to the terminal functional groups as they interfere with the polarity distinctively from a perfluorinated chain four isotopic labeled iss were assigned as the quantify marker qm for each group accordingly appropriate calibration curves were used for semi quantification by choosing the standards with similar functional moieties and chain lengths more details for the selection of qm and referred calibration curves are introduced in the supplementary materials 2 7 quality assurance quality control precision and accuracy for quality assurance and quality control lrbs and frbs were prepared as described in epa method 537 1 shoemaker 2018 see the supplementary materials the precision and accuracy were determined by taking the percent relative standard deviation as rsd and average percent recovery of 7 laboratory fortified blank lfb replicates shoemaker 2018 respectively in addition continuing calibration check ccc shoemaker 2018 was performed at the beginning of each analysis batch after every ten field samples and at the end of the analysis batch to verify the instrument sensitivity and method calibration 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitive and accurate pfas analysis by nano esi hrms detection by nano esi hrms exhibited high sensitivity for the analysis of 22 target pfass achieving low lods in the range from 3 2 to 36 2 ng l table 1 for lc ms ms good separation was achieved of all 22 target analytes fig s3 and table s5 though their lods exhibited a two order of magnitude span from 1 1 to 135 6 ng l table 1 our lc ms ms method was optimized for detecting c4 c8 pfsas and c6 c8 pfcas that are of primary concern by regulatory agencies with lods in the range of 1 1 to 15 2 ng l however this method was less sensitive in detecting precursor compounds particularly ftss and genx with lods greater than 60 ng l in contrast nano esi hrms exhibited sensitive detection of both c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas and precursor compounds e g ftcas fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids ftucas ftss and hfpo da for these precursor compounds lods of nano esi hrms were 1 2 to 15 6 folds lower than those of lc ms ms compared to lc ms ms nano esi hrms showed similar or higher sensitivity towards all target pfass of different chain lengths and functional moieties likely due to the uniformly formed nanodroplets fig s1 precluding bias derived from the chromatographic separation and solvent elution the precision rsd and accuracy recovery for the nano esi hrms analysis were further assessed by a surrogate corrected recovery experiment with 7 lfb replicates spiked with 5 ng of 22 target pfass as shown in fig s4a the precision 2 11 reflected the high repeatability and reliability of pfas analysis by nano esi hrms fig s4b showed mean surrogate corrected recovery rates between 87 and 120 for 16 pfass five pfass i e perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa pfhxs 5 3 ftca 8 2 fts and hfpo da had recoveries between 120 and 130 and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuda had a mean recovery of 133 the recoveries in the range of 87 133 met the requirement of epa method 537 1 50 150 they presented a comparable performance to previous records for the analyses of pfcas pfsas and ftss 87 99 backe et al 2013 70 149 gremmel et al 2017 and 80 134 coggan et al 2019a validating the effectiveness and robustness of nano esi hrms for the analysis of mixed pfass at environment relevant concentrations furthermore we quantitatively analyzed 22 target pfass in 3 afff formations and 12 wastewater samples using nano esi hrms and lc ms ms respectively as shown in fig s5 results obtained from both detection methods reached good agreement with each other as evident by the significant correlation pearson s τ 0 95 with linear slopes closing to 1 and r2 values greater than 0 91 this supports reliable quantitative analysis of pfass by nano esi hrms in diverse environmental samples which was validated by the epa standardized method using lc ms ms chromatographic separation is renowned for its ability to alleviate matrix effects from coexisting ions which thus boosts the ms response the consensus results between nano esi hrms and lc ms ms analyses revealed no distinguishable matrix effects for the nano esi hrms analysis even with no chromatographic separation employed detailed discussion on comparing results by both methods are provided in the supplementary materials the following sections focus on novel quantitative and qualitative results in afff formulations and wastewater samples obtained by nano esi hrms 3 2 discovery of novel afff constituents suspect screening by nano esi hrms enabled the discovery of 12 chemicals from 9 novel pfas classes to the best of our knowledge which have yet been reported in afff formulations namely tfms perfluoroethyl cyclohexanesulfonate pfechs ketone perfluorooctanesulfonic acid keto pfos fluorotelomer sulfonyl amido sulfonic acid ftsas so2 n ammoniopropyl perfluoroalkanesulfonamidopropylsulfonate n amp fasaps fluorotelomer unsaturated amide sulfonic acid ftuams fluorotelomer amide ftam 2 perfluoroalkyl thio acetatic acid thio n 2 ftca and 2 perfluoroalkyl 3 yl oxy carbonyl hydrazine 1 carboxylate n 2 ft pochc table 2 among them 7 pfas classes had the detection confidence level 3 and above as their structures can be validated by cid ms ms spectra figs s9 s11 s33 while no cid spectra were available for thio 8 2 ftca and 8 2 ft pochc level 4 note that masses m z of n amp fasaps ftuams and ftam anions showed positive matches with the formula records in the local database however during the structure validation their cid spectra revealed that these mass features were novel isomers because their fragmentation patterns were incompatible with the recorded structures for the corresponding masses iupac like names ion formula exact masses mass error table s6 and chemical structure fig 1 are provided for all newly identified pfass to complement the discussion below for tfms pfechs and n amp fasaps as well as in the supplementary materials for the other 6 pfas classes tfms the ms ms cid spectrum of tfms figs 2 a and s9 revealed the detection of m z 148 9517 matched with the theoretical monoisotopic mass of the cf3so3 anion m z 148 9520 by a mass error of 1 9 ppm the daughter m z 80 was identified as the sulfite radical anion so3 this cid spectrum was further verified by a commercial standard of tfms 99 sigma aldrich usa a calibration curve was constructed with this standard in the concentration range from 0 39 ng l to 12 5 μg l fig s10 tfms concentrations were thus quantified as 106 7 2 6 μg ml in afff 1983 29 5 0 6 μg ml in afff 1989 and 383 6 32 8 μg ml in afff 1999 table 2 a recent site survey reported the widespread presence of tfms at concentrations up to 940 ng l near the source and downstream of five firefighting training sites with the historical use of afffs björnsdotter et al 2019 furthermore tfms has also been detected at high frequencies in leachates storm water and surface water in the proximity of municipal and industrial landfills and hazardous waste management facilities björnsdotter et al 2019 as well as groundwater and surface water that serve as drinking water sources schulze et al 2019 though tfms is known as a superacid widely used in organic synthesis björnsdotter et al 2020 kazakova and vasilyev 2017 no documents are available to explain the prevalence of tfms in afff formulations björnsdotter et al 2020 in addition to tfms pfprs another representative ultrashort chain pfaa was also detected in afff 1989 and afff 1999 table 2 as an abundant afff ingredient pfprs fig s11 was confirmed by the cid observation of the deprotonated parent anion m h as well as two pfsa signature fragments i e so3 and cnf2n 1 barzen hanson et al 2017b pfprs has been reported in 5 other afff formulations manufactured by 3 m at the concentration from 120 to 270 μg ml barzen hanson and field 2015 as a potential residual derived from afff manufacture similarly our semi quantification results showed the detection of pfprs at 52 1 and 16 7 μg ml in afff 1989 and afff 1999 respectively both of which were manufactured by 3 m ultrashort chain pfaas are highly persistent mobile and difficult to remove once entering the aquatic environment ateia et al 2019 björnsdotter et al 2019 they can also be generated through the biotransformation of precursor compounds and lurked from treatment facilities e g filtration via desorption ateia et al 2019 yeung et al 2017 recent toxicology research revealed that even low tfms exposure at 10 μg kg could cause liver lipid metabolism disorders in mice zhou et al 2020 the combination of their persistency prevalence and toxicity underscores the need to survey the distribution of ultrashort chain pfaas in the aquatic environment which have been overlooked particularly at sites with historical afff applications to date tfms and other ultrashort chain pfaas have been scarcely investigated primarily due to the analytical challenges e g low retention efficiency of c 18 column of using lc separation barzen hanson and field 2015 björnsdotter et al 2020 therefore our discovery of tfms as a major constituent in afff formulations reconciles its prevalence at afffs impacted sites björnsdotter et al 2019 and thus calls for more attention to tfms and other ultrashort chain pfaas pfechs pfechs fig 1e was detected in afff 1989 at the concentration of 87 7 µg ml using m8 pfos as the internal standard and pfos as the calibration reference respectively the cid spectrum figs 2b and s12 matched the ms ms record of pfechs reported by de silva et al 2011 featured by its fragmentation into a c8 perfluoroalkyl carbanion with one degree of unsaturation c8f15 m z 381 and the sulfonate group so3 m z 80 as the primary collision pathway we postulated a cyclic structure between 1st and 6th carbon from the sulfonate head because the detected fragments cannot be explained by one single double bond assuming the existence of a double bond in this molecule the concurrence of the saturated m z 119 c2f5 and unsaturated m z 131 c3f5 181 c4f7 231 c5f9 281 c6f11 331 c7f13 and 381 c8f15 corroborated its location at 6th carbon contradictorily m z 241 c4f6so3 and 292 c5f8so3 suggested a location of the double bond between 1st and 4th carbon therefore this pfas feature was of great chance to contain a cyclic structure rather than a double bond and thus categorized as pfechs in afff 1989 pfechs is used as an erosion inhibitor for aircraft hydraulic fluids and was synthesized by 3 m as commercial fluorochemical surfactant product fc 98 until the cessation of its production in 2002 de silva et al 2011 pfechs was widely detected at 0 16 5 65 ng l in the great lakes de silva et al 2011 1 04 195 ng l in the surface water downstream of airports de solla et al 2012 wang et al 2016 and up to 77 ng l in rivers marchiandi et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 despite the lack of direct evidence confirming the addition of pfechs in this specific afff formulation the detection of pfechs in this study implies that certain afffs can be contributors to cyclic pfass that may persist in the environment note that unsaturated pfos an isomer of pfechs but with a double bond can also be an issue given its previous reports in afff formulations barzen hanson et al 2017b commercial products barzen hanson and field 2015 barzen hanson et al 2017b and human serum mcdonough et al 2021 thus extra attention is needed to differentiate these isomers pfechs and unsaturated pfos when their physiochemical properties and environmental behaviors are further characterized n amp fasaps in afff 1989 and afff 1999 four homologues n 3 6 belonging to the class of n amp fasaps fig 1k table 2 were identified at relatively high concentrations 10 2 174 2 µg ml as depicted in fig 2c and s13 m z 483 and 319 were detected as signatures of n amp fasaps n 6 representing the mass fragments of this compound without the c3h6so3 side chain and the perfluorinated alkane tail c6f13 respectively the structure of n amp fasaps was further validated by its dissociation patterns such as cnf2n 1 and m c3h6so3 which were identical to n spamp fasaps reported as the class 5 pfass by barzen hanson et al 2017b since these two pfas classes shared the main chain of perfluoroalkane sulfon amido propyl sulfonate cnf2n 1nc3h6so3 barzen hanson et al 2017b when n 3 and 5 the parent ions of n amp fasaps cn perfluoroalkylsulfonamido amino carboxylate pfasac cn 1 cannot completely separate in the cid spectra figs s14 and s15 because the m z differences between these paired compounds were below 0 2 da in the ms1 data fortunately both n amp fasaps cn and pfasac cn 1 were well collided resulting in specific fragments that can be distinctively identified fig s14 and s15 this is the first report of n amp fasaps n 3 6 in afff formulations or any samples and their relatively high concentrations and frequent detections underlined the need of further investigation 3 3 semi quantitative profiling of dominant pfass in afff formulations under esi based on the combination of our absolute and semi quantification results 40 pfass in three afff formulations were outlined in table 2 which met the intensity threshold of 0 1 of 20 µg l m8 pfos as the internal standard equivalent to approximately 0 2 µg ml before dilution 40 pfass were classified into 5 groups including the perfluorinated sulfonate group pfsg fluorotelomer sulfonate group ftsg perfluorinated carboxylate group pfcg fluorotelomer carboxylate group ftcg and fluorotelomer amide group ftamg see details in the supplementary materials among them we highlighted 16 pfass from 9 pfas classes necessitating priority attention marked in red table 2 since 1 they were present at a concerning level 100 μg ml in one or more afff formulations 2 they together accounted for the majority of σpfass in three afffs 88 2 for afff 1983 95 2 for afff 1989 and 96 5 for afff 1999 table s7 and 3 they if not newly identified in this study were reported frequently in previous investigations and surveys of pfass in afff formulations that were typically manufactured via two processes ecf based and fluorotelomerization based ft based barzen hanson et al 2017b place and field 2012 pfos was the most detected pfsa at concentrations of 135 3 5 7 10 949 6 459 9 and 3405 7 143 0 μg ml in afff 1983 1989 and 1999 respectively accounting for 5 6 81 9 and 43 6 of σpfass in these afff formulations meanwhile other pfsas n 2 7 and 9 10 table 2 were also commonly found in these afffs at concentrations approximately one to two orders of magnitude lower than pfos similarly pfsa derivatives with substitutes e g h pfos and cl pfos and functional moieties e g keto pfos were detected below 100 μg ml and only in afff 1989 and 1999 showing the relatively low contribution to the σpfass 0 7 for pfaa precursors ftsass 6 2 and 8 2 followed by ftsas so 6 2 and 8 2 6 2 ftab pfasac n 6 and 6 2 fts were most concerned in afff formulations particularly 6 2 ftsas presented at the concentration of 821 7 81 4 and 1049 1 103 9 μg ml in afff 1983 and 1999 accounting for 33 9 and 13 4 of the σpfass respectively 8 2 ftsas was detected at 996 3 89 7 μg ml in afff 1999 equivalent to 12 7 of the σpfass in afff 1983 6 2 ftsas was the most abundant anionic constituent with a concentration 5 times greater than pfos 6 2 ftsas and 8 2 ftsas were the second and third most abundant components in afff 1999 only lower than pfos among 56 ft based afff formulations 32 and 15 were detected with 6 2 and 8 2 ftsas at concentrations up to 11 000 and 1100 μg ml respectively table 2 indicating their dominance in a variety of afff formulations 6 2 ftsas so showed concentrations of 142 4 19 1 and 279 2 25 1 μg ml in afff 1983 and 1999 respectively 8 2 ftsas so was only detected in afff 1999 at 271 3 18 4 μg ml which contributed to 12 7 to the σpfass despite no quantitative data 6 2 and 8 2 ftsas sos were also detected at notable frequencies 19 36 and 6 12 in previous afff analyses table 2 further 6 2 and 8 2 ftabs were detected in afff 1983 at the concentrations of 450 1 49 1 and 83 1 6 4 μg ml respectively pfasacs n 4 6 were detected in afff 1999 at the concentrations of 56 3 4 9 and 211 1 16 2 μg ml respectively ftss n 6 8 and 10 were detected in afff 1983 and 1999 in the concentration range between 17 and 166 μg ml according to previous studies ftsass ftsas sos ftabs and ftss were reported dominantly in the ft based afff formulations while predominant pfsas with minor pfcas were featuring constituents for ecf based formulations barzen hanson et al 2017b d agostino and mabury 2013 place and field 2012 as summarized in table 2 afff 1983 was found as a typical ft based formulation which agrees with previous investigations on national foam products barzen hanson et al 2017a place and field 2012 3 m afff products are reputed for the ecf based manufacture process which was proved in our study by the dominant presence of pfsas 90 9 and 51 3 especially pfos 81 9 and 43 6 and minor detection of pfcas 1 2 and 0 6 in afff 1989 and afff 1999 uniquely a noticeable proportion of fluorotelomers including ftsass 26 1 and ftsas sos 7 1 were detected in afff 1999 which were rarely associated with 3 m formulations however the presence of fluorotelomers e g 6 2 ftsas 6 2 ftab and 6 2 fts have been reported in two ar afff formations dauchy et al 2017 fluorotelomers were added as foam stabilizers in ar afffs to improve the fire knockdown efficiency kleiner and jho 2009 it is possible that 3 m may have acquired fluorinated additives from other manufacturers though the msds for afff 1999 did not explicitly indicate the supplier information or composition along with other reports our results revealed the mixture of ecf and ft based pfas constituents in ar afff formulations warranting further attention note that target 22 pfass σ22pfass only contributed partially to the σpfass 16 1 91 1 and 47 3 for afff 1983 1989 and 1999 table s7 the profiling of pfass revealed that 27 out of the top 40 dominant constituents in afff samples were non target pfass that are typically not covered by standardized methods using lc ms ms the total concentrations of pfass in ftcg and ftsg were 461 4 to 3285 0 μg ml in three afff formulations table s7 collectively the contribution of ultrashort chain pfaas e g tfms and polyfluorinated fluorotelomer compounds e g ftsass and ftsas sos was remarkable in afff formulations necessitating future monitoring and remediation efforts at impacted sites 3 4 dynamics of target pfass over conventional wastewater treatment we further validated the environmental analysis by nano esi hrms using wastewater samples collected from local wwtps as shown in fig 3 the σ22pfass was 272 6 97 0 ng l in the influents 352 1 223 4 ng l in aeration tanks 382 5 304 1 ng l in clarifier tanks and 327 0 21 3 in the effluents respectively individual target pfas concentration data were pooled among three wwtps to statistically discern the contribution of major wastewater treatment processes using the two way mann whitney u test significant elevation of pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa concentrations was evident across three wwtps in the effluents compared to the influents fig 3 the generation of several pfcas was observed at aeration tanks at plant p concentrations of pfpea pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa increased significantly in the aeration tank compared to those in the influent 8 98 ng l 19 205 ng l 2 47 ng l and 61 106 ng l respectively implying activated sludge can degrade precursors into pfcas in the influent fig s34a at plant r an increase of pfpea 31 78 ng l was also observed however none of the target pfass showed significant change over the activated sludge treatment at plant l fig s34b probably due to the variations in influent compositions and microbial communities of the activated sludge unlike the other two plants that serve small populations plant p is a large size wwtp that handles an average inflow of 226 330 mgd and serves 1 5 million people table s4 which potentially leads to a more intricate input matrix of pfas precursors clarifier tanks were another hot spots where pfas biotransformation might occur presumably through anaerobic processes as evident by the generation of pfhxa p 205 447 ng l l 35 94 ng l and pfpea l 42 79 ng l fig s34 bertanza et al 2013 on the other hand the decrease of pfba 4 9 ng l not detectable pfpea 72 26 ng l and pfhxa 105 22 ng l at plant r might be resulted from either the adsorption to the biosolids and or biotransformation huang and jaffé 2019 nevertheless the roles of biotic and abiotic processes in pfas removal at clarifiers remain elusive and can be influenced by operation parameters such as tank configuration inflow composition and sludge retention time srt as depicted in fig 3 pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfbs remained at concerning concentrations 40 200 ng l in the effluent samples at all three wwtps indicating the inefficiency of the current wastewater treatment process for pfas removal for instance pfoa in the effluent sample of plant p was as high as 90 0 6 6 ng l exceeding its epa s drinking water health advisory level 70 ng l overall effluents of wwtps can be potential point sources pertinently discharging pfass to the receiving waters coggan et al 2019b eriksson et al 2017 gallen et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 recent investigation on target pfass in wwtps revealed that their fate and behaviors can be affected by manifold factors including i the type and size of wwtps ii influent compositions domestic industrial urban runoff versus agricultural chen et al 2018 iii operating factors such as mixed liquor suspended solids temperature hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time kibambe et al 2020 however greater sampling size and frequency at a collection of various wwtps are required to sort out the influence of individual factors on pfas generation and removal over conventional wastewater treatment processes 3 5 possible pfas features newly detected in wwtp matrices using suspect screening we identified 16 possible pfas features in wwtp matrices fig 4 following four stringent criteria 1 they were not found in the solvents lrbs or frbs 2 they were positively detected in at least two replicates of each sample 3 they were detected in more than two wastewater samples and 4 their highest intensities exceeded 1 of that of m8 pfos as the internal standard equivalent to 10 ng l formula and structures of these pfas features were predicted based on molecular weights and their matches in the local database though cid spectra were not available due to the complex media matrix in wwtp samples and or low ms response further details about their putative structures and mass errors are present in table s8 notably two representative ultrashort chain pfaas trifluoroacetate tfa and tfms were found in all wwtp samples with 9 4 and 3 0 fold increments from the influent to the effluent at plant r as well as 7 9 and 2 6 fold increments at plant p fig 4 as recommended by epa method 537 1 shoemaker 2018 the polystyrene divinylbenzene sdvb cartridge was used to extract most pfass that are relatively hydrophobic though not optimal for retaining these two ultrashort chain pfaas to validate the detection of ultrashort chain pfaas we conducted a recovery experiment for tfms and found its extraction efficiency was low as 16 5 fig s35 according to which the estimated occurrence level of tfms in wwtp samples was up to 86 2 ng l though such low extraction efficiency for tfms didn t satisfy the requirement for quantitative analysis our results remained valid to demonstrate the ubiquity and emergence of ultrashort chain pfaas along the wastewater treatment chain in addition ultrashort chain pfaas have been reported in groundwater barzen hanson and field 2015 surface water ateia et al 2019 björnsdotter et al 2019 guardian et al 2020 rain precipitation yeung et al 2017 and even bottled water for drinking chow et al 2021 representing an imminent threat to the water cycle further hydrido perfluoropetanoic acid h pfpea 3 8 ftam pfasac n 1 and n dihydroxybutyl dihob dimethyl ammoniopropylperfluoroalkanesulfonamide n dihobamp fasa n 2 were detected in multiple samples h pfpea 6 2 ftam and pfasacs n 3 8 were reported in afffs aforementioned in this work table 2 and elsewhere barzen hanson et al 2017b d agostino and mabury 2013 the class of n dihobamp fasas n 4 6 was found in afffs impacted groundwater barzen hanson et al 2017b and the class of h pfcas n 4 10 was also recently reported in wastewater samples at wwtps in china wang et al 2020 in addition several highly defluorinated ftcas e g 3 3 ftca and 2 9 ftca and associated features with unsaturation e g 3 3 ftuca and hydrogen substitution e g h 4 9 ftca tended to emerge in the aeration tanks or clarifiers and decline over the subsequent treatment s fig 4 ftcas ftucas and h ftcas were reported as common biotransformation intermediates of pfas precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs kim et al 2014 2012 and ftss d agostino and mabury 2017 shaw et al 2019 observation of these pfas features corroborated their essential roles in the biotransformation of unknown long chain precursors in the wastewater some of these pfas features can also be precursors for short and ultrashort chain pfaas however no significant correlation was observed between the signal intensity of these pfas features fig 4 and the pfaa concentrations fig 3 in this study 4 conclusions this study developed and validated a rapid and sensitive analytical method for screening and semi quantifying both target and suspect pfass by nano esi hrms uniquely nano esi hrms enables a timesaving pfas analysis 2 min per sample without scarifying detection sensitivity and accuracy this rapid pfas analysis is highly desirable for environmental investigations with a large sample size nano esi hrms exhibits a comprehensive detection of diverse pfas features with the inclusion of ultrashort chain and other highly polar molecules that are often overlooked when lc is employed results generated from nano esi hrms are reliable and reproducible without the need for extensive optimization for individual analytes with the assistance of the high resolution detection and efficient screening algorithm nano esi hrms results can support the identification of novel pfas structures and their transformation metabolites produced naturally or over physiochemical and biological treatments here we also reported ultrashort chain pfaas e g tfms pfprs and tfa in afff formulations and wwtp samples for the first time this discovery demonstrated the potential of afff impacted sites and municipal wwtps as point sources of ultrashort chain pfaas pertinently discharging to the receiving water bodies given their extreme hydrophilicity and recalcitrance these ultrashort chain pfaas can spread in the environment and transport through the water cycles affecting regions that are even distant and rural for instance tfms and other ultrashort chain pfaas in surface snow at remote arctic locations björnsdotter et al 2021 considering its ubiquitous existence and environmental persistency ateia et al 2019 chow et al 2021 guardian et al 2020 yeung et al 2017 the contamination of ultrashort chain pfaas has emerged as a global issue urging immediate attention and action nano esi hrms offers an effective alternative to analyze ultrashort chain pfaas though the extraction approach needs to be tailored for these weak anions using wax and other cartridges björnsdotter et al 2021 to date pfas analysis has greatly been hindered by the limited and expensive commercial standards required for absolute quantification to cope with this major obstacle we designed a streamlined 2 level classification scheme to categorize anionic and zwitterionic pfas features into five major groups and assign them with appropriate qms and calibration references for semi quantification when their standards are inaccessible albeit with non negligible quantitative errors concentration data derived from semi quantification render a tangible profile of the complex pfas contamination in the environment and assist environmental engineers and scientists to pinpoint the dominant and other concerned species that could be addressed with priority our analysis primarily focused on anionic pfass given the availability of commercial standards and regulatory significance with the increasing availability of isotopic labeled pfass we recommend improving our experimental design and applying diverse surrogates to track the extraction efficiencies of pfass of different properties in the future with appropriate cationic references and internal standards nano esi hrms is compatible with cationic pfas analysis under the esi mode without significantly modifying this reported method non dissociable neutral pfass e g fluorotelomer alcohols are more suited for the analysis by gc ms when they are sufficiently volatile without chromatographic separation analysis by nano esi hrms can be affected by in source fragmentation and matrix effects however no collision energy was applied to generate the ms1 data which minimizes the potential for in source fragmentation though tfms and ultrashort chain pfaas have been frequently detected in our samples they are unlikely in source fragments due to their unique structures e g shorter chain lengths than known pfas precursors and terminal moieties e g sulfonate and carboxylic acid groups furthermore it should be noted that sensitivity of pfas analysis can be affected by complex matrixes due to ion competition which can be alleviated by appropriate pretreatment procedures e g spe liquid liquid phase extraction to reduce interfering matters analysis of pfas isomers can be also challenging using nano esi hrms especially when they share similar fragmentation patterns therefore results from nano esi hrms can be synergized with other chromatography integrated mass spectrometry approaches e g lc ms ms and gc ms to gain a comprehensive view of pfass when necessary for site characterization and remediation declaration of competing interest we

pfhpa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea as well as the emergence of ultrashort trifluoroacetic acid tfa and tfms and several novel fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas overall nano esi hrms enabled comprehensive pfas quantitative analysis and suspect screening applicable for rapid investigation and assessment of pfas related exposure and treatment in environmental matrixes

low injection volume demand karas et al 2000 wilm and mann 1994 nano esi refers to esi that is equipped with an ultrathin emitter usually 10 100 micrometer in diameter the ultrathin emitter can be charged at high voltage kv to produce nanodroplets from samples or extracts fig s1 promoting efficient ionization and diminishing salt interference enaksha et al 2006 gremmel et al 2017 karas et al 2000 injection by nano esi can also reduce matrix effects since it creates high surface tensions and facilitates more stable and uniform spraying of sample droplets as compared to conventional esi juraschek et al 1999 karas et al 2000 notably even with a small injection volume e g 1 µl nano esi can generate a signal intensity 2 to 3 times higher than that detected by the conventional esi conducive to substantial improvement in sensitivity wilm and mann 1996 furthermore the emitter can be easily replaced for each sample to avoid cross contamination carried over from prior injections gremmel et al 2017 karas et al 2000 as there is no chromatographic separation the running time for nano esi can be as short as 1 2 min given the increasing number of newly identified pfass interest in screening and quantitative analysis of these non target pfass by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has escalated over the past decade barzen hanson et al 2017b gago ferrero et al 2015 liu et al

validation cooks 1995 fornal 2014 pérez ortega et al 2016 this study combined the nano esi injection with the hrms detection namely nano esi hrms for the rapid sensitive and robust pfas analysis and suspect screening detection sensitivity and accuracy of 22 target pfass table s1 including pfcas pfsas fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas ftss and hfpo da were compared between nano esi hrms and lc ms ms pfas suspect screening was conducted to profile dominant anionic and zwitterionic pfas constituents in three afff formulations and unveil the dynamics of possible pfas features along with the conventional wastewater treatment processes we also designed a streamlined 2 level classification scheme to synergize absolute quantification of target analytes and semi quantitation of suspect features for the comprehensive analysis of pfass compatible with limited availability of reference and calibration standards the development of this novel analytical approach with nano esi hrms has prominent potential to assist and promote the imminent investigation of fate behavior and exposure of pfass in water and other matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and terminology reagents solvents and standards used in this study are described and listed in the supplementary materials as suggested by epa method 537 1 a mixed internal standard is solution consisting of 4 mass labeled pfass m8 pfoa m8 pfos m2 6 2 ftca and m2 6 2 fts in table s1 was prepared at the concentration of 500 μg l targeting the quantification for the four main groups of pfass i e pfcas pfsas ftcas and ftss this mixed is solution was added to calibration solutions and samples to achieve a concentration of 10 μg l prior to the analysis by nano esi hrms or lc ms ms m4 perfluorohexanesulfonic acid m4 pfhxs was used as a surrogate to track the efficiency of pfas extraction in wastewater samples zhang et al 2019 2021 the surrogate stock solution was prepared by diluting its commercial standard solution with methanol with 4 di water to achieve the concentration of 200 μg l for m4 pfhxs shoemaker 2018 in this study target pfass refer to the 22 pfass available with non mass labeled analytical standards table s1 used to compare the detection sensitivity and accuracy between nano esi hrms and lc ms ms the total concentration of 22 target pfass was noted as σ22pfass suspect pfass refer to the non target positive hits that match the local pfas database see details in the supplementary materials with the mass error threshold of 5 ppm the total anionic zwitterionic pfass detected under the esi condition were represented as σpfass for simplicity analytical standards were not available for suspect pfass except trifluoromethanesulfonic acid tfms acronyms used in this study are summarized in table s2 2 2 sample collection afff formulations three afff formulations table s3 were subsampled from three air force bases afbs and kept in 15 ml conical polypropylene centrifuge tubes prior to the analysis at new jersey institute of technology njit the first afff sample was manufactured by national foam in 1983 and collected directly from its original product container at the eglin afb the second sample was a 3 m afff product dated in 1989 and collected from the original container at the galena afb the third afff from the massachusetts military reservation cape cod ma was a 1999 version of alcohol resistant afff ar afff from 3 m the material safety data sheet msds of this ar afff indicates a mixture of the standard electrochemical fluorination ecf based 3 m afff and fluorinated additives with unknown manufacturer to maintain a film in the presence of alcohols in this study three formulations are designated as afff 1983 afff 1989 and afff 1999 respectively representing a diversity of afff formulations with different manufacturing sources wastewater samples water samples were collected from three domestic wwtps plant r p and l in northern new jersey between july and august 2020 their operation parameters are outlined in table s4 at each wwtp wastewater samples were collected in sequence from the primary influent tank after coarse filtration the aeration tank with activated sludge the secondary clarifier tank and the final effluent after disinfection designated as inf are cla and eff respectively all high density polyethylene hdpe sampling bottles were rinsed with methanol and reagent water in the lab backe et al 2013 and with wastewater samples three times at the sampling site wastewater samples were then filled into 500 ml hdpe bottles leaving no air in the headspace samples were kept in a cooler with ice during the delivery to njit and filtered through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane to remove the biomass and other suspended particles prior to the storage at 4 c to discern the amount of 22 target analytes or other interferences introduced by sampling and analytical activities field reagent blanks frbs were taken and handled along with each sample set in triplicate following the description in epa method 537 1 shoemaker 2018 more details about the wastewater sampling are provided in the si 2 3 sample preparation afff formulations all afffs were diluted with methanol by a factor of 100 000 and filtered by 0 22 μm pes membrane wastewater samples within 48 h after the sample collection all wastewater samples were repeatedly sonicated and gently mixed in their original sampling bottles as previously described backe et al 2013 subsequently solid phase extraction spe was carried out for pfas extraction from wwtp water samples following the standard epa method 537 1 with slight modification see details in si the extract 4 ml was evaporated to dryness with the constant nitrogen flow in a water bath heated at 62 and then dissolved in 1 ml methanol containing 4 water all afff and wastewater samples were spiked with the addition of 10 μl of the mixed is solution and vigorously mixed before the quantitative analysis and suspect screening by nano esi hrms or lc ms ms 2 4 pfas analytical apparatus by lc ms ms and nano esi hrms for lc ms ms analysis following the epa method 537 1 and previous studies coggan et al 2019a gremmel et al 2017 22 target pfass were analyzed using a 1290 infinity ii hplc system in tandem with 6470a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent santa clara ca liu et al 2021 operation information of lc ms ms is detailed in the supplementary materials pfas analysis by nano esi hrms was operated by a high resolution q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific san jose ca equipped with a nano esi injector the emitter tip was pulled using a laser puller model p 2000 sutter internet novato ca the capillary temperature was set at 350 c the sample injection flow rate was 2 µl min with 3 0 kv potential applied to the nano esi emitter the resolution of 140 000 was selected for the hrms with the spectra obtained based on a scan time of 2 0 min 80 scans ms spectra results were not collected until the automatic gain control agc target achieved 100 with the total ion current tic variation below 10 ms1 data were collected under the full scan mode in the range of 50 750 m z with no collision energy applied based on the suspect screening result of ms1 data potential m z species were manually selected for cid to collect ms2 data for select mass species of interest ms2 data were collected under the data dependent acquisition dda mode when cid was manually applied the quadrupole filter was set to distinguish the mass difference of 0 2 da at m z 200 resulting in a full width half maximum fwhm resolution of 500 m dm when two or more molecules were captured by ms1 parent ions and their daughter ions were determined based on their co occurrence in the ms2 spectrum and the intensity shifting pattern in response to the applied collision energy ce details about laboratory calibration instrument lower limits of detection lods and method detection limits mdls are provided in the supplementary materials 2 5 suspect screening and analyte identification following barzen hanson s work barzen hanson et al 2017b the suspect screening method was developed to process nano esi hrms data consisting of four steps local database construction background noise removal positive hit screening and molecular structure validation a local pfas database consisting of the chemical formulae smiles structures monoisotopic molecular weights and putative monoisotopic anionic weight of 7300 pfass was constructed based on the master list of pfas substances usepa 2020 and timely updates from recent publications allred et al 2014 backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017a barzen hanson and field 2015 barzen hanson et al 2017b chen et al 2020 field et al 2017 kang et al 2020 li et al 2020 liu and mejia avendano 2013 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2020 wang et al 2020 washington et al 2020 for each sample the nano esi hrms analysis generated a list of mass species m z and their intensities as ms1 data exported by xcalibur thermofisher scientific usa from the raw hrms data file background mass species were subtracted from the samples peak list by traversal comparison between laboratory reagent blanks lrbs methanol solvent controls and samples according to the criteria listed in the supplementary materials after removing background noises mass spectra were matched with those in our local database based on a mass error threshold of 5 ppm additional criteria for screening the positive hits are listed in the supplementary materials all positive hits were gathered as a suspect screening list and ranked by the intensity with a cutoff at 105 a u ions structures were further examined based on the fragmentation patterns in ms2 data obtained by cid the confidence levels of suspect pfass were then determined following the rules indicated by schymanski et al 2014 2 6 semi quantification of suspect pfass to estimate the concentration of the suspect pfass in afff formulations a streamlined semi quantifiable sq approach was developed following previous reports allred et al 2014 backe et al 2013 jacob et al 2021 after structural examination by cid pfas analytes of interest aois see in table 2 were divided into five groups following a two level classification scheme as depicted in fig s2 in level 1 classification each pfas aoi was primarily assigned into one of the three major groups based on its terminal functional group including the sulfonate group so3 the carboxylate group coo and the amide group conh2 since terminal groups govern the ionization efficiencies in esi level 2 classification is further based on the presence of alkyl carbons particularly those adjacent to the terminal functional groups as they interfere with the polarity distinctively from a perfluorinated chain four isotopic labeled iss were assigned as the quantify marker qm for each group accordingly appropriate calibration curves were used for semi quantification by choosing the standards with similar functional moieties and chain lengths more details for the selection of qm and referred calibration curves are introduced in the supplementary materials 2 7 quality assurance quality control precision and accuracy for quality assurance and quality control lrbs and frbs were prepared as described in epa method 537 1 shoemaker 2018 see the supplementary materials the precision and accuracy were determined by taking the percent relative standard deviation as rsd and average percent recovery of 7 laboratory fortified blank lfb replicates shoemaker 2018 respectively in addition continuing calibration check ccc shoemaker 2018 was performed at the beginning of each analysis batch after every ten field samples and at the end of the analysis batch to verify the instrument sensitivity and method calibration 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitive and accurate pfas analysis by nano esi hrms detection by nano esi hrms exhibited high sensitivity for the analysis of 22 target pfass achieving low lods in the range from 3 2 to 36 2 ng l table 1 for lc ms ms good separation was achieved of all 22 target analytes fig s3 and table s5 though their lods exhibited a two order of magnitude span from 1 1 to 135 6 ng l table 1 our lc ms ms method was optimized for detecting c4 c8 pfsas and c6 c8 pfcas that are of primary concern by regulatory agencies with lods in the range of 1 1 to 15 2 ng l however this method was less sensitive in detecting precursor compounds particularly ftss and genx with lods greater than 60 ng l in contrast nano esi hrms exhibited sensitive detection of both c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas and precursor compounds e g ftcas fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids ftucas ftss and hfpo da for these precursor compounds lods of nano esi hrms were 1 2 to 15 6 folds lower than those of lc ms ms compared to lc ms ms nano esi hrms showed similar or higher sensitivity towards all target pfass of different chain lengths and functional moieties likely due to the uniformly formed nanodroplets fig s1 precluding bias derived from the chromatographic separation and solvent elution the precision rsd and accuracy recovery for the nano esi hrms analysis were further assessed by a surrogate corrected recovery experiment with 7 lfb replicates spiked with 5 ng of 22 target pfass as shown in fig s4a the precision 2 11 reflected the high repeatability and reliability of pfas analysis by nano esi hrms fig s4b showed mean surrogate corrected recovery rates between 87 and 120 for 16 pfass five pfass i e perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa pfhxs 5 3 ftca 8 2 fts and hfpo da had recoveries between 120 and 130 and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuda had a mean recovery of 133 the recoveries in the range of 87 133 met the requirement of epa method 537 1 50 150 they presented a comparable performance to previous records for the analyses of pfcas pfsas and ftss 87 99 backe et al 2013 70 149 gremmel et al 2017 and 80 134 coggan et al 2019a validating the effectiveness and robustness of nano esi hrms for the analysis of mixed pfass at environment relevant concentrations furthermore we quantitatively analyzed 22 target pfass in 3 afff formations and 12 wastewater samples using nano esi hrms and lc ms ms respectively as shown in fig s5 results obtained from both detection methods reached good agreement with each other as evident by the significant correlation pearson s τ 0 95 with linear slopes closing to 1 and r2 values greater than 0 91 this supports reliable quantitative analysis of pfass by nano esi hrms in diverse environmental samples which was validated by the epa standardized method using lc ms ms chromatographic separation is renowned for its ability to alleviate matrix effects from coexisting ions which thus boosts the ms response the consensus results between nano esi hrms and lc ms ms analyses revealed no distinguishable matrix effects for the nano esi hrms analysis even with no chromatographic separation employed detailed discussion on comparing results by both methods are provided in the supplementary materials the following sections focus on novel quantitative and qualitative results in afff formulations and wastewater samples obtained by nano esi hrms 3 2 discovery of novel afff constituents suspect screening by nano esi hrms enabled the discovery of 12 chemicals from 9 novel pfas classes to the best of our knowledge which have yet been reported in afff formulations namely tfms perfluoroethyl cyclohexanesulfonate pfechs ketone perfluorooctanesulfonic acid keto pfos fluorotelomer sulfonyl amido sulfonic acid ftsas so2 n ammoniopropyl perfluoroalkanesulfonamidopropylsulfonate n amp fasaps fluorotelomer unsaturated amide sulfonic acid ftuams fluorotelomer amide ftam 2 perfluoroalkyl thio acetatic acid thio n 2 ftca and 2 perfluoroalkyl 3 yl oxy carbonyl hydrazine 1 carboxylate n 2 ft pochc table 2 among them 7 pfas classes had the detection confidence level 3 and above as their structures can be validated by cid ms ms spectra figs s9 s11 s33 while no cid spectra were available for thio 8 2 ftca and 8 2 ft pochc level 4 note that masses m z of n amp fasaps ftuams and ftam anions showed positive matches with the formula records in the local database however during the structure validation their cid spectra revealed that these mass features were novel isomers because their fragmentation patterns were incompatible with the recorded structures for the corresponding masses iupac like names ion formula exact masses mass error table s6 and chemical structure fig 1 are provided for all newly identified pfass to complement the discussion below for tfms pfechs and n amp fasaps as well as in the supplementary materials for the other 6 pfas classes tfms the ms ms cid spectrum of tfms figs 2 a and s9 revealed the detection of m z 148 9517 matched with the theoretical monoisotopic mass of the cf3so3 anion m z 148 9520 by a mass error of 1 9 ppm the daughter m z 80 was identified as the sulfite radical anion so3 this cid spectrum was further verified by a commercial standard of tfms 99 sigma aldrich usa a calibration curve was constructed with this standard in the concentration range from 0 39 ng l to 12 5 μg l fig s10 tfms concentrations were thus quantified as 106 7 2 6 μg ml in afff 1983 29 5 0 6 μg ml in afff 1989 and 383 6 32 8 μg ml in afff 1999 table 2 a recent site survey reported the widespread presence of tfms at concentrations up to 940 ng l near the source and downstream of five firefighting training sites with the historical use of afffs björnsdotter et al 2019 furthermore tfms has also been detected at high frequencies in leachates storm water and surface water in the proximity of municipal and industrial landfills and hazardous waste management facilities björnsdotter et al 2019 as well as groundwater and surface water that serve as drinking water sources schulze et al 2019 though tfms is known as a superacid widely used in organic synthesis björnsdotter et al 2020 kazakova and vasilyev 2017 no documents are available to explain the prevalence of tfms in afff formulations björnsdotter et al 2020 in addition to tfms pfprs another representative ultrashort chain pfaa was also detected in afff 1989 and afff 1999 table 2 as an abundant afff ingredient pfprs fig s11 was confirmed by the cid observation of the deprotonated parent anion m h as well as two pfsa signature fragments i e so3 and cnf2n 1 barzen hanson et al 2017b pfprs has been reported in 5 other afff formulations manufactured by 3 m at the concentration from 120 to 270 μg ml barzen hanson and field 2015 as a potential residual derived from afff manufacture similarly our semi quantification results showed the detection of pfprs at 52 1 and 16 7 μg ml in afff 1989 and afff 1999 respectively both of which were manufactured by 3 m ultrashort chain pfaas are highly persistent mobile and difficult to remove once entering the aquatic environment ateia et al 2019 björnsdotter et al 2019 they can also be generated through the biotransformation of precursor compounds and lurked from treatment facilities e g filtration via desorption ateia et al 2019 yeung et al 2017 recent toxicology research revealed that even low tfms exposure at 10 μg kg could cause liver lipid metabolism disorders in mice zhou et al 2020 the combination of their persistency prevalence and toxicity underscores the need to survey the distribution of ultrashort chain pfaas in the aquatic environment which have been overlooked particularly at sites with historical afff applications to date tfms and other ultrashort chain pfaas have been scarcely investigated primarily due to the analytical challenges e g low retention efficiency of c 18 column of using lc separation barzen hanson and field 2015 björnsdotter et al 2020 therefore our discovery of tfms as a major constituent in afff formulations reconciles its prevalence at afffs impacted sites björnsdotter et al 2019 and thus calls for more attention to tfms and other ultrashort chain pfaas pfechs pfechs fig 1e was detected in afff 1989 at the concentration of 87 7 µg ml using m8 pfos as the internal standard and pfos as the calibration reference respectively the cid spectrum figs 2b and s12 matched the ms ms record of pfechs reported by de silva et al 2011 featured by its fragmentation into a c8 perfluoroalkyl carbanion with one degree of unsaturation c8f15 m z 381 and the sulfonate group so3 m z 80 as the primary collision pathway we postulated a cyclic structure between 1st and 6th carbon from the sulfonate head because the detected fragments cannot be explained by one single double bond assuming the existence of a double bond in this molecule the concurrence of the saturated m z 119 c2f5 and unsaturated m z 131 c3f5 181 c4f7 231 c5f9 281 c6f11 331 c7f13 and 381 c8f15 corroborated its location at 6th carbon contradictorily m z 241 c4f6so3 and 292 c5f8so3 suggested a location of the double bond between 1st and 4th carbon therefore this pfas feature was of great chance to contain a cyclic structure rather than a double bond and thus categorized as pfechs in afff 1989 pfechs is used as an erosion inhibitor for aircraft hydraulic fluids and was synthesized by 3 m as commercial fluorochemical surfactant product fc 98 until the cessation of its production in 2002 de silva et al 2011 pfechs was widely detected at 0 16 5 65 ng l in the great lakes de silva et al 2011 1 04 195 ng l in the surface water downstream of airports de solla et al 2012 wang et al 2016 and up to 77 ng l in rivers marchiandi et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 despite the lack of direct evidence confirming the addition of pfechs in this specific afff formulation the detection of pfechs in this study implies that certain afffs can be contributors to cyclic pfass that may persist in the environment note that unsaturated pfos an isomer of pfechs but with a double bond can also be an issue given its previous reports in afff formulations barzen hanson et al 2017b commercial products barzen hanson and field 2015 barzen hanson et al 2017b and human serum mcdonough et al 2021 thus extra attention is needed to differentiate these isomers pfechs and unsaturated pfos when their physiochemical properties and environmental behaviors are further characterized n amp fasaps in afff 1989 and afff 1999 four homologues n 3 6 belonging to the class of n amp fasaps fig 1k table 2 were identified at relatively high concentrations 10 2 174 2 µg ml as depicted in fig 2c and s13 m z 483 and 319 were detected as signatures of n amp fasaps n 6 representing the mass fragments of this compound without the c3h6so3 side chain and the perfluorinated alkane tail c6f13 respectively the structure of n amp fasaps was further validated by its dissociation patterns such as cnf2n 1 and m c3h6so3 which were identical to n spamp fasaps reported as the class 5 pfass by barzen hanson et al 2017b since these two pfas classes shared the main chain of perfluoroalkane sulfon amido propyl sulfonate cnf2n 1nc3h6so3 barzen hanson et al 2017b when n 3 and 5 the parent ions of n amp fasaps cn perfluoroalkylsulfonamido amino carboxylate pfasac cn 1 cannot completely separate in the cid spectra figs s14 and s15 because the m z differences between these paired compounds were below 0 2 da in the ms1 data fortunately both n amp fasaps cn and pfasac cn 1 were well collided resulting in specific fragments that can be distinctively identified fig s14 and s15 this is the first report of n amp fasaps n 3 6 in afff formulations or any samples and their relatively high concentrations and frequent detections underlined the need of further investigation 3 3 semi quantitative profiling of dominant pfass in afff formulations under esi based on the combination of our absolute and semi quantification results 40 pfass in three afff formulations were outlined in table 2 which met the intensity threshold of 0 1 of 20 µg l m8 pfos as the internal standard equivalent to approximately 0 2 µg ml before dilution 40 pfass were classified into 5 groups including the perfluorinated sulfonate group pfsg fluorotelomer sulfonate group ftsg perfluorinated carboxylate group pfcg fluorotelomer carboxylate group ftcg and fluorotelomer amide group ftamg see details in the supplementary materials among them we highlighted 16 pfass from 9 pfas classes necessitating priority attention marked in red table 2 since 1 they were present at a concerning level 100 μg ml in one or more afff formulations 2 they together accounted for the majority of σpfass in three afffs 88 2 for afff 1983 95 2 for afff 1989 and 96 5 for afff 1999 table s7 and 3 they if not newly identified in this study were reported frequently in previous investigations and surveys of pfass in afff formulations that were typically manufactured via two processes ecf based and fluorotelomerization based ft based barzen hanson et al 2017b place and field 2012 pfos was the most detected pfsa at concentrations of 135 3 5 7 10 949 6 459 9 and 3405 7 143 0 μg ml in afff 1983 1989 and 1999 respectively accounting for 5 6 81 9 and 43 6 of σpfass in these afff formulations meanwhile other pfsas n 2 7 and 9 10 table 2 were also commonly found in these afffs at concentrations approximately one to two orders of magnitude lower than pfos similarly pfsa derivatives with substitutes e g h pfos and cl pfos and functional moieties e g keto pfos were detected below 100 μg ml and only in afff 1989 and 1999 showing the relatively low contribution to the σpfass 0 7 for pfaa precursors ftsass 6 2 and 8 2 followed by ftsas so 6 2 and 8 2 6 2 ftab pfasac n 6 and 6 2 fts were most concerned in afff formulations particularly 6 2 ftsas presented at the concentration of 821 7 81 4 and 1049 1 103 9 μg ml in afff 1983 and 1999 accounting for 33 9 and 13 4 of the σpfass respectively 8 2 ftsas was detected at 996 3 89 7 μg ml in afff 1999 equivalent to 12 7 of the σpfass in afff 1983 6 2 ftsas was the most abundant anionic constituent with a concentration 5 times greater than pfos 6 2 ftsas and 8 2 ftsas were the second and third most abundant components in afff 1999 only lower than pfos among 56 ft based afff formulations 32 and 15 were detected with 6 2 and 8 2 ftsas at concentrations up to 11 000 and 1100 μg ml respectively table 2 indicating their dominance in a variety of afff formulations 6 2 ftsas so showed concentrations of 142 4 19 1 and 279 2 25 1 μg ml in afff 1983 and 1999 respectively 8 2 ftsas so was only detected in afff 1999 at 271 3 18 4 μg ml which contributed to 12 7 to the σpfass despite no quantitative data 6 2 and 8 2 ftsas sos were also detected at notable frequencies 19 36 and 6 12 in previous afff analyses table 2 further 6 2 and 8 2 ftabs were detected in afff 1983 at the concentrations of 450 1 49 1 and 83 1 6 4 μg ml respectively pfasacs n 4 6 were detected in afff 1999 at the concentrations of 56 3 4 9 and 211 1 16 2 μg ml respectively ftss n 6 8 and 10 were detected in afff 1983 and 1999 in the concentration range between 17 and 166 μg ml according to previous studies ftsass ftsas sos ftabs and ftss were reported dominantly in the ft based afff formulations while predominant pfsas with minor pfcas were featuring constituents for ecf based formulations barzen hanson et al 2017b d agostino and mabury 2013 place and field 2012 as summarized in table 2 afff 1983 was found as a typical ft based formulation which agrees with previous investigations on national foam products barzen hanson et al 2017a place and field 2012 3 m afff products are reputed for the ecf based manufacture process which was proved in our study by the dominant presence of pfsas 90 9 and 51 3 especially pfos 81 9 and 43 6 and minor detection of pfcas 1 2 and 0 6 in afff 1989 and afff 1999 uniquely a noticeable proportion of fluorotelomers including ftsass 26 1 and ftsas sos 7 1 were detected in afff 1999 which were rarely associated with 3 m formulations however the presence of fluorotelomers e g 6 2 ftsas 6 2 ftab and 6 2 fts have been reported in two ar afff formations dauchy et al 2017 fluorotelomers were added as foam stabilizers in ar afffs to improve the fire knockdown efficiency kleiner and jho 2009 it is possible that 3 m may have acquired fluorinated additives from other manufacturers though the msds for afff 1999 did not explicitly indicate the supplier information or composition along with other reports our results revealed the mixture of ecf and ft based pfas constituents in ar afff formulations warranting further attention note that target 22 pfass σ22pfass only contributed partially to the σpfass 16 1 91 1 and 47 3 for afff 1983 1989 and 1999 table s7 the profiling of pfass revealed that 27 out of the top 40 dominant constituents in afff samples were non target pfass that are typically not covered by standardized methods using lc ms ms the total concentrations of pfass in ftcg and ftsg were 461 4 to 3285 0 μg ml in three afff formulations table s7 collectively the contribution of ultrashort chain pfaas e g tfms and polyfluorinated fluorotelomer compounds e g ftsass and ftsas sos was remarkable in afff formulations necessitating future monitoring and remediation efforts at impacted sites 3 4 dynamics of target pfass over conventional wastewater treatment we further validated the environmental analysis by nano esi hrms using wastewater samples collected from local wwtps as shown in fig 3 the σ22pfass was 272 6 97 0 ng l in the influents 352 1 223 4 ng l in aeration tanks 382 5 304 1 ng l in clarifier tanks and 327 0 21 3 in the effluents respectively individual target pfas concentration data were pooled among three wwtps to statistically discern the contribution of major wastewater treatment processes using the two way mann whitney u test significant elevation of pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa concentrations was evident across three wwtps in the effluents compared to the influents fig 3 the generation of several pfcas was observed at aeration tanks at plant p concentrations of pfpea pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa increased significantly in the aeration tank compared to those in the influent 8 98 ng l 19 205 ng l 2 47 ng l and 61 106 ng l respectively implying activated sludge can degrade precursors into pfcas in the influent fig s34a at plant r an increase of pfpea 31 78 ng l was also observed however none of the target pfass showed significant change over the activated sludge treatment at plant l fig s34b probably due to the variations in influent compositions and microbial communities of the activated sludge unlike the other two plants that serve small populations plant p is a large size wwtp that handles an average inflow of 226 330 mgd and serves 1 5 million people table s4 which potentially leads to a more intricate input matrix of pfas precursors clarifier tanks were another hot spots where pfas biotransformation might occur presumably through anaerobic processes as evident by the generation of pfhxa p 205 447 ng l l 35 94 ng l and pfpea l 42 79 ng l fig s34 bertanza et al 2013 on the other hand the decrease of pfba 4 9 ng l not detectable pfpea 72 26 ng l and pfhxa 105 22 ng l at plant r might be resulted from either the adsorption to the biosolids and or biotransformation huang and jaffé 2019 nevertheless the roles of biotic and abiotic processes in pfas removal at clarifiers remain elusive and can be influenced by operation parameters such as tank configuration inflow composition and sludge retention time srt as depicted in fig 3 pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfbs remained at concerning concentrations 40 200 ng l in the effluent samples at all three wwtps indicating the inefficiency of the current wastewater treatment process for pfas removal for instance pfoa in the effluent sample of plant p was as high as 90 0 6 6 ng l exceeding its epa s drinking water health advisory level 70 ng l overall effluents of wwtps can be potential point sources pertinently discharging pfass to the receiving waters coggan et al 2019b eriksson et al 2017 gallen et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 recent investigation on target pfass in wwtps revealed that their fate and behaviors can be affected by manifold factors including i the type and size of wwtps ii influent compositions domestic industrial urban runoff versus agricultural chen et al 2018 iii operating factors such as mixed liquor suspended solids temperature hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time kibambe et al 2020 however greater sampling size and frequency at a collection of various wwtps are required to sort out the influence of individual factors on pfas generation and removal over conventional wastewater treatment processes 3 5 possible pfas features newly detected in wwtp matrices using suspect screening we identified 16 possible pfas features in wwtp matrices fig 4 following four stringent criteria 1 they were not found in the solvents lrbs or frbs 2 they were positively detected in at least two replicates of each sample 3 they were detected in more than two wastewater samples and 4 their highest intensities exceeded 1 of that of m8 pfos as the internal standard equivalent to 10 ng l formula and structures of these pfas features were predicted based on molecular weights and their matches in the local database though cid spectra were not available due to the complex media matrix in wwtp samples and or low ms response further details about their putative structures and mass errors are present in table s8 notably two representative ultrashort chain pfaas trifluoroacetate tfa and tfms were found in all wwtp samples with 9 4 and 3 0 fold increments from the influent to the effluent at plant r as well as 7 9 and 2 6 fold increments at plant p fig 4 as recommended by epa method 537 1 shoemaker 2018 the polystyrene divinylbenzene sdvb cartridge was used to extract most pfass that are relatively hydrophobic though not optimal for retaining these two ultrashort chain pfaas to validate the detection of ultrashort chain pfaas we conducted a recovery experiment for tfms and found its extraction efficiency was low as 16 5 fig s35 according to which the estimated occurrence level of tfms in wwtp samples was up to 86 2 ng l though such low extraction efficiency for tfms didn t satisfy the requirement for quantitative analysis our results remained valid to demonstrate the ubiquity and emergence of ultrashort chain pfaas along the wastewater treatment chain in addition ultrashort chain pfaas have been reported in groundwater barzen hanson and field 2015 surface water ateia et al 2019 björnsdotter et al 2019 guardian et al 2020 rain precipitation yeung et al 2017 and even bottled water for drinking chow et al 2021 representing an imminent threat to the water cycle further hydrido perfluoropetanoic acid h pfpea 3 8 ftam pfasac n 1 and n dihydroxybutyl dihob dimethyl ammoniopropylperfluoroalkanesulfonamide n dihobamp fasa n 2 were detected in multiple samples h pfpea 6 2 ftam and pfasacs n 3 8 were reported in afffs aforementioned in this work table 2 and elsewhere barzen hanson et al 2017b d agostino and mabury 2013 the class of n dihobamp fasas n 4 6 was found in afffs impacted groundwater barzen hanson et al 2017b and the class of h pfcas n 4 10 was also recently reported in wastewater samples at wwtps in china wang et al 2020 in addition several highly defluorinated ftcas e g 3 3 ftca and 2 9 ftca and associated features with unsaturation e g 3 3 ftuca and hydrogen substitution e g h 4 9 ftca tended to emerge in the aeration tanks or clarifiers and decline over the subsequent treatment s fig 4 ftcas ftucas and h ftcas were reported as common biotransformation intermediates of pfas precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs kim et al 2014 2012 and ftss d agostino and mabury 2017 shaw et al 2019 observation of these pfas features corroborated their essential roles in the biotransformation of unknown long chain precursors in the wastewater some of these pfas features can also be precursors for short and ultrashort chain pfaas however no significant correlation was observed between the signal intensity of these pfas features fig 4 and the pfaa concentrations fig 3 in this study 4 conclusions this study developed and validated a rapid and sensitive analytical method for screening and semi quantifying both target and suspect pfass by nano esi hrms uniquely nano esi hrms enables a timesaving pfas analysis 2 min per sample without scarifying detection sensitivity and accuracy this rapid pfas analysis is highly desirable for environmental investigations with a large sample size nano esi hrms exhibits a comprehensive detection of diverse pfas features with the inclusion of ultrashort chain and other highly polar molecules that are often overlooked when lc is employed results generated from nano esi hrms are reliable and reproducible without the need for extensive optimization for individual analytes with the assistance of the high resolution detection and efficient screening algorithm nano esi hrms results can support the identification of novel pfas structures and their transformation metabolites produced naturally or over physiochemical and biological treatments here we also reported ultrashort chain pfaas e g tfms pfprs and tfa in afff formulations and wwtp samples for the first time this discovery demonstrated the potential of afff impacted sites and municipal wwtps as point sources of ultrashort chain pfaas pertinently discharging to the receiving water bodies given their extreme hydrophilicity and recalcitrance these ultrashort chain pfaas can spread in the environment and transport through the water cycles affecting regions that are even distant and rural for instance tfms and other ultrashort chain pfaas in surface snow at remote arctic locations björnsdotter et al 2021 considering its ubiquitous existence and environmental persistency ateia et al 2019 chow et al 2021 guardian et al 2020 yeung et al 2017 the contamination of ultrashort chain pfaas has emerged as a global issue urging immediate attention and action nano esi hrms offers an effective alternative to analyze ultrashort chain pfaas though the extraction approach needs to be tailored for these weak anions using wax and other cartridges björnsdotter et al 2021 to date pfas analysis has greatly been hindered by the limited and expensive commercial standards required for absolute quantification to cope with this major obstacle we designed a streamlined 2 level classification scheme to categorize anionic and zwitterionic pfas features into five major groups and assign them with appropriate qms and calibration references for semi quantification when their standards are inaccessible albeit with non negligible quantitative errors concentration data derived from semi quantification render a tangible profile of the complex pfas contamination in the environment and assist environmental engineers and scientists to pinpoint the dominant and other concerned species that could be addressed with priority our analysis primarily focused on anionic pfass given the availability of commercial standards and regulatory significance with the increasing availability of isotopic labeled pfass we recommend improving our experimental design and applying diverse surrogates to track the extraction efficiencies of pfass of different properties in the future with appropriate cationic references and internal standards nano esi hrms is compatible with cationic pfas analysis under the esi mode without significantly modifying this reported method non dissociable neutral pfass e g fluorotelomer alcohols are more suited for the analysis by gc ms when they are sufficiently volatile without chromatographic separation analysis by nano esi hrms can be affected by in source fragmentation and matrix effects however no collision energy was applied to generate the ms1 data which minimizes the potential for in source fragmentation though tfms and ultrashort chain pfaas have been frequently detected in our samples they are unlikely in source fragments due to their unique structures e g shorter chain lengths than known pfas precursors and terminal moieties e g sulfonate and carboxylic acid groups furthermore it should be noted that sensitivity of pfas analysis can be affected by complex matrixes due to ion competition which can be alleviated by appropriate pretreatment procedures e g spe liquid liquid phase extraction to reduce interfering matters analysis of pfas isomers can be also challenging using nano esi hrms especially when they share similar fragmentation patterns therefore results from nano esi hrms can be synergized with other chromatography integrated mass spectrometry approaches e g lc ms ms and gc ms to gain a comprehensive view of pfass when necessary for site characterization and remediation declaration of competing interest we

15898,aggregation kinetics of nanoplastics in aquatic environment are influenced by their interactions with proteins having different structures and properties this study employed time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls to investigate the effects of 5 proteins bovine hemoglobin bhb bovine bsa and human serum albumin hsa collagen type i col i and bovine casein cs on aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps under natural water conditions which were simulated using various ionic strength 1 1000 mm nacl and 0 01 100 mm cacl2 ph 3 9 and protein concentration 1 5 mg l of total organic carbon the results indicated that the interactions between proteins and psnps strongly depended on electrostatic properties protein structures and solution chemistries which induced distinct aggregation behaviors in nacl and cacl2 solutions electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance dominated their interactions in nacl solution by stabilizing psnps with the order of spherical bsa and disordered cs heart shaped hsa fibrillar col i whereas positively charged bhb destabilized psnps with aggregation rate of 1 71 nm s at 300 mm nacl in contrast at cacl2 concentration below 20 mm proteins destabilized psnps following the sequence of hsa bhb col i bsa depending on counterbalance among double layer compression cation bridging and steric hindrance whereas cs stabilized psnps by precipitating ca2 that inhibited charge screening effect both protein concentration and solution ph affected protein corona formation surface charge and protein structure that altered stability of psnps characterizations using fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism and two dimensional correlation analysis spectroscopy showed fluorescence quenching and ellipticity reduction of proteins indicating strong adsorption affinity between psnps and proteins the study provides insight to how protein configuration and water chemistry affect fate and transport of nanoplastics in aquatic environment graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics protein corona colloidal stability electrostatic interaction steric hindrance cation bridging 1 introduction plastic products have been widely used in all aspects of daily production and life due to their superior properties lebreton and andrady 2019 the global plastic production has increased from 265 to 368 million tons between 2010 and 2019 plasticseurope 2011 2020 with a global demand predicted to be rising to 33 billion tons in 2050 horton et al 2017 the extensive use of plastics and their improper disposal in the environment have caused serious pollution problems peng et al 2020 plastics in natural environments easily undergo aging and fragmentation processes under physical chemical and biological effects to form smaller particles including microplastics mps with diameters ranging from 1 μm to 5 mm and nanoplastics nps with size below 100 nm kumar et al 2021 other than derivation from mps nps can also be directly released from personal care products or other plastic product into the environment hernandez et al 2017 researchers have identified nps in water samples from the north atlantic gyre and snow samples collected from austrian alps davranche et al 2020 materic et al 2020 it was estimated that the amount of nps in the environment would far outnumber that of mps by a factor of 1014 besseling et al 2019 the fate transport and risk of nps in aquatic environment are strongly dependent upon their aggregation behavior which may be influenced by their physicochemical properties yu et al 2019 aging process liu et al 2019 solution chemistry lu et al 2018 biomacromolecules liu et al 2020 and other colloids oriekhova and stoll 2018 wherein biomacromolecules e g protein extracellular polymers and humic acids ubiquitously present in aquatic environment may interact with nps and form a corona like shell known as biological corona abdelsattar et al 2021 specifically protein corona as protein aggregates coated on particle surface may alter the structure and biological function of proteins as well as the potential toxicity and environmental behavior of nps vethaak and legler 2021 gopinath et al 2019 demonstrated that nps may bind to amino acid residues of polypeptide chain of human serum albumin hsa which underwent partial unfolding and alteration in function formation of protein corona may enhance the toxicity of nps to organisms and mediate their recognition and internalization by cells gopinath et al 2021 whereas the opposite effect was also observed that protein corona may passivate the surface of nps and reduce their cytotoxicity martin et al 2022 noting that such contradictory results are dependent upon the properties of both nps and protein corona kihara et al 2021 dong et al 2020 found that bovine serum protein bsa and lysozyme exerted opposite effects on the migration of psnps with different particle sizes li et al 2021a reported that the protein corona formed on psnps provided steric hindrance which prevented psnps from approaching each other in a finite space as well as additional electrostatic repulsion that enhanced particle stability our previous study identified that the globular bsa induced longer range steric repulsive forces between psnps compared to the more linear biomacromolecules including humic substances and alginate liu et al 2020 therefore proteins are complex biomacromolecules possessing various chemical compositions structures and characteristics it remains unclear how these properties could influence the interactions of different proteins with nps and further affect their aggregation kinetics the interaction mechanisms between proteins with different configurations and nps under various environmentally relevant solution conditions e g ionic composition ionic strength protein concentration and ph should be elucidated we hypothesize that the protein configuration and water chemistry are key factors determining the interaction mechanisms between different proteins and nps which may in turn affect the aggregation of nps in water five representative proteins possessing various chemical compositions structures and characteristics were chosen for systematic investigation including hemoglobin bhb bsa hsa collagen type i col i and casein cs these proteins are commonly found in organisms and are widely used in chemical pharmaceutical and food processing which may generate protein rich wastewater for instance poultry processing wastewater contains 35 protein and the protein like substances may account for 40 of chemical oxygen demand cod avula et al 2009 miao et al 2021 since various proteins are still abundant in wastewater after biological treatment they may interact with nps and influence their aggregation process in aquatic environments bsa and bhb both have spherical spatial structures yet their compositions differ as bhb composes of globin and heme whereas bsa is a single chain polypeptide consisting of 583 amino acid residues dong et al 2021 hsa is a homologous protein to bsa with 75 6 homology and has peptide chains folded into a heart shaped triangular structure majorek et al 2012 unlike the above proteins col i is a fibrous protein formed by intertwining with two α1 chains and one α2 chain he et al 2020 moreover cs is an intrinsically disordered protein typically present in aqueous environment as micelles with roughly spherical morphology yet its complex configurations may include α cs β cs and κ cs cao et al 2019 the different protein configurations including electrical charge hydrophobicity structure and size of these different proteins may affect their dominant interaction mechanisms e g adsorption steric hindrance electrostatic interactions and molecular bridging with nps the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 5 proteins bhb bsa hsa col i and cs with different structures and properties on the aggregation kinetics of nps under environmental conditions psnps were employed as the nps model as polystyrene is one type of the most consumed plastics worldwide andrady 2011 natural water conditions from freshwater to seawater were simulated using various ionic strength 1 1000 mm nacl and 0 01 100 mm cacl2 ph 3 9 and protein concentration 1 5 mg c l i e milligrams of total organic carbon toc per liter of water liu et al 2020 shao et al 2021 the effects of protein type and concentration ph and electrolyte concentration on the early stage aggregation kinetics of psnps in nacl and cacl2 solutions were quantified by time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 salts were selected due their representativeness of background electrolytes in natural aquatic environment as well as their difference in cationic valence that would induce distinct charge screening steric hindrance and cation bridging effects on psnps in the presence of various proteins thus allowing comparisons of different aggregation behaviors under complex chemical conditions mao et al 2020 mui et al 2016 the interaction mechanisms between psnps and proteins were revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism cd spectrum fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and two dimensional correlation analysis spectroscopy 2dcos this study should provide new insights to how the interaction of nps with different proteins may influence their environmental fate and transport the results may also be useful for assessing the potential risks of nps involved with protein interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents polystyrene latex beads 0 05 0 1 μm without surface modification were purchased from aladdin reagents co ltd shanghai china the aggregation experiments were conducted at 10 mg l psnps bhb col i cs and hsa were obtained from yuanye biotechnology co ltd shanghai china while bsa was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china the protein stock solutions of bhb bsa col i cs and hsa were all prepared at mass concentration of 600 mg l out of which their toc concentrations were analyzed to be 215 64 265 02 250 08 207 72 and 244 38 mg c l respectively they were then diluted to 1 2 5 and 5 mg c l i e 1 2 5 and 5 mg l of toc in solution based on biomacromolecule concentrations in natural aquatic environment wang et al 2015 other experimental reagents including electrolytes were of analytical grade and purchased from aladdin reagents co ltd shanghai china the preparation procedures for the above samples are described in s1 1 of the supplementary material 2 2 aggregation experiments the aggregation kinetics of psnps with or without proteins in monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 solutions under different ph were determined with tr dls using the zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instrument co ltd uk which employs a he ne laser operating at 633 nm and scattering angle of 90 aliquots of psnp suspension milli q water protein solution and electrolyte solution were added into a pre cleaned cuvette dts0012 in sequence to form a total volume of 2 ml such that the initial psnp concentration n 0 always maintained at 10 mg l the sample was then vortexed vortex genie2 us for 1 s and immediately inserted into the instrument for recording the hydrodynamic diameter d h every 15 s over 20 min triplicate samples were measured for each experiment 2 3 characterization of interactions between psnps and proteins the d h and zeta potential ζ of psnps were determined by dynamic light scattering dls using the zetasizer instrument the ζ potentials of psnps were measured in the presence or absence of proteins as a function of electrolyte concentration and at ph 3 9 yielding the isoelectric point iep the morphology and bare size of psnps were observed under transmission electron microscope tem fei talos f200s us the interaction mechanisms between psnps and proteins were characterized by fluorescence spectrometry cd ftir 2dcos tem and hydrodynamic adsorption layer thickness halt measurement the detailed procedures are described in s1 2 1 6 of the supplementary material 2 4 fitting and calculation procedures the determination of aggregation kinetics and empirical fitting for critical coagulation concentration ccc are described in s1 7 and eq s1 s3 of the supplementary material the stability curve of psnps was fitted with theoretical prediction based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory using the matlab 2019b software from which the hamaker constant for psnps could be obtained the interaction energy between psnps including the van der waals attraction v vdw and electrical double layer repulsion v edl was calculated to analyze the mechanisms governing stability of psnps under different solution chemistry duan et al 2021 the modified dlvo mdlvo theory was further applied to calculate the interaction energy between psnps in the presence of protein by incorporating the steric repulsive energy v ste hwang et al 2018 the detailed fitting and calculation procedures are described in s1 8 and eq s4 s15 of the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics and properties of psnps and proteins the pristine psnp samples selected in this study were regular spherical particles with a core size of 66 nm as observed under tem fig 1 a this size was slightly smaller than the d h of 84 9 1 9 nm as measured by dls fig 1b which was mainly due to the adsorption of water layer on the particle surface wu et al 2019 the ζ potential of psnps in milli q water was 43 03 1 60 mv at ph 6 and remained strongly negative within ph 3 9 fig 1c indicating their high stability against aggregation li et al 2018 the strong negative charge of psnps was comparable to previous studies and may be attributed to the introduction of sulfate free radicals during its preparation process by the supplier li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 the ftir spectrum of psnps showed absorption peaks at 3024 2922 1603 1495 1450 756 and 700 cm 1 fig s1a which aligned with the characteristics of polystyrene liang and krimm 1958 the secondary structures of pristine proteins analyzed by cd spectroscopy fig 1d showed that both bsa and hsa exhibited two negative peaks and one positive peak calculation with cdnn software further revealed that their secondary structures were mainly α helix that accounted for 51 5 and 42 1 respectively which were similar to bhb that accounted for 32 6 table s1 however col i was mainly coiled helical structure 41 8 that represented the helical structure of collagen zhao et al 2020 for cs its secondary structure contained higher contents of β antiparallel 33 0 and random coil 33 8 the detailed discussion on the results of ftir analysis for 5 proteins are presented under fig s1b fig 1c shows that the iep of bhb bsa col i cs and hsa were 6 4 4 7 3 8 4 4 and 5 1 respectively therefore all proteins except for bhb were negatively charged at ph 6 in most of the following aggregation experiments 3 2 effects of electrolyte concentration on aggregation of psnps in the presence of protein 3 2 1 nacl solution the aggregation kinetics and ζ potentials of psnps were first investigated in nacl solution at ph 6 without the presence of protein the results are presented in fig s2 and its associated discussion in the supplementary material showing that the aggregation behavior of psnps without proteins followed the dlvo theory with a ccc value of 270 mm nacl and a fitted hamaker constant a pwp of 3 0 10 21 j in water the aggregation of psnps in the presence of 2 5 mg c l protein at ph 6 were then investigated at 100 800 mm nacl fig 2 a and fig s3 with the rates k shown in fig 2b the results demonstrated that at 300 mm nacl fig 2a all proteins except for bhb stabilized psnps against aggregation with the effect following the order of bsa cs hsa col i specifically no aggregation of psnps occurred in the presence of bsa and cs k 0 however bhb did not exert any effect on psnps at 300 mm nacl similar results were obtained at 600 mm nacl fig s3b except that bhb also stabilized psnps to a same extent with col i i e bsa cs hsa col i bhb at 100 mm nacl fig s3a where psnps were originally stable k 0 distinct results were observed in the presence of bhb and hsa that significantly destabilized psnps to 1000 k 1 71 0 13 nm s and 800 nm k 0 83 0 04 nm s in 20 min respectively while other proteins did not exert any effect fig 2b fig 2c demonstrates that 5 proteins reduced the negative charge on psnps at all tested nacl concentrations with the effect following the order of bhb bsa hsa cs col i the positively charged bhb iep 6 4 fig 1c induced charge screening and even charge reversal ζ potential 10 mv of psnps indicating that its strong destabilization effect on psnps was mainly attributed to edl compression at 100 mm nacl fig 2b li et al 2021b and dong et al 2020 also observed that the protein corona of positively charged bovine trypsin and lysozyme formed on surface of psnps promoted their aggregation in comparison bsa col i and cs strongly stabilized psnps against aggregation at all nacl concentrations even though they reduced the negative charge of psnps demonstrating inconsistency between the ζ potential and aggregation rate results therefore electrostatic interaction was not likely the major mechanism and non dlvo forces may contribute to the stabilization of psnps by bsa cs and col i liu et al 2020 it should be noted that more complex mechanisms may be involved for bhb and hsa which significantly destabilized psnps at 100 mm nacl while stabilized psnps at higher nacl concentrations fig 2b table s2 shows that the halt values of 2 5 mg c l bsa cs and hsa measured at 10 mm nacl were 19 4 15 4 and 7 9 nm respectively which represent the thickness of protein corona on psnp surface by adsorption the order of halt values for these 3 proteins ranked similarly with their stabilization effect on psnps at 300 and 600 mm nacl fig 2b these are all globular proteins that tend to spontaneously accumulate on particle surface saleh et al 2010 forming protein corona that could be clearly identified under tem fig s4a c at 10 mm nacl and 25 c the debye length of psnps approximated by eq s11 was 3 05 nm which was smaller than the halt values of protein corona layer in table s2 it indicates that protein corona could prevent psnps from approaching each other due to the finite space available and the steric repulsive force between psnps fig s5 presents the interaction energies between psnps in the presence of protein by considering the balance among v vdw v edl and v ste which was calculated based on the mdlvo theory the results indicated that bsa and cs provided strong steric repulsive force in nacl solution resulting in negligible van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion at all nacl concentrations therefore both bsa and cs significantly inhibited aggregation of psnps in nacl solution during adsorption counterions i e na would be incorporated into the protein particle interface for reducing the charge unfavorable energy between the two negatively charged surface shao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 below 300 mm nacl fig 2b such charge reduction by hsa may destabilize psnps due to edl compression which overcame the weak steric hindrance as depicted by its small halt value however above 300 mm nacl hsa stabilized psnps by steric hindrance with such effect enhancing with nacl concentration likely due to formation of a more compact molecular structure on psnp surface thio et al 2011 similar phenomenon may occur for bhb whose halt was too thin to be measured although its corona was visible under tem fig s4d above 400 mm nacl the compact bhb may provide steric hindrance strong enough that overcame edl compression hence stabilizing psnps fig 2b unlike the above globular proteins col i with a fibrous structure exhibited strong extensibility that may provide relatively weak steric hindrance force moreover the abundant hydrophilic e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the outside of collagen molecule might facilitate col i to form hydrogen bond with water sionkowska et al 2020 reducing its adsorption affinity onto psnps therefore the halt value could not be measured for col i table s2 even though a thin layer of protein corona on psnps was still visible under tem fig 2d consequently col i weakly stabilized psnps by steric hindrance overall at a protein concentration of 2 5 mg c l bsa cs and col i stabilized psnps in nacl solution by steric hindrance hsa and bhb destabilized psnps at nacl concentration below 100 mm while stabilized psnps at higher nacl concentration depending on the counterbalance between steric hindrance and edl compression 3 2 2 cacl2 solution the aggregation kinetics and ζ potentials of psnps in cacl2 solution without the presence of protein at ph 6 followed the dlvo theory with a ccc value of 22 mm cacl2 fig s2 and its associated discussions in the supplementary material the aggregation rates of psnps as a function of cacl2 concentration in the presence of 2 5 mg c l protein at ph 6 were then investigated as shown in fig 3 a the results showed that bhb bsa col i and bsa all destabilized psnps with the effect following the order of hsa bhb col i bsa at cacl2 concentration below 10 mm while it changed to col i hsa bhb at higher cacl2 concentration specifically bsa destabilized psnps at cacl2 concentration below 20 mm but stabilized psnps as cacl2 concentration further increased the stability curves in fig s6 demonstrate that the aggregation of psnps in cacl2 solution still followed the dlvo theory in the presence of col i and bsa reducing the ccc from 22 to 7 2 and 4 9 mm cacl2 respectively nevertheless the overall destabilization effect of col i was still stronger than bsa even though bsa reduced the ccc more significantly fig 3a in comparison both bhb and hsa continuously promoted the aggregation of psnps with increase of cacl2 concentration resulting in deviation from the dlvo theory and failure to obtain the ccc unlike other proteins cs continuously stabilized psnps in cacl2 solution fig 3b shows that all 5 proteins reduced the negative charge on psnps at tested cacl2 concentrations with the effect following the order of bhb bsa hsa col i cs charge reversal of psnps occurred in the presence of bhb indicating that edl compression should be the major mechanism of bhb for destabilizing psnps in cacl2 solution as similarly observed above in nacl solution for bsa col i and hsa cation bridging may also contribute to their destabilization of psnps in cacl2 solution in addition to edl compression as shown in the ftir spectra fig s1b these 3 proteins possessed abundant oxygen containing e g carboxyl functional groups which could form a gel like structure with ca2 and significantly promote the aggregation of psnps as observed under tem in fig 3c and fig s7 previous studies also reported similar destabilization effect of nanoparticles by cation bridging between other biological macromolecules e g humic acid and extracellular polymers and ca2 liu et al 2020 unlike other 4 proteins cs stabilized psnps in cacl2 solution at ph 6 cs is a calcium sensitive protein with strong affinity for ca2 especially the α cs and β cs configurations centered at the cs micelles that easily capture ca2 to form cs precipitation dalgleish 2011 it was speculated that cs could preferentially bind with ca2 to form larger micelles as the irregular lumpy aggregates observed under tem fig 3d rather than forming the above gel like structure therefore cs weakened the edl compression by ca2 and provided strong steric hindrance resulting in the dispersed and stabilized psnps in tem image the above results suggested that at protein concentration of 2 5 mg c l bhb col i and hsa destabilized psnps in cacl2 solution by cation bridging bsa destabilized psnps at cacl2 20 mm while stabilized psnps at higher cacl2 concentrations depending on the counterbalance between cation bridging and edl compression and cs consistently stabilized psnps by specifically precipitating ca2 and weakening its edl compression 3 3 interaction mechanisms between psnps and proteins the interaction mechanisms between psnps and each protein were further analyzed with fluorescence spectra cd ftir and 2dcos the fluorescence spectra of proteins before and after interaction with 10 100 mg l psnps are presented in fig 4 a b and fig s8 the results showed that all 5 proteins exhibited fluorescence quenching effect after interaction with psnps with such effect enhancing at higher concentration of psnps it indicates the strong affinity between psnps and proteins and that psnps affected the microenvironment around the amino acid residues of proteins li et al 2021b as the psnps concentration increased from 0 to 100 mg l 4 proteins showed gradual blue shift of fluorescence peak following the extent of bsa hsa cs col i for instance there was a blue shift of maximum wavelength from 343 to 336 nm for bsa fig s8a manifesting its reduced polarity of microenvironment around the amino acid residues and an enhanced hydrophobicity wang et al 2009 therefore the structure of these 4 proteins became more compact after interaction with psnps imparting a strong steric hindrance effect that stabilized psnps in nacl solution on the contrary there was a red shift of fluorescence peak from 334 to 346 nm for bhb fig s8c indicating its decreased hydrophobicity and looser structure after interaction with psnps kooravand et al 2021 this may contribute to the weak steric hindrance effect of bhb which destabilized psnps mainly via edl compression as discussed previously the cd spectra of each protein after interaction with psnps are shown in fig 4c d and fig s9 which were further processed with the cdnn software to determine the secondary protein structure in table s1 the cd curve of cs after interaction with psnps changed from smooth to rough shape with decrease in the negative channel fig 4c correspondingly its proportions of β fold i e antiparallel parallel and α helix both increased while the proportions of β turn and random coil both decreased table s1 indicating that the structure of cs became more rigid similarly the negative channel in the cd spectrum of col i also decreased fig 4d the random coil content of col i decreased by 3 while its total proportion of α helix and β fold increased from 33 3 to 37 7 for bsa its two negative channels decreased slightly fig s9a however its α helix proportion increased from 51 5 to 53 3 indicating that the molecular structure of bsa became more compact liu et al 2020 which was consistent with the fluorescence result fig s8a similarly the ellipticity of the cd spectra for hsa decreased slightly fig s9b with an increase of α helix structure from 42 1 to 44 7 unlike these 4 proteins the α helix content of bhb decreased from 32 6 to 26 9 while its random coil increased by 3 6 fig s9c in general the interaction of psnps with all 5 proteins altered their secondary structures especially for cs col i and bhb leading to formation of hard protein corona kihara et al 2019 table s3 compares the major findings in mechanisms and key factors on the change of protein structure after particle interaction which were obtained from this study and the literature for nps and other nanoparticles the comparison suggests that the extent of conformational is mainly related to the nature of particles e g size surface charge hydrophobicity and functional group and protein e g structure and surface charge as well as solution chemistry e g ph the ftir spectra of 5 proteins before and after interactions with psnps are presented in fig s10 the results showed that the n h o h peaks on hsa col i and cs shifted from 3307 3306 and 3272 cm 1 to 3301 3325 and 3299 cm 1 respectively after interaction with psnps although these peak positions on bhb and bsa barely changed after interaction their peak strength enhanced similar to other 3 proteins indicating that the n h o h structures of bhb and bsa were also affected by psnps likely due to hydrophobic interactions zhou et al 2019 the red shift of c h absorption peaks on all 5 proteins may indicate partial change of the alkyl skeleton similarly the peaks at amide i and amide ii bands of all 5 proteins after interaction with psnps became sharper and more intensive specially the two infrared absorption peaks of cs at 1623 amide i band and 1517 cm 1 amide ii band blue shifted obviously to 1656 and 1541 cm 1 respectively this result indicated that the conformation of cs was strongly affected with the changed of secondary structure in correspondence to the cd analysis above new absorption peaks appeared at 3020 756 and 700 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of 5 proteins after interaction with psnps which was caused by the vibration of benzene ring on psnps the above ftir results indicated strong binding of all 5 proteins with psnps with alteration in protein secondary structure which was in agreement with the fluorescence and cd analyses to further evaluate the order of protein groups interacting and binding with psnps 2dcos analysis was used to analyze the synchronous and asynchronous ftir spectra of each protein in the range of 1800 1000 cm 1 fig 4e h fig s11 and tables s4 s8 the synchronous map of cs in fig 4e shows 7 auto peaks at 1730 1650 1610 1540 1450 1400 and 1300 1200 cm 1 the peaks at 1730 cm 1 and 1610 cm 1 were attributed to the carboxyl group c o and side chain moieties of amide i respectively chen et al 2018 sit et al 2019 the variation in intensity was the strongest for amide i for cs indicating that the amide i showed the strongest affinity with psnps the cross peaks formed by the auto peaks were all positive which indicated that their spectral intensity changed in the same direction the new auto peak at 1450 cm 1 may be attributed to the deformation vibration of aromatic c h bond after protein interaction with psnps suggesting good binding affinity the auto peaks and cross peaks from their synchronous fig 4e and asynchronous maps fig 4f are shown in table s4 according to the noda s rule isao noda 1988 by combining the synchronous and asynchronous maps the interaction sequence may be obtained as amide iii 1300 1200 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 side chain moieties of amide i 1610 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 amide i 1650 cm 1 similar to cs the 2dcos results for col i fig s11a b and bhb fig s11c d indicated the following orders of change carboxyl c o 1710 cm 1 amide iii 1320 1240 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 amide i 1650 cm 1 for col i table s5 and carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 amide iii 1200 cm 1 cooh 1390 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 amide i 1650 cm 1 for bhb table s6 similar to the above 3 proteins the auto peaks in the synchronous map of bsa fig 4g were also located at 1730 1650 1610 1540 1450 1400 and 1300 1200 cm 1 showing the same susceptibility of change in spectral intensity however opposite to previous 3 proteins the interaction sequence of bsa was amide i 1650 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 side chain moieties of amide i 1610 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 amide iii 1300 1200 cm 1 carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 fig 4g h and table s7 the variation patterns of synchronous fig s11e and asynchronous fig s11f maps for hsa were similar with bsa showing the interaction sequence of amide i 1650 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 side chain moieties of amide i 1610 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 amide iii 1200 cm 1 carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 table s8 overall the amide i of 5 proteins all showed the strongest affinity for psnps the functional groups of two homologous proteins i e bsa and hsa had similar interaction sequence with psnps which was in opposite to other 3 proteins 3 4 effects of protein concentration on aggregation of psnps the aggregation kinetics of psnps as a function of protein concentration 1 2 5 and 5 mg c l was investigated in 300 mm nacl or 10 mm cacl2 solutions fig 5 the high ends of na and ca2 concentrations in natural aquatic environment which typically range from 43 μm to 485 mm and 25 μm to 11 mm respectively mui et al 2016 were selected so that the effects of protein concentration could be clearly shown fig 5a b show that at 300 mm nacl where psnps could undergo diffusion limited aggregation alone fig s2d the presence of bhb at 1 5 mg c l all slightly enhanced their aggregation while such enhancement gradually weakened as bhb concentration increased comparison between fig 2c and fig 5d suggested that at 300 mm nacl bhb significantly reduced the ζ potential of psnps from 20 to 0 mv whereas such charge screening effect was weakly influenced by bhb concentration these results suggested that edl compression was the major mechanism for bhb to destabilize psnps in nacl solution while the steric hindrance may compete with edl compression at higher bhb concentration similar to bhb col i present at 1 mg c l also slightly enhanced psnps aggregation while it reversed to stabilizing psnps at 2 5 and 5 mg c l with such effect enhancing with higher protein concentration notably as the col i concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l k decreased from 1 28 to 0 21 nm s and d h decreased from 987 16 to 357 12 nm after 20 min this may be attributed to the fact that at lower col i concentration its edl compression effect fig s12a outweighed the weak steric hindrance whereas the opposite occurred as protein concentration increased the other 3 proteins bsa hsa and cs all stabilized psnps at the tested protein concentrations particularly for cs even 1 mg c l protein could effectively inhibit any aggregation of psnps which did not change with further increase of protein concentration unlike cs both bsa and hsa stabilized psnps more effectively at higher protein concentration the d h of psnps failed to reach 1 5d 0 within 20 min at 2 5 mg c l bsa or 5 mg c l hsa which exhibited the same stabilization ability the enhanced stabilization effect on psnps at higher protein concentration should be attributed to the stronger steric hindrance originated from a thicker protein corona this was evident from the increase of halt values by 91 77 and 221 for bsa cs and hsa respectively as the protein concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l table s2 similar phenomenon was also reported for biomacromolecules including fulvic acid sun et al 2021 extracellular polymers as well as bsa and alginate liu et al 2020 as shown in fig 5c the effect of protein concentration on the aggregation kinetics of psnps in cacl2 solution was different from that in nacl solution overall all proteins except for cs present at 1 5 mg c l destabilized psnps to variable extents in 10 mm cacl2 solution due to edl compression fig 5d and fig s12 and cation bridging with ca2 it is noted that their destabilization effect all weakened at higher protein concentrations specifically as bsa concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l k decreased from 1 98 to 0 52 nm s which was still above that without the presence of bsa such phenomenon may be caused by the stronger steric hindrance effect at higher protein concentration that competed with edl compression and cation bridging yu et al 2019 meanwhile more protein was adsorbed by psnps at higher protein concentration leaving less amount of free protein in solution to bridge with ca2 table s2 notably 1 mg c l cs slightly destabilized psnps at 10 mm cacl2 which contradicted with its stabilization effect at 2 5 mg c l above fig 3a this was likely due to edl compression that dominated over other mechanisms at low concentration of cs however its effect reversed to stabilizing psnps at 2 5 and 5 mg c l cs with k decreased to 0 14 and 0 11 nm s respectively under these conditions cs stabilized psnps by specifically binding with ca2 that weakened the edl compression effect which was outweighed by steric hindrance as discussed earlier fig 3 the above results further demonstrate that the complex effects of protein on psnps aggregation depended on the counterbalance of edl compression cation bridging and steric hindrance 3 5 effects of ph on aggregation of psnps in the presence of protein 3 5 1 effects on electrostatic interactions and protein compactness in nacl solution as ph is a critical factor affecting the properties of both nps and proteins the ph effects on aggregation rate fig 6 a b and fig s13a c and ζ potential fig s14 of psnps were investigated in nacl solution containing 2 5 mg c l protein generally psnps remained positively charged at ph 3 and negatively charged at ph 9 with all 5 proteins as discussed earlier bhb with an iep of 6 4 destabilized psnps at ph 6 in nacl solution through charge neutralization fig 2 in comparison psnps possessed strong positive and negative charges in nacl solution at ph 3 and 9 in the presence of bhb respectively fig s14a therefore no or negligible aggregation k 0 11 nm s was observed when bhb was present under acidic and basic conditions due to electrostatic repulsion fig 6a similar to bhb psnps did not aggregate at ph 3 in the presence of hsa fig s13a this was likely caused by electrostatic repulsion with quite positive ζ potentials 6 3 20 0 mv of psnps at 100 1000 mm nacl fig s14b as well as steric hindrance imparted by a compact protein structure at low ph however the protein structure may become looser as ph increases due to deprotonation of hydrophobic surface functional groups weakening the steric hindrance liu et al 2020 consequently although the negative charge of psnps in the presence of hsa was always stronger at ph 9 than ph 6 fig s14b psnps aggregated faster under basic condition at nacl concentrations above 300 mm where edl compression dominated over steric hindrance fig s13a unlike hsa and bhb col i with an iep of 3 8 fig 1c resulted in the most neutral ζ potentials of psnps at ph 3 fig s14c leading to the strongest destabilization effect among 5 proteins under such condition fig 6b however psnps attained stronger negative charge as ph increased from 3 to 9 in the presence of col i which gradually stabilized psnps similar to col i cs significantly destabilized psnps at ph 3 fig s13b by edl compression as their ζ potentials were 3 1 9 4 mv at 100 1000 mm nacl fig s14d no further aggregation occurred in the presence of cs when ph increased to 6 or 9 possibly because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance fig s13c shows that under all tested conditions herein no aggregation of psnps occurred in the presence of bsa due to strong steric hindrance effect yet one exception occurred at ph 3 and 800 mm nacl where slow aggregation k 0 26 0 03 nm s was found indicating that edl compression slightly outweighed steric hindrance under this circumstance fig s14e 3 5 2 effects on electrostatic interactions and cation bridging in cacl2 solution the aggregation rate fig 6c d and fig s13d f and ζ potential fig s15 of psnps as a function of ph were examined in cacl2 solution containing 2 5 mg c l protein both bhb fig 6c and bsa fig s13f effectively stabilized psnps in cacl2 solution at ph 3 by providing strong positive charge fig s15a b which was similar to their behaviors in nacl solution psnps started to aggregate as ph increased to 6 in cacl2 solution containing bhb or bsa due to charge neutralization and cation bridging a continued increase of ph from 6 to 9 generally reduced the aggregation rate by enhancing electrostatic repulsion meanwhile the calcium bridging effect may be weakened at higher ph as the stability of protein secondary structure was interfered lan et al 2020 an exception was found in the presence of bhb at cacl2 concentration 60 mm where psnps aggregated faster at ph 9 than at ph 6 fig 6c it demonstrated that the destabilization effect by cation bridging exceeded the stabilization effect by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion under such circumstance in the presence of col i psnps aggregated rapidly even at ph 3 over the cacl2 concentrations fig 6d this phenomenon was different from other 4 proteins likely because of its weakest electrostatic repulsion fig s15c the aggregation rate further increased at higher ph indicating that deprotonation of acidic functional groups e g hydroxyl and carboxyl on col i may provide more sites for calcium bridging effect that dominated over electrostatic repulsion as shown in fig s13d the ph effect on aggregation of psnps in the presence of hsa was similar to that of bsa due to the strong surface charge of psnps imparted by cs fig s15e they did not aggregate at cacl2 10 mm under all ph conditions fig s13e it was noted that above 30 mm cacl2 psnps aggregated faster at ph 9 than at ph 6 herein the ζ potentials of psnps were near zero in the presence of cs at 60 100 mm cacl2 fig s15e the weakened steric hindrance effect due to the dissociation of cs micelles into smaller scale at ph 9 may promote the aggregation of psnps vaia et al 2006 4 conclusion the results from this study demonstrated that the configuration and surface property of protein as well as solution chemistry complexly influenced the aggregation of psnps under natural water conditions from freshwater to seawater in neutral nacl solution both spherical bsa and micellar cs significantly stabilized psnps by steric hindrance due to formation of thick protein corona while fibrous col i with relatively higher hydrophilicity provided the weakest stabilization by contrast the positively charged bhb destabilized psnps by electrostatic attraction at nacl concentrations below 400 mm in neutral cacl2 solution bsa col i hsa and bhb all destabilized psnps following the order of hsa bhb col i bsa at cacl2 concentration below 20 mm while it changed to col i hsa bhb bsa at higher cacl2 concentrations depending on counterbalance among steric hindrance edl compression and cation bridging however cs stabilized psnps by specifically precipitating ca2 and weakening its edl compression both protein concentration and solution ph strongly influenced the properties of proteins and psnps thus affecting stability of psnps fluorescence cd and ftir 2dcos analyses confirmed the strong affinity and revealed the interaction mechanisms between proteins and psnps overall the results suggested that both protein configuration e g structure charge and hydrophobicity and water chemistry e g ionic type ionic strength and ph exerted combined effects on the interactions between psnps and proteins thus altering the aggregation process of psnps governed by the interplay between dlvo v vdw and v edl and non dlvo e g steric hindrance cation bridging and cation precipitation interactions this work underlined the necessity of

15898,aggregation kinetics of nanoplastics in aquatic environment are influenced by their interactions with proteins having different structures and properties this study employed time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls to investigate the effects of 5 proteins bovine hemoglobin bhb bovine bsa and human serum albumin hsa collagen type i col i and bovine casein cs on aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps under natural water conditions which were simulated using various ionic strength 1 1000 mm nacl and 0 01 100 mm cacl2 ph 3 9 and protein concentration 1 5 mg l of total organic carbon the results indicated that the interactions between proteins and psnps strongly depended on electrostatic properties protein structures and solution chemistries which induced distinct aggregation behaviors in nacl and cacl2 solutions electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance dominated their interactions in nacl solution by stabilizing psnps with the order of spherical bsa and disordered cs heart shaped hsa fibrillar col i whereas positively charged bhb destabilized psnps with aggregation rate of 1 71 nm s at 300 mm nacl in contrast at cacl2 concentration below 20 mm proteins destabilized psnps following the sequence of hsa bhb col i bsa depending on counterbalance among double layer compression cation bridging and steric hindrance whereas cs stabilized psnps by precipitating ca2 that inhibited charge screening effect both protein concentration and solution ph affected protein corona formation surface charge and protein structure that altered stability of psnps characterizations using fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism and two dimensional correlation analysis spectroscopy showed fluorescence quenching and ellipticity reduction of proteins indicating strong adsorption affinity between psnps and proteins the study provides insight to how protein configuration and water chemistry affect fate and transport of nanoplastics in aquatic environment graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics protein corona colloidal stability electrostatic interaction steric hindrance cation bridging 1 introduction plastic products have been widely used in all aspects of daily production and life due to their superior properties lebreton and andrady 2019 the global plastic production has increased from 265 to 368 million tons between 2010 and 2019 plasticseurope 2011 2020 with a global demand predicted to be rising to 33 billion tons in 2050 horton et al 2017 the extensive use of plastics and their improper disposal in the environment have caused serious pollution problems peng et al 2020 plastics in natural environments easily undergo aging and fragmentation processes under physical chemical and biological effects to form smaller particles including microplastics mps with diameters ranging from 1 μm to 5 mm and nanoplastics nps with size below 100 nm kumar et al 2021 other than derivation from mps nps can also be directly released from personal care products or other plastic product into the environment hernandez et al 2017 researchers have identified nps in water samples from the north atlantic gyre and snow samples collected from austrian alps davranche et al 2020 materic et al 2020 it was estimated that the amount of nps in the environment would far outnumber that of mps by a factor of 1014 besseling et al 2019 the fate transport and risk of nps in aquatic environment are strongly dependent upon their aggregation behavior which may be influenced by their physicochemical properties yu et al 2019 aging process liu et al 2019 solution chemistry lu et al 2018 biomacromolecules liu et al 2020 and other colloids oriekhova and stoll 2018 wherein biomacromolecules e g protein extracellular polymers and humic acids ubiquitously present in aquatic environment may interact with nps and form a corona like shell known as biological corona abdelsattar et al 2021 specifically protein corona as protein aggregates coated on particle surface may alter the structure and biological function of proteins as well as the potential toxicity and environmental behavior of nps vethaak and legler 2021 gopinath et al 2019 demonstrated that nps may bind to amino acid residues of polypeptide chain of human serum albumin hsa which underwent partial unfolding and alteration in function formation of protein corona may enhance the toxicity of nps to organisms and mediate their recognition and internalization by cells gopinath et al 2021 whereas the opposite effect was also observed that protein corona may passivate the surface of nps and reduce their cytotoxicity martin et al 2022 noting that such contradictory results are dependent upon the properties of both nps and protein corona kihara et al 2021 dong et al 2020 found that bovine serum protein bsa and lysozyme exerted opposite effects on the migration of psnps with different particle sizes li et al 2021a reported that the protein corona formed on psnps provided steric hindrance which prevented psnps from approaching each other in a finite space as well as additional electrostatic repulsion that enhanced particle stability our previous study identified that the globular bsa induced longer range steric repulsive forces between psnps compared to the more linear biomacromolecules including humic substances and alginate liu et al 2020 therefore proteins are complex biomacromolecules possessing various chemical compositions structures and characteristics it remains unclear how these properties could influence the interactions of different proteins with nps and further affect their aggregation kinetics the interaction mechanisms between proteins with different configurations and nps under various environmentally relevant solution conditions e g ionic composition ionic strength protein concentration and ph should be elucidated we hypothesize that the protein configuration and water chemistry are key factors determining the interaction mechanisms between different proteins and nps which may in turn affect the aggregation of nps in water five representative proteins possessing various chemical compositions structures and characteristics were chosen for systematic investigation including hemoglobin bhb bsa hsa collagen type i col i and casein cs these proteins are commonly found in organisms and are widely used in chemical pharmaceutical and food processing which may generate protein rich wastewater for instance poultry processing wastewater contains 35 protein and the protein like substances may account for 40 of chemical oxygen demand cod avula et al 2009 miao et al 2021 since various proteins are still abundant in wastewater after biological treatment they may interact with nps and influence their aggregation process in aquatic environments bsa and bhb both have spherical spatial structures yet their compositions differ as bhb composes of globin and heme whereas bsa is a single chain polypeptide consisting of 583 amino acid residues dong et al 2021 hsa is a homologous protein to bsa with 75 6 homology and has peptide chains folded into a heart shaped triangular structure majorek et al 2012 unlike the above proteins col i is a fibrous protein formed by intertwining with two α1 chains and one α2 chain he et al 2020 moreover cs is an intrinsically disordered protein typically present in aqueous environment as micelles with roughly spherical morphology yet its complex configurations may include α cs β cs and κ cs cao et al 2019 the different protein configurations including electrical charge hydrophobicity structure and size of these different proteins may affect their dominant interaction mechanisms e g adsorption steric hindrance electrostatic interactions and molecular bridging with nps the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 5 proteins bhb bsa hsa col i and cs with different structures and properties on the aggregation kinetics of nps under environmental conditions psnps were employed as the nps model as polystyrene is one type of the most consumed plastics worldwide andrady 2011 natural water conditions from freshwater to seawater were simulated using various ionic strength 1 1000 mm nacl and 0 01 100 mm cacl2 ph 3 9 and protein concentration 1 5 mg c l i e milligrams of total organic carbon toc per liter of water liu et al 2020 shao et al 2021 the effects of protein type and concentration ph and electrolyte concentration on the early stage aggregation kinetics of psnps in nacl and cacl2 solutions were quantified by time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 salts were selected due their representativeness of background electrolytes in natural aquatic environment as well as their difference in cationic valence that would induce distinct charge screening steric hindrance and cation bridging effects on psnps in the presence of various proteins thus allowing comparisons of different aggregation behaviors under complex chemical conditions mao et al 2020 mui et al 2016 the interaction mechanisms between psnps and proteins were revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism cd spectrum fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and two dimensional correlation analysis spectroscopy 2dcos this study should provide new insights to how the interaction of nps with different proteins may influence their environmental fate and transport the results may also be useful for assessing the potential risks of nps involved with protein interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents polystyrene latex beads 0 05 0 1 μm without surface modification were purchased from aladdin reagents co ltd shanghai china the aggregation experiments were conducted at 10 mg l psnps bhb col i cs and hsa were obtained from yuanye biotechnology co ltd shanghai china while bsa was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china the protein stock solutions of bhb bsa col i cs and hsa were all prepared at mass concentration of 600 mg l out of which their toc concentrations were analyzed to be 215 64 265 02 250 08 207 72 and 244 38 mg c l respectively they were then diluted to 1 2 5 and 5 mg c l i e 1 2 5 and 5 mg l of toc in solution based on biomacromolecule concentrations in natural aquatic environment wang et al 2015 other experimental reagents including electrolytes were of analytical grade and purchased from aladdin reagents co ltd shanghai china the preparation procedures for the above samples are described in s1 1 of the supplementary material 2 2 aggregation experiments the aggregation kinetics of psnps with or without proteins in monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 solutions under different ph were determined with tr dls using the zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instrument co ltd uk which employs a he ne laser operating at 633 nm and scattering angle of 90 aliquots of psnp suspension milli q water protein solution and electrolyte solution were added into a pre cleaned cuvette dts0012 in sequence to form a total volume of 2 ml such that the initial psnp concentration n 0 always maintained at 10 mg l the sample was then vortexed vortex genie2 us for 1 s and immediately inserted into the instrument for recording the hydrodynamic diameter d h every 15 s over 20 min triplicate samples were measured for each experiment 2 3 characterization of interactions between psnps and proteins the d h and zeta potential ζ of psnps were determined by dynamic light scattering dls using the zetasizer instrument the ζ potentials of psnps were measured in the presence or absence of proteins as a function of electrolyte concentration and at ph 3 9 yielding the isoelectric point iep the morphology and bare size of psnps were observed under transmission electron microscope tem fei talos f200s us the interaction mechanisms between psnps and proteins were characterized by fluorescence spectrometry cd ftir 2dcos tem and hydrodynamic adsorption layer thickness halt measurement the detailed procedures are described in s1 2 1 6 of the supplementary material 2 4 fitting and calculation procedures the determination of aggregation kinetics and empirical fitting for critical coagulation concentration ccc are described in s1 7 and eq s1 s3 of the supplementary material the stability curve of psnps was fitted with theoretical prediction based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory using the matlab 2019b software from which the hamaker constant for psnps could be obtained the interaction energy between psnps including the van der waals attraction v vdw and electrical double layer repulsion v edl was calculated to analyze the mechanisms governing stability of psnps under different solution chemistry duan et al 2021 the modified dlvo mdlvo theory was further applied to calculate the interaction energy between psnps in the presence of protein by incorporating the steric repulsive energy v ste hwang et al 2018 the detailed fitting and calculation procedures are described in s1 8 and eq s4 s15 of the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics and properties of psnps and proteins the pristine psnp samples selected in this study were regular spherical particles with a core size of 66 nm as observed under tem fig 1 a this size was slightly smaller than the d h of 84 9 1 9 nm as measured by dls fig 1b which was mainly due to the adsorption of water layer on the particle surface wu et al 2019 the ζ potential of psnps in milli q water was 43 03 1 60 mv at ph 6 and remained strongly negative within ph 3 9 fig 1c indicating their high stability against aggregation li et al 2018 the strong negative charge of psnps was comparable to previous studies and may be attributed to the introduction of sulfate free radicals during its preparation process by the supplier li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 the ftir spectrum of psnps showed absorption peaks at 3024 2922 1603 1495 1450 756 and 700 cm 1 fig s1a which aligned with the characteristics of polystyrene liang and krimm 1958 the secondary structures of pristine proteins analyzed by cd spectroscopy fig 1d showed that both bsa and hsa exhibited two negative peaks and one positive peak calculation with cdnn software further revealed that their secondary structures were mainly α helix that accounted for 51 5 and 42 1 respectively which were similar to bhb that accounted for 32 6 table s1 however col i was mainly coiled helical structure 41 8 that represented the helical structure of collagen zhao et al 2020 for cs its secondary structure contained higher contents of β antiparallel 33 0 and random coil 33 8 the detailed discussion on the results of ftir analysis for 5 proteins are presented under fig s1b fig 1c shows that the iep of bhb bsa col i cs and hsa were 6 4 4 7 3 8 4 4 and 5 1 respectively therefore all proteins except for bhb were negatively charged at ph 6 in most of the following aggregation experiments 3 2 effects of electrolyte concentration on aggregation of psnps in the presence of protein 3 2 1 nacl solution the aggregation kinetics and ζ potentials of psnps were first investigated in nacl solution at ph 6 without the presence of protein the results are presented in fig s2 and its associated discussion in the supplementary material showing that the aggregation behavior of psnps without proteins followed the dlvo theory with a ccc value of 270 mm nacl and a fitted hamaker constant a pwp of 3 0 10 21 j in water the aggregation of psnps in the presence of 2 5 mg c l protein at ph 6 were then investigated at 100 800 mm nacl fig 2 a and fig s3 with the rates k shown in fig 2b the results demonstrated that at 300 mm nacl fig 2a all proteins except for bhb stabilized psnps against aggregation with the effect following the order of bsa cs hsa col i specifically no aggregation of psnps occurred in the presence of bsa and cs k 0 however bhb did not exert any effect on psnps at 300 mm nacl similar results were obtained at 600 mm nacl fig s3b except that bhb also stabilized psnps to a same extent with col i i e bsa cs hsa col i bhb at 100 mm nacl fig s3a where psnps were originally stable k 0 distinct results were observed in the presence of bhb and hsa that significantly destabilized psnps to 1000 k 1 71 0 13 nm s and 800 nm k 0 83 0 04 nm s in 20 min respectively while other proteins did not exert any effect fig 2b fig 2c demonstrates that 5 proteins reduced the negative charge on psnps at all tested nacl concentrations with the effect following the order of bhb bsa hsa cs col i the positively charged bhb iep 6 4 fig 1c induced charge screening and even charge reversal ζ potential 10 mv of psnps indicating that its strong destabilization effect on psnps was mainly attributed to edl compression at 100 mm nacl fig 2b li et al 2021b and dong et al 2020 also observed that the protein corona of positively charged bovine trypsin and lysozyme formed on surface of psnps promoted their aggregation in comparison bsa col i and cs strongly stabilized psnps against aggregation at all nacl concentrations even though they reduced the negative charge of psnps demonstrating inconsistency between the ζ potential and aggregation rate results therefore electrostatic interaction was not likely the major mechanism and non dlvo forces may contribute to the stabilization of psnps by bsa cs and col i liu et al 2020 it should be noted that more complex mechanisms may be involved for bhb and hsa which significantly destabilized psnps at 100 mm nacl while stabilized psnps at higher nacl concentrations fig 2b table s2 shows that the halt values of 2 5 mg c l bsa cs and hsa measured at 10 mm nacl were 19 4 15 4 and 7 9 nm respectively which represent the thickness of protein corona on psnp surface by adsorption the order of halt values for these 3 proteins ranked similarly with their stabilization effect on psnps at 300 and 600 mm nacl fig 2b these are all globular proteins that tend to spontaneously accumulate on particle surface saleh et al 2010 forming protein corona that could be clearly identified under tem fig s4a c at 10 mm nacl and 25 c the debye length of psnps approximated by eq s11 was 3 05 nm which was smaller than the halt values of protein corona layer in table s2 it indicates that protein corona could prevent psnps from approaching each other due to the finite space available and the steric repulsive force between psnps fig s5 presents the interaction energies between psnps in the presence of protein by considering the balance among v vdw v edl and v ste which was calculated based on the mdlvo theory the results indicated that bsa and cs provided strong steric repulsive force in nacl solution resulting in negligible van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion at all nacl concentrations therefore both bsa and cs significantly inhibited aggregation of psnps in nacl solution during adsorption counterions i e na would be incorporated into the protein particle interface for reducing the charge unfavorable energy between the two negatively charged surface shao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 below 300 mm nacl fig 2b such charge reduction by hsa may destabilize psnps due to edl compression which overcame the weak steric hindrance as depicted by its small halt value however above 300 mm nacl hsa stabilized psnps by steric hindrance with such effect enhancing with nacl concentration likely due to formation of a more compact molecular structure on psnp surface thio et al 2011 similar phenomenon may occur for bhb whose halt was too thin to be measured although its corona was visible under tem fig s4d above 400 mm nacl the compact bhb may provide steric hindrance strong enough that overcame edl compression hence stabilizing psnps fig 2b unlike the above globular proteins col i with a fibrous structure exhibited strong extensibility that may provide relatively weak steric hindrance force moreover the abundant hydrophilic e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the outside of collagen molecule might facilitate col i to form hydrogen bond with water sionkowska et al 2020 reducing its adsorption affinity onto psnps therefore the halt value could not be measured for col i table s2 even though a thin layer of protein corona on psnps was still visible under tem fig 2d consequently col i weakly stabilized psnps by steric hindrance overall at a protein concentration of 2 5 mg c l bsa cs and col i stabilized psnps in nacl solution by steric hindrance hsa and bhb destabilized psnps at nacl concentration below 100 mm while stabilized psnps at higher nacl concentration depending on the counterbalance between steric hindrance and edl compression 3 2 2 cacl2 solution the aggregation kinetics and ζ potentials of psnps in cacl2 solution without the presence of protein at ph 6 followed the dlvo theory with a ccc value of 22 mm cacl2 fig s2 and its associated discussions in the supplementary material the aggregation rates of psnps as a function of cacl2 concentration in the presence of 2 5 mg c l protein at ph 6 were then investigated as shown in fig 3 a the results showed that bhb bsa col i and bsa all destabilized psnps with the effect following the order of hsa bhb col i bsa at cacl2 concentration below 10 mm while it changed to col i hsa bhb at higher cacl2 concentration specifically bsa destabilized psnps at cacl2 concentration below 20 mm but stabilized psnps as cacl2 concentration further increased the stability curves in fig s6 demonstrate that the aggregation of psnps in cacl2 solution still followed the dlvo theory in the presence of col i and bsa reducing the ccc from 22 to 7 2 and 4 9 mm cacl2 respectively nevertheless the overall destabilization effect of col i was still stronger than bsa even though bsa reduced the ccc more significantly fig 3a in comparison both bhb and hsa continuously promoted the aggregation of psnps with increase of cacl2 concentration resulting in deviation from the dlvo theory and failure to obtain the ccc unlike other proteins cs continuously stabilized psnps in cacl2 solution fig 3b shows that all 5 proteins reduced the negative charge on psnps at tested cacl2 concentrations with the effect following the order of bhb bsa hsa col i cs charge reversal of psnps occurred in the presence of bhb indicating that edl compression should be the major mechanism of bhb for destabilizing psnps in cacl2 solution as similarly observed above in nacl solution for bsa col i and hsa cation bridging may also contribute to their destabilization of psnps in cacl2 solution in addition to edl compression as shown in the ftir spectra fig s1b these 3 proteins possessed abundant oxygen containing e g carboxyl functional groups which could form a gel like structure with ca2 and significantly promote the aggregation of psnps as observed under tem in fig 3c and fig s7 previous studies also reported similar destabilization effect of nanoparticles by cation bridging between other biological macromolecules e g humic acid and extracellular polymers and ca2 liu et al 2020 unlike other 4 proteins cs stabilized psnps in cacl2 solution at ph 6 cs is a calcium sensitive protein with strong affinity for ca2 especially the α cs and β cs configurations centered at the cs micelles that easily capture ca2 to form cs precipitation dalgleish 2011 it was speculated that cs could preferentially bind with ca2 to form larger micelles as the irregular lumpy aggregates observed under tem fig 3d rather than forming the above gel like structure therefore cs weakened the edl compression by ca2 and provided strong steric hindrance resulting in the dispersed and stabilized psnps in tem image the above results suggested that at protein concentration of 2 5 mg c l bhb col i and hsa destabilized psnps in cacl2 solution by cation bridging bsa destabilized psnps at cacl2 20 mm while stabilized psnps at higher cacl2 concentrations depending on the counterbalance between cation bridging and edl compression and cs consistently stabilized psnps by specifically precipitating ca2 and weakening its edl compression 3 3 interaction mechanisms between psnps and proteins the interaction mechanisms between psnps and each protein were further analyzed with fluorescence spectra cd ftir and 2dcos the fluorescence spectra of proteins before and after interaction with 10 100 mg l psnps are presented in fig 4 a b and fig s8 the results showed that all 5 proteins exhibited fluorescence quenching effect after interaction with psnps with such effect enhancing at higher concentration of psnps it indicates the strong affinity between psnps and proteins and that psnps affected the microenvironment around the amino acid residues of proteins li et al 2021b as the psnps concentration increased from 0 to 100 mg l 4 proteins showed gradual blue shift of fluorescence peak following the extent of bsa hsa cs col i for instance there was a blue shift of maximum wavelength from 343 to 336 nm for bsa fig s8a manifesting its reduced polarity of microenvironment around the amino acid residues and an enhanced hydrophobicity wang et al 2009 therefore the structure of these 4 proteins became more compact after interaction with psnps imparting a strong steric hindrance effect that stabilized psnps in nacl solution on the contrary there was a red shift of fluorescence peak from 334 to 346 nm for bhb fig s8c indicating its decreased hydrophobicity and looser structure after interaction with psnps kooravand et al 2021 this may contribute to the weak steric hindrance effect of bhb which destabilized psnps mainly via edl compression as discussed previously the cd spectra of each protein after interaction with psnps are shown in fig 4c d and fig s9 which were further processed with the cdnn software to determine the secondary protein structure in table s1 the cd curve of cs after interaction with psnps changed from smooth to rough shape with decrease in the negative channel fig 4c correspondingly its proportions of β fold i e antiparallel parallel and α helix both increased while the proportions of β turn and random coil both decreased table s1 indicating that the structure of cs became more rigid similarly the negative channel in the cd spectrum of col i also decreased fig 4d the random coil content of col i decreased by 3 while its total proportion of α helix and β fold increased from 33 3 to 37 7 for bsa its two negative channels decreased slightly fig s9a however its α helix proportion increased from 51 5 to 53 3 indicating that the molecular structure of bsa became more compact liu et al 2020 which was consistent with the fluorescence result fig s8a similarly the ellipticity of the cd spectra for hsa decreased slightly fig s9b with an increase of α helix structure from 42 1 to 44 7 unlike these 4 proteins the α helix content of bhb decreased from 32 6 to 26 9 while its random coil increased by 3 6 fig s9c in general the interaction of psnps with all 5 proteins altered their secondary structures especially for cs col i and bhb leading to formation of hard protein corona kihara et al 2019 table s3 compares the major findings in mechanisms and key factors on the change of protein structure after particle interaction which were obtained from this study and the literature for nps and other nanoparticles the comparison suggests that the extent of conformational is mainly related to the nature of particles e g size surface charge hydrophobicity and functional group and protein e g structure and surface charge as well as solution chemistry e g ph the ftir spectra of 5 proteins before and after interactions with psnps are presented in fig s10 the results showed that the n h o h peaks on hsa col i and cs shifted from 3307 3306 and 3272 cm 1 to 3301 3325 and 3299 cm 1 respectively after interaction with psnps although these peak positions on bhb and bsa barely changed after interaction their peak strength enhanced similar to other 3 proteins indicating that the n h o h structures of bhb and bsa were also affected by psnps likely due to hydrophobic interactions zhou et al 2019 the red shift of c h absorption peaks on all 5 proteins may indicate partial change of the alkyl skeleton similarly the peaks at amide i and amide ii bands of all 5 proteins after interaction with psnps became sharper and more intensive specially the two infrared absorption peaks of cs at 1623 amide i band and 1517 cm 1 amide ii band blue shifted obviously to 1656 and 1541 cm 1 respectively this result indicated that the conformation of cs was strongly affected with the changed of secondary structure in correspondence to the cd analysis above new absorption peaks appeared at 3020 756 and 700 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of 5 proteins after interaction with psnps which was caused by the vibration of benzene ring on psnps the above ftir results indicated strong binding of all 5 proteins with psnps with alteration in protein secondary structure which was in agreement with the fluorescence and cd analyses to further evaluate the order of protein groups interacting and binding with psnps 2dcos analysis was used to analyze the synchronous and asynchronous ftir spectra of each protein in the range of 1800 1000 cm 1 fig 4e h fig s11 and tables s4 s8 the synchronous map of cs in fig 4e shows 7 auto peaks at 1730 1650 1610 1540 1450 1400 and 1300 1200 cm 1 the peaks at 1730 cm 1 and 1610 cm 1 were attributed to the carboxyl group c o and side chain moieties of amide i respectively chen et al 2018 sit et al 2019 the variation in intensity was the strongest for amide i for cs indicating that the amide i showed the strongest affinity with psnps the cross peaks formed by the auto peaks were all positive which indicated that their spectral intensity changed in the same direction the new auto peak at 1450 cm 1 may be attributed to the deformation vibration of aromatic c h bond after protein interaction with psnps suggesting good binding affinity the auto peaks and cross peaks from their synchronous fig 4e and asynchronous maps fig 4f are shown in table s4 according to the noda s rule isao noda 1988 by combining the synchronous and asynchronous maps the interaction sequence may be obtained as amide iii 1300 1200 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 side chain moieties of amide i 1610 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 amide i 1650 cm 1 similar to cs the 2dcos results for col i fig s11a b and bhb fig s11c d indicated the following orders of change carboxyl c o 1710 cm 1 amide iii 1320 1240 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 amide i 1650 cm 1 for col i table s5 and carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 amide iii 1200 cm 1 cooh 1390 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 amide i 1650 cm 1 for bhb table s6 similar to the above 3 proteins the auto peaks in the synchronous map of bsa fig 4g were also located at 1730 1650 1610 1540 1450 1400 and 1300 1200 cm 1 showing the same susceptibility of change in spectral intensity however opposite to previous 3 proteins the interaction sequence of bsa was amide i 1650 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 side chain moieties of amide i 1610 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 amide iii 1300 1200 cm 1 carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 fig 4g h and table s7 the variation patterns of synchronous fig s11e and asynchronous fig s11f maps for hsa were similar with bsa showing the interaction sequence of amide i 1650 cm 1 amide ii 1540 cm 1 aromatic c h 1450 cm 1 side chain moieties of amide i 1610 cm 1 cooh 1400 cm 1 amide iii 1200 cm 1 carboxyl c o 1730 cm 1 table s8 overall the amide i of 5 proteins all showed the strongest affinity for psnps the functional groups of two homologous proteins i e bsa and hsa had similar interaction sequence with psnps which was in opposite to other 3 proteins 3 4 effects of protein concentration on aggregation of psnps the aggregation kinetics of psnps as a function of protein concentration 1 2 5 and 5 mg c l was investigated in 300 mm nacl or 10 mm cacl2 solutions fig 5 the high ends of na and ca2 concentrations in natural aquatic environment which typically range from 43 μm to 485 mm and 25 μm to 11 mm respectively mui et al 2016 were selected so that the effects of protein concentration could be clearly shown fig 5a b show that at 300 mm nacl where psnps could undergo diffusion limited aggregation alone fig s2d the presence of bhb at 1 5 mg c l all slightly enhanced their aggregation while such enhancement gradually weakened as bhb concentration increased comparison between fig 2c and fig 5d suggested that at 300 mm nacl bhb significantly reduced the ζ potential of psnps from 20 to 0 mv whereas such charge screening effect was weakly influenced by bhb concentration these results suggested that edl compression was the major mechanism for bhb to destabilize psnps in nacl solution while the steric hindrance may compete with edl compression at higher bhb concentration similar to bhb col i present at 1 mg c l also slightly enhanced psnps aggregation while it reversed to stabilizing psnps at 2 5 and 5 mg c l with such effect enhancing with higher protein concentration notably as the col i concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l k decreased from 1 28 to 0 21 nm s and d h decreased from 987 16 to 357 12 nm after 20 min this may be attributed to the fact that at lower col i concentration its edl compression effect fig s12a outweighed the weak steric hindrance whereas the opposite occurred as protein concentration increased the other 3 proteins bsa hsa and cs all stabilized psnps at the tested protein concentrations particularly for cs even 1 mg c l protein could effectively inhibit any aggregation of psnps which did not change with further increase of protein concentration unlike cs both bsa and hsa stabilized psnps more effectively at higher protein concentration the d h of psnps failed to reach 1 5d 0 within 20 min at 2 5 mg c l bsa or 5 mg c l hsa which exhibited the same stabilization ability the enhanced stabilization effect on psnps at higher protein concentration should be attributed to the stronger steric hindrance originated from a thicker protein corona this was evident from the increase of halt values by 91 77 and 221 for bsa cs and hsa respectively as the protein concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l table s2 similar phenomenon was also reported for biomacromolecules including fulvic acid sun et al 2021 extracellular polymers as well as bsa and alginate liu et al 2020 as shown in fig 5c the effect of protein concentration on the aggregation kinetics of psnps in cacl2 solution was different from that in nacl solution overall all proteins except for cs present at 1 5 mg c l destabilized psnps to variable extents in 10 mm cacl2 solution due to edl compression fig 5d and fig s12 and cation bridging with ca2 it is noted that their destabilization effect all weakened at higher protein concentrations specifically as bsa concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l k decreased from 1 98 to 0 52 nm s which was still above that without the presence of bsa such phenomenon may be caused by the stronger steric hindrance effect at higher protein concentration that competed with edl compression and cation bridging yu et al 2019 meanwhile more protein was adsorbed by psnps at higher protein concentration leaving less amount of free protein in solution to bridge with ca2 table s2 notably 1 mg c l cs slightly destabilized psnps at 10 mm cacl2 which contradicted with its stabilization effect at 2 5 mg c l above fig 3a this was likely due to edl compression that dominated over other mechanisms at low concentration of cs however its effect reversed to stabilizing psnps at 2 5 and 5 mg c l cs with k decreased to 0 14 and 0 11 nm s respectively under these conditions cs stabilized psnps by specifically binding with ca2 that weakened the edl compression effect which was outweighed by steric hindrance as discussed earlier fig 3 the above results further demonstrate that the complex effects of protein on psnps aggregation depended on the counterbalance of edl compression cation bridging and steric hindrance 3 5 effects of ph on aggregation of psnps in the presence of protein 3 5 1 effects on electrostatic interactions and protein compactness in nacl solution as ph is a critical factor affecting the properties of both nps and proteins the ph effects on aggregation rate fig 6 a b and fig s13a c and ζ potential fig s14 of psnps were investigated in nacl solution containing 2 5 mg c l protein generally psnps remained positively charged at ph 3 and negatively charged at ph 9 with all 5 proteins as discussed earlier bhb with an iep of 6 4 destabilized psnps at ph 6 in nacl solution through charge neutralization fig 2 in comparison psnps possessed strong positive and negative charges in nacl solution at ph 3 and 9 in the presence of bhb respectively fig s14a therefore no or negligible aggregation k 0 11 nm s was observed when bhb was present under acidic and basic conditions due to electrostatic repulsion fig 6a similar to bhb psnps did not aggregate at ph 3 in the presence of hsa fig s13a this was likely caused by electrostatic repulsion with quite positive ζ potentials 6 3 20 0 mv of psnps at 100 1000 mm nacl fig s14b as well as steric hindrance imparted by a compact protein structure at low ph however the protein structure may become looser as ph increases due to deprotonation of hydrophobic surface functional groups weakening the steric hindrance liu et al 2020 consequently although the negative charge of psnps in the presence of hsa was always stronger at ph 9 than ph 6 fig s14b psnps aggregated faster under basic condition at nacl concentrations above 300 mm where edl compression dominated over steric hindrance fig s13a unlike hsa and bhb col i with an iep of 3 8 fig 1c resulted in the most neutral ζ potentials of psnps at ph 3 fig s14c leading to the strongest destabilization effect among 5 proteins under such condition fig 6b however psnps attained stronger negative charge as ph increased from 3 to 9 in the presence of col i which gradually stabilized psnps similar to col i cs significantly destabilized psnps at ph 3 fig s13b by edl compression as their ζ potentials were 3 1 9 4 mv at 100 1000 mm nacl fig s14d no further aggregation occurred in the presence of cs when ph increased to 6 or 9 possibly because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance fig s13c shows that under all tested conditions herein no aggregation of psnps occurred in the presence of bsa due to strong steric hindrance effect yet one exception occurred at ph 3 and 800 mm nacl where slow aggregation k 0 26 0 03 nm s was found indicating that edl compression slightly outweighed steric hindrance under this circumstance fig s14e 3 5 2 effects on electrostatic interactions and cation bridging in cacl2 solution the aggregation rate fig 6c d and fig s13d f and ζ potential fig s15 of psnps as a function of ph were examined in cacl2 solution containing 2 5 mg c l protein both bhb fig 6c and bsa fig s13f effectively stabilized psnps in cacl2 solution at ph 3 by providing strong positive charge fig s15a b which was similar to their behaviors in nacl solution psnps started to aggregate as ph increased to 6 in cacl2 solution containing bhb or bsa due to charge neutralization and cation bridging a continued increase of ph from 6 to 9 generally reduced the aggregation rate by enhancing electrostatic repulsion meanwhile the calcium bridging effect may be weakened at higher ph as the stability of protein secondary structure was interfered lan et al 2020 an exception was found in the presence of bhb at cacl2 concentration 60 mm where psnps aggregated faster at ph 9 than at ph 6 fig 6c it demonstrated that the destabilization effect by cation bridging exceeded the stabilization effect by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion under such circumstance in the presence of col i psnps aggregated rapidly even at ph 3 over the cacl2 concentrations fig 6d this phenomenon was different from other 4 proteins likely because of its weakest electrostatic repulsion fig s15c the aggregation rate further increased at higher ph indicating that deprotonation of acidic functional groups e g hydroxyl and carboxyl on col i may provide more sites for calcium bridging effect that dominated over electrostatic repulsion as shown in fig s13d the ph effect on aggregation of psnps in the presence of hsa was similar to that of bsa due to the strong surface charge of psnps imparted by cs fig s15e they did not aggregate at cacl2 10 mm under all ph conditions fig s13e it was noted that above 30 mm cacl2 psnps aggregated faster at ph 9 than at ph 6 herein the ζ potentials of psnps were near zero in the presence of cs at 60 100 mm cacl2 fig s15e the weakened steric hindrance effect due to the dissociation of cs micelles into smaller scale at ph 9 may promote the aggregation of psnps vaia et al 2006 4 conclusion the results from this study demonstrated that the configuration and surface property of protein as well as solution chemistry complexly influenced the aggregation of psnps under natural water conditions from freshwater to seawater in neutral nacl solution both spherical bsa and micellar cs significantly stabilized psnps by steric hindrance due to formation of thick protein corona while fibrous col i with relatively higher hydrophilicity provided the weakest stabilization by contrast the positively charged bhb destabilized psnps by electrostatic attraction at nacl concentrations below 400 mm in neutral cacl2 solution bsa col i hsa and bhb all destabilized psnps following the order of hsa bhb col i bsa at cacl2 concentration below 20 mm while it changed to col i hsa bhb bsa at higher cacl2 concentrations depending on counterbalance among steric hindrance edl compression and cation bridging however cs stabilized psnps by specifically precipitating ca2 and weakening its edl compression both protein concentration and solution ph strongly influenced the properties of proteins and psnps thus affecting stability of psnps fluorescence cd and ftir 2dcos analyses confirmed the strong affinity and revealed the interaction mechanisms between proteins and psnps overall the results suggested that both protein configuration e g structure charge and hydrophobicity and water chemistry e g ionic type ionic strength and ph exerted combined effects on the interactions between psnps and proteins thus altering the aggregation process of psnps governed by the interplay between dlvo v vdw and v edl and non dlvo e g steric hindrance cation bridging and cation precipitation interactions this work underlined the necessity of

15899,electrochemical filtration system efs has received broad interest due to its high efficiency for organic contaminants removal however the porous nature of electrodes and flow through operation mode make it susceptible to potential fouling in this work we systematically investigated the impacts of biofouling on sulfanilic acid sa removal and effluent toxicity in an efs results showed that the degradation efficiency of sa slightly deteriorated from 92 3 to 81 1 at 4 0 v due to the electrode fouling surprisingly after the occurrence of fouling the toxicity in terms of luminescent bacteria inhibition of the efs effluent decreased from 72 3 to 40 2 and cytotoxicity assay exhibited similar tendency scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses revealed that biofouling occurred on the porous cathode and live microorganisms were the dominant contributors which are expected to play an important role in toxicity suppression the relative abundance of flavobacterium genus related to the degradation of p nitrophenol an aromatic intermediate product of sa increased on the membrane cathode after fouling the analysis of degradation pathway confirmed the synergetic effects of electrochemical oxidation and biodegradation in removal of sa and its intermediate products in a bio fouled efs accounting for the decrease of the effluent toxicity results of our study for the first time highlight the critical role of biofouling in detoxication using efs for the treatment of contaminated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

2017 poza nogueiras et al 2018 sirés et al 2014 the key to the development of viable eaops is to prepare low cost durable high surface area electrodes modules that can demonstrate high efficiency whilst minimize the production of unwanted toxic byproducts attri et al 2015 chaplin 2019 wang et al 2020 electrochemical filtration system efs has been therefore fabricated to address this issue by introducing porous electrodes or electrified membranes into an eaop system which is typically operated in flow through mode buffa et al 2016 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 ni et al 2020 yu et al 2020 in this mode the convection transport of water in the small pores of porous electrodes significantly decreases the diffusion boundary layer because the layer thickness is confined to a theoretical distance less than the electrode pore radius at high flow rates which increases the electroactive surface area and enables compact design of an eaop system chaplin 2019 qian et al 2021 trellu et al 2018 hence efs has been applied for water and wastewater treatment in various fields such as disinfection liu et al 2020 2019 ni et al 2020 treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate chen et al 2021 and

harmful algal blooms in surface water yang et al 2022 previous studies have demonstrated that efs operated in flow through mode shows higher efficiency for contaminant degradation compared to flow by mode under the same conditions chen et al 2021 chen et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 as the mass transfer rate constant k m of contaminants on the electrodes can be increased by 2 5 4 4 times zheng et al 2018 moreover it is reported that the steady state oh radical concentration in flow through mode is 10 3 times higher than that in flow by mode chen et al 2020 the increased k m and higher yield of oxidants are expected to contribute to the superior performance of efs however the complex water matrix containing natural organic matter nom colloids and microorganisms may induce electrode biofouling i e the biological fouling phenomenon on the electrode and therefore deteriorate the process performance it is reported that degradation efficiency of tetracycline decreased in the presence of natural organic matter nom which may be caused by adsorption of inert organics onto the electrodes liu et al 2015 in regard to the large high surface area and flow through operation one would expect that efs is more susceptible to electrode fouling for example liu et al 2019 found that the disinfection ability of efs for natural water was obviously affected by electrode fouling in fact the role of biofouling that plays in efs is not well understood because the biofilm may get involved in further degradation of the oxidation products interestingly results of recent studies have shown that integration of eaop with biological treatment has synergetic action to degrade various contaminants chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 for these integrated systems the biological communities are always cultured in a suspended form in a large volume which have less negative effect on electrode compared to the biofouling developed on the electrochemical filter it is not clear whether such a biofilm biofouling would exhibit synergetic effects with eaops to degrade the intermediate products especially when the degradation efficiency of parent compound may be subject to deterioration since the intermediates could be toxic or even more toxic than their parent contaminants radjenovic and sedlak 2015 zhu et al 2016 it can be hypothesized that the induced synergetic effects by the biofouling layer in efs may suppress the toxicity of oxidation products whilst refine the bio safety of the treated water chaudhari et al 2017 puentes jácome et al 2021 shehzadi et al 2014 we speculated that microorganisms which can utilize toxic organic pollutants especially electrochemically recalcitrant intermediate products as carbon sources would contribute to toxicity suppression when they are present in the biofouling layer it was reported that rhodococcus and xanthobacter genus could degrade the electrochemical degradation intermediates of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole respectively li et al 2021 ren et al 2021 such an effect can also possibly be observed in other efss that produce intermediate products recalcitrant to electrochemical degradation however comprehensive investigation on this important topic is scarce in efss in this work an efs with ti sno2 sb as anode and titanium mesh as cathode was developed sulfanilic acid sa was chosen as a model contaminant because it is widely used in the production of dyes medicine pesticides and other chemical products chen et al 2012 el ghenymy et al 2012 pereira et al 2011 change of the performance in response to biofouling was evaluated by monitoring the time course results of sa degradation and effluent toxicity during continuous operation of efs the fouled electrode and the biofilm i e microbial community formed on electrode resulting from the biofouling were characterized in this work with consideration given to the vital microbial community that potentially contributes to degradation of sa and its intermediates to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to systematically investigate the biofouling in the efs and to reveal the role of biofouling playing in suppression of effluent toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup experiments were carried out in an electrochemical filtration system efs effective volume 4 48 l consisting of an electrochemical filtration module fig 1 a two baffle plates and a diffuser at the bottom fig 1b for the fabrication of the electrochemical filtration module two titanium meshes 10 cm 16 cm hongyun china with a pore size of 48 μm were used as cathodes and placed at both sides of a polyvinyl chloride pvc bracket with a built in ti sno2 sb electrode 8 cm 14 cm serving as anode the distance between the anode and each cathode was 1 cm fig 1a with the photo of the module presented in supporting information si fig s1 2 2 batch and continuous operation of the efs in order to determine the suitable applied voltage batch tests were conducted at constant voltages of 0 2 0 3 0 or 4 0 v for 360 min in flow by mode in which the influent and effluent pumps were turned off fig 1b the experimental solution containing 5 mm na2so4 and 10 μm sa had the same electrical conductivity as that in the long term operation for the rapid screening of experimental conditions samples were then collected at 0 5 10 30 60 120 180 240 300 and 360 min the degradation of sa in flow through mode fig 1c in efs was further evaluated at a constant flux of 33 l m2 h which resulted in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 360 min an equivalent time to that used in flow by mode zheng et al 2017 samples were collected at 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 h the experimental solution was synthetic surface water containing 10 μm sa 51 28 mg l ch3coona 9 44 mg l nh4 2so4 1 76 mg l kh2po4 6 5 mg l nahco3 1 35 mg l k2so4 6 0 mg l caso4 and 12 3 mg l mgso4 7h2o hedberg et al 2017 bacterial suspension as the inoculum collected from langxia full scale membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment plant shanghai china was fed into efs for two weeks without voltage applied and then discharged from the system fig 1d with the aeration the microorganisms were well mixed and suspended in the system which allowed them to attach onto the porous cathode for further growth to initiate the biofouling on electrode surface the biofilm would then gradually develop on the surface of porous cathode throughout the experiment the system was then fed with the synthetic surface water at a constant flux of 33 l m2 h with an operation cycle of nearly 30 d which is reasonable for obtaining convincing results at a specific operation condition chen et al 2018 2017 zhang et al 2020 the system was termed bio fouled efs bf efs and more information could be found in si section s1 to maintain a constant flux the operation pressure of the system would increase when the porous electrode was fouled reflecting the increase in filtration resistance or formation of biofilm on the electrode therefore the biofouling condition of the system could be monitored by measuring the operation pressure daily with a pressure gage hydraulic washing would be conducted if the operation pressure increased to 30 0 kpa or the removal efficiency of sa in the system significantly declined physical washing could recover the operation pressure to the initial level but would not completely remove the attached microorganisms avoiding re inoculation of the biofilm 2 3 analysis of sa degradation sa in water samples collected from efs was quantified using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 usa with an agilent c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the mixture of methanol and water ph 2 8 adjusted by phosphoric acid v v 5 95 was used as mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min an agilent 1200 photodiode array detector dad was used to detect sa at 246 nm the injection volume was 10 μl and test temperature was 30 c to identify the degradation products of sa pretreatment process was firstly conducted to remove salinity in water samples the water samples were lyophilized overnight and were redissolved in 80 methanol solution then the samples were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min and 5 μl of the internal standard 0 14 mg ml dichlorophenylalanine was added into 200 μl supernatant for subsequent analysis lc ms ms waters uplc thermo q exactive with acquity uplc hss t3 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm was used for analysis of products the mixture of acetonitrile and water acidified with 0 05 formic acid gradient elute was used as mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 0 3 ml min the injection volume was 5 μl and test temperature was 40 c the positive and negative modes were conducted for the electrospray ionization esi with a spray voltage of 3 0 kv and 3 2 kv monitoring ions with m z 70 1050 the detailed procedures for degradation intermediates identification are presented in si section s2 2 4 toxicity evaluation the toxicity of samples was analyzed using luminescent bacteria toxicity assay and cytotoxicity assay the samples of efs influent and efs effluent were collected at 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 h in flow through mode the samples of bf efs effluent at 3 0 and 4 0 v were collected on 24 25 26 d and 55 57 59 d of long term operation respectively luminescent bacteria toxicity assay the acute toxicity of water samples toward the luminescent v fischeri bacteria nrrl b 11 177 was measured according to the test iso 11 348 3 2007 before the test the salinity of samples was adjusted to 2 w v the bioluminescence intensity of v fischeri bacteria was measured using a multimode microplate reader synergy 4 bio tek usa after 15 min contact with samples at 25 c olmez hanci et al 2015 cytotoxicity assay a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line icell bioscience inc shanghai was used to perform the chronic cytotoxicity assay cell viability was measured using the celltiter glo luminescent cell viability assay kit promega usa based on the adenosine triphosphate atp assay wagner and plewa 2017 wu et al 2019 in addition synthetic surface water without sa was set as negative control and cytotoxicity of water samples was expressed as relative cell viability the specific steps of this test are given in si section s3 2 5 electrochemical measurements linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were carried out in a three electrode system by an electrochemical workstation reference 600 gamry us the three electrode system consisted of a pristine or fouled electrode cut from the efs as the working electrode an ag agcl saturated kcl reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode the electrolytes for test were 50 mm na2so4 containing 5 mm sa at ph 7 0 0 5 the lsv voltage windows for anode and cathode were 0 to 3 v and 3 to 0 v respectively at a scan rate of 50 mv s eis data were recorded with a 10 mv amplitude sinusoidal potential perturbation over a frequency range of 105 to 10 2 hz 2 6 microscopic characterization the morphology of pristine and fouled electrodes was characterized using scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 with an acceleration voltage of 3 0 kv confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was employed to deconvolute the component thickness and distribution of foulants on the electrode before clsm observation the biofouling layer on electrode surface was stained with concavalin a con a molecular probes inc and sypro orange molecular probes u s to label α polysaccharides and proteins respectively syto 9 and pi molecular probes u s were used to stain all and dead bacteria respectively after staining the electrode surface was washed with pbs buffer solution three times to remove extra agent and then observed with clsm 2 7 microbial community analysis the microbial samples were collected from the electrode surface and termed bf efs0 at the beginning of the experiment at the end of operation at 3 0 and 4 0 v the samples were collected and termed bf efs26 and bf efs60 respectively although the sample for community analysis was taken once at each time point all the biofilm on the electrodes were completely scratched off rather than sampling from a specific region the analysis of microbial communities was performed using illumina miseq platform majorbio shanghai china detailed procedures are provided in si section s4 2 8 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova test was used to test the significance among the results and p 0 05 is considered to be significantly different 3 results and discussion 3 1 sa removal and biofouling of efs in long term operation results of sa degradation by using efs in flow by mode are presented in fig 2 a aiming to determine the suitable applied voltage for long term test the degradation of sa increased with an increase in applied voltage after 360 min reaction 21 8 59 5 and 69 5 percentage removal of sa were achieved at an applied voltage of 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 v respectively under all voltages the electrochemical degradation of sa followed the pseudo first order degradation kinetics el ghenymy et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 as shown in table s1 the apparent rate constant k app of efs for sa degradation under 4 0 v was 0 0032 min 1 which was slightly higher than that under 3 0 v 0 0026 min 1 nevertheless the current density of efs under 4 0 v 2 43 ma cm2 was nearly 3 times that under 3 0 v 0 93 ma cm2 indicating a significantly higher energy consumption but nearly the same degradation rate this phenomenon should be contributed by the side reactions that became dominant at elevated voltages moreira et al 2017 therefore in the following long term operation 3 0 v was firstly chosen as the applied voltage additionally to assess whether an increase in the applied voltage can mitigate electrode biofouling the applied voltage was increased to 4 0 v at the second stage of operation the bf efs was fed with synthetic surface water for long term operation in flow through mode and the removal efficiency of sa is shown in fig 2b horizontal dot dash lines in fig 2b represent the corresponding sa removal by efs in flow through mode before fouling which were 66 5 1 8 and 93 4 1 3 under 3 0 and 4 0 v respectively fig s2 it should be noted that these two values were higher than those measured in flow by mode due to the enhanced mass transfer fig 2b shows that bf efs can achieve comparable sa removal at the initial stage of continuous operation 63 6 66 1 however the degradation efficiency began to deteriorate even lower than 40 with the prolongation of operation time implying the negative impacts of biofouling on the electrodes the biofouling was further evidenced by the increase in filtration pressure of efs fig 2c which suggested that the bf efs possessed increased resistance to water passage during the long term operation after 26 days of operation the pressure increased to 25 5 kpa and the percentage removal of sa was declined to 24 7 calling for a cleaning of the efs the surface of cathodes was washed by pressurized deionized water for 10 min to remove the foulant and 4 0 v was applied for the second stage operation under this operating condition sa percentage removal achieved 90 initially then declined slightly and maintained at 81 1 till the end of operation fig 2b when severe biofouling of electrode was observed as reflected by the increased pressure in fig 2c while it was reported that relatively high voltages could affect the redox potential across the cell membrane and inhibit bacterial growth pandit et al 2017 the electrode was still fouled at 4 0 v with a fouling rate of 0 90 kpa d though lower than 0 95 kpa d at 3 0 v which indicated that increasing the applied voltage cannot effectively mitigate the electrode biofouling nevertheless sa degradation by the bf efs under 4 0 v was significantly higher than that under 3 0 v and the cod removal remained stable throughout the whole long term operation fig s3 meanwhile we noticed that the sa removal efficiency at stage ii maintained even though the trans membrane pressure tmp increased to a high level comparable to that at stage i this could be ascribed to the following reasons i a higher current density at 4 0 v caused higher electrochemical degradation of sa and organic matter and ii possibly synergistic effect of electrochemical and biological degradation contributed to the enhanced removal efficiency to clarify these points we determined the effluent sa concentrations of efs on 0 26 and 60 d under open circuit condition fig s4 the results showed both sa concentrations of effluents on 26 d and 60 d by the bf efs without voltage applied were lower than that of influent indicating that the microorganisms themselves in the biofouling layer contributed to sa removal therefore we can conclude that the maintained high sa degradation for bf efs under 4 0 v was attributed to the synergetic effect with electrochemical degradation capacity playing a major role 3 2 electrochemical and morphology properties of the fouled electrode at the end of long term operation the electrode module was removed from efs and disassembled for further analysis the electrochemical properties of electrodes were characterized to reveal the effect of biofouling on degradation capacity of the efs fig 3 a shows the results of the linear sweep voltammetry lsv experiment an oxidation peak corresponding to the oxidation reaction of sa at 1 12 v vs ag agcl was noticed which was not observed in the absence of sa fig s5 however after long term operation and formation of biofilm the characteristic oxidation peak of sa shifted to a higher potential of 1 24 v and the shape of the oxidation peak became relatively flat in addition the current density of cathode decreased obviously at the same potential after fouling fig 3b therefore it could be concluded that the foulants on the electrode surface retarded the electron transfer and resulted in deterioration of the electrode performance patel et al 2013 serrano et al 2015 this explained that why the removal of sa on 26 d was lower than that of 0 d by efs fig 2 nyquist plots of pristine and fouled electrodes are shown in fig 3c d for the pristine anode the electrochemical impedance at high frequency range is related to charge transfer resistance through the electrode electrolyte interface and the steep sloping line represents mass diffusion and capacitive behavior on the electrode however for the fouled anode in addition to the charge transfer resistance in the intermediate frequency range an impedance of mass transfer resistance that is related to mass transport through the fouling layer appeared in the high frequency range fig 3c meanwhile the charge transfer resistance of the cathode in high frequency increased after fouling in view of the change of electrochemical properties the deteriorated electrode properties resulted in the decreased degradation efficiency of sa fig 2b fig 4 shows the surface morphologies of pristine and fouled electrodes by sem since the anode was not permeable fouling on the anode was not severe fig 4c in contrast cathodes with the mesh type structure acted as the filtration electrode and it can be seen from fig 4d that a fouling layer was developed on the cathode surface likely accounting for the increase in the filtration pressure while the negatively charged surface of cathode may reject foulants typically negatively charged from the water matrix chen et al 2019 fu et al 2019 the drag force induced by flow through operation might aggravate the deposition of foulants on the cathode surface facilitating the growth of biofilm to further clarify the compositions of foulants on the electrodes clsm was conducted to visualize the biofouling layer as shown in fig 5 the anode was slightly fouled while the cathode was severely fouled and the thickness of fouling layer on the cathode 229 0 12 7 μm was much higher than the anode 70 0 14 1 μm such fouling tendency is in consistent with the sem results fig 4 moreover live microorganisms were found to be the major contributors compared to the dead microorganisms α polysaccharides and proteins on the surface of cathode fig s6 the microorganisms on the cathode are therefore expected to play an important role in sa and its intermediate degradation 3 3 effects of biofouling on the toxicity of effluent from efs the deterioration in electrochemical property of electrode after fouling resulted in the decrease in sa removal efficiency for the efs but whether the effluent toxicity would show the same tendency remained unknown the toxicity of effluent is of vital importance for water quality barceló et al 2020 dong et al 2019 du et al 2017 considering that low concentration pollutants do not necessarily represent a low toxicity for a water sample wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 therefore we further analyzed the toxicity of the influent and effluent from efs before and after fouling via luminescent bacteria toxicity and cytotoxicity assays before refers to the effluent of a control efs in flow through mode fig 1c in the absence of biofouling and after refers to the effluent of bf efs at the end of 3 0 v and 4 0 v operation fig 6 a shows that the effluent of efs had higher inhibition to luminescent bacteria i e larger toxicity compared to the influent which suggested that the effluent was even more toxic than the influent the increased toxicity of the effluent is probably due to the generation of highly toxic intermediate products or transformation products similar phenomena were reported in previous studies of tetracycline trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2016 interestingly the effluent toxicity of bf efs at both 3 0 v and 4 0 v significantly decreased in comparison to the effluent of efs the cytotoxicity assay fig 6b exhibited similar tendency i e the effluent of bf efs had lower cytotoxicity compared with that from efs to clarify the reason for the increased toxicity the profile of the effluent toxicity during the electrochemical degradation of sa by the efs in flow by mode was continuously monitored using luminescent bacteria toxicity assay fig 6c the relative toxicity r toxicity toxicity toxicity0 and relative concentration of sa r concentration c c 0 were used to describe the relationship between effluent toxicity and concentration of sa fig 6c can be divided into three regions according to the relationship between r toxicity and r concentration wang et al 2018c region 1 represents an ideal situation and the toxicity is reduced as the parent pollutant degrades however the data points of efs in flow by mode fall into region 2 at the beginning of sa degradation c c 0 0 8 1 0 implying that the rate of toxicity elimination was slower than the rate of sa degradation with the further degradation of sa most data points fall in region 3 suggesting the generation of intermediate products that were more toxic than the parent compound sa furthermore fig 3c shows that the data point of the efs effluent in flow through mode falls in region 3 while the data point of bf efs effluent at 4 0 v falls in region 2 this indicated a decrease in the effluent toxicity when the biofilm formed on the electrode surface moreover the data point of bf efs effluent at 3 0 v also fell in region 2 with a low c c 0 value of 0 74 it implied that the suppressed toxicity of bf efs effluent at 3 0 v was due to both the low sa degradation rate and a slight contribution by the biofilm on the electrode 3 4 microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer to understand the structure of microbial community involved in detoxication of the effluent the biofilm samples were collected from the cathode surface on 0 d 26 d and 60 d i e termed bf efs0 bf efs26 and bf efs60 during the long term operation a total of 1256 335 sequences were obtained from the three samples and 608 otus were clustered based on the α diversity statistics table s2 shannon index decreased as a function of operating time which indicated that the community diversity decreased with the continuous operation of bf efs ma et al 2017 in this study decline in community diversity as compared to the inoculum may be attributed to the presence of an electrical field and the acclimation of microorganisms to the less abundant organic matter in the synthetic surface water chen et al 2019 li et al 2021 the microbial communities were mainly composed of 28 phyla except for unclassified bacteria in these samples as shown in fig 7 a proteobacteria 52 4 bacteroidota 24 4 chloroflexi 6 7 acidobacteriota 5 5 and actinobacteriota 2 2 were the dominant phyla in bf efs0 after long term operation the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased to 88 0 and 95 6 on 26 and 60 d respectively besides the relative abundance of γ proteobacteria class increased in bf efs60 compared to bf efs0 which are frequently observed in sulphonamide contaminated environments song et al 2019 the relative abundance of actinobacteriota also increased slightly in bf efs26 compared to that in bf efs0 which may be due to the application of an electric field fahey 2013 li et al 2021 it has been reported that five isolated strains which can degrade sulfonamides belong to actinobacteriota and proteobacteria respectively bouju et al 2012 sun et al 2019 furthermore similarity and overlap of phyla composition among different samples were analyzed caldisericota synergistota and spirochaetota existed in the sample of bf efs26 which were classified as others in bf efs0 due to low relative abundance caldisericota phylum may participate in the sulfur oxidation reaction aida et al 2014 in order to further clarify the variation of microbial communities during the operation the analysis at genus level was conducted with the results shown in circos diagram fig 7b the number of genera in bf efs26 decreased significantly compared to bf efs0 which is consistent with the results of α diversity analysis the circos diagram reflects the distribution proportion of dominant genera in each sample and the distribution proportion of each dominant genera among different samples as shown in fig 7b acinetobacter 40 was the dominant genus in bf efs60 and its relative abundances in bf efs26 and bf efs60 were significantly higher than bf efs0 it is reported that acinetobacter sp could degrade sulfonamide such as sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine having the potential for the bioremediation of sulfonamide polluted environments wang et al 2018b wang and wang 2018 zhang et al 2012 sa is the degradation intermediate of sulfonamides which may induce the enrichment of acinetobacter genus chen et al 2012 el ghenymy et al 2012 pereira et al 2011 however the removal efficiency of sa on 26 d was lower than that of 0 d in spite of the increased relative abundance of acinetobacter genus under 3 0 v the sa degradation on 0 d and 26 d was largely attributed to the electrochemical degradation compared to the overall sa degradation ratio in fig 2 while the biofouling was responsible for deteriorating the electrochemical performance of the electrode on 26 d as evidenced in fig 3 it has been reported that flavobacterium genus could utilize p nitrophenol as the sole carbon source and realize its mineralization arora et al 2014 raymond and alexander 1971 as shown in fig 7b flavobacterium genus was present in the biofilm after inoculation in other words benefits of biofouling were possibly present at the beginning of the experiment and the effect was associated with the abundance of functional microorganisms i e the degree of toxicity suppression was related to the microbial abundance the relative abundance of flavobacterium genus decreased in bf efs26 and increased in bf efs60 compared to bf efs0 fig s7 electro oxidation of sa in the efs resulted in the formation of degradation products p nitrophenol as shown in the following section offering carbon source to flavobacterium however deteriorated degradation efficiency of sa at 3 0 v may lead to reduced production of intermediates i e insufficient carbon source and consequently lower relative abundance of flavobacterium genus in bf efs26 this result implied that microorganisms flavobacterium responsible for toxicity suppression were more enriched at 4 0 v than that at 3 0 v and the synergetic effect on effluent toxicity suppression at 3 0 v was relatively weak due to both low degradation rate of sa and decreased relative abundance of flavobacterium genus fig s7 3 5 sa degradation pathway and toxicity suppression mechanisms the effluents from efs and bf efs were analyzed by lc ms ms to elucidate the degradation pathway of sa the total ion chromatograms tic of water samples fig s8 and the mass spectra ms of degradation products figs s9 s11 were obtained and the degradation pathway of sa was proposed fig 8 according to previous literature el ghenymy et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 hydroquinone and p benzoquinone are the two main aromatic products by dihydroxylation of sa in the electrochemical oxidation process however as shown in fig 8 p nitrophenol was detected in the effluent of efs before fouling the sulfonic acid group of sa was firstly replaced by a phenolic hydroxyl group and the amino group in para position was oxidized to nitro group it has been reported that the rat oral acute toxicity of p nitrophenol lc50 230 mg kg is higher than sa lc50 12 300 mg kg pubchem 2021a 2021b which may account for the increase in the effluent toxicity of efs except for aromatic product cis cis muconic acid was also detected in the effluent of efs which was further degraded into fumaric acid lc50 6800 mg kg pubchem 2021c however these three products and other characteristic products were not detected in the effluent from bf efs this implied that the electrochemical degradation products of sa were further degraded by the microorganisms in the biofouling layer which suppressed the effluent toxicity the mechanisms of toxicity suppression are proposed according to the above results the microorganisms in the influent gradually deposit on the electrode and develop a microbial community that can metabolize organic contaminants flow through operation leads to the enhancement of mass transfer of oxidation products on the electrode and then the enrichment of p nitrophenol degrading bacteria e g flavobacterium in the biofilm consequently electrogenerated toxic intermediate products are utilized by the microorganisms and the toxicity of efs effluent is decreased biofouling is always deemed to have negative impacts on water and wastewater treatment because this causes decline in permeate flux increase in operating pressure zhang et al 2020 and deterioration in electrochemical performance however it is interesting to note that biofouling in an efs may contribute to the suppression of effluent toxicity as a result of the synergetic effects of the microorganisms and electrochemical reactions fig 9 the porous cathode of efs is responsible for enriching the functional microorganisms during the development of biofilm which provides a new idea for the treatment of different types of wastewaters overall the appropriate amount of biofilm provides the synergetic effects but it would deteriorate the process performance such as a decrease in electrochemical degradation of the parent compound sa and an increase in tmp when the biofilm became too thick the key towards better utilization of the microorganisms is to maintain the optimal conditions by monitoring the effluent toxicity and operation pressure therefore adjusting the efs cleaning frequency carefully would be beneficial to control the growth rate of the biofouling layer which would be investigated in depth in our future study we believe that a precise control of microorganisms grown on the electrode would be beneficial to maintain high efficiency of efs whilst minimize the production of toxic byproducts 4 conclusions the degradation efficiency of sulfanilic acid sa in an efs was deteriorated during long term operation due to the occurrence of biofouling an increased voltage was less efficient to mitigate the electrode biofouling however after the development of biofilm on the cathode the luminescent bacteria inhibition effluent toxicity of efs effluent decreased from 72 3 to 40 2 with a similar phenomenon noted in the cytotoxicity assay the deterioration of electrode property after fouling indicated that the electrode itself was unlikely responsible for suppressing the effluent toxicity biofouling on the cathode with live microorganisms as the major contributors had the potential to play a considerable role in toxicity suppression the relative abundance of flavobacterium genus related to the degradation of p nitrophenol increased after fouling the proposed degradation pathway also showed that the microorganisms in the biofouling layer degraded the intermediate products therefore the synergetic effects of the electrode and microorganisms in the bio fouled efs resulted in efficient degradation of sa and suppression of effluent

15899,electrochemical filtration system efs has received broad interest due to its high efficiency for organic contaminants removal however the porous nature of electrodes and flow through operation mode make it susceptible to potential fouling in this work we systematically investigated the impacts of biofouling on sulfanilic acid sa removal and effluent toxicity in an efs results showed that the degradation efficiency of sa slightly deteriorated from 92 3 to 81 1 at 4 0 v due to the electrode fouling surprisingly after the occurrence of fouling the toxicity in terms of luminescent bacteria inhibition of the efs effluent decreased from 72 3 to 40 2 and cytotoxicity assay exhibited similar tendency scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses revealed that biofouling occurred on the porous cathode and live microorganisms were the dominant contributors which are expected to play an important role in toxicity suppression the relative abundance of flavobacterium genus related to the degradation of p nitrophenol an aromatic intermediate product of sa increased on the membrane cathode after fouling the analysis of degradation pathway confirmed the synergetic effects of electrochemical oxidation and biodegradation in removal of sa and its intermediate products in a bio fouled efs accounting for the decrease of the effluent toxicity

whilst minimize the production of unwanted toxic byproducts attri et al 2015 chaplin 2019 wang et al 2020 electrochemical filtration system efs has been therefore fabricated to address this issue by introducing porous electrodes or electrified membranes into an eaop system which is typically operated in flow through mode buffa et al 2016 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 ni et al 2020 yu et al 2020 in this mode the convection transport of water in the small pores of porous electrodes significantly decreases the diffusion boundary layer because the layer thickness is confined to a theoretical distance less than the electrode pore radius at high flow rates which increases the electroactive surface area and enables compact design of an eaop system chaplin 2019 qian et al 2021 trellu et al 2018 hence efs has been applied for water and wastewater treatment in various fields such as disinfection liu et al 2020 2019 ni et al 2020 treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate chen et al 2021 and

harmful algal blooms in surface water yang et al 2022 previous studies have demonstrated that efs operated in flow through mode shows higher efficiency for contaminant degradation compared to flow by

2018 moreover it is reported that the steady state oh radical concentration in flow through mode is 10 3 times higher than that in flow by mode chen et al 2020 the increased k m and higher yield of oxidants are expected to contribute to the superior performance of efs however the complex water matrix containing natural organic matter nom colloids and microorganisms may induce electrode biofouling i e the biological fouling phenomenon on the electrode and therefore deteriorate the process performance it is reported that degradation efficiency of tetracycline decreased in the presence of natural organic matter nom which may be caused by adsorption of inert organics onto the electrodes liu et al 2015 in regard to the large high surface area and flow through operation one would expect that efs is more susceptible to electrode fouling for example liu et al 2019 found that the disinfection ability of efs for natural water was obviously affected by electrode fouling in fact the role of biofouling that plays in efs is not well understood because the biofilm may get involved in further degradation of the oxidation products interestingly results of recent studies have shown that integration of eaop with biological treatment has synergetic action to degrade various contaminants chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 for these integrated systems the biological communities are always cultured in a suspended form in a large volume which have less negative effect on electrode compared to the biofouling developed on the electrochemical filter it is not clear whether such a biofilm biofouling would exhibit synergetic effects with eaops to degrade the intermediate products especially when the degradation efficiency of parent compound may be subject to deterioration since the intermediates could be toxic or even more toxic than their parent contaminants radjenovic and sedlak 2015 zhu et al 2016 it can be hypothesized that the induced synergetic effects by the biofouling layer in efs may suppress the toxicity of oxidation products whilst refine the bio safety of the treated water chaudhari et al 2017 puentes jácome et al 2021 shehzadi et al 2014 we speculated that microorganisms which can utilize toxic organic pollutants especially electrochemically recalcitrant intermediate products as carbon sources would contribute to toxicity suppression when they are present in the biofouling layer it was reported that rhodococcus and xanthobacter genus could degrade the electrochemical degradation intermediates of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole respectively li et al 2021 ren et al 2021 such an effect can also possibly be observed in other efss that produce intermediate products recalcitrant to electrochemical degradation however comprehensive investigation on this important topic is scarce in efss in this work an efs with ti sno2 sb as anode and titanium mesh as cathode was developed sulfanilic acid sa was chosen as a model contaminant because it is widely used in the production of dyes medicine pesticides and other chemical products chen et al 2012 el ghenymy et al 2012 pereira et al 2011 change of the performance in response to biofouling was evaluated by monitoring the time course results of sa degradation and effluent toxicity during continuous operation of efs the fouled electrode and the biofilm i e microbial community formed on electrode resulting from the biofouling were characterized in this work with consideration given to the vital microbial community that potentially contributes to degradation of sa and its intermediates to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to systematically investigate the biofouling in the efs and to reveal the role of biofouling playing in suppression of effluent toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup experiments were carried out in an electrochemical filtration system efs effective volume 4 48 l consisting of an electrochemical filtration module fig 1 a two baffle plates and a diffuser at the bottom fig 1b for the fabrication of the electrochemical filtration module two titanium meshes 10 cm 16 cm hongyun china with a pore size of 48 μm were used as cathodes and placed at both sides of a polyvinyl chloride pvc bracket with a built in ti sno2 sb electrode 8 cm 14 cm serving as anode the distance between the anode and each cathode was 1 cm fig 1a with the photo of the module presented in supporting information si fig s1 2 2 batch and continuous operation of the efs in order to determine the suitable applied voltage batch tests were conducted at constant voltages of 0 2 0 3 0 or 4 0 v for 360 min in flow by mode in which the influent and effluent pumps were turned off fig 1b the experimental solution containing 5 mm na2so4 and 10 μm sa had the same electrical conductivity as that in the long term operation for the rapid screening of experimental conditions samples were then collected at 0 5 10 30 60 120 180 240 300 and 360 min the degradation of sa in flow through mode fig 1c in efs was further evaluated at a constant flux of 33 l m2 h which resulted in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 360 min an equivalent time to that used in flow by mode zheng et al 2017 samples were collected at 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 h the experimental solution was synthetic surface water containing 10 μm sa 51 28 mg l ch3coona 9 44 mg l nh4 2so4 1 76 mg l kh2po4 6 5 mg l nahco3 1 35 mg l k2so4 6 0 mg l caso4 and 12 3 mg l mgso4 7h2o hedberg et al 2017 bacterial suspension as the inoculum collected from langxia full scale membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment plant shanghai china was fed into efs for two weeks without voltage applied and then discharged from the system fig 1d with the aeration the microorganisms were well mixed and suspended in the system which allowed them to attach onto the porous cathode for further growth to initiate the biofouling on electrode surface the biofilm would then gradually develop on the surface of porous cathode throughout the experiment the system was then fed with the synthetic surface water at a constant flux of 33 l m2 h with an operation cycle of nearly 30 d which is reasonable for obtaining convincing results at a specific operation condition chen et al 2018 2017 zhang et al 2020 the system was termed bio fouled efs bf efs and more information could be found in si section s1 to maintain a constant flux the operation pressure of the system would increase when the porous electrode was fouled reflecting the increase in filtration resistance or formation of biofilm on the electrode therefore the biofouling condition of the system could be monitored by measuring the operation pressure daily with a pressure gage hydraulic washing would be conducted if the operation pressure increased to 30 0 kpa or the removal efficiency of sa in the system significantly declined physical washing could recover the operation pressure to the initial level but would not completely remove the attached microorganisms avoiding re inoculation of the biofilm 2 3 analysis of sa degradation sa in water samples collected from efs was quantified using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 usa with an agilent c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the mixture of methanol and water ph 2 8 adjusted by phosphoric acid v v 5 95 was used as mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min an agilent 1200 photodiode array detector dad was used to detect sa at 246 nm the injection volume was 10 μl and test temperature was 30 c to identify the degradation products of sa pretreatment process was firstly conducted to remove salinity in water samples the water samples were lyophilized overnight and were redissolved in 80 methanol solution then the samples were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min and 5 μl of the internal standard 0 14 mg ml dichlorophenylalanine was added into 200 μl supernatant for subsequent analysis lc ms ms waters uplc thermo q exactive with acquity uplc hss t3 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm was used for analysis of products the mixture of acetonitrile and water acidified with 0 05 formic acid gradient elute was used as mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 0 3 ml min the injection volume was 5 μl and test temperature was 40 c the positive and negative modes were conducted for the electrospray ionization esi with a spray voltage of 3 0 kv and 3 2 kv monitoring ions with m z 70 1050 the detailed procedures for degradation intermediates identification are presented in si section s2 2 4 toxicity evaluation the toxicity of samples was analyzed using luminescent bacteria toxicity assay and cytotoxicity assay the samples of efs influent and efs effluent were collected at 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 h in flow through mode the samples of bf efs effluent at 3 0 and 4 0 v were collected on 24 25 26 d and 55 57 59 d of long term operation respectively luminescent bacteria toxicity assay the acute toxicity of water samples toward the luminescent v fischeri bacteria nrrl b 11 177 was measured according to the test iso 11 348 3 2007 before the test the salinity of samples was adjusted to 2 w v the bioluminescence intensity of v fischeri bacteria was measured using a multimode microplate reader synergy 4 bio tek usa after 15 min contact with samples at 25 c olmez hanci et al 2015 cytotoxicity assay a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line icell bioscience inc shanghai was used to perform the chronic cytotoxicity assay cell viability was measured using the celltiter glo luminescent cell viability assay kit promega usa based on the adenosine triphosphate atp assay wagner and plewa 2017 wu et al 2019 in addition synthetic surface water without sa was set as negative control and cytotoxicity of water samples was expressed as relative cell viability the specific steps of this test are given in si section s3 2 5 electrochemical measurements linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were carried out in a three electrode system by an electrochemical workstation reference 600 gamry us the three electrode system consisted of a pristine or fouled electrode cut from the efs as the working electrode an ag agcl saturated kcl reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode the electrolytes for test were 50 mm na2so4 containing 5 mm sa at ph 7 0 0 5 the lsv voltage windows for anode and cathode were 0 to 3 v and 3 to 0 v respectively at a scan rate of 50 mv s eis data were recorded with a 10 mv amplitude sinusoidal potential perturbation over a frequency range of 105 to 10 2 hz 2 6 microscopic characterization the morphology of pristine and fouled electrodes was characterized using scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 with an acceleration voltage of 3 0 kv confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was employed to deconvolute the component thickness and distribution of foulants on the electrode before clsm observation the biofouling layer on electrode surface was stained with concavalin a con a molecular probes inc and sypro orange molecular probes u s to label α polysaccharides and proteins respectively syto 9 and pi molecular probes u s were used to stain all and dead bacteria respectively after staining the electrode surface was washed with pbs buffer solution three times to remove extra agent and then observed with clsm 2 7 microbial community analysis the microbial samples were collected from the electrode surface and termed bf efs0 at the beginning of the experiment at the end of operation at 3 0 and 4 0 v the samples were collected and termed bf efs26 and bf efs60 respectively although the sample for community analysis was taken once at each time point all the biofilm on the electrodes were completely scratched off rather than sampling from a specific region the analysis of microbial communities was performed using illumina miseq platform majorbio shanghai china detailed procedures are provided in si section s4 2 8 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova test was used to test the significance among the results and p 0 05 is considered to be significantly different 3 results and discussion 3 1 sa removal and biofouling of efs in long term operation results of sa degradation by using efs in flow by mode are presented in fig 2 a aiming to determine the suitable applied voltage for long term test the degradation of sa increased with an increase in applied voltage after 360 min reaction 21 8 59 5 and 69 5 percentage removal of sa were achieved at an applied voltage of 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 v respectively under all voltages the electrochemical degradation of sa followed the pseudo first order degradation kinetics el ghenymy et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 as shown in table s1 the apparent rate constant k app of efs for sa degradation under 4 0 v was 0 0032 min 1 which was slightly higher than that under 3 0 v 0 0026 min 1 nevertheless the current density of efs under 4 0 v 2 43 ma cm2 was nearly 3 times that under 3 0 v 0 93 ma cm2 indicating a significantly higher energy consumption but nearly the same degradation rate this phenomenon should be contributed by the side reactions that became dominant at elevated voltages moreira et al 2017 therefore in the following long term operation 3 0 v was firstly chosen as the applied voltage additionally to assess whether an increase in the applied voltage can mitigate electrode biofouling the applied voltage was increased to 4 0 v at the second stage of operation the bf efs was fed with synthetic surface water for long term operation in flow through mode and the removal efficiency of sa is shown in fig 2b horizontal dot dash lines in fig 2b represent the corresponding sa removal by efs in flow through mode before fouling which were 66 5 1 8 and 93 4 1 3 under 3 0 and 4 0 v respectively fig s2 it should be noted that these two values were higher than those measured in flow by mode due to the enhanced mass transfer fig 2b shows that bf efs can achieve comparable sa removal at the initial stage of continuous operation 63 6 66 1 however the degradation efficiency began to deteriorate even lower than 40 with the prolongation of operation time implying the negative impacts of biofouling on the electrodes the biofouling was further evidenced by the increase in filtration pressure of efs fig 2c which suggested that the bf efs possessed increased resistance to water passage during the long term operation after 26 days of operation the pressure increased to 25 5 kpa and the percentage removal of sa was declined to 24 7 calling for a cleaning of the efs the surface of cathodes was washed by pressurized deionized water for 10 min to remove the foulant and 4 0 v was applied for the second stage operation under this operating condition sa percentage removal achieved 90 initially then declined slightly and maintained at 81 1 till the end of operation fig 2b when severe biofouling of electrode was observed as reflected by the increased pressure in fig 2c while it was reported that relatively high voltages could affect the redox potential across the cell membrane and inhibit bacterial growth pandit et al 2017 the electrode was still fouled at 4 0 v with a fouling rate of 0 90 kpa d though lower than 0 95 kpa d at 3 0 v which indicated that increasing the applied voltage cannot effectively mitigate the electrode biofouling nevertheless sa degradation by the bf efs under 4 0 v was significantly higher than that under 3 0 v and the cod removal remained stable throughout the whole long term operation fig s3 meanwhile we noticed that the sa removal efficiency at stage ii maintained even though the trans membrane pressure tmp increased to a high level comparable to that at stage i this could be ascribed to the following reasons i a higher current density at 4 0 v caused higher electrochemical degradation of sa and organic matter and ii possibly synergistic effect of electrochemical and biological degradation contributed to the enhanced removal efficiency to clarify these points we determined the effluent sa concentrations of efs on 0 26 and 60 d under open circuit condition fig s4 the results showed both sa concentrations of effluents on 26 d and 60 d by the bf efs without voltage applied were lower than that of influent indicating that the microorganisms themselves in the biofouling layer contributed to sa removal therefore we can conclude that the maintained high sa degradation for bf efs under 4 0 v was attributed to the synergetic effect with electrochemical degradation capacity playing a major role 3 2 electrochemical and morphology properties of the fouled electrode at the end of long term operation the electrode module was removed from efs and disassembled for further analysis the electrochemical properties of electrodes were characterized to reveal the effect of biofouling on degradation capacity of the efs fig 3 a shows the results of the linear sweep voltammetry lsv experiment an oxidation peak corresponding to the oxidation reaction of sa at 1 12 v vs ag agcl was noticed which was not observed in the absence of sa fig s5 however after long term operation and formation of biofilm the characteristic oxidation peak of sa shifted to a higher potential of 1 24 v and the shape of the oxidation peak became relatively flat in addition the current density of cathode decreased obviously at the same potential after fouling fig 3b therefore it could be concluded that the foulants on the electrode surface retarded the electron transfer and resulted in deterioration of the electrode performance patel et al 2013 serrano et al 2015 this explained that why the removal of sa on 26 d was lower than that of 0 d by efs fig 2 nyquist plots of pristine and fouled electrodes are shown in fig 3c d for the pristine anode the electrochemical impedance at high frequency range is related to charge transfer resistance through the electrode electrolyte interface and the steep sloping line represents mass diffusion and capacitive behavior on the electrode however for the fouled anode in addition to the charge transfer resistance in the intermediate frequency range an impedance of mass transfer resistance that is related to mass transport through the fouling layer appeared in the high frequency range fig 3c meanwhile the charge transfer resistance of the cathode in high frequency increased after fouling in view of the change of electrochemical properties the deteriorated electrode properties resulted in the decreased degradation efficiency of sa fig 2b fig 4 shows the surface morphologies of pristine and fouled electrodes by sem since the anode was not permeable fouling on the anode was not severe fig 4c in contrast cathodes with the mesh type structure acted as the filtration electrode and it can be seen from fig 4d that a fouling layer was developed on the cathode surface likely accounting for the increase in the filtration pressure while the negatively charged surface of cathode may reject foulants typically negatively charged from the water matrix chen et al 2019 fu et al 2019 the drag force induced by flow through operation might aggravate the deposition of foulants on the cathode surface facilitating the growth of biofilm to further clarify the compositions of foulants on the electrodes clsm was conducted to visualize the biofouling layer as shown in fig 5 the anode was slightly fouled while the cathode was severely fouled and the thickness of fouling layer on the cathode 229 0 12 7 μm was much higher than the anode 70 0 14 1 μm such fouling tendency is in consistent with the sem results fig 4 moreover live microorganisms were found to be the major contributors compared to the dead microorganisms α polysaccharides and proteins on the surface of cathode fig s6 the microorganisms on the cathode are therefore expected to play an important role in sa and its intermediate degradation 3 3 effects of biofouling on the toxicity of effluent from efs the deterioration in electrochemical property of electrode after fouling resulted in the decrease in sa removal efficiency for the efs but whether the effluent toxicity would show the same tendency remained unknown the toxicity of effluent is of vital importance for water quality barceló et al 2020 dong et al 2019 du et al 2017 considering that low concentration pollutants do not necessarily represent a low toxicity for a water sample wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 therefore we further analyzed the toxicity of the influent and effluent from efs before and after fouling via luminescent bacteria toxicity and cytotoxicity assays before refers to the effluent of a control efs in flow through mode fig 1c in the absence of biofouling and after refers to the effluent of bf efs at the end of 3 0 v and 4 0 v operation fig 6 a shows that the effluent of efs had higher inhibition to luminescent bacteria i e larger toxicity compared to the influent which suggested that the effluent was even more toxic than the influent the increased toxicity of the effluent is probably due to the generation of highly toxic intermediate products or transformation products similar phenomena were reported in previous studies of tetracycline trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2016 interestingly the effluent toxicity of bf efs at both 3 0 v and 4 0 v significantly decreased in comparison to the effluent of efs the cytotoxicity assay fig 6b exhibited similar tendency i e the effluent of bf efs had lower cytotoxicity compared with that from efs to clarify the reason for the increased toxicity the profile of the effluent toxicity during the electrochemical degradation of sa by the efs in flow by mode was continuously monitored using luminescent bacteria toxicity assay fig 6c the relative toxicity r toxicity toxicity toxicity0 and relative concentration of sa r concentration c c 0 were used to describe the relationship between effluent toxicity and concentration of sa fig 6c can be divided into three regions according to the relationship between r toxicity and r concentration wang et al 2018c region 1 represents an ideal situation and the toxicity is reduced as the parent pollutant degrades however the data points of efs in flow by mode fall into region 2 at the beginning of sa degradation c c 0 0 8 1 0 implying that the rate of toxicity elimination was slower than the rate of sa degradation with the further degradation of sa most data points fall in region 3 suggesting the generation of intermediate products that were more toxic than the parent compound sa furthermore fig 3c shows that the data point of the efs effluent in flow through mode falls in region 3 while the data point of bf efs effluent at 4 0 v falls in region 2 this indicated a decrease in the effluent toxicity when the biofilm formed on the electrode surface moreover the data point of bf efs effluent at 3 0 v also fell in region 2 with a low c c 0 value of 0 74 it implied that the suppressed toxicity of bf efs effluent at 3 0 v was due to both the low sa degradation rate and a slight contribution by the biofilm on the electrode 3 4 microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer to understand the structure of microbial community involved in detoxication of the effluent the biofilm samples were collected from the cathode surface on 0 d 26 d and 60 d i e termed bf efs0 bf efs26 and bf efs60 during the long term operation a total of 1256 335 sequences were obtained from the three samples and 608 otus were clustered based on the α diversity statistics table s2 shannon index decreased as a function of operating time which indicated that the community diversity decreased with the continuous operation of bf efs ma et al 2017 in this study decline in community diversity as compared to the inoculum may be attributed to the presence of an electrical field and the acclimation of microorganisms to the less abundant organic matter in the synthetic surface water chen et al 2019 li et al 2021 the microbial communities were mainly composed of 28 phyla except for unclassified bacteria in these samples as shown in fig 7 a proteobacteria 52 4 bacteroidota 24 4 chloroflexi 6 7 acidobacteriota 5 5 and actinobacteriota 2 2 were the dominant phyla in bf efs0 after long term operation the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased to 88 0 and 95 6 on 26 and 60 d respectively besides the relative abundance of γ proteobacteria class increased in bf efs60 compared to bf efs0 which are frequently observed in sulphonamide contaminated environments song et al 2019 the relative abundance of actinobacteriota also increased slightly in bf efs26 compared to that in bf efs0 which may be due to the application of an electric field fahey 2013 li et al 2021 it has been reported that five isolated strains which can degrade sulfonamides belong to actinobacteriota and proteobacteria respectively bouju et al 2012 sun et al 2019 furthermore similarity and overlap of phyla composition among different samples were analyzed caldisericota synergistota and spirochaetota existed in the sample of bf efs26 which were classified as others in bf efs0 due to low relative abundance caldisericota phylum may participate in the sulfur oxidation reaction aida et al 2014 in order to further clarify the variation of microbial communities during the operation the analysis at genus level was conducted with the results shown in circos diagram fig 7b the number of genera in bf efs26 decreased significantly compared to bf efs0 which is consistent with the results of α diversity analysis the circos diagram reflects the distribution proportion of dominant genera in each sample and the distribution proportion of each dominant genera among different samples as shown in fig 7b acinetobacter 40 was the dominant genus in bf efs60 and its relative abundances in bf efs26 and bf efs60 were significantly higher than bf efs0 it is reported that acinetobacter sp could degrade sulfonamide such as sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine having the potential for the bioremediation of sulfonamide polluted environments wang et al 2018b wang and wang 2018 zhang et al 2012 sa is the degradation intermediate of sulfonamides which may induce the enrichment of acinetobacter genus chen et al 2012 el ghenymy et al 2012 pereira et al 2011 however the removal efficiency of sa on 26 d was lower than that of 0 d in spite of the increased relative abundance of acinetobacter genus under 3 0 v the sa degradation on 0 d and 26 d was largely attributed to the electrochemical degradation compared to the overall sa degradation ratio in fig 2 while the biofouling was responsible for deteriorating the electrochemical performance of the electrode on 26 d as evidenced in fig 3 it has been reported that flavobacterium genus could utilize p nitrophenol as the sole carbon source and realize its mineralization arora et al 2014 raymond and alexander 1971 as shown in fig 7b flavobacterium genus was present in the biofilm after inoculation in other words benefits of biofouling were possibly present at the beginning of the experiment and the effect was associated with the abundance of functional microorganisms i e the degree of toxicity suppression was related to the microbial abundance the relative abundance of flavobacterium genus decreased in bf efs26 and increased in bf efs60 compared to bf efs0 fig s7 electro oxidation of sa in the efs resulted in the formation of degradation products p nitrophenol as shown in the following section offering carbon source to flavobacterium however deteriorated degradation efficiency of sa at 3 0 v may lead to reduced production of intermediates i e insufficient carbon source and consequently lower relative abundance of flavobacterium genus in bf efs26 this result implied that microorganisms flavobacterium responsible for toxicity suppression were more enriched at 4 0 v than that at 3 0 v and the synergetic effect on effluent toxicity suppression at 3 0 v was relatively weak due to both low degradation rate of sa and decreased relative abundance of flavobacterium genus fig s7 3 5 sa degradation pathway and toxicity suppression mechanisms the effluents from efs and bf efs were analyzed by lc ms ms to elucidate the degradation pathway of sa the total ion chromatograms tic of water samples fig s8 and the mass spectra ms of degradation products figs s9 s11 were obtained and the degradation pathway of sa was proposed fig 8 according to previous literature el ghenymy et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 hydroquinone and p benzoquinone are the two main aromatic products by dihydroxylation of sa in the electrochemical oxidation process however as shown in fig 8 p nitrophenol was detected in the effluent of efs before fouling the sulfonic acid group of sa was firstly replaced by a phenolic hydroxyl group and the amino group in para position was oxidized to nitro group it has been reported that the rat oral acute toxicity of p nitrophenol lc50 230 mg kg is higher than sa lc50 12 300 mg kg pubchem 2021a 2021b which may account for the increase in the effluent toxicity of efs except for aromatic product cis cis muconic acid was also detected in the effluent of efs which was further degraded into fumaric acid lc50 6800 mg kg pubchem 2021c however these three products and other characteristic products were not detected in the effluent from bf efs this implied that the electrochemical degradation products of sa were further degraded by the microorganisms in the biofouling layer which suppressed the effluent toxicity the mechanisms of toxicity suppression are proposed according to the above results the microorganisms in the influent gradually deposit on the electrode and develop a microbial community that can metabolize organic contaminants flow through operation leads to the enhancement of mass transfer of oxidation products on the electrode and then the enrichment of p nitrophenol degrading bacteria e g flavobacterium in the biofilm consequently electrogenerated toxic intermediate products are utilized by the microorganisms and the toxicity of efs effluent is decreased biofouling is always deemed to have negative impacts on water and wastewater treatment because this causes decline in permeate flux increase in operating pressure zhang et al 2020 and deterioration in electrochemical performance however it is interesting to note that biofouling in an efs may contribute to the suppression of effluent toxicity as a result of the synergetic effects of the microorganisms and electrochemical reactions fig 9 the porous cathode of efs is responsible for enriching the functional microorganisms during the development of biofilm which provides a new idea for the treatment of different types of wastewaters overall the appropriate amount of biofilm provides the synergetic effects but it would deteriorate the process performance such as a decrease in electrochemical degradation of the parent compound sa and an increase in tmp when the biofilm became too thick the key towards better utilization of the microorganisms is to maintain the optimal conditions by monitoring the effluent toxicity and operation pressure therefore adjusting the efs cleaning frequency carefully would be beneficial to control the growth rate of the biofouling layer which would be investigated in depth in our future study we believe that a precise control of microorganisms grown on the electrode would be beneficial to maintain high efficiency of efs whilst minimize the production of toxic byproducts 4 conclusions the degradation efficiency of sulfanilic acid sa in an efs was deteriorated during long term operation due to the occurrence of biofouling an increased voltage was less efficient to mitigate the electrode biofouling however after the development of biofilm on the cathode the luminescent bacteria inhibition effluent toxicity of efs effluent decreased from 72 3 to 40 2 with a similar phenomenon noted in the cytotoxicity assay the deterioration of electrode property after fouling indicated that the electrode itself was unlikely responsible for suppressing the effluent toxicity biofouling on the cathode with live microorganisms as the major contributors had the potential to play a considerable role in toxicity suppression the relative abundance of flavobacterium genus related to the degradation of p nitrophenol increased after fouling the proposed degradation pathway also showed that the microorganisms in the biofouling layer degraded the intermediate products therefore the synergetic effects of the electrode and microorganisms in the bio fouled efs resulted in efficient degradation of sa and suppression of effluent
