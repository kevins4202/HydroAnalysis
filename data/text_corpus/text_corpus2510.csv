12550,ciprofloxacin cip has been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems due to antibiotics abuse and its refractory which seriously affected public health and ecological safety herein we devised a photo electro fenton like pef like system for efficient removal of cip cubi2o4 bi2moo6 cbmo p n heterojunction composites were successfully fabricated through hydrothermal and solvothermal methods significantly cbmo composite catalysts were not only able to generate oh by the cu activation of h2o2 during electro fenton process the following synergistic effects in the photo fenton process simultaneously promoted the production of more oh the internal electric field ief in the p n heterojunction was conducive to the directional transfer of photogenerated electrons thus promoting the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers moreover photogenerated electrons could directly or indirectly activate h2o2 to yield more abundant oh thus improving photoelectric catalytic activity consequently the degradation efficiency of cip during pef like system was 97 4 in 90 min and the mineralization efficiency finally reached 78 5 in 180 min the prepared cubi2o4 bi2moo6 40 cbmo 40 possessed great stability and structural integrity after six consecutive cycles furthermore the cbmo 40 in pef like system showed superior performance for the removal of diverse antibiotics including quinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides which revealed the broad applicability of cbmo 40 for the antibiotics removal in pef like system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photo electro fenton like p n heterojunction ciprofloxacin internal electric field hydroxide radical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction being one of the second generation fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin cip is extensively used and even abused in medical agriculture animal husbandry and aquaculture due to its excellent broad spectrum antibacterial activity 1 2 due to the stable chemical structure of cip it is difficult to be completely metabolized and decomposed and it remains in various water environments which seriously threatens human health and the safety of global ecosystems 3 therefore it is imperative to develop effective treatment technologies to solve the cip pollution of aqueous environment fenton process is one of the most prospective advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment with the advantages of environmental friendliness superior degradation efficiency and facile reaction conditions 4 however the narrow ph range and the generation of ferric sludge restrict its wide applications to some extent 5 to overcome these drawbacks cu based electro fenton like ef like process was proposed during ef like process h2o2 can be continuously produced at the cathode by the two electron reduction of dissolved oxygen 6 afterwards h2o2 is further activated into oh with strong oxidizing ability by the low valence transition metal ions it is possible to achieve such efficient removal of antibiotics thanks to the non selective damage of most organic pollutants by oh which indicates that the efficient activation of h2o2 is of great significance to improve the degradation efficiency of pollutants 7 previous studies have reported that photogenerated electrons in photocatalysis are beneficial for the activation of h2o2 h2o2 e oh oh 8 9 moreover the generation of photogenerated holes and some other reactive oxygen species ros such as o2 and 1o2 in the photocatalysis pc process are also conducive to promote the oxidative decomposition of organic pollutants 10 11 hence it is theoretically feasible and potentially applicable to develop a novel photo electro fenton like pef like system for the efficient degradation of organic pollutants as a cu based p type semiconductor material copper bismuthate cubi2o4 is able to activate h2o2 in a wide ph range by participating in fenton like reactions through the redox of multivalent copper 12 in addition thanks to its narrow band gap near 1 8 ev 13 14 it can also achieve excellent visible light absorption however the pc efficiency of cubi2o4 alone is very low owing to the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers to obtain efficient separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs construction of heterostructures with suitable semiconductor materials is considered as a feasible method in particular p n heterojunction has received increasing attention since p type semiconductors and n type semiconductors exhibit large differences in work function which can lead to the formation of internal electric field ief in the composites 15 the establishment of ief allows electrons and holes to move in opposite directions thus enabling effective spatial separation of photogenerated carriers as an n type semiconductor with a layered structure bismuth molybdate bi2moo6 is seen as a promising photocatalyst because of its suitable energy band width non toxicity and tunable morphology 16 meanwhile the conduction band cb and the valence band vb energy level of bi2moo6 is positive than that of cubi2o4 17 such suitable band edge distribution facilitates the fabrication of heterojunction between cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 which could accelerate the migration and separation of the photogenerated carriers inspired by the above ideas we designed a novel pef like system with cubi2o4 bi2moo6 cbmo p n heterojunction catalyst to removal cip from wastewater efficiently the performance of the photoelectric synergistic degradation of cip in the pef like system was investigated in detail and it was also demonstrated that the ph range was extended compared to that of the conventional fenton system additionally the satisfactory stability of the cbmo p n heterojunction catalyst was confirmed by cycling experiments ultimately we also proposed the possible degradation mechanism and pathways in pef like process 2 experimental 2 1 materials all the

according to previous report with slight modifications 18 in details 0 2416 g cu no3 2 3h2o was added into 25 ml distilled water with continuous stirring for 15 min to fully dissolve the blue powder then 0 9701 g bi no3 3 5h2o was introduced into the above solution followed by stirring and ultrasound for 15 min separately the solution ph was regulated by slowly adding 5 ml 2 mol l 1 naoh solution under constant stirring during which the suspension gradually turned blue green color next the obtained solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and heated to 180 c for 5 h after the autoclave cooled naturally to room temperature the dark brown cubi2o4 precipitates were washed three times with distilled water and collected by centrifugation finally the obtained product was dried in a blast oven at 110 c 2 2 2 preparation of cbmo composites a series of cbmo catalysts were fabricated through solvothermal reactions 19 first 0 4851 g bi no3 3 5h2o and 0 1210 g na2moo4 2h2o were dissolved into 10 ml eg respectively which were labeled as solutions a and b next a certain amount of cubi2o4 was added into solution b and sonicated for 5 min to achieve uniform dispersion following that solution b was added dropwise to the above solution a and stirred for 15 min later 30 ml of ethanol was slowly mixed into above mixture after continuous stirring for 30 min the mixture was transferred to a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave heated to 160 c and maintained for 10 h the solution was naturally cooled to room temperature and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times by distilled water the resulting catalysts were finally dried overnight at 60 c in addition by tuning the mass of cubi2o4 added the mass ratio of cubi2o4 to bi2moo6 in the cbmo composites were 20 40 60 and were recorded as cbmo 20 cbmo 40 and cbmo 60 respectively 2 2 3 preparation of bi2moo6 the procedure for the synthesis of bi2moo6 was the same as the preparation of above composite catalysts except that cubi2o4 was not added 2 3 characterizations the morphologies of samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8010 and transmission electron microscope tem jeol jem 2100f the crystal structures and phase compositions were determined by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max 2200pc equipped with a cu kα radiation the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrum was recorded by an ft ir spectrometer thermo nicoletis5 via the kbr press method the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was performed on a quantachrome autosorb iq to calculate the specific surface area and pore distribution the element compositions and valence states were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a k alpha thermo fisher spectrometer using a monochromatic al kα x ray source photoluminescence pl spectra were measured on a fluorescence spectrometer f 7000 the uv 3600plus spectrophotometer was used to obtain uv vis diffuse reflection spectra uv vis drs of different samples high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms was conducted with a waters xevo tqs analyzer to identify the degradation intermediates the total organic carbon toc was analyzed on a shimadzu toc l cpn analyzer the leaching concentration of cu bi and mo ions after each cycle were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5110 2 4 degradation procedure a series of cip degradation experiments by pef like system were performed in a cubic quartz cell using a 300 w xenon lamp cel hxf300 λ 420 nm as light source the pt sheet and cf were used as anode and cathode respectively in addition the simulated wastewater was 50 mg l 1 cip in 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 solution and the initial ph was adjusted by adding 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 or naoh solution during pef like process 15 mg catalyst powder was dispersed into 70 ml cip solution under continuous stirring and pure oxygen was constantly injected into the suspension at a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the suspension was left in the dark for 30 min to attain adsorption equilibrium prior to the energization and illumination afterwards both light and electricity were turned on simultaneously and the degradation process continued for 1 5 h from the present moment within this period 2 ml of the sample solution was taken out at a specific time interval and the absorbance was measured at 276 nm by an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific genesys 180 to further calculate the degradation rate 2 5 photoelectrochemical measurements the photoelectrochemical performances of catalysts were tested by an electrochemical workstation chi760e equipped with a standard three electrode configuration the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and transient photocurrent responses of different samples were carried out in 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 electrolyte under ph 3 among all the tests the pt sheet and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively in eis test a catalyst modified glassy carbon electrode was served as the working electrode while the transient photocurrent response measurements were performed under alternating light on or off in which the catalyst coated fluorine doped tin oxide fto electrode acted as the working electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the prepared catalysts the synthesis steps of different catalysts were presented in fig 1a and the cbmo 40 heterojunction catalyst was obtained by successive hydrothermal as well as solvothermal methods sem was utilized to observe the morphology and microstructure of different samples the pristine bi2moo6 showed flower like microspheres with a diameter of around 1 μm which was assembled by two dimensional layered nanosheets in fig s1a as displayed in fig s1b the pure cubi2o4 exhibited cuboid rod like morphology with fairly smooth surface fig 1b and fig 1c demonstrated that the cbmo 40 possessed a unique three dimensional hierarchical structure with numerous bi2moo6 nanosheets interlaced growth on the surface of cubi2o4 as expected after combining these two monomers together the surface of nanocomposite became rough and there were few flower like microspheres of bi2moo6 in the vision while the morphology and size of cubi2o4 almost unchanged this result was attributed to the introduction of cubi2o4 which could serve as base materials during the growth of bi2moo6 and significantly inhibit the aggregation of bi2moo6 nanosheets 20 moreover cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 contacted tightly with each other by this means which in turn could increase specific surface areas to some extent and expose more surface active sites to participate in degradation reaction tem images of cbmo 40 in fig 1d and fig 1e presented that rod shape cubi2o4 was tightly coupled with bi2moo6 nanosheets and the high resolution image revealed the clear lattice fringes in fig 1f as expected the crystal lattice spacings of 0 194 and 0 275 nm were ascribed to the 202 and 200 planes of bi2moo6 21 and the lattice spacing of 0 318 nm was corresponded to 211 plane of cubi2o4 22 all the fringe spacings can be attributed to bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 revealing possible formation of heterostructure between bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 23 24 also as shown in fig s1c s1g the energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds elemental mapping images displayed that cu mo bi and o elements were evenly dispersed in cbmo 40 which firmly confirmed that the successful synthesis of the composite xrd was employed to study the crystalline phases and chemical compositions of the prepared catalysts as shown in fig 2a five peaks at 28 2 32 5 46 7 55 5 and 58 4 were assigned to the 131 200 202 133 and 262 planes pdf no 76 2388 of bi2moo6 25 individually the diffraction peaks of bare cubi2o4 centered at 20 9 28 0 33 3 46 7 53 0 55 6 60 7 63 7 and 66 1 were corresponding to 200 211 310 411 213 332 521 530 and 413 planes pdf no 72 0493 26 in addition all the characteristic diffraction peaks of the two monomers could be clearly observed in the cbmo heterojunction catalysts with different proportions indicating the successful combination of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 dramatically as the content of cubi2o4 increased the diffraction peak intensity of cubi2o4 gradually increased which was consistent with the change of monomer proportion in the composites ft ir was utilized to study the functional groups of cubi2o4 bi2moo6 and cbmo x composites fig 2b in all samples there were two broad peaks centered at around 3440 and 1620 cm 1 which were related to the oh stretching and bending vibration of surface adsorbed water 27 as for pristine cubi2o4 the sharp peak at 1385 cm 1 was indexed to bio stretching vibration 28 29 moreover the peaks at 547 and 526 cm 1 were assigned to the cuo stretching vibration 30 the main absorption peaks of bi2moo6 at 842 735 and 561 cm 1 were ascribed to the mo o mo bridging stretching vibration moo and bio stretching vibration 31 respectively notably these major peaks of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 were available in cbmo x composites proving the successful synthesis of heterojunction catalysts the specific surface areas and pore structures of different samples were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms according to the classification of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac all these three samples fig 2c exhibited typical type iv isotherms along with type h3 hysteresis loops in high relative pressure 32 indicating that there were mesoporous structures which could be further proved by the pore size distribution fig 2d 33 table s1 summarized the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size of bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 since the cubi2o4 was successfully combined with bi2moo6 the specific surface area of cbmo 40 was 31 9 m2 g 1 which was greatly increased compared with single cubi2o4 3 6 m2 g 1 benefiting from the larger specific surface area more active sites were supplied for the adsorption of pollutants in the degradation process thereby achieving efficient degradation of cip xps was performed to further determine the surface element compositions and corresponding chemical valence states of bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 as expected the survey scan spectrum of cbmo 40 fig s2 explicitly exhibited cu bi mo o and c elements indicating the coexistence of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 notably the c 1s peak from outside was utilized for calibration and the binding energies of all elements were corrected by the peak value of c 1s at 284 8 ev 34 in theory the shift of binding energy is strictly associated with the variation of electron cloud density which indicates the electron cloud density decreases when the binding energy increases and vice versa 35 in fig 3a the mo 3d spectrum of bi2moo6 was fitted into two peaks centered at 232 0 and 235 1 ev which corresponded to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 respectively belonging to mo6 after combining with cubi2o4 the correlation peaks of cbmo 40 showed a slight shift toward higher binding energy which meant that the electrons were transferred from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 in the cbmo 40 heterojunction as shown in fig 3b the fine spectra of cu 2p were divided into six peaks for cubi2o4 the two strong peaks located at 933 8 and 953 6 ev with spin orbit splitting of approximate 20 ev were indexed to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 respectively indicating the presence of cu2 36 and the two shake up satellites centered at 940 8 and 943 4 ev further confirmed the cu ions existed as bivalent state which was in consistent with previously reported results 37 in addition the other two peaks appearing at 932 1 and 951 7 ev were assigned to cu whose existence was related to oxygen vacancy it was considered that there was a defect species existed in the form of cu oxygen vacancy complex in cubi2o4 benefitting from the charge compensation effect of oxygen vacancy the valence of cu ion was reduced from 2 to 1 38 39 compared to cubi2o4 the binding energy of cu 2p peaks in cbmo 40 shifted to lower position which was in contrast to the trend of mo 3d peaks this phenomenon well verified the strong electronic interaction rather than a physical contact between cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 in the heterojunction in the xps spectra of the bi 4f region of all samples fig 3c the two individual peaks at approximately 158 8 and 164 1 ev were ascribed to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 reflecting bi existed as the form of bi3 40 the o 1s spectra of cubi2o4 bi2moo6 and cbmo 40 were displayed in fig 3d in which the broad asymmetric o 1s spectra could be divided into three peaks located at around 529 9 531 3 and 532 3 ev typically the peaks at the higher binding energy and the lower binding energy could be attributed to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups and the lattice oxygen separately what s more the peaks located at about 531 3 ev were assigned to the presence of oxygen vacancies 20 28 it is clearly that the bi 4f peaks and o 1s peaks of cbmo 40 were centered between that of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 which further proved the successful construction of cbmo 40 heterojunction consequently we could infer that there was a directional electron transfer from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 on the cbmo interface leading to the establishment of an ief which was conducive to the migration of photogenerated electrons in cubi2o4 across the interface to bi2moo6 41 3 2 evaluation of the cip degradation performance with different catalysts in the preparation process of composite materials only a proper proportion of monomers could be combined with each other to realize the tight coupling of contact surfaces therefore the ratio between monomers played an important role in the degradation effect of composite catalysts accordingly we tested different composite catalysts for the degradation of cip to find out the optimum compound ratio as shown in fig s3a the degradation efficiency tended to first increase and then decreased with the increase of cubi2o4 content meanwhile cbmo 40 showed the most exceptional degradation of cip especially for the first 30 min and eventually reached 97 4 in 90 min in regards to dynamics the above degradation process followed the rule of pseudo first order kinetics as shown in fig 4a and fig 4b cbmo 40 featured the largest rate constant k 0 04036 min 1 which was 3 2 1 1 1 3 and 1 6 times higher than that of bi2moo6 cbmo 20 cbmo 60 and cubi2o4 respectively furthermore toc analysis fig s3b showed that the mineralization rate of cip with cbmo 40 78 5 was higher than that of cubi2o4 64 8 and bi2moo6 44 1 in 180 min consequently we chose cbmo 40 as the optimal catalyst for further study in order to explain that the formation of cbmo 40 was accomplished by successfully constructing a heterojunction between bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 rather than simple physical mixing two monomers that in specific mass ratio were jointly added to the reaction system for cip degradation as shown in fig s3c the system consisting of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 mechanically mixed at a ratio of 40 showed limited degradation efficiency and was much lower than that of cbmo 40 within 90 min this phenomenon was exactly a powerful indication that cbmo 40 was not mechanically mixed but formed a heterostructure which facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs it is recognized that ph plays an essential role in the catalytic activity of fenton catalysts therefore it is of great significance to consider the influence of the initial ph of solution on the degradation rate of cip by cbmo 40 in the pef like system we adjusted the initial ph in the range of 2 6 by using 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 or 0 5 mol l 1 naoh solution the degradation rate fluctuated widely in the first 30 min at different ph values in fig s3d as the reaction progressed the degradation efficiency continued to rise and the gaps were narrowing but there was still a fairly distinct difference at different ph values during the final 90 min among all the ph conditions tested the degradation efficiency of cip was maximum at ph 3 which was due to the acidic environment being more conducive to the generation of h2o2 o2 2h 2e h2o2 42 hence it was quite understandable that the degradation of cip was inhibited under more alkaline conditions with the initial ph increasing the acidic ambience weakened so that the two electron reduction of o2 to produce h2o2 was probably limited while the decomposition of h2o2 to produce oh may also be hindered which also seriously impacted the degradation of cip nevertheless as the acidity of the reaction solution was further enhanced the removal efficiency still did not further improve it was possibly on account of the large amount of h in the solution preferring to form the more stable h3o2 by reacting with h2o2 43 to summarize the optimal ph in this novel pef like system was 3 and the ph range of the system with cbmo 40 as the photoelectric catalyst was broadened to some extent compared to the conventional fenton method it was precisely the synergistic photoelectric effect that could bring out such an impressive degradation property in the pef like system thus we further evidenced this by taking cbmo 40 in different systems the pseudo first order kinetic curves of different systems were illustrated in fig 4c and corresponding kinetic constants were offered in the inset apparently the rate constant of pef like system was higher than that of other two systems proving the best catalytic performance of pef like system also the reaction rate of the pef like system was 237 0 and 1 4 times faster than that of pc system and ef like system respectively as we can see clearly in fig s3e the pef like system presented better catalytic activity than the other two systems in particular during the first 30 min the degradation efficiency in the pef like system was 75 6 which was approximately 30 0 and 70 0 higher than that in the ef like system and pc system respectively thereby we can definitely infer that the high catalytic activity of cbmo 40 was perfectly realized by the synergistic effect of light and electricity in the pef like system to exclude the influence of each adsorption factor we conducted different adsorption experiments as shown in fig 4d the contribution of electro adsorption physical adsorption and anodic oxidation ao process to cip removal was relatively weak which further suggested the outstanding performance of the pef like system moreover as shown in fig s3f the excellent degradation efficiencies of tc 95 7 cip 97 4 enr 96 2 pfx 94 2 and smx 92 5 under the same conditions strongly confirmed the broad applicability of the prepared cbmo 40 to quinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides antibiotics 3 3 band structures and optical properties of different catalysts uv vis drs was implemented to investigate the light absorption properties and band gaps of cubi2o4 bi2moo6 and cbmo 40 then we could further discuss the important role of heterojunction formation in the light harvesting process fig 5a showed both bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 could absorb solar energy from ultraviolet to visible light regions and the absorption band edges were located at around 460 and 700 nm respectively compared with bare bi2moo6 the absorption band of cbmo 40 heterojunction displayed an obvious red shift after coupling bi2moo6 with cubi2o4 which attributed to the addition of narrow band gap cubi2o4 expanded the optical absorption range of bi2moo6 44 moreover cbmo 40 achieved more intensive absorptions in ultraviolet region in comparison with cubi2o4 which also implied that bi2moo6 had been successfully combined with cubi2o4 the band gap energies of bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 were calculated by kubelka munk function eq 1 as follows 1 αhν a hν e g n 2 where α h v a and e g represent the absorption coefficient planck constant irradiation frequency absorption constant and band gap energy respectively meanwhile the value of n depended on the optical transition type the direct band gap semiconductor corresponded to n value of 1 and the indirect band gap semiconductor was 4 45 hence the n values of all catalysts were both taken as 1 and the values of e g could be estimated from the tauc plot in fig 5b the band gaps were determined to be 2 72 1 78 and 2 66 ev for bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 respectively in fig 5c and fig 5d mott schottky curves were employed to estimate the band potential of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 the bi2moo6 with a positive curve slope was an n type semiconductor while the curve slope of cubi2o4 was negative demonstrating that it was a p type semiconductor specially in fig s4a the mott schottky plot of cbmo 40 exhibited an inverted v shape which confirmed that cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 successfully constructed the p n heterojunction 46 generally the vb position of p type semiconductors was 0 1 0 3 ev lower than that of flat band as well as the cb position of n type semiconductors was 0 1 0 3 ev higher than that of flat band 47 the flat band potentials e fb of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 were 0 28 and 1 01 ev vs nhe respectively therefore the vb potential e vb of cubi2o4 and the cb potential e cb of bi2moo6 were calculated as 1 21 and 0 48 ev vs nhe respectively in addition the cb and vb energy levels could be determined by the following equation eq 2 2 e g e vb e cb as a result the cb value of cubi2o4 and the vb value of bi2moo6 were calculated to be 0 57 and 2 24 ev vs nhe separately which were consistent with the results of the valence band xps vb xps analysis in fig s4c and fig s4d based on the above results the energy band structures of both semiconductors were obtained and presented in fig s4b surprisingly there were suitable band structures for them to construct p n heterostructure since the vb and cb positions of bi2moo6 were positive than that of cubi2o4 to further illustrate the specific recombination and separation behavior of photo induced charge carriers several photoelectrochemical measurements such as pl spectroscopy transient photocurrent response test and eis were carried out theoretically the lower characteristic peak intensity of pl spectrum the better separation effect of photogenerated carriers in other words the lower recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes on the contrary the higher recombination of photogenerated carriers was on behalf of the lower photocatalytic activity of the catalyst from fig 5e single bi2moo6 possessed the strongest emission intensity indicating the highest recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs meanwhile a series of cbmo x composites exhibited distinctly quenched pl signals in contrast with bi2moo6 which strongly inferred that the construction of heterojunction was of great significance for effectively inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated carriers among composite samples cbmo 40 showed the lowest emission intensity which confirmed the most effective carrier separation behaviors additionally cubi2o4 displayed the lowest emission intensity among these materials but the degradation efficiency of cip wasn t the best the reason was that cubi2o4 showed low excitation light response which led to less photogenerated electron hole pairs and this phenomenon had been mentioned in previous reports 20 48 it was generally accepted that the smaller semicircle diameter in eis nyquist plot signified the lower electron transfer resistance as displayed in fig 5f cbmo 40 exhibited the smallest semicircle diameter compared with the two semiconductor monomers demonstrating the lowest interface charge transfer resistance of cbmo 40 heterojunction transient photocurrent response was carried out with the light continuous alternating on and off as illustrated in fig s5 it was clear that cbmo 40 performed a higher photocurrent intensity than that of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 further highlighting that the heterojunction interface between bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 was beneficial to facilitate the fast separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers 3 4 separation mechanism of photogenerated carriers in cbmo 40 the above xps results mentioned that the binding energies of cu 2p o 1s and bi 2p of cbmo 40 became more negative compared to cubi2o4 in contrast the binding energies of mo 2p o 1s and bi 2p of cbmo 40 were more positive than those of bi2moo6 all above phenomena were attributed to the transfer of electrons from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 through the interface of heterojunction consequently the interface region near bi2moo6 was positively charged because of the donation of electrons whereas the interface region close to cubi2o4 was negatively charged as it acquires electrons verifying the construction of an ief that pointing from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 fig s6a and fig s6b mott schottky results also proved the formation of the above mentioned ief and further revealed the transfer mechanism of photogenerated carriers in p n heterojunction previous reports have indicated that e fb denoted the fermi level position of the semiconductor relative to the reference electrode potential 47 49 since the e fb values of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 were 1 01 and 0 28 ev respectively as soon as bi2moo6 combined with cubi2o4 to construct a p n heterojunction the electrons would spontaneously flow across the interface from bi2moo6 with high fermi level to cubi2o4 with low fermi level until the thermodynamic and fermi level equilibrium was established 20 50 under equilibrium an electron depletion accumulation layer would be established at the interface of cbmo heterojunction where bi2moo6 was positively charged and cubi2o4 was negatively charged leading to the formation of a strong ief with the direction from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 it was consistent with the results confirmed by xps analysis in addition the band edge of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 would bend upward and downward 51 which provided a strong driving force to promote the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes according to above analysis a reasonable type ii separation mechanism of photogenerated carriers over cbmo p n heterojunction was proposed in fig s6c under visible light irradiation both cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 could generate photogenerated electrons that jumped from their vbs to cbs leaving holes in vbs driven by the ief at the interface and the bending band the photogenerated electrons in the cb of cubi2o4 were spontaneously transferred to the cb of bi2moo6 and the photogenerated holes were automatically accumulated in the cb of cubi2o4 which effectively inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers 3 5 mechanism of the pef like system with cbmo 40 free radical trapping experiments were conducted to investigate the kinds of reactive species present and their contribution in the pef like system various reactive species were captured by the specific radical scavengers of which k2cr2o7 cr vi triethanolamine teoa 52 53 isopropanol ipa p benzoquinone pbq 54 and catalase were utilized to trap e h oh o2 and h2o2 respectively in fig 6a the removal process of cip was remarkably restricted upon the addition of catalase and ipa within 90 min the degradation efficiency showed a dramatic decrease to 31 2 and 34 4 respectively which also demonstrated the crucial role of h2o2 as well as oh moreover o2 also exhibited relatively strong inhibition with a total degradation efficiency of 52 2 suggesting that o2 also made a significant contribution to the removal of cip after adding cr vi to capture e the terminal degradation efficiency was moderately inhibited to 76 8 illustrating the fact that photoexcited electrons were also essential for the degradation of cip to some extent nevertheless the decomposition rate of cip descended slightly in the presence of teoa and the minimum change may be due to the weak oxidation capacity of h to sum up oh o2 e and h coexisted in the pef like system and they synergistically catalyzed to achieve such superior removal performance especially oh played the most prominent role among them in order to check the capability of activate h2o2 to produce oh by variable valence metals in heterojunction catalyst the trapping experiment of oh was carried out using cubi2o4 as electrocatalyst in ef like process as shown in fig 6b the degradation efficiency dramatically decreased after introducing ipa to the system proving that cubi2o4 could indeed decompose h2o2 into oh with the redox reaction between cu and cu2 electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement was carried out to detect the active radicals involved in different degradation processes in which 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo was applied to trap oh and o2 normally the intensity of the esr signal is proportional to the amount of free radicals generated 55 as depicted in fig 6c it was clear that the intensity of dmpo oh characteristic peaks for pef like process was the highest indicating that the photoelectric synergy function was able to provide more oh in the pef like system particularly there were no dmpo oh peaks during pc process which precisely corroborated the type ii transfer mechanism of photogenerated electrons in p n heterojunction in fig 6d the intensity of dmpo o2 was lower for ef like process and pc process while the pef like process exhibited the highest peak intensity which was further proved that more o2 were generated above epr test results provided good evidence that the photoelectric synergy of pef like system could generate more reactive radicals that were conducive to the efficient degradation of cip it is widely accepted that h2o2 plays an indispensable role in fenton like process thus the concentrations of h2o2 were monitored during the pef like and ef like processes with the presence of cbmo 40 following the conventional ce so4 2 titration method 56 and the results were shown in fig s7 during initial 15 min the h2o2 concentration increased rapidly due to the efficient conversion of o2 into large amounts of h2o2 at cathode subsequently the h2o2 concentration continued to rise but the accumulation rate obviously declined as a result of the continuous activation of h2o2 to produce oh for the oxidation of cip and the generation was always faster than decomposition noteworthily the h2o2 concentration in pef like process was always lower than that of ef like process throughout the degradation process fully proving that the concurrent activation of h2o2 by photogenerated electrons and cu in the pef like system which consumed more h2o2 to produced more ross it was consistent with the results of degradation experiments in different systems by comprehensively analyzing the above results a logical photoelectric synergistic catalytic mechanism for cip degradation by cbmo 40 in the pef like system was proposed in fig 7 at first dissolved oxygen acquired two electrons to yield h2o2 on the surface of cathode eq 3 then cu could decompose h2o2 into oh eq 4 in addition h2o2 could also combined with cu2 and oh which was a crucial source for generating o2 57 58 eq 5 and eq 6 as soon as the xenon lamp was turned on photogenerated electrons of both p type cubi2o4 and n type bi2moo6 were excited from vb to cb and left photogenerated holes in vb eq 7 motivated by the ief and the bending band photogenerated electrons on the cb of cubi2o4 migrated simultaneously to the cb of bi2moo6 likewise photogenerated holes transferred from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 realizing effective spatial separation of photogenerated carriers as the e vb of cubi2o4 was less positive than that of oh h2o 2 38 ev vs nhe 59 the holes accumulated in the vb of cubi2o4 only contributed weakly to direct oxidation of cip rather than reacting with h2o to form oh nevertheless the photogenerated electrons are capable of reducing o2 to produce o2 since bi2moo6 has a more negative e cb than o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe 60 eq 8 the conversion between copper ions could also accomplish by capturing a photogenerated electron eq 9 what s more photogenerated electrons were also participated in the activation of h2o2 which was also a crucial way to generate oh 61 eq 10 the photoelectrons were continuous consumed thereby promoting the effective separation of photogenerated carriers finally the abundant active species of oh o2 e and h were available to decompose cip molecules into co2 h2o and inorganic ions via photoelectric synergistic catalysis eq 11 consequently leading to the efficient mineralization of cip 3 o 2 2e 2h h 2 o 2 4 h 2

pathways of cip in order to identify the degradation pathways of cip in pef like system hplc ms analysis was applied to determine the intermediates of cip the mass and charge m z of the intermediate products and corresponding molecular structures were listed in table s2 three possible degradation pathways were proposed and illustrated in fig 8 pathway i was initiated by the cleavage of the piperazine ring of cip and the intermediate a m z 362 with dialdehyde derivative structure was firstly obtained then the intermediate a lost one of the formaldehyde groups to form the intermediate b m z 334 further removal of the second formaldehyde group resulted in a transformation from the intermediate b to the intermediate c m z 306 62 subsequently compounds d m z 291 and e m z 263 were derived by dropping a secondary amine nitrogen further oxidation and loosing formaldehyde along the amine side chain leading to the complete decomposition of piperazine ring 63 followed by defluorination reaction the intermediate f m z 245 was finally generated as for pathway ii oh attacked the quinolone ring and produced the intermediate g m z 348 after an addition reaction 64 following the release of the carboxyl group the intermediate g was converted to the intermediate h m z 304 which could be further degraded to the intermediate i m z 288 by removing of hydroxyl group from the quinolone ring 65 after that intermediate i suffered from hydroxyl substitution reaction loss of carbonyl oxygen and further oxidation of quinolone ring as well as piperazine ring yielding three intermediates of j m z 286 k m z 274 and l m z 227 66 respectively initially the hydroxyl group substituted the fluorine atom on the benzene ring of cip to form the intermediate m m z 330 in pathway iii and the intermediate n m z 314 was obtained after the loss of hydroxyl group on the intermediate m as the degradation reaction continued the intermediates were further degraded into other small molecules and mineralized to form h2o and co2 3 7 stability of pef like system with cbmo 40 for practical applications the stability of the catalyst is one of the most essential factors thus we performed cycling experiments to investigate the recyclability of cbmo 40 as shown in fig s8a the degradation efficiency of cip still maintained 89 9 after four cycles and then decreased to 83 6 in sixth consecutive cycles within 90 min proving the good reusability of cbmo 40 in pef like system the gradually decrease of degradation efficiency might be attributed to the catalyst active sites being occupied by organic compounds and the loss of the active metal components throughout the reaction 67 it was also inevitable that artificial loss of catalysts during recycling process in addition the leaching concentrations of cu bi and mo ions after each cycle were also observed by icp oes depicted in fig s8b and table s3 listed the specific leaching values of cu bi and mo ions the leaching cu ion concentration was 1 mg l 1 in each cycle which was always far below the governmental standard 1 mg l 1 for emission of pollutants in china 68 it was calculated that cu loss of cbmo 40 after six cycles was only approximately 1 0 wt fully demonstrating the excellent stability of cbmo 40 furthermore compared with other systems table s4 pef like process with cbmo in our work exhibited an excellent performance in terms of both the degradation efficiency and cyclic stability in order to further demonstrate the stability of the heterostructure the phase composition and surface elemental content of cbmo 40 before and after the reaction were analyzed by xrd and xps respectively in fig s8c and fig s8d all the characteristic peaks remained almost unchanged before and after the reaction which also strongly suggested that the cbmo 40 heterojunction presented superior structural stability during pef like process to verify the potential of this work for application in real water environments we also carried out cip degradation experiments in pef like system with different water samples and results were shown in fig s9 it was evident that the removal rates of cip in seawater distilled water and oil produced water were 92 0 97 4 and 95 3 respectively the lower degradation rate may be due to the influence of natural organic matter and background ions in natural water 69 surprisingly the degradation efficiency of cip in oil produced water was very fast in the early time which may because the presence of cu fe mn and ni ions in the solution can accelerate the fenton like reaction 70 the results showed that the pef like system was able to remove most of the cip from different real water samples it was much suitable to apply pef like system to remove cip in water 4 conclusions in summary the hydrothermal and solvothermal methods were utilized to successfully prepare a series of cbmo p n heterojunction catalysts for cip removal in pef like process cbmo 40 exhibited the best catalytic activity which attributed to the fact that it featured the smallest interfacial charge transfer resistance and the strongest photocurrent response besides the formation of ief contributed to the successful construction of p n heterojunction thus achieving the effective separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs then multiple active species like oh o2 e and h were produced and used for the efficient degradation of cip under the synergistic operation of photoelectricity finally the pef like system demonstrated the most excellent degradation efficiency within 90 min and the corresponding kinetic constant was 237 0 and 1 4 times higher than that of pc and ef like systems separately the results of quenching experiments and epr analysis demonstrated that oh played a major role in pef like system and the possible degradation mechanism was put forward based on the hplc ms data three possible pathways for cip degradation were also proposed finally the excellent stability of cbmo 40 catalyst during pef like process was tested by six consecutive cycling experiments therefore this pef like system with p n heterojunction catalysts was a promising way to deal with cip in

12550,ciprofloxacin cip has been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems due to antibiotics abuse and its refractory which seriously affected public health and ecological safety herein we devised a photo electro fenton like pef like system for efficient removal of cip cubi2o4 bi2moo6 cbmo p n heterojunction composites were successfully fabricated through hydrothermal and solvothermal methods significantly cbmo composite catalysts were not only able to generate oh by the cu activation of h2o2 during electro fenton process the following synergistic effects in the photo fenton process simultaneously promoted the production of more oh the internal electric field ief in the p n heterojunction was conducive to the directional transfer of photogenerated electrons thus promoting the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers moreover photogenerated electrons could directly or indirectly activate h2o2 to yield more abundant oh thus improving photoelectric catalytic activity consequently the degradation efficiency of cip during pef like system was 97 4 in 90 min and the mineralization efficiency finally reached 78 5 in 180 min the prepared cubi2o4 bi2moo6 40 cbmo 40 possessed great stability and structural integrity after six consecutive cycles furthermore the cbmo 40 in pef like system showed superior performance for the removal of diverse antibiotics including quinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides which revealed the broad applicability of cbmo 40 for the antibiotics removal in pef like system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photo electro fenton like p n heterojunction ciprofloxacin internal electric field hydroxide radical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction being one of the second generation fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin cip is extensively used and even abused in medical agriculture animal husbandry and aquaculture due to its excellent broad spectrum antibacterial activity 1 2 due to the stable chemical structure of cip it is difficult to be completely metabolized and decomposed and it remains in various water environments which seriously threatens human health and the safety of global ecosystems 3 therefore it is imperative to develop effective treatment technologies to solve the cip pollution of aqueous environment fenton process is one of the most prospective advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment with the advantages of environmental friendliness superior degradation efficiency and facile reaction conditions 4 however the narrow ph range and the generation of ferric sludge restrict its wide applications to some extent 5 to overcome these drawbacks cu based electro fenton like ef like process was proposed during ef like process h2o2 can be continuously produced at the cathode by the two electron reduction of dissolved oxygen 6 afterwards h2o2 is further activated into oh with strong oxidizing ability by the low valence transition metal ions it is possible to achieve such efficient removal of antibiotics thanks to the non selective damage of most organic pollutants by oh which indicates that the efficient activation of h2o2 is of great significance to improve the degradation efficiency of pollutants 7 previous studies have reported that photogenerated electrons in photocatalysis are beneficial for the activation of h2o2 h2o2 e oh oh 8 9 moreover the generation of photogenerated holes and some other reactive oxygen species ros such as o2 and 1o2 in the photocatalysis pc process are also conducive to promote the oxidative decomposition of organic pollutants 10 11 hence it is theoretically feasible and potentially applicable to develop a novel photo electro fenton like pef like system for the efficient degradation of organic pollutants as a cu based p type semiconductor material copper bismuthate cubi2o4 is able to activate h2o2 in a wide ph range by participating in fenton like reactions through the redox of multivalent copper 12 in addition thanks to its narrow band gap near 1 8 ev 13 14 it can also achieve excellent visible light absorption however the pc efficiency of cubi2o4 alone is very low owing to the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers to obtain efficient separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs construction of heterostructures with suitable semiconductor materials is considered as a feasible method in particular p n heterojunction has received increasing attention since p type semiconductors and n type semiconductors exhibit large differences in work function which can lead to the formation of internal electric field ief in the composites 15 the establishment of ief allows electrons and holes to move in opposite directions thus enabling effective spatial separation of photogenerated carriers as an n type semiconductor with a layered structure bismuth molybdate bi2moo6 is seen as a promising photocatalyst because of its suitable energy band width non toxicity and tunable morphology 16 meanwhile the conduction band cb and the valence band vb energy level of bi2moo6 is positive than that of cubi2o4 17 such suitable band edge distribution facilitates the fabrication of heterojunction between cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 which could accelerate the migration and separation of the photogenerated carriers inspired by the above ideas we designed a novel pef like system with cubi2o4 bi2moo6 cbmo p n heterojunction catalyst to removal cip from wastewater efficiently the performance of the photoelectric synergistic degradation of cip in the pef like system was investigated in detail and it was also demonstrated that the ph range was extended compared to that of the conventional fenton system additionally the satisfactory stability of the cbmo p n heterojunction catalyst was confirmed by cycling experiments ultimately we also proposed the possible degradation mechanism and pathways in pef like process 2 experimental 2 1 materials all the

tianjin heowns biochem technology co ltd the carbon felt cf was provided by shanghai qijie carbon material co ltd 2 2 fabrication of catalysts 2 2 1 preparation of cubi2o4 cubi2o4 was synthesized according to previous report with slight modifications 18 in details 0 2416 g cu no3 2 3h2o was added into 25 ml distilled water with continuous stirring for 15 min to fully dissolve the blue powder then 0 9701 g bi no3 3 5h2o was introduced into the above solution followed by stirring and ultrasound for 15 min separately the solution ph was regulated by slowly adding 5 ml 2 mol l 1 naoh solution under constant stirring during which the suspension gradually turned blue green color next the obtained solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and heated to 180 c for 5 h after the autoclave cooled naturally to room temperature the dark brown cubi2o4 precipitates were washed three times with distilled water and collected by centrifugation finally the obtained product was dried in a blast oven at 110 c 2 2 2 preparation of cbmo composites a series of cbmo catalysts were fabricated through solvothermal reactions 19 first 0 4851 g bi no3 3 5h2o and 0 1210 g na2moo4 2h2o were dissolved into 10 ml eg respectively which were labeled as solutions a and b next a certain amount of cubi2o4 was added into solution b and sonicated for 5 min to achieve uniform dispersion following that solution b was added dropwise to the above solution a and stirred for 15 min later 30 ml of ethanol was slowly mixed into above mixture after continuous stirring for 30 min the mixture was transferred to a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave heated to 160 c and maintained for 10 h the solution was naturally cooled to room temperature and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times by distilled water the resulting catalysts were finally dried overnight at 60 c in addition by tuning the mass of cubi2o4 added the mass ratio of cubi2o4 to bi2moo6 in the cbmo composites were 20 40 60 and were recorded as cbmo 20 cbmo 40 and cbmo 60 respectively 2 2 3 preparation of bi2moo6 the procedure for the synthesis of bi2moo6 was the same as the preparation of above composite catalysts except that cubi2o4 was not added 2 3 characterizations the morphologies of samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8010 and transmission electron microscope tem jeol jem 2100f the crystal structures and phase compositions were determined by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max 2200pc equipped with a cu kα radiation the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrum was recorded by an ft ir spectrometer thermo nicoletis5 via the kbr press method the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was performed on a quantachrome autosorb iq to calculate the specific surface area and pore distribution the element compositions and valence states were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a k alpha thermo fisher spectrometer using a monochromatic al kα x ray source photoluminescence pl spectra were measured on a fluorescence spectrometer f 7000 the uv 3600plus spectrophotometer was used to obtain uv vis diffuse reflection spectra uv vis drs of different samples high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms was conducted with a waters xevo tqs analyzer to identify the degradation intermediates the total organic carbon toc was analyzed on a shimadzu toc l cpn analyzer the leaching concentration of cu bi and mo ions after each cycle were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5110 2 4 degradation procedure a series of cip degradation experiments by pef like system were performed in a cubic quartz cell using a 300 w xenon lamp cel hxf300 λ 420 nm as light source the pt sheet and cf were used as anode and cathode respectively in addition the simulated wastewater was 50 mg l 1 cip in 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 solution and the initial ph was adjusted by adding 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 or naoh solution during pef like process 15 mg catalyst powder was dispersed into 70 ml cip solution under continuous stirring and pure oxygen was constantly injected into the suspension at a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the suspension was left in the dark for 30 min to attain adsorption equilibrium prior to the energization and illumination afterwards both light and electricity were turned on simultaneously and the degradation process continued for 1 5 h from the present moment within this period 2 ml of the sample solution was taken out at a specific time interval and the absorbance was measured at 276 nm by an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific genesys 180 to further calculate the degradation rate 2 5 photoelectrochemical measurements the photoelectrochemical performances of catalysts were tested by an electrochemical workstation chi760e equipped with a standard three electrode configuration the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and transient photocurrent responses of different samples were carried out in 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 electrolyte under ph 3 among all the tests the pt sheet and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively in eis test a catalyst modified glassy carbon electrode was served as the working electrode while the transient photocurrent response measurements were performed under alternating light on or off in which the catalyst coated fluorine doped tin oxide fto electrode acted as the working electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the prepared catalysts the synthesis steps of different catalysts were presented in fig 1a and the cbmo 40 heterojunction catalyst was obtained by successive hydrothermal as well as solvothermal methods sem was utilized to observe the morphology and microstructure of different samples the pristine bi2moo6 showed flower like microspheres with a diameter of around 1 μm which was assembled by two dimensional layered nanosheets in fig s1a as displayed in fig s1b the pure cubi2o4 exhibited cuboid rod like morphology with fairly smooth surface fig 1b and fig 1c demonstrated that the cbmo 40 possessed a unique three dimensional hierarchical structure with numerous bi2moo6 nanosheets interlaced growth on the surface of cubi2o4 as expected after combining these two monomers together the surface of nanocomposite became rough and there were few flower like microspheres of bi2moo6 in the vision while the morphology and size of cubi2o4 almost unchanged this result was attributed to the introduction of cubi2o4 which could serve as base materials during the growth of bi2moo6 and significantly inhibit the aggregation of bi2moo6 nanosheets 20 moreover cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 contacted tightly with each other by this means which in turn could increase specific surface areas to some extent and expose more surface active sites to participate in degradation reaction tem images of cbmo 40 in fig 1d and fig 1e presented that rod shape cubi2o4 was tightly coupled with bi2moo6 nanosheets and the high resolution image revealed the clear lattice fringes in fig 1f as expected the crystal lattice spacings of 0 194 and 0 275 nm were ascribed to the 202 and 200 planes of bi2moo6 21 and the lattice spacing of 0 318 nm was corresponded to 211 plane of cubi2o4 22 all the fringe spacings can be attributed to bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 revealing possible formation of heterostructure between bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 23 24 also as shown in fig s1c s1g the energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds elemental mapping images displayed that cu mo bi and o elements were evenly dispersed in cbmo 40 which firmly confirmed that the successful synthesis of the composite xrd was employed to study the crystalline phases and chemical compositions of the prepared catalysts as shown in fig 2a five peaks at 28 2 32 5 46 7 55 5 and 58 4 were assigned to the 131 200 202 133 and 262 planes pdf no 76 2388 of bi2moo6 25 individually the diffraction peaks of bare cubi2o4 centered at 20 9 28 0 33 3 46 7 53 0 55 6 60 7 63 7 and 66 1 were corresponding to 200 211 310 411 213 332 521 530 and 413 planes pdf no 72 0493 26 in addition all the characteristic diffraction peaks of the two monomers could be clearly observed in the cbmo heterojunction catalysts with different proportions indicating the successful combination of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 dramatically as the content of cubi2o4 increased the diffraction peak intensity of cubi2o4 gradually increased which was consistent with the change of monomer proportion in the composites ft ir was utilized to study the functional groups of cubi2o4 bi2moo6 and cbmo x composites fig 2b in all samples there were two broad peaks centered at around 3440 and 1620 cm 1 which were related to the oh stretching and bending vibration of surface adsorbed water 27 as for pristine cubi2o4 the sharp peak at 1385 cm 1 was indexed to bio stretching vibration 28 29 moreover the peaks at 547 and 526 cm 1 were assigned to the cuo stretching vibration 30 the main absorption peaks of bi2moo6 at 842 735 and 561 cm 1 were ascribed to the mo o mo bridging stretching vibration moo and bio stretching vibration 31 respectively notably these major peaks of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 were available in cbmo x composites proving the successful synthesis of heterojunction catalysts the specific surface areas and pore structures of different samples were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms according to the classification of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac all these three samples fig 2c exhibited typical type iv isotherms along with type h3 hysteresis loops in high relative pressure 32 indicating that there were mesoporous structures which could be further proved by the pore size distribution fig 2d 33 table s1 summarized the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size of bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 since the cubi2o4 was successfully combined with bi2moo6 the specific surface area of cbmo 40 was 31 9 m2 g 1 which was greatly increased compared with single cubi2o4 3 6 m2 g 1 benefiting from the larger specific surface area more active sites were supplied for the adsorption of pollutants in the degradation process thereby achieving efficient degradation of cip xps was performed to further determine the surface element compositions and corresponding chemical valence states of bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 as expected the survey scan spectrum of cbmo 40 fig s2 explicitly exhibited cu bi mo o and c elements indicating the coexistence of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 notably the c 1s peak from outside was utilized for calibration and the binding energies of all elements were corrected by the peak value of c 1s at 284 8 ev 34 in theory the shift of binding energy is strictly associated with the variation of electron cloud density which indicates the electron cloud density decreases when the binding energy increases and vice versa 35 in fig 3a the mo 3d spectrum of bi2moo6 was fitted into two peaks centered at 232 0 and 235 1 ev which corresponded to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 respectively belonging to mo6 after combining with cubi2o4 the correlation peaks of cbmo 40 showed a slight shift toward higher binding energy which meant that the electrons were transferred from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 in the cbmo 40 heterojunction as shown in fig 3b the fine spectra of cu 2p were divided into six peaks for cubi2o4 the two strong peaks located at 933 8 and 953 6 ev with spin orbit splitting of approximate 20 ev were indexed to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 respectively indicating the presence of cu2 36 and the two shake up satellites centered at 940 8 and 943 4 ev further confirmed the cu ions existed as bivalent state which was in consistent with previously reported results 37 in addition the other two peaks appearing at 932 1 and 951 7 ev were assigned to cu whose existence was related to oxygen vacancy it was considered that there was a defect species existed in the form of cu oxygen vacancy complex in cubi2o4 benefitting from the charge compensation effect of oxygen vacancy the valence of cu ion was reduced from 2 to 1 38 39 compared to cubi2o4 the binding energy of cu 2p peaks in cbmo 40 shifted to lower position which was in contrast to the trend of mo 3d peaks this phenomenon well verified the strong electronic interaction rather than a physical contact between cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 in the heterojunction in the xps spectra of the bi 4f region of all samples fig 3c the two individual peaks at approximately 158 8 and 164 1 ev were ascribed to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 reflecting bi existed as the form of bi3 40 the o 1s spectra of cubi2o4 bi2moo6 and cbmo 40 were displayed in fig 3d in which the broad asymmetric o 1s spectra could be divided into three peaks located at around 529 9 531 3 and 532 3 ev typically the peaks at the higher binding energy and the lower binding energy could be attributed to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups and the lattice oxygen separately what s more the peaks located at about 531 3 ev were assigned to the presence of oxygen vacancies 20 28 it is clearly that the bi 4f peaks and o 1s peaks of cbmo 40 were centered between that of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 which further proved the successful construction of cbmo 40 heterojunction consequently we could infer that there was a directional electron transfer from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 on the cbmo interface leading to the establishment of an ief which was conducive to the migration of photogenerated electrons in cubi2o4 across the interface to bi2moo6 41 3 2 evaluation of the cip degradation performance with different catalysts in the preparation process of composite materials only a proper proportion of monomers could be combined with each other to realize the tight coupling of contact surfaces therefore the ratio between monomers played an important role in the degradation effect of composite catalysts accordingly we tested different composite catalysts for the degradation of cip to find out the optimum compound ratio as shown in fig s3a the degradation efficiency tended to first increase and then decreased with the increase of cubi2o4 content meanwhile cbmo 40 showed the most exceptional degradation of cip especially for the first 30 min and eventually reached 97 4 in 90 min in regards to dynamics the above degradation process followed the rule of pseudo first order kinetics as shown in fig 4a and fig 4b cbmo 40 featured the largest rate constant k 0 04036 min 1 which was 3 2 1 1 1 3 and 1 6 times higher than that of bi2moo6 cbmo 20 cbmo 60 and cubi2o4 respectively furthermore toc analysis fig s3b showed that the mineralization rate of cip with cbmo 40 78 5 was higher than that of cubi2o4 64 8 and bi2moo6 44 1 in 180 min consequently we chose cbmo 40 as the optimal catalyst for further study in order to explain that the formation of cbmo 40 was accomplished by successfully constructing a heterojunction between bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 rather than simple physical mixing two monomers that in specific mass ratio were jointly added to the reaction system for cip degradation as shown in fig s3c the system consisting of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 mechanically mixed at a ratio of 40 showed limited degradation efficiency and was much lower than that of cbmo 40 within 90 min this phenomenon was exactly a powerful indication that cbmo 40 was not mechanically mixed but formed a heterostructure which facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs it is recognized that ph plays an essential role in the catalytic activity of fenton catalysts therefore it is of great significance to consider the influence of the initial ph of solution on the degradation rate of cip by cbmo 40 in the pef like system we adjusted the initial ph in the range of 2 6 by using 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 or 0 5 mol l 1 naoh solution the degradation rate fluctuated widely in the first 30 min at different ph values in fig s3d as the reaction progressed the degradation efficiency continued to rise and the gaps were narrowing but there was still a fairly distinct difference at different ph values during the final 90 min among all the ph conditions tested the degradation efficiency of cip was maximum at ph 3 which was due to the acidic environment being more conducive to the generation of h2o2 o2 2h 2e h2o2 42 hence it was quite understandable that the degradation of cip was inhibited under more alkaline conditions with the initial ph increasing the acidic ambience weakened so that the two electron reduction of o2 to produce h2o2 was probably limited while the decomposition of h2o2 to produce oh may also be hindered which also seriously impacted the degradation of cip nevertheless as the acidity of the reaction solution was further enhanced the removal efficiency still did not further improve it was possibly on account of the large amount of h in the solution preferring to form the more stable h3o2 by reacting with h2o2 43 to summarize the optimal ph in this novel pef like system was 3 and the ph range of the system with cbmo 40 as the photoelectric catalyst was broadened to some extent compared to the conventional fenton method it was precisely the synergistic photoelectric effect that could bring out such an impressive degradation property in the pef like system thus we further evidenced this by taking cbmo 40 in different systems the pseudo first order kinetic curves of different systems were illustrated in fig 4c and corresponding kinetic constants were offered in the inset apparently the rate constant of pef like system was higher than that of other two systems proving the best catalytic performance of pef like system also the reaction rate of the pef like system was 237 0 and 1 4 times faster than that of pc system and ef like system respectively as we can see clearly in fig s3e the pef like system presented better catalytic activity than the other two systems in particular during the first 30 min the degradation efficiency in the pef like system was 75 6 which was approximately 30 0 and 70 0 higher than that in the ef like system and pc system respectively thereby we can definitely infer that the high catalytic activity of cbmo 40 was perfectly realized by the synergistic effect of light and electricity in the pef like system to exclude the influence of each adsorption factor we conducted different adsorption experiments as shown in fig 4d the contribution of electro adsorption physical adsorption and anodic oxidation ao process to cip removal was relatively weak which further suggested the outstanding performance of the pef like system moreover as shown in fig s3f the excellent degradation efficiencies of tc 95 7 cip 97 4 enr 96 2 pfx 94 2 and smx 92 5 under the same conditions strongly confirmed the broad applicability of the prepared cbmo 40 to quinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides antibiotics 3 3 band structures and optical properties of different catalysts uv vis drs was implemented to investigate the light absorption properties and band gaps of cubi2o4 bi2moo6 and cbmo 40 then we could further discuss the important role of heterojunction formation in the light harvesting process fig 5a showed both bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 could absorb solar energy from ultraviolet to visible light regions and the absorption band edges were located at around 460 and 700 nm respectively compared with bare bi2moo6 the absorption band of cbmo 40 heterojunction displayed an obvious red shift after coupling bi2moo6 with cubi2o4 which attributed to the addition of narrow band gap cubi2o4 expanded the optical absorption range of bi2moo6 44 moreover cbmo 40 achieved more intensive absorptions in ultraviolet region in comparison with cubi2o4 which also implied that bi2moo6 had been successfully combined with cubi2o4 the band gap energies of bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 were calculated by kubelka munk function eq 1 as follows 1 αhν a hν e g n 2 where α h v a and e g represent the absorption coefficient planck constant irradiation frequency absorption constant and band gap energy respectively meanwhile the value of n depended on the optical transition type the direct band gap semiconductor corresponded to n value of 1 and the indirect band gap semiconductor was 4 45 hence the n values of all catalysts were both taken as 1 and the values of e g could be estimated from the tauc plot in fig 5b the band gaps were determined to be 2 72 1 78 and 2 66 ev for bi2moo6 cubi2o4 and cbmo 40 respectively in fig 5c and fig 5d mott schottky curves were employed to estimate the band potential of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 the bi2moo6 with a positive curve slope was an n type semiconductor while the curve slope of cubi2o4 was negative demonstrating that it was a p type semiconductor specially in fig s4a the mott schottky plot of cbmo 40 exhibited an inverted v shape which confirmed that cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 successfully constructed the p n heterojunction 46 generally the vb position of p type semiconductors was 0 1 0 3 ev lower than that of flat band as well as the cb position of n type semiconductors was 0 1 0 3 ev higher than that of flat band 47 the flat band potentials e fb of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 were 0 28 and 1 01 ev vs nhe respectively therefore the vb potential e vb of cubi2o4 and the cb potential e cb of bi2moo6 were calculated as 1 21 and 0 48 ev vs nhe respectively in addition the cb and vb energy levels could be determined by the following equation eq 2 2 e g e vb e cb as a result the cb value of cubi2o4 and the vb value of bi2moo6 were calculated to be 0 57 and 2 24 ev vs nhe separately which were consistent with the results of the valence band xps vb xps analysis in fig s4c and fig s4d based on the above results the energy band structures of both semiconductors were obtained and presented in fig s4b surprisingly there were suitable band structures for them to construct p n heterostructure since the vb and cb positions of bi2moo6 were positive than that of cubi2o4 to further illustrate the specific recombination and separation behavior of photo induced charge carriers several photoelectrochemical measurements such as pl spectroscopy transient photocurrent response test and eis were carried out theoretically the lower characteristic peak intensity of pl spectrum the better separation effect of photogenerated carriers in other words the lower recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes on the contrary the higher recombination of photogenerated carriers was on behalf of the lower photocatalytic activity of the catalyst from fig 5e single bi2moo6 possessed the strongest emission intensity indicating the highest recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs meanwhile a series of cbmo x composites exhibited distinctly quenched pl signals in contrast with bi2moo6 which strongly inferred that the construction of heterojunction was of great significance for effectively inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated carriers among composite samples cbmo 40 showed the lowest emission intensity which confirmed the most effective carrier separation behaviors additionally cubi2o4 displayed the lowest emission intensity among these materials but the degradation efficiency of cip wasn t the best the reason was that cubi2o4 showed low excitation light response which led to less photogenerated electron hole pairs and this phenomenon had been mentioned in previous reports 20 48 it was generally accepted that the smaller semicircle diameter in eis nyquist plot signified the lower electron transfer resistance as displayed in fig 5f cbmo 40 exhibited the smallest semicircle diameter compared with the two semiconductor monomers demonstrating the lowest interface charge transfer resistance of cbmo 40 heterojunction transient photocurrent response was carried out with the light continuous alternating on and off as illustrated in fig s5 it was clear that cbmo 40 performed a higher photocurrent intensity than that of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 further highlighting that the heterojunction interface between bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 was beneficial to facilitate the fast separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers 3 4 separation mechanism of photogenerated carriers in cbmo 40 the above xps results mentioned that the binding energies of cu 2p o 1s and bi 2p of cbmo 40 became more negative compared to cubi2o4 in contrast the binding energies of mo 2p o 1s and bi 2p of cbmo 40 were more positive than those of bi2moo6 all above phenomena were attributed to the transfer of electrons from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 through the interface of heterojunction consequently the interface region near bi2moo6 was positively charged because of the donation of electrons whereas the interface region close to cubi2o4 was negatively charged as it acquires electrons verifying the construction of an ief that pointing from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 fig s6a and fig s6b mott schottky results also proved the formation of the above mentioned ief and further revealed the transfer mechanism of photogenerated carriers in p n heterojunction previous reports have indicated that e fb denoted the fermi level position of the semiconductor relative to the reference electrode potential 47 49 since the e fb values of cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 were 1 01 and 0 28 ev respectively as soon as bi2moo6 combined with cubi2o4 to construct a p n heterojunction the electrons would spontaneously flow across the interface from bi2moo6 with high fermi level to cubi2o4 with low fermi level until the thermodynamic and fermi level equilibrium was established 20 50 under equilibrium an electron depletion accumulation layer would be established at the interface of cbmo heterojunction where bi2moo6 was positively charged and cubi2o4 was negatively charged leading to the formation of a strong ief with the direction from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 it was consistent with the results confirmed by xps analysis in addition the band edge of bi2moo6 and cubi2o4 would bend upward and downward 51 which provided a strong driving force to promote the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes according to above analysis a reasonable type ii separation mechanism of photogenerated carriers over cbmo p n heterojunction was proposed in fig s6c under visible light irradiation both cubi2o4 and bi2moo6 could generate photogenerated electrons that jumped from their vbs to cbs leaving holes in vbs driven by the ief at the interface and the bending band the photogenerated electrons in the cb of cubi2o4 were spontaneously transferred to the cb of bi2moo6 and the photogenerated holes were automatically accumulated in the cb of cubi2o4 which effectively inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers 3 5 mechanism of the pef like system with cbmo 40 free radical trapping experiments were conducted to investigate the kinds of reactive species present and their contribution in the pef like system various reactive species were captured by the specific radical scavengers of which k2cr2o7 cr vi triethanolamine teoa 52 53 isopropanol ipa p benzoquinone pbq 54 and catalase were utilized to trap e h oh o2 and h2o2 respectively in fig 6a the removal process of cip was remarkably restricted upon the addition of catalase and ipa within 90 min the degradation efficiency showed a dramatic decrease to 31 2 and 34 4 respectively which also demonstrated the crucial role of h2o2 as well as oh moreover o2 also exhibited relatively strong inhibition with a total degradation efficiency of 52 2 suggesting that o2 also made a significant contribution to the removal of cip after adding cr vi to capture e the terminal degradation efficiency was moderately inhibited to 76 8 illustrating the fact that photoexcited electrons were also essential for the degradation of cip to some extent nevertheless the decomposition rate of cip descended slightly in the presence of teoa and the minimum change may be due to the weak oxidation capacity of h to sum up oh o2 e and h coexisted in the pef like system and they synergistically catalyzed to achieve such superior removal performance especially oh played the most prominent role among them in order to check the capability of activate h2o2 to produce oh by variable valence metals in heterojunction catalyst the trapping experiment of oh was carried out using cubi2o4 as electrocatalyst in ef like process as shown in fig 6b the degradation efficiency dramatically decreased after introducing ipa to the system proving that cubi2o4 could indeed decompose h2o2 into oh with the redox reaction between cu and cu2 electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement was carried out to detect the active radicals involved in different degradation processes in which 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo was applied to trap oh and o2 normally the intensity of the esr signal is proportional to the amount of free radicals generated 55 as depicted in fig 6c it was clear that the intensity of dmpo oh characteristic peaks for pef like process was the highest indicating that the photoelectric synergy function was able to provide more oh in the pef like system particularly there were no dmpo oh peaks during pc process which precisely corroborated the type ii transfer mechanism of photogenerated electrons in p n heterojunction in fig 6d the intensity of dmpo o2 was lower for ef like process and pc process while the pef like process exhibited the highest peak intensity which was further proved that more o2 were generated above epr test results provided good evidence that the photoelectric synergy of pef like system could generate more reactive radicals that were conducive to the efficient degradation of cip it is widely accepted that h2o2 plays an indispensable role in fenton like process thus the concentrations of h2o2 were monitored during the pef like and ef like processes with the presence of cbmo 40 following the conventional ce so4 2 titration method 56 and the results were shown in fig s7 during initial 15 min the h2o2 concentration increased rapidly due to the efficient conversion of o2 into large amounts of h2o2 at cathode subsequently the h2o2 concentration continued to rise but the accumulation rate obviously declined as a result of the continuous activation of h2o2 to produce oh for the oxidation of cip and the generation was always faster than decomposition noteworthily the h2o2 concentration in pef like process was always lower than that of ef like process throughout the degradation process fully proving that the concurrent activation of h2o2 by photogenerated electrons and cu in the pef like system which consumed more h2o2 to produced more ross it was consistent with the results of degradation experiments in different systems by comprehensively analyzing the above results a logical photoelectric synergistic catalytic mechanism for cip degradation by cbmo 40 in the pef like system was proposed in fig 7 at first dissolved oxygen acquired two electrons to yield h2o2 on the surface of cathode eq 3 then cu could decompose h2o2 into oh eq 4 in addition h2o2 could also combined with cu2 and oh which was a crucial source for generating o2 57 58 eq 5 and eq 6 as soon as the xenon lamp was turned on photogenerated electrons of both p type cubi2o4 and n type bi2moo6 were excited from vb to cb and left photogenerated holes in vb eq 7 motivated by the ief and the bending band photogenerated electrons on the cb of cubi2o4 migrated simultaneously to the cb of bi2moo6 likewise photogenerated holes transferred from bi2moo6 to cubi2o4 realizing effective spatial separation of photogenerated carriers as the e vb of cubi2o4 was less positive than that of oh h2o 2 38 ev vs nhe 59 the holes accumulated in the vb of cubi2o4 only contributed weakly to direct oxidation of cip rather than reacting with h2o to form oh nevertheless the photogenerated electrons are capable of reducing o2 to produce o2 since bi2moo6 has a more negative e cb than o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe 60 eq 8 the conversion between copper ions could also accomplish by capturing a photogenerated electron eq 9 what s more photogenerated electrons were also participated in the activation of h2o2 which was also a crucial way to generate oh 61 eq 10 the photoelectrons were continuous consumed thereby promoting the effective separation of photogenerated carriers finally the abundant active species of oh o2 e and h were available to decompose cip molecules into co2 h2o and inorganic ions via photoelectric synergistic catalysis eq 11 consequently leading to the efficient mineralization of cip 3 o 2 2e 2h h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 cu h oh cu 2 h 2 o 5 h 2 o 2 cu 2 o 2 cu 2h 6 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o h 7 cbmo 40 hν h e 8 o 2 e o 2 9 cu 2 e cu 10 h 2 o 2 e oh oh 11 cip oh o 2 h co 2 h 2 o inorganic ions 3 6 possible degradation pathways of cip in order to identify the degradation pathways of cip in pef like system hplc ms analysis was applied to determine the intermediates of cip the mass and charge m z of the intermediate products and corresponding molecular structures were listed in table s2 three possible degradation pathways were proposed and illustrated in fig 8 pathway i was initiated by the cleavage of the piperazine ring of cip and the intermediate a m z 362 with dialdehyde derivative structure was firstly obtained then the intermediate a lost one of the formaldehyde groups to form the intermediate b m z 334 further removal of the second formaldehyde group resulted in a transformation from the intermediate b to the intermediate c m z 306 62 subsequently compounds d m z 291 and e m z 263 were derived by dropping a secondary amine nitrogen further oxidation and loosing formaldehyde along the amine side chain leading to the complete decomposition of piperazine ring 63 followed by defluorination reaction the intermediate f m z 245 was finally generated as for pathway ii oh attacked the quinolone ring and produced the intermediate g m z 348 after an addition reaction 64 following the release of the carboxyl group the intermediate g was converted to the intermediate h m z 304 which could be further degraded to the intermediate i m z 288 by removing of hydroxyl group from the quinolone ring 65 after that intermediate i suffered from hydroxyl substitution reaction loss of carbonyl oxygen and further oxidation of quinolone ring as well as piperazine ring yielding three intermediates of j m z 286 k m z 274 and l m z 227 66 respectively initially the hydroxyl group substituted the fluorine atom on the benzene ring of cip to form the intermediate m m z 330 in pathway iii and the intermediate n m z 314 was obtained after the loss of hydroxyl group on the intermediate m as the degradation reaction continued the intermediates were further degraded into other small molecules and mineralized to form h2o and co2 3 7 stability of pef like system with cbmo 40 for practical applications the stability of the catalyst is one of the most essential factors thus we performed cycling experiments to investigate the recyclability of cbmo 40 as shown in fig s8a the degradation efficiency of cip still maintained 89 9 after four cycles and then decreased to 83 6 in sixth consecutive cycles within 90 min proving the good reusability of cbmo 40 in pef like system the gradually decrease of degradation efficiency might be attributed to the catalyst active sites being occupied by organic compounds and the loss of the active metal components throughout the reaction 67 it was also inevitable that artificial loss of catalysts during recycling process in addition the leaching concentrations of cu bi and mo ions after each cycle were also observed by icp oes depicted in fig s8b and table s3 listed the specific leaching values of cu bi and mo ions the leaching cu ion concentration was 1 mg l 1 in each cycle which was always far below the governmental standard 1 mg l 1 for emission of pollutants in china 68 it was calculated that cu loss of cbmo 40 after six cycles was only approximately 1 0 wt fully demonstrating the excellent stability of cbmo 40 furthermore compared with other systems table s4 pef like process with cbmo in our work exhibited an excellent performance in terms of both the degradation efficiency and cyclic stability in order to further demonstrate the stability of the heterostructure the phase composition and surface elemental content of cbmo 40 before and after the reaction were analyzed by xrd and xps respectively in fig s8c and fig s8d all the characteristic peaks remained almost unchanged before and after the reaction which also strongly suggested that the cbmo 40 heterojunction presented superior structural stability during pef like process to verify the potential of this work for application in real water environments we also carried out cip degradation experiments in pef like system with different water samples and results were shown in fig s9 it was evident that the removal rates of cip in seawater distilled water and oil produced water were 92 0 97 4 and 95 3 respectively the lower degradation rate may be due to the influence of natural organic matter and background ions in natural water 69 surprisingly the degradation efficiency of cip in oil produced water was very fast in the early time which may because the presence of cu fe mn and ni ions in the solution can accelerate the fenton like reaction 70 the results showed that the pef like system was able to remove most of the cip from different real water samples it was much suitable to apply pef like system to remove cip in water 4 conclusions in summary the hydrothermal and solvothermal methods were utilized to successfully prepare a series of cbmo p n heterojunction catalysts for cip removal in pef like process cbmo 40 exhibited the best catalytic activity which attributed to the fact that it featured the smallest interfacial charge transfer resistance and the strongest photocurrent response besides the formation of ief contributed to the successful construction of p n heterojunction thus achieving the effective separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs then multiple active species like oh o2 e and h were produced and used for the efficient degradation of cip under the synergistic operation of photoelectricity finally the pef like system demonstrated the most excellent degradation efficiency within 90 min and the corresponding kinetic constant was 237 0 and 1 4 times higher than that of pc and ef like systems separately the results of quenching experiments and epr analysis demonstrated that oh played a major role in pef like system and the possible degradation mechanism was put forward based on the hplc ms data three possible pathways for cip degradation were also proposed finally the excellent stability of cbmo 40 catalyst during pef like process was tested by six consecutive cycling experiments therefore this pef like system with p n heterojunction catalysts was a promising way to deal with cip in

12551,antibiotic resistance is widely acknowledged as one of the most challenging global crises at hand antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args are ubiquitously detected as emerging biological contaminants several human lives are currently perished due to untreated infections for the emergence of antibiotic resistance semi metabolized antibiotic residue from human faeces and effluents of the pharmaceutical industry are released into municipal wastewater this in turn triggers the selection of args and arb which eventually seek a way into natural environmental matrices to this end the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials such as enormous surface area and higher surface reactivity benefit them to get nominated as an emerging tool to combat antibiotic resistance as such tremendous research and development efforts are currently underway to achieve meaningful progress in the development and deployment of innovative nanotechnology based treatment strategies with high removal efficacy for args and arb nano enabled water wastewater treatment system offer perquisites of being energy efficient effectual durable and cost effective although nanotechnological approaches are gaining momentum the major challenge in terms of commercialization is that long term efficacy of nano based treatment under realistic conditions remains relatively unknown this review is intended to accentuate the potentiality of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in args and arb removal additionally several noble detection technologies that are currently in use as well as those that are in the process of deployment beyond the laboratory scale are enumerated graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes nanotechnology detection remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the term antibiotic resistance refers to the developed potentiality of certain germs like bacteria and fungi to defend themselves from antibiotics that are designed to destroy them pathogenic strains developing resistance to several antibiotics and commonly used antimicrobial agents leads to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance an ideal example of multi drug resistance is methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa which raises a serious concern to treat hospital acquired infections 1 antibiotics not only find their application as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans but are also used extensively in agriculture as feed additives for poultry and livestock veterinary medicine and biocides in fruit and crop production 2 as stated by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the world is likely to enter the post antibiotic era eventually leading to more people dying of bacterial infections than cancer 3 cdc antibiotic resistance ar threat report 2019 has enlisted potential germs into four different categories namely urgent threats serious threats concerning threats and watch list that requires constant monitoring 4 high profile predictions sprang up that antimicrobial resistance may claim 10 million lives by 2050 if we fail to adopt suitable control measures the emergence of antibiotic resistance has threatened the global health care system due to the potential loss of efficacy of existing antibiotics moreover curtailing of new antibiotic exploration has exacerbated the challenges faced due to antibiotic resistance thereby unfolding the probability of having no defence system against infections in near future 5 antibiotic resistance has serious implications on human health which must be adequately addressed especially in order to achieve the united nations sustainable development goals viz sdg 3 tackling antibiotic resistance adds to higher medical costs prolonged hospitalization and can even lead to increased morbidity and mortality the incapability of using appropriate antibiotics in a timely manner may cause treatment failure in some cases leading to chronic problems ensuing sepsis relapse of infection after treatment and endangering the lives of patients undergoing chemotherapy dialysis organ transplantation and surgery 4 in addition dissemination of args in water creates significant ecotoxicological challenges for the aquatic environment eventually disturbing both aquatic and terrestrial food webs further the polluted water seeps into the soil which in turn contaminates food crops and imperil human and livestock survival 6 excessive and indiscriminate usage of antibiotics has whipped up the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes args in various environments like surface water and groundwater soil ecosystem aquatic ecosystem wastewater effluents and even in drinking water reflecting worst case scenarios 7 8 the greatest pitfall lies in the fact that once args are introduced into the environment they persevere over many generations even in absence of antibiotic selective pressure 9 wastewater treatment plant wwtp which serves as a removal site for common contaminants has been outlined to be the major hotspot of antimicrobial resistance worldwide 7 the build up of antibiotic residues arb and args in the aquatic system may be attributed to the incapability of natural degradation of antibiotics due to their low hydrophilicity and high structural stability 10 the seriousness of the situation is aggravated when antimicrobial residues and resistance determinants cannot be eliminated by most practiced treatment strategies thereby accelerating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance determinants in discharged effluent of municipal wwtps 11 as antibiotic resistance shows no sign of abatement effective treatment strategies ranging from biological to physical chemical methods to combat args and arb are the area of prime focus various remediation technologies with considerable removal efficiencies are in use but the increasing load of args and arb has propelled us to look for improved processes using an advantageous application of nanomaterials nanotechnology offers tremendous technological opportunities in the realm of water treatment it enables proficient ways of handling water treatment problems on small scale as well as large scale in precise and accurate manner for instance nanoparticles are capable of treating contaminants in water by reaching out to depths and locations which other conventional techniques cannot accomplish 12 nanoscale materials are delineated to be more efficacious than bulk materials by virtue of their higher surface area and surface reactivity researchers have fabricated multifarious nanostructured materials for application as high performance sorbents membranes catalysts and sensors in wastewater treatment this review precisely catalogues the different types of nanomaterials that can be widely utilized for elimination of arb and args however it is perplexing to draw comparison among these nanomaterials in terms of their performance because each application may entail different operational parameters nevertheless the specificity of nanomaterials towards the desired pollutant is anticipated to minimize competitive interactions with interfering species and co pollutants 13 globally at least 1 2 million people died on account of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections in 2019 according to the data published by the medical journal lancet 14 therefore detection of arb and args is an absolute requirement for timely and precise diagnosis of the pattern of bacterial antibiotic resistance there is an urgent need for a rapid cost effective and highly sensitive detection platform for amr diagnosis this review presents an in depth analysis of the source and dissemination of args detection technologies and conventional treatment approaches along with the wide scale application of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in mitigation of args and arb 2 source and dissemination of antibiotics and args in the environment args are termed as easy to get hard to lose pollutants since their existence can be spotted in both antibiotic free environments and even after withdrawal of antibiotic selective pressure 15 antibiotic resistance at a very low level may originate due to natural selection whereas the increasing abundance of args and arb in the environment is a direct consequence of human activities it is quite eminent that the unconstrained anthropogenic consumption of antibiotics has given rise to the enhanced gene transfer in bacterial communities and evolution of args 16 studies revealed the prevalence of class i integrons as a substitute to antibiotic pollution that also brings forth the significance of the relationship between anthropogenic impact and the abundance of int1 genes 17 18 four media was described as genetic reactor inducing antibiotic resistance evolution viz a human and animal microbiota b hospitals and healthcare facilities c wastewater and biological residues and d soil and surface or groundwater environment 19 wwtp is regarded as the major anthropogenic source of occurrence and spread of args and land application of manure is considered the animal source 20 indiscriminate discharge of untreated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry releases a considerable amount of antibiotic residues these antibiotics thus released into the environment may be washed by rainwater runoffs into the local water bodies including groundwater 6 notable release of water disinfectant by products may contribute to the elicitation of antibiotic resistance as reported in a study where chlorine and iodoacetic acid resulted in the evolution of resistant escherichia coli strains 21 sewage and hospital discharge are the sources of args of clinically relevant pathogens sediment samples of river water often exhibit high concentrations of antibiotics arb and args primarily due to urban wastewater discharge into the river without appropriate treatment 22 in a biological system the gut microbiome is considered a hotspot of horizontal gene transfer due to its favorable environment for conjugation 23 the research highlighted the prime importance of the food chain in the emergence of arg in humans counter to the antibiotics applied to animals 24 the aquatic microbial community also carries args that bear the potential to transmit them to human and animal pathogens through direct contact with arb present in the aquatic system or passing of args via resistant environmental bacteria 25 biofilms and marine sediments in the natural aquatic ecosystem are also identified as the origin of the transfer maintenance and spread of args biofilms present in the aquatic environment are nowadays emerging as a potent hotspot for the propagation of novel arb and args 26 the sub inhibitory concentration of antibiotics in the soil is believed to be the evolutionary force for the array of resistant genes in soil microbes 27 evidence of soil pollution by antibiotics and antibiotic resistance determinants escalates the likelihood of human pathogen acquiring resistance through mobile genetic elements mges as demonstrated in shuttling of args among distinctly related soil and human microbiome via plasmids and integrons assistance 28 29 broiler feedlots and fishponds designated as an agriculturally influenced region are also regarded as sources of args in the environment 28 30 31 moreover animal husbandry is an added sponsor to the environmental burden of args constructed wetlands also harbor args that mostly originate from domestic sewage 20 municipal solid waste and landfill leachate retain a substantial quantity of antibiotics metals and organic pollutants which may augment the persistence of args 32 needless to say wastewater from antibiotic manufacturing facilities and hospital effluents have the largest contribution to the discharge of antibiotics in the aquatic environment and hence the manifestation of arb and args various sources of antibiotics and args are sketched in fig 1 owing to the meteoric distribution of args across the environment researchers have unanimously endorsed that bacteria avail two main transfer paths i e horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt for spreading antibiotic resistance in the environment 33 stressors like antibiotics metals biocides and preservatives are sometimes deemed responsible for the transfer of bacterial genetic elements 34 35 most significantly mobile genetic elements like plasmids transposons and integrons enact crucial roles in the emergence and spread of args 36 another notable example demonstrating the transfer of multiple args concurrently is the acquirement of gene cassette by mrsa 37 3 detection of args and arb molecular based techniques for detection of args are not only rapid and sensitive but also render multiplex targeting with precise characterization and detection nucleic acid amplification tests namely polymerase chain reaction pcr and loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp are the most widely used detection technologies pcr and qpcr are the most commonly used conventional techniques which are nowadays being replaced with more promising high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr it offers cost effective simultaneous detection of multiple args with a high processing rate and high sensitivity 33 studies reported the use of ht qpcr for args profiling of bacterial isolates obtained from park soil 38 singleplex and multiplex real time pcr provides fast and reliable detection of mrsa in pediatric samples along with differentiation between mrsa and methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus mssa 39 args analysis and profiling can be successfully performed using four distinct ht qpcr platforms i e bio rad cfx384tm biomarktm dynamic array openarray and the most commonly used wafergentm smartchip 40 isothermal amplification methods came up with more recent development than pcr based methods with faster and more sensitive next generation molecular diagnostics lamp helicase dependent amplification had and rolling circle amplification rca is widely applicable isothermal methods for args detection 41 whole genome sequencing wgs bears the prospects for the recognition of all known resistant genes in an isolate metagenomics can be applied reliably for the detection of args since it facilitates investigation of bacterial gene mutations and genomic variations thus providing evidence of being used intensively for environmental args in several studies 42 44 the advantage of whole metagenome sequencing lies in the capability of arg identification directly from clinical specimens without lacking the pre requisite of isolation or identification of specific bacteria 41 a relevant example of the usefulness of metagenomics is reported in a study where it was applied to reveal the degree of contamination by args and mges thereby manifesting a wwtp as a probable hotspot of args dissemination 45 hybridization tests such as dna microarray fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and line probe assay lpa also deliver optimal results of arg detection line probe assay can detect several resistance markers like penicillinases metallo β lactamases spontaneously while fish offers direct detection of resistance markers in bacterial cells researchers developed dna microarray for simultaneous detection of args based on fluorescently labelled pcr products in clinical samples of staphylococcus sp 46 experimentation on clinical isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis for identification of resistance to fluroquinolones rifampicin kanamycin and capreomycin are reported to be performed successfully by pyrosequencing 41 similar examples can also be evinced on using nanopore sequencing such as identification of plasmid pathogen and arg in bacterial dna of blood culture sample using minion nanopore sequencing 47 another study demonstrated the functionality of minion in the identification of bacterial pathogen along with its acquired resistance genes from urine samples without culturing 48 lateral flow immunoassay lfia and nucleic acid lateral flow assay are often employed to detect several resistant markers at once in addition to the aforementioned technologies recent developments on microfluidics based lab on chip loc technologies extend far more convenient cost effective and high throughput analysis researchers fabricated a microfluidic chip with surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers for identification and differentiation between mrsa and mssa 49 resistance genes from escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by a real time ultrafast electronic microdevice employing the recombinase polymerase amplification rpa method for arg identification 50 electrochemical detection of mrsa using a sandwich product of two nanoparticle probes via adsorptive transfer stripping square wave voltammetry method was reported 51 the various detection technologies along with insight into their potential merits and demerits are summarized in table 1 4 remediation technologies in order to combat the spread of args as well as inactivate the pathogens to limit the harm caused by their abundance it is imperative to resort to effective treatment strategies as described in fig 2 4 1 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cws not only harbor a great population of a microbial community but also offer an environmentally friendly inexpensive and simple wastewater treatment approach 52 several characteristics of constructed wetlands like flow type flow configuration and plant species have been proved to affect the removal performance of arb and args 53 a notable decrease of arg content in the effluent of antibiotic wastewater along with the effective exclusion of pathogens were observed in a vertical up flow constructed wetland 54 biodegradation surface adsorption and plant uptake are stated to be the possible ways of degradation of antibiotics and arg 53 similarly matrix adsorption and biological process are reported to be the main course of arg removal in a study where mesocosm scale cws demonstrated 87 8 99 1 removal efficiency of args from antibiotics spiked domestic sewage 55 4 2 anaerobic or aerobic bioreactors aerobic and anaerobic reactors operating in sequence significantly eliminate antibiotics arb and args via biological treatment in addition employing membrane bioreactor mbr along with biological treatment further improves removal efficacy 20 reduction in the concentration of args was reported in anaerobic and anoxic effluent of mbr than aerobic mbr alone 56 anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr was successfully claimed to diminish the load of args and arb into the receiving environment 57 another relevant study compared the efficiency of activated sludge oxidative ditch and rotary biological contractors to report the log removal rates of tetracycline resistant and sulfonamide resistant bacteria with three args including sul1 tetw teto 58 the metagenomics study revealed the competence of anaerobic aerobic sequence aas bioreactor in eliminating 85 of args in influent as compared to individual anaerobic and aerobic reactors 59 biofouling of membrane poses a major disadvantage as it minimizes the removal efficiency of args therefore certain modified anmbr are introduced with the aim of enhancing removal efficacy alongside the mitigation of membrane fouling examples of such modified anmbr include electrochemical membrane bioreactor bio electrochemical coupled anmbr and anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor 33 4 3 adsorption biochar an efficient and sustainable adsorbent with a large specific surface area offers abundant sites for contaminant adsorption biochar is capable of removing potential pathogens in an aquatic environment 60 significant changes in the microbial community are evidenced on the addition of biochar thus considering its effects on the relative abundance of args 61 several studies are conducted on biochar and modified biochar mediated adsorption thereby indicating its interference with args distribution such as the application of biochar decreased arg abundance in livestock wastewater and usage of β cyclodextrin modified biochar also contributed in diminution of relative abundance of total identified args 62 63 likewise biochar treated antibiotic contaminated soil demonstrated its potential to restrain the accumulation of antibiotics arb and args in the tissues of vegetables 64 however a major limitation is the aging of biochar which significantly reduce the adsorption efficiency of args 65 powdered activated carbon pac has been successfully used in several membrane based integration process for efficient removal of arb and args 66 other biobased adsorbents like sulfate calcined eggshells iron oxide coated sand and sewage sludge biochar have been developed to study their potential in reducing the dissemination risk of args and arb 67 68 similarly non biobased adsorbents like ceo2 have shown promising results in removal of free dna harboring args 69 implementation of adsorption technique for wastewater treatment at an industrial scale may turn out to be beneficial owing to its cost effectiveness facile operation and easy scalability however certain bottlenecks like toxicity of adsorbent material leaching of nanomaterial adsorbent into the ecosystem renewability of adsorbents and perplexity of manipulating ph in wastewater treatment plant for highly ph dependent adsorption still limits its practical usage here the greatest drawback of adsorption technique is the concern of ultimate fate of args since elution of adsorbed args and arb will further occur into different environmental matrices thereby evoking questions on post treatment disposal 4 4 disinfection disinfection is the most widely used treatment for the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms chlorination is the widely applied disinfection strategy due to the easy availability and effectiveness of chlorine disinfectant besides ozone and uv radiation are also employed as routine disinfectants in wastewater treatment plants for removal of arb and args researchers already investigated the effectiveness of using chlorine disinfectant in the removal of different antibiotics including ciprofloxacin rifampicin tetracycline vancomycin and many others alongside its effect in arb and args deactivation 20 during chlorination of biological molecules in solution hocl reacts with selective functional groups of biomolecules like sulfhydryl group of glutathione purine and pyrimidine of nucleobases and organosulfur or aromatic moieties of amino acids 70 71 different doses of chlorine were utilized to inactivate 9 different arb along with successful removal of args erea ereb ermb and teta tetb tetm and teto with removal of 60 and 20 respectively 72 simultaneous removal of args and arb namely escherichia coli and enterococcus faecium was obtained within 30 min of chlorine disinfection 73 nevertheless usage of chlorine disinfection is not currently preferred as chlorination leads to the generation of carcinogenic by products 74 a study reported chlorination to be the most effective process for inactivation of args than uv irradiation and ozonation when experimented using args including sul1 tetg and inti1 75 interestingly sequential uv chlorination treatment was found more advantageous in terms of arg removal efficiency than either uv irradiation or chlorination alone when investigated using args sul1 tetx tetg inti 1 obtained from municipal wwtp 37 merging conventional disinfection processes like chlorination and ionizing radiation with advanced technologies like advanced oxidation process aop will be highly beneficial in the elimination of args 33 a notable study demonstrated the potential of ionizing radiation assisted peroxymonosulfate oxidation system in the elimination of antibiotics and args 76 other disinfectants like hydrogen peroxide peracetic acid paa and sodium hypochlorite are also explored in successful targeting of arb 77 80 paa is reported to remove 99 9 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria within 20 min 80 disinfection technologies are advantageous because of their affordability simplicity and brief contact time nevertheless disinfection technologies are often restricted due to their inherent shortcomings like production of pernicious disinfection by products dbps or toxic chemical residues like bromate or nitrosamines concomitantly it has been observed that bacterial inactivation via disinfection may not always cause degradation of intracellular args which adds to its disadvantage 71 sometimes biocidal agents like triclosan and benzalkonium chloride that are used for disinfection can themselves augment antibiotic resistance 79 nevertheless usage of chlorine disinfection is not currently preferred as chlorination leads to the generation of carcinogenic by products 74 4 5 advanced oxidation process advanced oxidation process aop employing uv h2o2 fenton reagent ozone photocatalyst and so on are popular treatment strategies with wide applicability aops involve the generation of free radicals such as oh so4 and o2 which consequently damages cell surface and dna structures thereupon inactivating pathogens and removing args 81 different aop technology aiming to eliminate args is discussed as follows 4 5 1 fenton and fenton like processes fenton is a popular water treatment process where hydroxyl radicals oh are produced through reaction of fe2 with h2o2 in the solar driven fenton process fe2 is regenerated from photo reduced fe3 generated in fenton reaction 82 solar fenton system resulted in complete removal of antibiotics along with 5 log reduction of arb sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin resistant enterococci 83 photo fenton process significantly killed 6 17 log arb harboring teta and blatem args within 30 min under visible light irradiation 84 more interestingly combining the fenton process with alkaline or microwave treatment demonstrated successful mitigation of target args 85 4 5 2 ozonation ozone being a powerful oxidant is another choice of water treatment where pollutants are either removed through direct o3 oxidation or indirectly via decomposition of o3 generating free radicals 86 ozonation resulted in 34 5 to 49 2 removal efficiency of sulfonamide resistance genes and tetracycline genes in secondary sewage 87 however in some cases ozonation has been found to be the least effective method in the inactivation of args as compared to fenton oxidation uv irradiation and chlorination 75 4 5 3 uv h2o2 attributing to its strong oxidizing ability uv h2o2 is the most widely used aop with growing interest towards removal of arb and args 33 the generated oh radical targets bacterial dna and arg structure thus inducing damage 88 uv h2o2 is reported to improve the removal efficiency of arb and args 89 however scavenging of oh radical by cellular components can result in an insignificant role of oh in damage of intracellular args 90 4 5 4 ultrasonic another category of aop implemented in wastewater treatment due to its ability to generate free radicles like oh is ultrasonic and is thus widely applicable for pathogen removal 91 researchers reported the utility of the ultrasonic technique as a pre treatment in the elimination of args 92 moreover the combined uv radiation ultrasonic technique displayed higher arg removal efficiency than the single ultrasonic technique 93 the only limitation of this technique is the high energy consumption since low energy and low frequency ultrasonic waves are reported to be insufficient in the elimination of pathogens 33 4 5 5 sulfate radical based aops this aop technique is tagged as a low cost highly selective oxidation process that gained popularity due to the long lifetime of so4 that plays a significant role in args degradation 94 there is evidence of so4 being the predominant reactive radicle species in heat activated persulfate reduction of args namely erma ermb ereb 95 a study reported the utility of gamma radiation activated persulfate system in the efficient elimination of args and inactivation of arb 96 4 5 6 photocatalytic processes high solar utilization and low cost offer an advantage in favor of photocatalyst for the elimination of contaminants reactive oxygen species viz o2 oh 1o2 generated during the photocatalytic process enables the effective elimination of arb and degradation of args experimentation using solar simulated nitrogen doped tio2 photocatalysis was performed to investigate its potential in inactivating multi drug resistant e coli strain 97 similarly uv a tio2 photocatalysis resulted in 1 3 log removal of arb namely vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis vre methicillin resistant s aureus and multi drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii mdrab 98 another study examined the effect of photocatalysis on arg transfer in urban wastewater using two antibiotic resistant and one antibiotic sensitive strain of e coli 99 table 2 presents a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various remediation technologies for eliminating args and arbs from environmental matrices 5 perspective in employing nanotechnology for removal of args and arb advanced nanotechnological approach is shaping water and wastewater treatment technologies the several unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials render them unparallel attributes in terms of sorption capacity surface reactivity and dissolution ability 39 in addition the enormous specific surface area and high porosity of most nanomaterials opens a plethora of opportunities to utilize them in various treatment technologies for the removal of arb and args moreover rational tuning of the microstructure and surface chemistry of nanomaterials can give rise to original material systems with novel functionalities and therefore enhanced removal performance towards arb and args 11 material size is proclaimed to affect material properties thus size effects play a crucial role a decrease in nanomaterial size is reported to enhance surface energy decrease melting point and favor in vivo effectiveness 100 to reflect on how the morphology of nanomaterials make them a suitable option researchers documented that the interior of nanomaterials permits easy penetration of antimicrobials enzymes and photosensitizers thereby extending a high degree of damage further the shape of functionalized nanomaterials tends to improve the local adhesive forces thereby boosting contact killing for instance nano blade and nano knive types of graphene oxide go display sharp edges that can cause intracellular cell leakage via cell membrane penetration ultimately leading to cell death 101 102 most importantly the strong antimicrobial properties of different nanomaterials make them particularly suitable for killing antibiotic resistant microbes besides the potential toxicity of certain engineered nanomaterials may also be exploited to combat args the use of nanomaterials is widely debatable due to their action towards antibiotic resistance some nanomaterials display antibacterial activity making them a suitable defence against multi drug resistance while a few are reported to exhort the development of antibiotic resistance in the environment 103 104 the advisability of implementing nanotechnology depends on its commendable advantages like cost reduction in long term water treatment once technology is adopted reduced time and energy consumption and minimal waste generation as compared to bulk materials in conventional techniques other benefits include increased effectiveness in contaminant removal due to increased specificity of nanomaterials and simplicity of operation 105 in spite of the aforementioned the practical applications of nanotechnology in eliminating arb and args are currently limited in the wake of hinderance imposed in commercialization of nanoengineered materials this is mainly subjected to their impacts on aquatic matrices considering which several studies are conducted to evaluate the risk associated with nanomaterials contradictory results from many studies coupled with stringent laws and regulations in some countries have limited the production of nanomaterials and restrained their usage in water treatment 6 nanotechnology and args the unique physiochemical properties of nanomaterials were accredited for empowering them to combat antibiotic resistance mechanisms nanotechnology brings forth a vast array of nanosensors nanosorbents nanostructured materials nanophotocatalysts for the detection and removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes from the surrounding environment the antimicrobial mechanism of nanomaterials portrayed in fig 3 is outlined as follows a oxidative stress induction or precisely ros generation b disruption of cell membrane causing cytoplasmic leakage c induction of intracellular antibacterial effects such as binding and disruption of intracellular components like dna and proteins d electrolyte imbalance on account of electron transport disruption and e nanomaterial used as cargo for drug delivery may enter bacterial cells via membrane fusion 3 106 the efficacy of various nanomaterials that are currently being considered for treating arb and args are presented in table 3 it is well known that biofilm matrix exhibits as a barrier to antibiotics thereupon conferring antibiotic resistance biofilms are habitually formed by gram positive staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and are mostly antibiotic resistant since conventional antibiotics cannot exterminate biofilms completely superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were found efficacious in treating antibiotic resistant biofilms formed by staphylococcus aureus 101 researchers used photothermal action of gold nanostar gns monolayer in the eradication of staphylococcus aureus biofilms 107 tio2 photocatalytic inactivation of three antibiotic resistance bacteria methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii mdrab and vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis vre was successfully examined thereby tagging tio2 as a useful candidate in the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria 98 intensifying x ray irradiation with the addition of nanoparticles is another novel strategy to kill multi drug resistant bacteria such experimental strategy was demonstrated when a greater percentage of mdr pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in presence of bismuth nanoparticles that enhanced x ray irradiation by 35 times higher than that without nanoparticles 108 chitosan stabilized gold nanoparticles exhibited antibacterial activity against biofilm forming antibiotic resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa 109 different solid lipid nanoparticle sln formulations were developed to reduce antibiotic resistance mechanisms 110 the effect of metal oxide nanoparticles monps on the lateral transfer of args was explored in a study where zno al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles were observed to bind with phosphate groups and bases of puc19 plasmid thereby suppressing lateral transfer of puc19 plasmid carrying ampicillin resistant gene into escherichia coli dh5α 111 silver modified mesoporous nanosilica ag ms demonstrated antibacterial activity against mdr strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa thereby hoping to render a propitious application in the reduction of antibiotic resistant bacteria 112 researchers investigated the ability of enzyme functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles in destroying methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa biofilms thereby providing a promising therapeutic approach to treat staphylococcus aureus biofilm associated infection 113 zero valent iron nanoparticles are reported to significantly eliminate the antibiotic resistance genes of heterotrophic bacteria including tetw tetracycline ctx m 32 ceftazidime and cmla1 chloramphenicol from wastewater 114 ceo2 nanoparticles were applied to study the modulation of args transfer between escherichia coli in the context of nanoagrotechnology where low concentration 1 and 5 mg l 1 of ceo2 nanoparticles inhibited the conjugative transfer of rp4 plasmid by 22 26 however higher concentration displayed the opposite effect the effectivity in low dosage can be accounted for decreased ros level reduced intercellular contact through suppression of polysaccharides synthesis in extracellular polymeric substance and shortage of atp supply repressing the expression of plasmid transfer genes 115 zero valent iron nanoparticles decrease the abundance of args in landfill leachate via the reduction of mobile genetic elements mge the shift in the bacterial community as seen in network analysis is significant in explaining changed arg patterns 116 a study explored the use of a bimetallic system to combat antibiotic resistance where nanoscale copper in mfe ncu system imparted args removal efficiency from post treated swine wastewater the absolute abundance of five args and class i integrase gene inti1 were significantly reduced by mfe ncu process 117 researchers embarked on a newer approach to look for nanomaterials to combat antibiotic resistance based on the interfacial interactions between args and metallic nanomaterials causing adsorption and fragmentation of args a comparison study was carried out between nanoscale titanium dioxide ntio2 and nano zero valent iron n zvi on the adsorption and desorption study of args tetm carrying plasmid n zvi not only exhibited a higher adsorption rate and capacity for args in contrast to ntio2 but also the desorbed args from n zvi were disintegrated into small irrelevant dna base fragments contrary to the intact args desorbed from ntio2 118 it was found that the proportion of microcystis aeruginosa is associated with the abundance of args in wastewater in this context carbon based copper nanocomposite ccn was found to flocculate microcystis aeruginosa in urban water to a notable level thus impairing the moveability potential of args mediated by mobile genetic elements like plasmid and lowering the abundance of args 119 in view of addressing the problem of increased discharge of nano metal oxides nmos in wastewater researchers explored the possibility of using the toxicity of nmos in the natural attenuation of arb in wastewater exposure to nmos like nzno ncuo and ntio2 for longer retention time gave excellent results killing 45 62 of arb through the dissolution of ions from nmos thus eliciting ros induced cell death they are also reported to reduce antibiotic tolerance by 11 58 4 via direct attachment to nmos triggering arg mutations and stress response among cells 120 pvdf membrane was functionalized with tio2 nanoparticles to design a photocatalytic reactive membrane for arb and arg removal after exposure to uv irradiation plasmid encoded args flor sul1 sul2 as well as inti1 inti2 and inti3 integrons were removed via photocatalytic degradation thus confirming the efficiency of tio2 in controlling horizontal transfer potential of args 13 novel functionalized nanomaterials like lipopolysaccharide lps imprinted polymer films lps mip and quaternary ammonium functionalized kaolin microparticles qas k when used in tandem gave excellent arg removal efficiency three args namely sul1 teto and meca could be eliminated below the detection limit and others blactxm ermb and qnrs hgt related inti1 were found to undergo a sharp decline in log reduction 7 the pairing of crispr cas9 genome editing technology with nanotechnology has been applied in targeting antibiotic resistance and bacterial pathogen polymer derivatized cas9 endonuclease is complexed with sg rna to form cr nanocomplex targeting methicillin resistance gene meca cr nanocomplex can be delivered into mrsa for editing bacterial genome with high efficacy and minimizing the growth of mrsa thereupon manifesting a novel strategy to mitigate antibiotic resistance 121 6 1 2d nanomaterials photocatalytic inactivation of arb and args rely upon several factors including cell structure type of antibiotic nature of the catalyst and interactions between cell and catalyst 122 the key inactivation mechanism of arb and args by photocatalyst is via generation of ros causing cell damage the desirability of using 2d nanomaterials comes from the array of opportunities they offer specifically in terms of high specific surface area excellent photocatalytic properties along with effective physical and chemical interactions with microorganisms 123 124 2d photocatalyst can be tuned with many modifications like doping addition of polymer enzymes metal oxides nanoparticles and even antibiotics to obtain necessary properties needed for attenuating arb and args 122 it is reported that 2d photocatalyst facilitates binding of bacteria onto catalyst surface thereby causing membrane damage which aids to attack the genetic material via increased permeability 125 since graphene based nanomaterials display high photothermal conversion efficiency under nir irradiation researchers investigated a novel approach of dual mode phototherapy where co irradiation of daylight and nir laser gave 99 efficiency against antibiotic resistant bacteria nanographene oxide based bovine serum albumin aie ngo bsa aie nanoparticles upon co irradiation were tested against amoxicillin resistant escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus where the heat produced under nir laser irradiation and ros produced under daylight were sufficient to kill bacteria 126 researchers have proposed another neoteric idea to fabricate lanthanum hydroxide and go nanocomposite la go to mitigate resistant bacteria without engendering antimicrobial resistance evolution la go was found beneficial towards the inactivation of arb on a range of tested resistant strains e coli displaying remarkable ineptitude to evolve secondary resistance to la go primarily due to extracellular multitarget invasion killing mechanism encompassing lipid peroxidation lipid dephosphorylation and peptidoglycan disruption 127 molecular imprinting was reported to augment the potency and selectivity of the photocatalytic process which was found beneficial in reducing the dissemination of args in wastewater molecular imprinting of graphitic carbon nitride with guanine was useful in degrading plasmid encoded arg bla ndm 1 through enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic degradation fragmentation and complete inactivation of bla ndm 1 minimized the potential for arg repair by transformed bacteria 128 although fe2o3 facilitates conjugative transfer decoration of mos2 is seen to change the biological properties of fe2o3 it therefore appears that mos2 fe2o3 nanocomposite is competent of inhibiting horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes mos2 is reported to upregulate global regulating gene trba thereupon inhibiting the expression of downstream genes of conjugative transfer namely traf and trbb along with plasmid encoding protein trfa 129 a separate study scrutinized peg functionalized mos2 nanoflowers for inhibition of tetracycline resistant bacillus tropicalis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia the superior photothermal conversion ability of peg mos2 nfs was used to generate nir laser induced high temperature that significantly expedited glutathione oxidation causing rapid death of antibiotic resistant bacteria via disruption of their intracellular protection system 130 go of different lateral sizes is observed to disturb the base stacking mode and double helix structure of dna leading to partial cleavage of supercoiled plasmid dna through intercalation as a result of go plasmid dna interactions it can be effectively used to inhibit the amplification and transformation of kanamycin resistant gene apha containing plasmid dna 131 another recent study highlighted the effectual use of go nanosheets as a novel adsorbent for the removal of both cyclic and double stranded args from a natural water sample the mechanism of args teta sul2 ermb and ampc adsorption by go nanosheets was accounted to the chemical binding of aromatic nucleic acid along with strong π stacking interactions owing to the presence of abundant oxygen containing groups and π bonding system of go nanosheet 132 go is believed to lower the abundance of tetracycline resistance gene teta and kanamycin resistance gene apha as well as lessen the frequency of conjugative transfer when used in high concentration through notable dna damage of rp4 plasmid consequently teta and apha gene on the plasmid is also impaired leading to mitigation of args abundance and reduced level of bacterial resistance to antibiotics 133 go was reported to reduce the copy numbers of args and mges by restraining horizontal gene transfer 134 experimental evidence was obtained on alleviation of selective pressure generated by antibiotics on microbes by go particularly go suppressed the transfer frequency of class i integron via p dna go interactions curtailing arg propagation 135 a novel tio2 ag go nanocomposite was fabricated to study its arb vitality and its effect on antibiotic resistance dissemination tio2 ag go under simulated sunlight irradiation significantly reduced bacterial survival to 12 2 and bacterial tolerance to tetracycline it was furthermore concluded that with tio2 ag go the promotion rate of args was limited as compared to other nanomaterials 136 ag tio2 go is also explored as an advanced oxidation process aop catalyst wherein it showed outstanding removal efficacy for intracellular args like teta and ampc along with extracellular args in model solution and secondary wastewater effluent ag tio2 go catalyst combined with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane was tested for its application in wastewater treatment thereupon showcasing its synergistic interfacial adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation for inactivation of args 137 biogenic agnps produced by fusarium oxysporum were wisely used to decorate go to design bio goag nanocomposite this demonstrated excellent antibiofilm activity with 100 inhibition of salmonella typhimurium cells adhered to stainless steel surface 160 tio2 reduced go tio2 rgo composite demonstrated complete inactivation of antibiotic resistant escherichia coli and removal of ampicillin resistant ampc gene under solar radiation 138 four multi drug arbs were isolated from secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant to examine the ability of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 mediated photocatalysis on enhanced inactivation of arb g c3n4 irradiated by simulated solar light increased the log inactivation of arb isolates more than compared to irradiation in absence of g c3n4 105 another study exploited the photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 for simultaneous removal of micropollutants and biological contaminants arb and args under simulated solar light irradiation g c3n4 resulted in complete inactivation of arb in milliq water and 4 3 log reduction of arb in wastewater effluent furthermore a reduction in the abundance of extracellular args was reported with 98 of blatem 1 and 99 of teta degradation after 120 min of contact time the mechanism of g c3n4 contaminant removal efficacy is mainly attributed to the production of superoxide radicals and holes h 139 a visible light photocatalyst was designed incorporating ternary nanocomposite of g c3n4 rgo and iron oxide that resulted in successful inactivation and complete fragmentation of plasmid containing args puc 18 and pbr 322 the photocatalytic degradation is mainly accredited to five possible mechanisms including photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride relaxation of photogenerated charge carrier by rgo photo fenton activity by iron oxide photocalatylic activity of iron oxide and quenching of electron hole pairs and generation of hydroxyl radical by hydrogen peroxide 140 visible light irradiation of ag agbr g c3n4 was utilized for photocatalytic inactivation of tetracycline resistant e coli as well as the removal of tetracycline resistant genes teta tetm tetq and intl1 141 even black phosphorus demonstrating antibacterial effects is needed to be investigated for its potential to be employed in attenuation of arb and args 122 7 conclusion rapid dissemination of args has recently evolved as an emerging ecological issue that extended its concerning effect to the health care system careful and improved antibiotic usage will assist to preserve drugs thus declining the spread of antibiotic residues args in the environment this review is intended to highlight the extensive application of nanomaterials in the removal of arb and args along with other commonly employed conventional treatment strategies the application of nanotechnology is envisioned as a better strategy to bridge the existing gaps in the effectiveness of arg removal technologies an extensive search for a promising nanomaterial showcasing superior removal performance will always be in progress in depth knowledge on the source and spread of arb and args are outlined for a better understanding of measures to prevent antibiotic resistance with continuous monitoring of args abundance a more detailed understanding of the dissemination pathways and mechanism of args transfer in presence of nanomaterials will benefit the research community in selecting and designing appropriate nanomaterial based removal techniques a brief elucidation of the existing arb and args detection technologies is discussed here there is a vital requirement of optimizing detection technologies along with designing practical easy to operate less time consuming and cost effective lab on chip devices for accurate identification of arb and args determining antibiotic susceptibility profiles will play a key role to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy some considerable research gaps that can be addressed via cross disciplinary efforts are a conducting risk assessment study to estimate the tolerable limit values of arb and args that could be present in wwtp effluent without imposing health problems b investigation of ecotoxicity of args degradation intermediates c examine the effects of different environmental stressors on arg transfer d study on cost effective scale up of removal technology with real water sample and e study and investigate the possibility to reverse resistance mechanism it is highly recommended to integrate these noble and innovative treatment techniques in wwtps for improved removal efficiency of emerging contaminants like arb and args efforts should made to set policies for regulating the indiscriminate use of antibiotics the various noble insights thus discussed in the removal technologies of args could pave the way for sustainable and effective real scale args removal in the near future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12551,antibiotic resistance is widely acknowledged as one of the most challenging global crises at hand antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args are ubiquitously detected as emerging biological contaminants several human lives are currently perished due to untreated infections for the emergence of antibiotic resistance semi metabolized antibiotic residue from human faeces and effluents of the pharmaceutical industry are released into municipal wastewater this in turn triggers the selection of args and arb which eventually seek a way into natural environmental matrices to this end the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials such as enormous surface area and higher surface reactivity benefit them to get nominated as an emerging tool to combat antibiotic resistance as such tremendous research and development efforts are currently underway to achieve meaningful progress in the development and deployment of innovative nanotechnology based treatment strategies with high removal efficacy for args and arb nano enabled water wastewater treatment system offer perquisites of being energy efficient effectual durable and cost effective although nanotechnological approaches are gaining momentum the major challenge in terms of commercialization is that long term efficacy of nano based treatment under realistic conditions remains relatively unknown this review is intended to accentuate the potentiality of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in args and arb removal additionally several noble detection technologies that are currently in use as well as those that are in the process of deployment beyond the laboratory scale are enumerated graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes nanotechnology detection remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the term antibiotic resistance refers to the developed potentiality of certain germs like bacteria and fungi to defend themselves from antibiotics that are designed to destroy them pathogenic strains developing resistance to several antibiotics and commonly used antimicrobial agents leads to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance an ideal example of multi drug resistance is methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa which raises a serious concern to treat hospital acquired infections 1 antibiotics not only find their application as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans but are also used extensively in agriculture as feed additives for poultry and livestock veterinary medicine and biocides in fruit and crop production 2 as stated by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the world is likely to enter the post antibiotic era eventually leading to more people dying of bacterial infections than cancer 3 cdc antibiotic resistance ar threat report 2019 has enlisted potential germs into four different categories namely urgent threats serious threats concerning threats and watch list that requires constant monitoring 4 high profile predictions sprang up that antimicrobial resistance may claim 10 million lives by 2050 if we fail to adopt suitable control measures the emergence of antibiotic resistance has threatened the global health care system due to the potential loss of efficacy of existing antibiotics moreover curtailing of new antibiotic exploration has exacerbated the challenges faced due to antibiotic resistance thereby unfolding the probability of having no defence system against infections in near future 5 antibiotic resistance has serious implications on human health which must be adequately addressed especially in order to achieve the united nations sustainable development goals viz sdg 3 tackling antibiotic resistance adds to higher medical costs prolonged hospitalization and can even lead to increased morbidity and mortality the incapability of using appropriate antibiotics in a timely manner may cause treatment failure in some cases leading to chronic problems ensuing sepsis relapse of infection after treatment and endangering the lives of patients undergoing chemotherapy dialysis organ transplantation and surgery 4 in addition dissemination of args in water creates significant ecotoxicological challenges for the aquatic environment eventually disturbing both aquatic and terrestrial food webs further the polluted water seeps into the soil which in turn contaminates food crops and imperil human and livestock survival 6 excessive and indiscriminate usage of antibiotics has whipped up the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes args in various environments like surface water and groundwater soil ecosystem aquatic ecosystem wastewater effluents and even in drinking water reflecting worst case scenarios 7 8 the greatest pitfall lies in the fact that once args are introduced into the environment they persevere over many generations even in absence of antibiotic selective pressure 9 wastewater treatment plant wwtp which serves as a removal site for common contaminants has been outlined to be the major hotspot of antimicrobial resistance worldwide 7 the build up of antibiotic residues arb and args in the aquatic system may be attributed to the incapability of natural degradation of antibiotics due to their low hydrophilicity and high structural stability 10 the seriousness of the situation is aggravated when antimicrobial residues and resistance determinants cannot be eliminated by most practiced treatment strategies thereby accelerating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance determinants in discharged effluent of municipal wwtps 11 as antibiotic resistance shows no sign of abatement effective treatment strategies ranging from biological to physical chemical methods to combat args and arb are the area of prime focus various remediation technologies with considerable removal efficiencies are in use but the increasing load of args and arb has propelled us to look for improved processes using an advantageous application of nanomaterials nanotechnology offers tremendous technological opportunities in the realm of water treatment it enables proficient ways of handling water treatment problems on small scale as well as large scale in precise and accurate manner for instance nanoparticles are capable of treating contaminants in water by reaching out to depths and locations which other conventional techniques cannot accomplish 12 nanoscale materials are delineated to be more efficacious than bulk materials by virtue of their higher surface area and surface reactivity researchers have fabricated multifarious nanostructured materials for application as high performance sorbents membranes catalysts and sensors in wastewater treatment this review precisely catalogues the different types of nanomaterials that can be widely utilized for elimination of arb and args however it is perplexing to draw comparison among these nanomaterials in terms of their performance because each application may entail different operational parameters nevertheless the specificity of nanomaterials towards the desired pollutant is anticipated to minimize competitive interactions with interfering species and co pollutants 13 globally at least 1 2 million people died on account of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections in 2019 according to the data published by the medical journal lancet 14 therefore detection of arb and args is an absolute requirement for timely and precise diagnosis of the pattern of bacterial antibiotic resistance there is an urgent need for a rapid cost effective and highly sensitive detection platform for amr diagnosis this review presents an in depth analysis of the source and dissemination of args detection technologies and conventional treatment approaches along with the wide scale application of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in mitigation of args and arb 2 source and dissemination of antibiotics and args in the environment args are termed as easy to get hard to lose pollutants since their existence can be spotted in both antibiotic free environments and even after withdrawal of antibiotic selective pressure 15 antibiotic resistance at a very low level may originate due to natural selection whereas the increasing abundance of args and arb in the environment is a direct consequence of human activities it is quite eminent that the unconstrained anthropogenic consumption of antibiotics has given rise to the enhanced gene transfer in bacterial communities and evolution of args 16 studies revealed the prevalence of class i integrons as a substitute to antibiotic pollution that also brings forth the significance of the relationship between anthropogenic impact and the abundance of int1 genes 17 18 four media was described as genetic reactor inducing antibiotic resistance evolution viz a human and animal microbiota b hospitals and healthcare facilities c wastewater and biological residues and d soil and surface or groundwater environment 19 wwtp is regarded as the major anthropogenic source of occurrence and spread of args and land application of manure is considered the animal source 20 indiscriminate discharge of untreated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry releases a considerable amount of antibiotic residues these antibiotics thus released into the environment may be washed by rainwater runoffs into the local water bodies including groundwater 6 notable release of water disinfectant by products may contribute to the elicitation of antibiotic resistance as reported in a study where chlorine and iodoacetic acid resulted in the evolution of resistant escherichia coli strains 21 sewage and hospital discharge are the sources of args of clinically relevant pathogens sediment samples of river water often exhibit high concentrations of antibiotics arb and args primarily due to urban wastewater discharge into the river without appropriate treatment 22 in a biological system the gut microbiome is considered a hotspot of horizontal gene transfer due to its favorable environment for conjugation 23 the research highlighted the prime importance of the food chain in the emergence of arg in humans counter to the antibiotics applied to animals 24 the aquatic microbial community also carries args that bear the potential to transmit them to human and animal pathogens through direct contact with arb present in the aquatic system or passing of args via resistant environmental bacteria 25 biofilms and marine sediments in the natural aquatic ecosystem are also identified as the origin of the transfer maintenance and spread of args biofilms present in the aquatic environment are nowadays emerging as a potent hotspot for the propagation of novel arb and args 26 the sub inhibitory concentration of antibiotics in the soil is believed to be the evolutionary force for the array of resistant genes in soil microbes 27 evidence of soil pollution by antibiotics and antibiotic resistance determinants escalates the likelihood of human pathogen acquiring resistance through mobile genetic elements mges as demonstrated in shuttling of args among distinctly related soil and human microbiome via plasmids and integrons assistance 28 29 broiler feedlots and fishponds designated as an agriculturally influenced region are also regarded as sources of args in the environment 28 30 31 moreover animal husbandry is an added sponsor to the environmental burden of args constructed wetlands also harbor args that mostly originate from domestic sewage 20 municipal solid waste and landfill leachate retain a substantial quantity of antibiotics metals and organic pollutants which may augment the persistence of args 32 needless to say wastewater from antibiotic manufacturing facilities and hospital effluents have the largest contribution to the discharge of antibiotics in the aquatic environment and hence the manifestation of arb and args various sources of antibiotics and args are sketched in fig 1 owing to the meteoric distribution of args across the environment researchers have unanimously endorsed that bacteria avail two main transfer paths i e horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt for spreading antibiotic resistance in the environment 33 stressors like antibiotics metals biocides and preservatives are sometimes deemed responsible for the transfer of bacterial genetic elements 34 35 most significantly mobile genetic elements like plasmids transposons and integrons enact crucial roles in the emergence and spread of args 36 another notable example demonstrating the transfer of multiple args concurrently is the acquirement of gene cassette by mrsa 37 3 detection of args and arb molecular based techniques for detection of args are not only rapid and sensitive but also render multiplex targeting with precise characterization and detection nucleic acid amplification tests namely polymerase chain reaction pcr and loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp are the most widely used detection technologies pcr and qpcr are the most commonly used conventional techniques which are nowadays being replaced with more promising high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr it offers cost effective simultaneous detection of multiple args with a high processing rate and high sensitivity 33 studies reported the use of ht qpcr for args profiling of bacterial isolates obtained from park soil 38 singleplex and multiplex real time pcr provides fast and reliable detection of mrsa in pediatric samples along with differentiation between mrsa and methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus mssa 39 args analysis and profiling can be successfully performed using four distinct ht qpcr platforms i e bio rad cfx384tm biomarktm dynamic array openarray and the most commonly used wafergentm smartchip 40 isothermal amplification methods came up with more recent development than pcr based methods with faster and more sensitive next generation molecular diagnostics lamp helicase dependent amplification had and rolling circle amplification rca is widely applicable isothermal methods for args detection 41 whole genome sequencing wgs bears the prospects for the recognition of all known resistant genes in an isolate metagenomics can be applied reliably for the detection of args since it facilitates investigation of bacterial gene mutations and genomic variations thus providing evidence of being used intensively for environmental args in several studies 42 44 the advantage of whole metagenome sequencing lies in the capability of arg identification directly from clinical specimens without lacking the pre requisite of isolation or identification of specific bacteria 41 a relevant example of the usefulness of metagenomics is reported in a study where it was applied to reveal the degree of contamination by args and mges thereby manifesting a wwtp as a probable hotspot of args dissemination 45 hybridization tests such as dna microarray fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and line probe assay lpa also deliver optimal results of arg detection line probe assay can detect several resistance markers like penicillinases metallo β lactamases spontaneously while fish offers direct detection of resistance markers in bacterial cells researchers developed dna microarray for simultaneous detection of args based on fluorescently labelled pcr products in clinical samples of staphylococcus sp 46 experimentation on clinical isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis for identification of resistance to fluroquinolones rifampicin kanamycin and capreomycin are reported to be performed successfully by pyrosequencing 41 similar examples can also be evinced on using nanopore sequencing such as identification of plasmid pathogen and arg in bacterial dna of blood culture sample using minion nanopore sequencing 47 another study demonstrated the functionality of minion in the identification of bacterial pathogen along with its acquired resistance genes from urine samples without culturing 48 lateral flow immunoassay lfia and nucleic acid lateral flow assay are often employed to detect several resistant markers at once in addition to the aforementioned technologies recent developments on microfluidics based lab on chip loc technologies extend far more convenient cost effective and high throughput analysis researchers fabricated a microfluidic chip with surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers for identification and differentiation between mrsa and mssa 49 resistance genes from escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by a real time ultrafast electronic microdevice employing the recombinase polymerase amplification rpa method for arg identification 50 electrochemical detection of mrsa using a sandwich product of two nanoparticle probes via adsorptive transfer stripping square wave voltammetry method was reported 51 the various detection technologies along with insight into their potential merits and demerits are summarized in table 1 4 remediation technologies in order to combat the spread of args as well as inactivate the pathogens to limit the harm caused by their abundance it is imperative to resort to effective treatment strategies as described in fig 2 4 1 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cws not only harbor a great population of a microbial community but also offer an environmentally friendly inexpensive and simple wastewater treatment approach 52 several characteristics of constructed wetlands like flow type flow configuration and plant species have been proved to affect the removal performance of arb and args 53 a notable decrease of arg content in the effluent of antibiotic wastewater along with the effective exclusion of pathogens were observed in a vertical up flow constructed wetland 54 biodegradation surface adsorption and plant uptake are stated to be the possible ways of degradation of antibiotics and arg 53 similarly matrix adsorption and biological process are reported to be the main course of arg removal in a study where mesocosm scale cws demonstrated 87 8 99 1 removal efficiency of args from antibiotics spiked domestic sewage 55 4 2 anaerobic or aerobic bioreactors aerobic and anaerobic reactors operating in sequence significantly eliminate antibiotics arb and args via biological treatment in addition employing membrane bioreactor mbr along with biological treatment further improves removal efficacy 20 reduction in the concentration of args was reported in anaerobic and anoxic effluent of mbr than aerobic mbr alone 56 anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr was successfully claimed to diminish the load of args and arb into the receiving environment 57 another relevant study compared the efficiency of activated sludge oxidative ditch and rotary biological contractors to report the log removal rates of tetracycline resistant and sulfonamide resistant bacteria with three args including sul1 tetw teto 58 the metagenomics study revealed the competence of anaerobic aerobic sequence aas bioreactor in eliminating 85 of args in influent as compared to individual anaerobic and aerobic reactors 59 biofouling of membrane poses a major disadvantage as it minimizes the removal efficiency of args therefore certain modified anmbr are introduced with the aim of enhancing removal efficacy alongside the mitigation of membrane fouling examples of such modified anmbr include electrochemical membrane bioreactor bio electrochemical coupled anmbr and anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor 33 4 3 adsorption biochar an efficient and sustainable adsorbent with a large specific surface area offers abundant sites for contaminant adsorption biochar is capable of removing potential pathogens in an aquatic environment 60 significant changes in the microbial community are evidenced on the addition of biochar thus considering its effects on the relative abundance of args 61 several studies are conducted on biochar and modified biochar mediated adsorption thereby indicating its interference with args distribution such as the application of biochar decreased arg abundance in livestock wastewater and usage of β cyclodextrin modified biochar also contributed in diminution of relative abundance of total identified args 62 63 likewise biochar treated antibiotic contaminated soil demonstrated its potential to restrain the accumulation of antibiotics arb and args in the tissues of vegetables 64 however a major limitation is the aging of biochar which significantly reduce the adsorption efficiency of args 65 powdered activated carbon pac has been successfully used in several membrane based integration process for efficient removal of arb and args 66 other biobased adsorbents like sulfate calcined eggshells iron oxide coated sand and sewage sludge biochar have been developed to study their potential in reducing the dissemination risk of args and arb 67 68 similarly non biobased adsorbents like ceo2 have shown promising results in removal of free dna harboring args 69 implementation of adsorption technique for wastewater treatment at an industrial scale may turn out to be beneficial owing to its cost effectiveness facile operation and easy scalability however certain bottlenecks like toxicity of adsorbent material leaching of nanomaterial adsorbent into the ecosystem renewability of adsorbents and perplexity of manipulating ph in wastewater treatment plant for highly ph dependent adsorption still limits its practical usage here the greatest drawback of adsorption technique is the concern of ultimate fate of args since elution of adsorbed args and arb will further occur into different environmental matrices thereby evoking questions on post treatment disposal 4 4 disinfection disinfection is the most widely used treatment for the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms chlorination is the widely applied disinfection strategy due to the easy availability and effectiveness of chlorine disinfectant besides ozone and uv radiation are also employed as routine disinfectants in wastewater treatment plants for removal of arb and args researchers already investigated the effectiveness of using chlorine disinfectant in the removal of different antibiotics including ciprofloxacin rifampicin tetracycline vancomycin and many others alongside its effect in arb and args deactivation 20 during chlorination of biological molecules in solution hocl reacts with selective functional groups of biomolecules like sulfhydryl group of glutathione purine and pyrimidine of nucleobases and organosulfur or aromatic moieties of amino acids 70 71 different doses of chlorine were utilized to inactivate 9 different arb along with successful removal of args erea ereb ermb and teta tetb tetm and teto with removal of 60 and 20 respectively 72 simultaneous removal of args and arb namely escherichia coli and enterococcus faecium was obtained within 30 min of chlorine disinfection 73 nevertheless usage of chlorine disinfection is not currently preferred as chlorination leads to the generation of carcinogenic by products 74 a study reported chlorination to be the most effective process for inactivation of args than uv irradiation and ozonation when experimented using args including sul1 tetg and inti1 75 interestingly sequential uv chlorination treatment was found more advantageous in terms of arg removal efficiency than either uv irradiation or chlorination alone when investigated using args sul1 tetx tetg inti 1 obtained from municipal wwtp 37 merging conventional disinfection processes like chlorination and ionizing radiation with advanced technologies like advanced oxidation process aop will be highly beneficial in the elimination of args 33 a notable study demonstrated the potential of ionizing radiation assisted peroxymonosulfate oxidation system in the elimination of antibiotics and args 76 other disinfectants like hydrogen peroxide peracetic acid paa and sodium hypochlorite are also explored in successful targeting of arb 77 80 paa is reported to remove 99 9 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria within 20 min 80 disinfection technologies are advantageous because of their affordability simplicity and brief contact time nevertheless disinfection technologies are often restricted due to their inherent shortcomings like production of pernicious disinfection by products dbps or toxic chemical residues like bromate or nitrosamines concomitantly it has been observed that bacterial inactivation via disinfection may not always cause degradation of intracellular args which adds to its disadvantage 71 sometimes biocidal agents like triclosan and benzalkonium chloride that are used for disinfection can themselves augment antibiotic resistance 79 nevertheless usage of chlorine disinfection is not currently preferred as chlorination leads to the generation of carcinogenic by products 74 4 5 advanced oxidation process advanced oxidation process aop employing uv h2o2 fenton reagent ozone photocatalyst and so on are popular treatment strategies with wide applicability aops involve the generation of free radicals such as oh so4 and o2 which consequently damages cell surface and dna structures thereupon inactivating pathogens and removing args 81 different aop technology aiming to eliminate args is discussed as follows 4 5 1 fenton and fenton like processes fenton is a popular water treatment process where hydroxyl radicals oh are produced through reaction of fe2 with h2o2 in the solar driven fenton process fe2 is regenerated from photo reduced fe3 generated in fenton reaction 82 solar fenton system resulted in complete removal of antibiotics along with 5 log reduction of arb sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin resistant enterococci 83 photo fenton process significantly killed 6 17 log arb harboring teta and blatem args within 30 min under visible light irradiation 84 more interestingly combining the fenton process with alkaline or microwave treatment demonstrated successful mitigation of target args 85 4 5 2 ozonation ozone being a powerful oxidant is another choice of water treatment where pollutants are either removed through direct o3 oxidation or indirectly via decomposition of o3 generating free radicals 86 ozonation resulted in 34 5 to 49 2 removal efficiency of sulfonamide resistance genes and tetracycline genes in secondary sewage 87 however in some cases ozonation has been found to be the least effective method in the inactivation of args as compared to fenton oxidation uv irradiation and chlorination 75 4 5 3 uv h2o2 attributing to its strong oxidizing ability uv h2o2 is the most widely used aop with growing interest towards removal of arb and args 33 the generated oh radical targets bacterial dna and arg structure thus inducing damage 88 uv h2o2 is reported to improve the removal efficiency of arb and args 89 however scavenging of oh radical by cellular components can result in an insignificant role of oh in damage of intracellular args 90 4 5 4 ultrasonic another category of aop implemented in wastewater treatment due to its ability to generate free radicles like oh is ultrasonic and is thus widely applicable for pathogen removal 91 researchers reported the utility of the ultrasonic technique as a pre treatment in the elimination of args 92 moreover the combined uv radiation ultrasonic technique displayed higher arg removal efficiency than the single ultrasonic technique 93 the only limitation of this technique is the high energy consumption since low energy and low frequency ultrasonic waves are reported to be insufficient in the elimination of pathogens 33 4 5 5 sulfate radical based aops this aop technique is tagged as a low cost highly selective oxidation process that gained popularity due to the long lifetime of so4 that plays a significant role in args degradation 94 there is evidence of so4 being the predominant reactive radicle species in heat activated persulfate reduction of args namely erma ermb ereb 95 a study reported the utility of gamma radiation activated persulfate system in the efficient elimination of args and inactivation of arb 96 4 5 6 photocatalytic processes high solar utilization and low cost offer an advantage in favor of photocatalyst for the elimination of contaminants reactive oxygen species viz o2 oh 1o2 generated during the photocatalytic process enables the effective elimination of arb and degradation of args experimentation using solar simulated nitrogen doped tio2 photocatalysis was performed to investigate its potential in inactivating multi drug resistant e coli strain 97 similarly uv a tio2 photocatalysis resulted in 1 3 log removal of arb namely vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis vre methicillin resistant s aureus and multi drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii mdrab 98 another study examined the effect of photocatalysis on arg transfer in urban wastewater using two antibiotic resistant and one antibiotic sensitive strain of e coli 99 table 2 presents a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various remediation technologies for eliminating args and arbs from environmental matrices 5 perspective in employing nanotechnology for removal of args and arb advanced nanotechnological approach is shaping water and wastewater treatment technologies the several unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials render them unparallel attributes in terms of sorption capacity surface reactivity and dissolution ability 39 in addition the enormous specific surface area and high porosity of most nanomaterials opens a plethora of opportunities to utilize them in various treatment technologies for the removal of arb and args moreover rational tuning of the microstructure and surface chemistry of nanomaterials can give rise to original material systems with novel functionalities and therefore enhanced removal performance towards arb and args 11 material size is proclaimed to affect material properties thus size effects play a crucial role a decrease in nanomaterial size is reported to enhance surface energy decrease melting point and favor in vivo effectiveness 100 to reflect on how the morphology of nanomaterials make them a suitable option researchers documented that the interior of nanomaterials permits easy penetration of antimicrobials enzymes and photosensitizers thereby extending a high degree of damage further the shape of functionalized nanomaterials tends to improve the local adhesive forces thereby boosting contact killing for instance nano blade and nano knive types of graphene oxide go display sharp edges that can cause intracellular cell leakage via cell membrane penetration ultimately leading to cell death 101 102 most importantly the strong antimicrobial properties of different nanomaterials make them particularly suitable for killing antibiotic resistant microbes besides the potential toxicity of certain engineered nanomaterials may also be exploited to combat args the use of nanomaterials is widely debatable due to their action towards antibiotic resistance some nanomaterials display antibacterial activity making them a suitable defence against multi drug resistance while a few are reported to exhort the development of antibiotic resistance in the environment 103 104 the advisability of implementing nanotechnology depends on its commendable advantages like cost reduction in long term water treatment once technology is adopted reduced time and energy consumption and minimal waste generation as compared to bulk materials in conventional techniques other benefits include increased effectiveness in contaminant removal due to increased specificity of nanomaterials and simplicity of operation 105 in spite of the aforementioned the practical applications of nanotechnology in eliminating arb and args are currently limited in the wake of hinderance imposed in commercialization of nanoengineered materials this is mainly subjected to their impacts on aquatic matrices considering which several studies are conducted to evaluate the risk associated with nanomaterials contradictory results from many studies coupled with stringent laws and regulations in some countries have limited the production of nanomaterials and restrained their usage in water treatment 6 nanotechnology and args the unique physiochemical properties of nanomaterials were accredited for empowering them to combat antibiotic resistance mechanisms nanotechnology brings forth a vast array of nanosensors nanosorbents nanostructured materials nanophotocatalysts for the detection and removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes from the surrounding environment the antimicrobial mechanism of nanomaterials portrayed in fig 3 is outlined as follows a oxidative stress induction or precisely ros generation b disruption of cell membrane causing cytoplasmic leakage c induction of intracellular antibacterial effects such as binding and disruption of intracellular components like dna and proteins d electrolyte imbalance on account of electron transport disruption and e nanomaterial used as cargo for drug delivery may enter bacterial cells via membrane fusion 3 106 the efficacy of various nanomaterials that are currently being considered for treating arb and args are presented in table 3 it is well known that biofilm matrix exhibits as a barrier to antibiotics thereupon conferring antibiotic resistance biofilms are habitually formed by gram positive staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and are mostly antibiotic resistant since conventional antibiotics cannot exterminate biofilms completely superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were found efficacious in treating antibiotic resistant biofilms formed by staphylococcus aureus 101 researchers used photothermal action of gold nanostar gns monolayer in the eradication of staphylococcus aureus biofilms 107 tio2 photocatalytic inactivation of three antibiotic resistance bacteria methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii mdrab and vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis vre was successfully examined thereby tagging tio2 as a useful candidate in the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria 98 intensifying x ray irradiation with the addition of nanoparticles is another novel strategy to kill multi drug resistant bacteria such experimental strategy was demonstrated when a greater percentage of mdr pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in presence of bismuth nanoparticles that enhanced x ray irradiation by 35 times higher than that without nanoparticles 108 chitosan stabilized gold nanoparticles exhibited antibacterial activity against biofilm forming antibiotic resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa 109 different solid lipid nanoparticle sln formulations were developed to reduce antibiotic resistance mechanisms 110 the effect of metal oxide nanoparticles monps on the lateral transfer of args was explored in a study where zno al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles were observed to bind with phosphate groups and bases of puc19 plasmid thereby suppressing lateral transfer of puc19 plasmid carrying ampicillin resistant gene into escherichia coli dh5α 111 silver modified mesoporous nanosilica ag ms demonstrated antibacterial activity against mdr strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa thereby hoping to render a propitious application in the reduction of antibiotic resistant bacteria 112 researchers investigated the ability of enzyme functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles in destroying methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa biofilms thereby providing a promising therapeutic approach to treat staphylococcus aureus biofilm associated infection 113 zero valent iron nanoparticles are reported to significantly eliminate the antibiotic resistance genes of heterotrophic bacteria including tetw tetracycline ctx m 32 ceftazidime and cmla1 chloramphenicol from wastewater 114 ceo2 nanoparticles were applied to study the modulation of args transfer between escherichia coli in the context of nanoagrotechnology where low concentration 1 and 5 mg l 1 of ceo2 nanoparticles inhibited the conjugative transfer of rp4 plasmid by 22 26 however higher concentration displayed the opposite effect the effectivity in low dosage can be accounted for decreased ros level reduced intercellular contact through suppression of polysaccharides synthesis in extracellular polymeric substance and shortage of atp supply repressing the expression of plasmid transfer genes 115 zero valent iron nanoparticles decrease the abundance of args in landfill leachate via the reduction of mobile genetic elements mge the shift in the bacterial community as seen in network analysis is significant in explaining changed arg patterns 116 a study explored the use of a bimetallic system to combat antibiotic resistance where nanoscale copper in mfe ncu system imparted args removal efficiency from post treated swine wastewater the absolute abundance of five args and class i integrase gene inti1 were significantly reduced by mfe ncu process 117 researchers embarked on a newer approach to look for nanomaterials to combat antibiotic resistance based on the interfacial interactions between args and metallic nanomaterials causing adsorption and fragmentation of args a comparison study was carried out between nanoscale titanium dioxide ntio2 and nano zero valent iron n zvi on the adsorption and desorption study of args tetm carrying plasmid n zvi not only exhibited a higher adsorption rate and capacity for args in contrast to ntio2 but also the desorbed args from n zvi were disintegrated into small irrelevant dna base fragments contrary to the intact args desorbed from ntio2 118 it was found that the proportion of microcystis aeruginosa is associated with the abundance of args in wastewater in this context carbon based copper nanocomposite ccn was found to flocculate microcystis aeruginosa in urban water to a notable level thus impairing the moveability potential of args mediated by mobile genetic elements like plasmid and lowering the abundance of args 119 in view of addressing the problem of increased discharge of nano metal oxides nmos in wastewater researchers explored the possibility of using the toxicity of nmos in the natural attenuation of arb in wastewater exposure to nmos like nzno ncuo and ntio2 for longer retention time gave excellent results killing 45 62 of arb through the dissolution of ions from nmos thus eliciting ros induced cell death they are also reported to reduce antibiotic tolerance by 11 58 4 via direct attachment to nmos triggering arg mutations and stress response among cells 120 pvdf membrane was functionalized with tio2 nanoparticles to design a photocatalytic reactive membrane for arb and arg removal after exposure to uv irradiation plasmid encoded args flor sul1 sul2 as well as inti1 inti2 and inti3 integrons were removed via photocatalytic degradation thus confirming the efficiency of tio2 in controlling horizontal transfer potential of args 13 novel functionalized nanomaterials like lipopolysaccharide lps imprinted polymer films lps mip and quaternary ammonium functionalized kaolin microparticles qas k when used in tandem gave excellent arg removal efficiency three args namely sul1 teto and meca could be eliminated below the detection limit and others blactxm ermb and qnrs hgt related inti1 were found to undergo a sharp decline in log reduction 7 the pairing of crispr cas9 genome editing technology with nanotechnology has been applied in targeting antibiotic resistance and bacterial pathogen polymer derivatized cas9 endonuclease is complexed with sg rna to form cr nanocomplex targeting methicillin resistance gene meca cr nanocomplex can be delivered into mrsa for editing bacterial genome with high efficacy and minimizing the growth of mrsa thereupon manifesting a novel strategy to mitigate antibiotic resistance 121 6 1 2d nanomaterials photocatalytic inactivation of arb and args rely upon several factors including cell structure type of antibiotic nature of the catalyst and interactions between cell and catalyst 122 the key inactivation mechanism of arb and args by photocatalyst is via generation of ros causing cell damage the desirability of using 2d nanomaterials comes from the array of opportunities they offer specifically in terms of high specific surface area excellent photocatalytic properties along with effective physical and chemical interactions with microorganisms 123 124 2d photocatalyst can be tuned with many modifications like doping addition of polymer enzymes metal oxides nanoparticles and even antibiotics to obtain necessary properties needed for attenuating arb and args 122 it is reported that 2d photocatalyst facilitates binding of bacteria onto catalyst surface thereby causing membrane damage which aids to attack the genetic material via increased permeability 125 since graphene based nanomaterials display high photothermal conversion efficiency under nir irradiation researchers investigated a novel approach of dual mode phototherapy where co irradiation of daylight and nir laser gave 99 efficiency against antibiotic resistant bacteria nanographene oxide based bovine serum albumin aie ngo bsa aie nanoparticles upon co irradiation were tested against amoxicillin resistant escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus where the heat produced under nir laser irradiation and ros produced under daylight were sufficient to kill bacteria 126 researchers have proposed another neoteric idea to fabricate lanthanum hydroxide and go nanocomposite la go to mitigate resistant bacteria without engendering antimicrobial resistance evolution la go was found beneficial towards the inactivation of arb on a range of tested resistant strains e coli displaying remarkable ineptitude to evolve secondary resistance to la go primarily due to extracellular multitarget invasion killing mechanism encompassing lipid peroxidation lipid dephosphorylation and peptidoglycan disruption 127 molecular imprinting was reported to augment the potency and selectivity of the photocatalytic process which was found beneficial in reducing the dissemination of args in wastewater molecular imprinting of graphitic carbon nitride with guanine was useful in degrading plasmid encoded arg bla ndm 1 through enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic degradation fragmentation and complete inactivation of bla ndm 1 minimized the potential for arg repair by transformed bacteria 128 although fe2o3 facilitates conjugative transfer decoration of mos2 is seen to change the biological properties of fe2o3 it therefore appears that mos2 fe2o3 nanocomposite is competent of inhibiting horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes mos2 is reported to upregulate global regulating gene trba thereupon inhibiting the expression of downstream genes of conjugative transfer namely traf and trbb along with plasmid encoding protein trfa 129 a separate study scrutinized peg functionalized mos2 nanoflowers for inhibition of tetracycline resistant bacillus tropicalis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia the superior photothermal conversion ability of peg mos2 nfs was used to generate nir laser induced high temperature that significantly expedited glutathione oxidation causing rapid death of antibiotic resistant bacteria via disruption of their intracellular protection system 130 go of different lateral sizes is observed to disturb the base stacking mode and double helix structure of dna leading to partial cleavage of supercoiled plasmid dna through intercalation as a result of go plasmid dna interactions it can be effectively used to inhibit the amplification and transformation of kanamycin resistant gene apha containing plasmid dna 131 another recent study highlighted the effectual use of go nanosheets as a novel adsorbent for the removal of both cyclic and double stranded args from a natural water sample the mechanism of args teta sul2 ermb and ampc adsorption by go nanosheets was accounted to the chemical binding of aromatic nucleic acid along with strong π stacking interactions owing to the presence of abundant oxygen containing groups and π bonding system of go nanosheet 132 go is believed to lower the abundance of tetracycline resistance gene teta and kanamycin resistance gene apha as well as lessen the frequency of conjugative transfer when used in high concentration through notable dna damage of rp4 plasmid consequently teta and apha gene on the plasmid is also impaired leading to mitigation of args abundance and reduced level of bacterial resistance to antibiotics 133 go was reported to reduce the copy numbers of args and mges by restraining horizontal gene transfer 134 experimental evidence was obtained on alleviation of selective pressure generated by antibiotics on microbes by go particularly go suppressed the transfer frequency of class i integron via p dna go interactions curtailing arg propagation 135 a novel tio2 ag go nanocomposite was fabricated to study its arb vitality and its effect on antibiotic resistance dissemination tio2 ag go under simulated sunlight irradiation significantly reduced bacterial survival to 12 2 and bacterial tolerance to tetracycline it was furthermore concluded that with tio2 ag go the promotion rate of args was limited as compared to other nanomaterials 136 ag tio2 go is also explored as an advanced oxidation process aop catalyst wherein it showed outstanding removal efficacy for intracellular args like teta and ampc along with extracellular args in model solution and secondary wastewater effluent ag tio2 go catalyst combined with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane was tested for its application in wastewater treatment thereupon showcasing its synergistic interfacial adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation for inactivation of args 137 biogenic agnps produced by fusarium oxysporum were wisely used to decorate go to design bio goag nanocomposite this demonstrated excellent antibiofilm activity with 100 inhibition of salmonella typhimurium cells adhered to stainless steel surface 160 tio2 reduced go tio2 rgo composite demonstrated complete inactivation of antibiotic resistant escherichia coli and removal of ampicillin resistant ampc gene under solar radiation 138 four multi drug arbs were isolated from secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant to examine the ability of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 mediated photocatalysis on enhanced inactivation of arb g c3n4 irradiated by simulated solar light increased the log inactivation of arb isolates more than compared to irradiation in absence of g c3n4 105 another study exploited the photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 for simultaneous removal of micropollutants and biological contaminants arb and args under simulated solar light irradiation g c3n4 resulted in complete inactivation of arb in milliq water and 4 3 log reduction of arb in wastewater effluent furthermore a reduction in the abundance of extracellular args was reported with 98 of blatem 1 and 99 of teta degradation after 120 min of contact time the mechanism of g c3n4 contaminant removal efficacy is mainly attributed to the production of superoxide radicals and holes h 139 a visible light photocatalyst was designed incorporating ternary nanocomposite of g c3n4 rgo and iron oxide that resulted in successful inactivation and complete fragmentation of plasmid containing args puc 18 and pbr 322 the photocatalytic degradation is mainly accredited to five possible mechanisms including photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride relaxation of photogenerated charge carrier by rgo photo fenton activity by iron oxide photocalatylic activity of iron oxide and quenching of electron hole pairs and generation of hydroxyl radical by hydrogen peroxide 140 visible light irradiation of ag agbr g c3n4 was utilized for photocatalytic inactivation of tetracycline resistant e coli as well as the removal of tetracycline resistant genes teta tetm tetq and intl1 141 even black phosphorus demonstrating antibacterial effects is needed to be investigated for its potential to be employed in attenuation of arb and args 122 7 conclusion rapid dissemination of args has recently evolved as an emerging ecological issue that extended its concerning effect to the health care system careful and improved antibiotic usage will assist to preserve drugs thus declining the spread of antibiotic residues args in the environment this review is intended to highlight the extensive application of nanomaterials in the removal of arb and args along with other commonly employed conventional treatment strategies the application of nanotechnology is envisioned as a better strategy to bridge the existing gaps in the effectiveness of arg removal technologies an extensive search for a promising nanomaterial showcasing superior removal performance will always be in progress in depth knowledge on the source and spread of arb and args are outlined for a better understanding of measures to prevent antibiotic resistance with continuous monitoring of args abundance a more detailed understanding of the dissemination pathways and mechanism of args transfer in presence of nanomaterials will benefit the research community in selecting and designing appropriate nanomaterial based removal techniques a brief elucidation of the existing arb and args detection technologies is discussed here there is a vital requirement of optimizing detection technologies along with designing practical easy to operate less time consuming and cost effective lab on chip devices for accurate identification of arb and args determining antibiotic susceptibility profiles will play a key role to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy some considerable research gaps that can be addressed via cross disciplinary efforts are a conducting risk assessment study to estimate the tolerable limit values of arb and args that could be present in wwtp effluent without imposing health problems b investigation of ecotoxicity of args degradation intermediates c examine the effects of different environmental stressors on arg transfer d study on cost effective scale up of removal technology with real water sample and e study and investigate the possibility to reverse resistance mechanism it is highly recommended to integrate these noble and innovative treatment techniques in wwtps for improved removal efficiency of emerging contaminants like arb and args efforts should made to set policies for regulating the indiscriminate use of antibiotics the various noble insights thus discussed in the removal technologies of args could pave the way for sustainable and effective real

removal process based on anammox is considered the most economical and effective biological n removal technology for municipal sewage treatment 1 2 it is also a core technology to realize energy self sufficiency in municipal sewage treatment plants stps and has broad application prospects 3 4 in the anammox reaction the common substrates for anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob including a certain proportion between ammonium and nitrite the stoichiometric ratio between ammonium and nitrite was 1 1 32 5 is required however nitrite concentrations are often very low in municipal sewage thus partial nitrification pn is a prerequisite process of anammox referred to as pn coupled anammox pn a in this process on the one hand nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob compete with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob for dissolved oxygen do on the other hand it compete with anaob for nitrite 6 therefore the nitrite which aob generate in the pn reaction can be oxidized to nitrate by nob which interferes with the anammox reaction consequently unstable and unsustainable pn caused by insufficient inhibition of nob activity continuously all is a bottleneck restricting the application of the pn a process under mainstream conditions 7 under mainstream conditions various regulatory strategies have been widely used to suppress nob such as do control alternating aerobic and anoxic conditions and short srt 3 8 among these alternating aerobic and anoxic conditions produced stable nob inhibition however its operation is complex and n removal efficiency is generally as low as 0 05 kg m3 d 9 therefore for operational regulation in mainstream conditions do and short srt control are considered the most feasible strategies for the growth of aob and nob do is a shared and important substrate thus do has been considered a key factor in inhibiting nob activity some scholars 10 found that the growth rate of aob became lower than that of nob when do concentration increased from 0 5 to 2 5 mg l conversely the growth rate of aob was significantly higher than that of nob when do was maintained below 0 5 mg l laureni et al 11 also observed the activity of nob would be decreased by reducing do from 1 2 to 0 17 mg l therefore it is widely believed that low do level is an effective strategy to inhibit nob the inhibition effects are based on the saturation coefficient of oxygen for nob 1 52 mg l 12 being higher than for aob 0 60 mg l 13 thus aob has a higher affinity for do cui et al 14 observed that nitrite accumulation efficiency niae remained above 90 during the first 30 days of reactor operation under the condition of low do i e 0 5 mg l indicating nob activity was inhibited however continuing to run under this condition do 0 5 mg l the niae value gradually declined from day 70 on dropping below 10 on day 130 and the inhibition of nob activity finally failed a parallel phenomenon has been observed experimentally by other scholars 15 hence a single low do control could not achieve a sustainable and stable nob inhibition therefore combining do regulation with other strategies is expected to achieve stable nob inhibition at mainstream conditions controlling sludge retention time srt is a conventional strategy to manage the dominant functional microorganisms some scholars e g 16 noted that nob growth rate was higher than aob when water temperature was below 20 c thus it was not feasible to flush nob from the system using srt while at water temperatures of 20 35 c the growth rate of nob was much lower than that of aob 16 an appropriate srt shorter than the generation time of nob but longer than that of aob was feasible to eliminate the nob from the pn reactor 10 at the changi 17 and southwest 18 stps short srts of 2 5 d and 3 5 d were adopted to achieve stable pn in another study 19 water temperature was maintained at 30 1 c the srt was reduced from 30 d to 20 d when the do was controlled as low as 0 3 mg l in the pn reactor consequently the activity of nob declined from 7 5 to 1 8 mg o2 g vss moreover the activity of aob decreased rapidly from 27 9 to 18 7 mg o2 g vss resulting in a sharp decrease in n removal performance in their study massive biomass loss was observed during the regulation of srt from 30 to 20 d causing the reactor to crash therefore it was necessary to explore an appropriate sludge discharge strategy for solving the problem of controlling target srt and ensuring reasonable biomass in the reactor further influent ammonium was generally 40 60 mg l at mainstream conditions thus a low influent total nitrogen load rate nlr approximately 0 1 0 2 kg m3 d has been widely adopted in many pn a reactors 20 24 nevertheless there are very few research on the influence of high influent nlr on pn under mainstream conditions activated sludge models asms are mathematical methods that express the complex biological reaction process between various pollutants in sewage and different functional microorganisms in activated sludge asms include rate equations that describe aob and nob growth and decay as well as kinetic parameters used to assess influence of external environmental factors and operational strategies on reaction rate presently asms have been applied to the study of pn soliman and eldyasti 25 obtained optimal pn operational data using such a model and proved that the calibrated model could simulate rapid shift of pn by operational conditions gu et al 26 determined do concentrations and srts required for nob inhibition at different temperatures using the model moreover their experimental study demonstrated model validity to address these problems a continuous flow completely mixed reactor was constructed and a model was established according to the configuration of the reactor the influence of diverse influent nlrs on pn was simulated at low do combined with short srt based upon the model under mainstream conditions in addition different sludge discharge strategies were simulated and explored with the model under high and low influent nlr to explore the control of short srt finally according to the simulated results suitable influent nlr conditions and sludge discharge strategy were verified in an experimental study with the combined control of low do and short srt 2 methodology 2 1 structure and operating condition of the experimental reactor a continuous flow completely mixed reactor fig 1 was constructed with cylindrical plexiglass its actual volume was 32 l an electric stirrer 100 rpm as well as an online monitoring probes wtw 9430 germany for water temperature ph and do were installed in the reactor the upper part of the reactor had a sample connection for convenient sampling moreover the bottom part was equipped with an aeration ring to provide do for microbial growth the aeration capacity was adjusted with a rotor flowmeter to regulate the required do level the influent and effluent flow was controlled with peristaltic pumps bt100 2 j baoding longer china water temperature was regulated between 25 and 32 c with a film heater the reactor was coated with material impervious to light to avoid the influence of algal growth on the results of the experiment based on controlled influent nlr changes the 105 day operational period could be divided into four phases table 1 2 2 inoculated sludge and wastewater the flocculent sludge inoculated in the reactor was derived from a pilot scale activated sludge reactor with stable pn 27 and a nitrite accumulation efficiency was above 90 the sludge concentration reached 3905 mg l after inoculation in the reactor synthetic inorganic wastewater after c and p resources were recovered was adopted in the experiment nh4hco3 and nahco3 were used to provide ammonium 40 60 mg l and alkalinity 400 600 mg l in respective the influent ph was kept at 8 0 0 3 according to van der star et al 28 trace element i and ii solutions in synthetic wastewater were 1 0 ml l and 1 25 ml l respectively table 2 the mineral elements were kh2po4 27 2 mg l cacl2 2h2o 180 mg l and mgso4 7h2o 300 mg l 2 3 chemical analyses and calculations ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined with nessler s uv spectrophotometric and n 1 naphthalene ethylenediamine methods respectively 29 mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured with the standard gravimetric method 29 the ammonium conversion efficiency ace and nitrite accumulation efficiency niae were calculated to assess aob and nob activity based on eqs 1 and 2 the n loading rate nlr of the influent was calculated based on eq 3 1 ace n h 4 n inf n h 4 n eff n h 4 n inf 100 2 niae n o 2 n eff n h 4 n inf n h 4 n eff 100 3 nlr tn inf 24 hrt 1000 with tn inf nh4 n

all in mg l are ammonium and nitrite concentrations of the effluent respectively hrt h is the hydraulic retention time of the reactor 2 4 mathematical model an activated sludge 2d model 30 and a modified vesilind model were implemented in the biowin software to simulate the impact of nlr and sludge discharge strategy on the growth and decay of nob and aob the simulation was conducted with a continuous stirred tank reactor and ideal sludge separation mode the critical kinetic parameters for characterizing the growth of nob and aob including substrate half saturation coefficients and maximum specific growth rates were set referred to the study of gu et al 26 maximum vesilind settling velocity was set to 170 m d 31 to simulate the solid liquid separation process in the settling pond influent ammonium concentration alkalinity and ph were set to 55 mg l 500 mg l and 8 respectively in the model nitrite nitrate and cod level were all set to 0 mg l in the influent and tp level was set to 1 mg l in the influent to maintain microbial growth the do level was set to 0 27 mg l in the continuously stirred tank reactor the water temperature and srt were set to 25 c and 10 d respectively other initial and boundary conditions were set on the basis of the experimental device a steady state simulation was carried out to simulate the influence of diverse nlrs on pn hrts of 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 h were created by regulating the influent flow thus different nlr conditions were established according to eq 3 at high and low influent nlrs of 0 52 and 0 10 kg m3 d two different sludge discharge strategies were simulated i e a sludge discharge directly from the completely mixed reactor and b sludge discharge from the bottom part of the settling pond the srt was controlled according to the daily amount of sludge discharged the daily sludge discharge amount q m3 d was calculated on the basis of eqs 4 and 5 by discharging sludge from the complete mixed reactor and the bottom part of the settling pond respectively under the scenario of shortening the srt from 30 to 10 d dynamic state simulations were conducted to simulate the effects of different sludge discharge strategies on pn the steady state simulation results were taken as the initial conditions of the dynamic simulation 4 q v srt 5 q vr 1 r srt where v m3 is the actual volume of the reactor srt d is the target sludge retention time to be controlled and r is the sludge return ratio i e the ratio of the returned sludge flow to the influent flow here r was assumed to be 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of n conversion and biomass under different nlr conditions when nlr was controlled at 0 66 kg m3 d at an hrt of 2 h 94 0 ammonium was converted and 96 7 nitrite accumulated in the reactor fig 2 indicating aob activity was high the activity of nob was effectively repressed by a low do of 0 27 mg l and a short srt of 10 d the nlr decreased to 0 33 kg m3 d when the hrt was extended to 4 h the ace stayed at 96 0 and the niae dropped to 79 8 thus high aob activity was maintained but nob activity recovered slightly by decreasing the nlr when extending the hrt further to 6 h the nlr was 0 22 kg m3 d the ace remained at a high level of 98 3 while the niae dropped further to 55 1 fig 2 as the nlr was diminished to 0 17 kg m3 d using an hrt of 8 h 98 4 ammonium was converted in contrast only 15 2 nitrite was accumulated and most ammonium was oxidized to nitrate showing nob suppression failed as the hrt was further extended from 10 to 14 h the corresponding influent nlr reduced from 0 13 to 0 09 kg m3 d but the ace was still high 98 5 in contrast niae values were low 2 9 3 8 and ammonium was virtually completely transformed into nitrate indicating the nob inhibition was ineffective at low nlrs of 0 09 0 13 kg m3 d a short srt of 10 d and a low do of 0 27 mg l therefore the ace was always stable above 94 as the nlr reduced from 0 66 to 0 09 kg m3 d by controlling the hrt while the niae decreased gradually from 96 7 to 2 9 fig 2 under the conditions of low do and short srt influent nlr had a significant impact on nob inhibition moreover aob activity was not decreased the simulation results revealed that nlrs should be kept at 0 33 0 66 kg m3 d to suppress nob activity when nlr was below 0 22 kg m3 d nob proliferated under low do and short srt conditions the mlvss decreased steadily from 1302 to 259 mg l in the reactor aob biomass decreased from 354 to 61 mg l when extending hrt from 2 to 14 h accordingly the nlr decreased from 0 66 to 0 09 kg m3 d fig 2 consequently microbial biomass was affected by nlr in the present study a lower nlr resulted in lower microbial biomass in the reactor at the low do and short srt however nob biomass increased from 2 7 to 78 3 mg l by decreasing nlr from 0 66 to 0 22 kg m3 d and then continually reduced to 37 7 mg l when the nlr further declined to 0 09 kg m3 d accordingly during the entire simulated nlr decline the ratio value of nob aob was elevated from 0 01 to 0 62 fig 2 it revealed that nob activity was repressed by the combined controlling of low do level and short srt at high nlrs of 0 33 0 66 kg m3 d under the condition of low influent nlrs 0 22 kg m3 d the nob aob ratio reached 0 57 0 62 nob aob ratios close to 0 8 were reported for a complete nitrification system 18 thus apparent nob proliferation appeared in the reactor at an nlr 0 22 kg m3 d the trends in n conversion and biomass due to nlr changes fig 1 confirmed that an appropriate nlr was critical to achieving inhibition of nob activity at low do and short srt high nlrs inhibited nob activity under low do and short srt conditions according to the literature 17 35 the influent nlr in the strass and changi stps which have both achieved stable and sustainable pn with the combined regulation of do and srt were as high as 1 06 and 0 91 kg m3 d in the aerobic zone respectively however mainstream pn a processes were generally carried out at low nlrs of 0 11 0 16 kg m3 d 20 22 24 accordingly the successful application of short srts combined with low do inhibiting nob activity was limited in both lab reactors and other municipal sewage treatment plants under mainstream conditions this was also validated by our simulations which showed that high nlrs might be critical in achieving stable pn combined with srt and do regulation 3 2 simulation of n conversion and biomass with different sludge discharge strategies when the target srt was shortened from 30 to 10 d with sludge discharge from the reactor with constant daily flow strategy a under the condition of high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d mlvss decreased sharply at the beginning of the dynamic simulation and reached the lowest value of 444 mg l on day 35 fig 3a then it rose gradually from day 36 on and finally remained at around 490 mg l on day 60 when srt was reduced from 30 to 10 d increasing the amount of sludge discharged daily was necessary the mlvss gradually decreased from the initial value of 1665 mg l with the decrease of mlvss the amount of discharged solid sludge should also decrease gradually on the other hand the sludge load should increase with the decrease in mlvss in the reactor theoretically the amount of sludge produced should increase accordingly in the present study nob and aob which accumulated in the reactor belonged to the main physiological groups of autotrophic microorganisms they obtain energy by chemosynthesis using inorganic c and inorganic n as c and n sources therefore the growth rate of autotrophic microorganisms is extremely low when the amount of sludge discharged was much larger than the number of microorganisms produced mlvss decreased sharply in the reactor simulated mlvss showed a linear downward trend from day 1 to 10 in the dynamic simulation with increasing simulation time to day 35 the actual quantity of solid sludge discharged diminished continuously due to the decrease of mlvss fig 3a when the amount of sludge discharged was lower than the production of microorganisms biomass accumulated and the mlvss began to rise in the reactor from days 36 to 60 fig 3a however with the increase of mlvss the amount of discharged sludge gradually increased again after a period of srt adjustment the biomass was stable in the reactor when the amount of discharged sludge was equal to the number of microorganisms produced a new steady state was achieved at an srt of 10 d thus from days 60 to 130 mlvss stabilized at around 490 mg l which was the stable sludge concentration at the target srt of 10 d with identical srt regulation but with the sludge discharged from the bottom of the settling pond strategy b under the condition of high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d during the first 29 days of the dynamic simulation fig 3a mlvss decreased quickly from the initial value of 1665 mg l to 383 mg l from day 30 on mlvss began to rise and recovered and stabilized at 430 mg l at day 54 day in the two strategies of sludge discharge simulated mlvss showed similar trends in the reactor compared with strategy a the time for biomass to decrease to the lowest value was shorter in strategy b during the initial period in addition the decrease rate of mlvss in strategy b was significantly higher than in strategy a this may be because the sludge discharged from the bottom of the settling pond was concentrated and its concentration reached 4 5 times the mlvss in the reactor compared with strategy a the time required to reach a stable sludge concentration at the target srt of 10 d was even shorter in strategy b over the 130 days of the dynamic simulation and under the conditions of high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d fig 3b a sustainable high ace 99 could be achieved with both strategies a and b and a high aob activity was maintained with the daily sludge discharge niae continued to rise from 38 7 and 41 2 to 88 6 and 88 9 at strategy a and strategy b respectively and eventually stabilized at 82 3 88 6 between days 60 and 130 fig 3c this confirmed that shortening the srt was conducive to repress the activity of nob in the study of li et al 19 they also pointed out that short srt was an important strategy to inhibit nob however during the period of srt regulation days 1 to 60 a higher niae was obtained by strategy b than by strategy an under the high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d at a low nlr of 0 10 kg m3 d and with sludge discharge from the reactor strategy a from day 1 to 55 mlvss gradually declined from 1452 to 133 mg l and finally stabilized at about 133 mg l fig 3a in contrast for strategy b simulated mlvss decreased sharply within first 40 days of operation and eventually remained at 90 mg l similarly at a low nlr a shorter srt adjustment process could be achieved with strategy b however no matter which sludge discharge strategy was adopted under low nlr the stable mlvss was always as low as 90 133 mg l at the target srt of 10 d while other scholars 21 23 found that the biomass could be enriched to 2000 mg l of mlvss in the reactors when nlr in the influent was kept at 0 1 kg m3 d this was because these reactors exhibited rapid growth of heterotrophic microorganisms however in the present study only autotrophic bacteria grew in the reactor it was evident that low nlrs caused low biomass in the reactor under the two sludge discharge strategies of low nlr aces remained above 99 throughout the dynamic simulation niaes gradually increased from 0 to 80 high aob activity could be maintained and stable nob inhibition was expected to be achieved at the low do and the short srt of 10 d at a low nlr moreover as described for the high nlr a higher niae could also be achieved with strategy b at a low nlr however it should be noted that the sludge concentration at the target srt should not be lower than the settleable sludge concentration the sedimentation of activated sludge is mostly due to stratification which requires a certain concentration of mixed liquid mines et al 31 assumed that stratified sedimentation could occur when the sludge concentration exceeded 500 mg l while others 32 considered 1000 mg l as the basic concentration of stratified sedimentation in the model of the present study it was assumed that the ideal settling performance of the activated sludge was maintained in the continuous stirred tank reactor all the time however the real settling performance of the activated sludge was markedly different in the reactor as the sludge concentration was below the settleable sludge concentration at the inappropriate sludge discharge strategy large quantities of sludge was exported from the pn reactor which has been commonly observed by other scholars 19 therefore a high nlr was required for the srt regulation at mainstream conditions in conclusion both at high and low nlrs of 0 52 and 0 1 kg m3 d high aob activities could be maintained with the two sludge discharge strategies during the regulation of srt from 30 to 10 d higher niaes could be achieved under the high nlr condition than the low nlr condition at identical sludge discharge strategies however at the low nlr biomass was always low under identical nlr conditions a higher niae and shorter time for srt regulation could be obtained by discharging sludge from the bottom part of the settling pond than from the reactor overall a reasonable sludge discharge strategy was critical for stable n conversion performance and a shorter srt regulation process in addition a high nlr was required for srt regulation 3 3 experimental study on n conversion under different nlr conditions with different sludge discharge strategies according to the simulation results influent nlr was increased by progressively shortening the hrt fig 4 during reactor operation from day 1 to 33 at an hrt of 5 33 h nlr was in the range of 0 22 0 26 kg m3 d during reactor start up days 1 12 ace remained low 20 4 30 5 because do was controlled below 0 35 mg l subsequently ace rose to 39 4 by increasing do to 0 59 mg l during the start up period niae declined from 12 3 to 7 9 and mlss continued to decline eventually stabilizing around 3242 mg l from day 13 on by discharging sludge from the completely mixed reactor srt was regulated at day 10 during the initial three days of the sludge discharge the ace rose rapidly from 50 7 to 72 4 due to high do concentrations 0 70 1 02 mg l subsequently days 16 33 the level of do was limited to 0 26 0 50 mg l during the early period of low do control days 16 24 the ace initially dropped to 46 1 then gradually rose and eventually stabilized at 59 1 on day 24 the niae kept rising from day 16 to 19 then slightly declined and eventually stabilized at 67 3 on day 24 fig 4 thus at the low nlr of 0 22 0 26 kg m3 d aob activity was kept and the activity of nob was partially repressed by the combined regulation of low do below 0 5 mg l and short srt of 10 d these results were consistent with our simulations in which a similar niae of 55 1 could be obtained at mainstream conditions by the coordinated control of low do and short srt as the reactor continued running days 25 to 33 the ace and niae both diminished and reached 15 2 and 0 respectively on day 33 the aob activity decreased and nob activity recovered gradually during this stage thus nob inhibition failed after experiencing long term operation other scholars 14 15 have found that nob adapt to low do and eventually proliferate in the reactor in fact the low do level could reduce nob activity to a certain extent but could not inhibit their growth completely however a low do level could also reduce aob activity when nob biomass accumulated to a certain extent during the sustainable low do operation for a long period nob activity could be recovered thus it is widely accepted that a single low do strategy cannot effectively inhibit nob 11 14 in the present study even short srt combined with low do regulation could not achieve sustainable and stable suppression of nob activity in the present study it was also found that the mlss reduced sharply from 2459 to 456 mg l from day 25 to 33 in the reactor in the study of li et al 19 a drastic loss of aob biomass occurred in the flocs as srt was shortened from 30 to 20 d at a low do of 0 3 mg l leading to a deterioration of pn therefore the reduction of n conversion capacity in the present study including both ace and niae had a relationship with the biomass trapped in the reactor when the reactor was operating under the condition of low nlr of 0 22 0 26 kg m3 d the growth of microorganisms was slow in theory because of low substrate levels including do and ammonium in addition a short srt control resulted in the expulsion of a large number of microorganisms from the reactor once the sludge discharging speed was greater than microbial growth after a long time of operation much sludge was washed out of the reactor as a result little sludge was intercepted and the reactor could not operate steadily and continuously after shortening the hrt to 3 21 h the nlr increased from day 34 to 64 to 0 34 0 42 kg m3 d from days 34 to 45 the ace and niae gradually rose and stabilized at 24 1 and 15 4 respectively this suggested that aob activity increased and nob activity began to be inhibited when elevating the nlr to 0 34 0 42 kg m3 d still at the low do of 0 18 0 45 mg l and short srt of 10 d accordingly mlss slightly increased to 672 721 mg l in the reactor during this stage this verified the simulation results showing that elevating nlr was beneficial to biomass increase in the reactor however from day 46 on mlss ace and niae all diminished which was most likely related to a short srt control resulting in the expulsion of substantial biomass from the reactor from day 49 on sludge discharge from the reactor was stopped subsequently an apparent increase in mlss was observed from 554 to 1313 mg l on day 64 accordingly the ace also increased from 14 4 to 43 1 however the niae declined from 3 6 to 0 the aob and nob activity increased with biomass without srt regulation a single low do control could not inhibit nob activity to verify the effectiveness of a higher nlr the hrt was further decreased to 2 13 h in response from day 65 to 83 the nlr rose to 0 52 0 70 kg m3 d at the beginning of this stage days 65 72 the ace remained at 37 3 46 9 because of the low do 0 1 mg l then as do increased to 0 1 0 2 mg l days 73 83 the ace gradually rose and stabilized at 58 4 accordingly aob activity would also be restricted due to the low do consistent with ma et al 15 during this stage the niae remained at 0 and mlss increased eventually reaching 1753 1914 mg l this indicated that a high nlr of 0 52 0 70 kg m3 d resulted in a high biomass in the system maintaining a sufficient ammonium conversion capacity at present under mainstream conditions the application of the pn a process depends on solving two problems 8 33 first how to achieve stable nob activity suppression and second how to maintain aob and anaob activity especially at conditions of low temperature and low ammonium here we speculate that a high nlr might be the key to maintaining high aob activity and inhibiting nob activity however the activity of nob was not repressed efficiently in the present study due to too long srts high biomass creates more favorable conditions for the implementation of srt regulation to avoid sludge run off at short srts by shortening hrt to 1 47 h and improving nlr to 0 68 1 05 kg m3 d from day 84 to 105 do remained at 0 14 0 35 mg l fig 4 by discharging sludge from the bottom part of the settling pond srt was controlled at 10 d during the initial operation days 84 90 the ace decreased and fluctuated greatly ranging between 30 4 and 51 7 the niae rose slightly and ranged between 0 and 7 5 the ace increased slightly and stabilized above 48 7 on day 105 in comparison the niae rose rapidly to 55 3 fig 4 after a period of high nlr operation the activity of aob was still high the activity of nob would be inhibited only when srt regulation was combined with low do consistent with gu et al 26 during this stage mlss decreased gradually and remained at 1059 1206 mg l in the pn reactor thereby biomass remained stable during the nlr elevation in the reactor although at a short srt of 10 d in conclusion the experimental results revealed that as the nlr reached to 0 52 1 05 kg m3 d a high ace of 50 could be achieved under conditions of low do below 0 5 mg l furthermore when nlr reached 0 52 1 05 kg m3 d mlss was maintained at 2000 mg l in the reactor which created favorable conditions for implementing a short srt regulation to inhibit nob activity in addition nob inhibition was achieved at the high nlr of 0 68 1 05 kg m3 d maintaining a short srt 10 d by sludge discharge from the bottom of the settling pond 4 conclusions simulation results revealed that high nlr combined with srt and do regulation were critical in achieving stable pn in mainstream sewage treatment additionally compared with discharging sludge directly from the completely mixed reactor it was beneficial to shorten the srt adjustment process and achieve a better nob inhibition effect by discharging sludge from the bottom part of the settling pond at a high nlr experiments demonstrated that as nlr reached 0 52 1 05 kg m3 d a high ace 50 could be achieved under low do conditions below 0 5 mg l furthermore mlss was maintained at 2000 mg l in the reactor which created favorable conditions for implementing a short srt regulation to inhibit nob activity this study provided a critical regulating factor to inhibit nob for promoting successful application of mainstream pn a process funding

a process under mainstream conditions 7 under mainstream conditions various regulatory strategies have been widely used to suppress nob such as do control alternating aerobic and anoxic conditions and short srt 3 8 among these alternating aerobic and anoxic conditions produced stable nob inhibition however its operation is complex and n removal efficiency is generally as low as 0 05 kg m3 d 9 therefore for operational regulation in mainstream conditions do and short srt control are considered the most feasible strategies for the growth of aob and nob do is a shared and important substrate thus do has been considered a key factor in inhibiting nob activity some scholars 10 found that the growth rate of aob became lower than that of nob when do concentration increased from 0 5 to 2 5 mg l conversely the growth rate of aob was significantly higher than that of nob when do was maintained below 0 5 mg l laureni et al 11 also observed the activity of nob would be decreased by reducing do from 1 2 to 0 17 mg l therefore it is widely believed that low do level is an effective strategy to inhibit nob the inhibition effects are based on the saturation coefficient of oxygen for nob 1 52 mg l 12 being higher than for aob 0 60 mg l 13 thus aob has a higher affinity for do cui et al 14 observed that nitrite accumulation efficiency niae remained above 90 during the first 30 days of reactor operation under the condition of low do i e 0 5 mg l indicating nob activity was inhibited however continuing to run under this condition do 0 5 mg l the niae value gradually declined from day 70 on dropping below 10 on day 130 and the inhibition of nob activity finally failed a parallel phenomenon has been observed experimentally by other scholars 15 hence a single low do control could not achieve a sustainable and stable nob inhibition therefore combining do regulation with other strategies is expected to achieve stable nob inhibition at mainstream conditions controlling sludge retention time srt is a conventional strategy to manage the dominant functional microorganisms some scholars e g 16 noted that nob growth rate was higher than aob when water temperature was below 20 c thus it was not feasible to flush nob from the system using srt while at water temperatures of 20 35 c the growth rate of nob was much lower than that of aob 16 an appropriate srt shorter than the generation time of nob but longer than that of aob was feasible to eliminate the nob from the pn reactor 10 at the changi 17 and southwest 18 stps short srts of 2 5 d and 3 5 d were adopted to achieve stable pn in another study 19 water temperature was maintained at 30 1 c the srt was reduced from 30 d to 20 d when the do was controlled as low as 0 3 mg l in the pn reactor consequently the activity of nob declined from 7 5 to 1 8 mg o2 g vss moreover the activity of aob decreased rapidly from 27 9 to 18 7 mg o2 g vss resulting in a sharp decrease in n removal performance in their study massive biomass loss was observed during the regulation of srt from 30 to 20 d causing the reactor to crash therefore it was necessary to explore an appropriate sludge discharge strategy for solving the problem of controlling target srt and ensuring reasonable biomass in the reactor further influent ammonium was generally 40 60 mg l at mainstream conditions thus a low influent total nitrogen load rate nlr approximately 0 1 0 2 kg m3 d has been widely adopted in many pn a reactors 20 24 nevertheless there are very few research on the influence of high influent nlr on pn under mainstream conditions activated sludge models asms are mathematical methods that express the complex biological reaction process between various pollutants in sewage and different functional microorganisms in activated sludge asms include rate equations that describe aob and nob growth and decay as well as kinetic parameters used to assess influence of external environmental factors and operational strategies on reaction rate presently asms have been applied to the study of pn soliman and eldyasti 25 obtained optimal pn operational data using such a model and proved that the calibrated model could simulate rapid shift of pn by operational conditions gu et al 26 determined do concentrations and srts required for nob inhibition at different temperatures using the model moreover their experimental study demonstrated model validity to address these problems a continuous flow completely mixed reactor was constructed and a model was established according to the configuration of the reactor the influence of diverse influent nlrs on pn was simulated at low do combined with short srt based upon the model under mainstream conditions in addition different sludge discharge strategies were simulated and explored with the model under high and low influent nlr to explore the control of short srt finally according to the simulated results suitable influent nlr conditions and sludge discharge strategy were verified in an experimental study with the combined control of low do and short srt 2 methodology 2 1 structure and operating condition of the experimental reactor a continuous flow completely mixed reactor fig 1 was constructed with cylindrical plexiglass its actual volume was 32 l an electric stirrer 100 rpm as well as an online monitoring probes wtw 9430 germany for water temperature ph and do were installed in the reactor the upper part of the reactor had a sample connection for convenient sampling moreover the bottom part was equipped with an aeration ring to provide do for microbial growth the aeration capacity was adjusted with a rotor flowmeter to regulate the required do level the influent and effluent flow was controlled with peristaltic pumps bt100 2 j baoding longer china water temperature was regulated between 25 and 32 c with a film heater the reactor was coated with material impervious to light to avoid the influence of algal growth on the results of the experiment based on controlled influent nlr changes the 105 day operational period could be divided into four phases table 1 2 2 inoculated sludge and wastewater the flocculent sludge inoculated in the reactor was derived from a pilot scale activated sludge reactor with stable pn 27 and a nitrite accumulation efficiency was above 90 the sludge concentration reached 3905 mg l after inoculation in the reactor synthetic inorganic wastewater after c and p resources were recovered was adopted in the experiment nh4hco3 and nahco3 were used to provide ammonium 40 60 mg l and alkalinity 400 600 mg l in respective the influent ph was kept at 8 0 0 3 according to van der star et al 28 trace element i and ii solutions in synthetic wastewater were 1 0 ml l and 1 25 ml l respectively table 2 the mineral elements were kh2po4 27 2 mg l cacl2 2h2o 180 mg l and mgso4 7h2o 300 mg l 2 3 chemical analyses and calculations ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined with nessler s uv spectrophotometric and n 1 naphthalene ethylenediamine methods respectively 29 mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured with the standard gravimetric method 29 the ammonium conversion efficiency ace and nitrite accumulation efficiency niae were calculated to assess aob and nob activity based on eqs 1 and 2 the n loading rate nlr of the influent was calculated based on eq 3 1 ace n h 4 n inf n h 4 n eff n h 4 n inf 100 2 niae n o 2 n eff n h 4 n inf n h 4 n eff 100 3 nlr tn inf 24 hrt 1000 with tn inf nh4 n

all in mg l are ammonium and nitrite concentrations of the effluent respectively hrt h is the hydraulic retention time of the reactor 2 4 mathematical model an activated sludge 2d model 30 and a modified vesilind model were implemented in the biowin software to simulate the impact of nlr and sludge discharge strategy on the growth and decay of nob and aob the simulation was conducted with a continuous stirred tank reactor and ideal sludge separation mode the critical kinetic parameters for characterizing the growth of nob and aob including substrate half saturation coefficients and maximum specific growth rates were set referred to the study of gu et al 26 maximum vesilind settling velocity was set to 170 m d 31 to simulate the solid liquid separation process in the settling pond influent ammonium concentration alkalinity and ph were set to 55 mg l 500 mg l and 8 respectively in the model nitrite nitrate and cod level were all set to 0 mg l in the influent and tp level was set to 1 mg l in the influent to maintain microbial growth the do level was set to 0 27 mg l in the continuously stirred tank reactor the water temperature and srt were set to 25 c and 10 d respectively other initial and boundary conditions were set on the basis of the experimental device a steady state simulation was carried out to simulate the influence of diverse nlrs on pn hrts of 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 h were created by regulating the influent flow thus different nlr conditions were established according to eq 3 at high and low influent nlrs of 0 52 and 0 10 kg m3 d two different sludge discharge strategies were simulated i e a sludge discharge directly from the completely mixed reactor and b sludge discharge from the bottom part of the settling pond the srt was controlled according to the daily amount of sludge discharged the daily sludge discharge amount q m3 d was calculated on the basis of eqs 4 and 5 by discharging sludge from the complete mixed reactor and the bottom part of the settling pond respectively under the scenario of shortening the srt from 30 to 10 d dynamic state simulations were conducted to simulate the effects of different sludge discharge strategies on pn the steady state simulation results were taken as the initial conditions of the dynamic simulation 4 q v srt 5 q vr 1 r srt where v m3 is the actual volume of the reactor srt d is the target sludge retention time to be controlled and r is the sludge return ratio i e the ratio of the returned sludge flow to the influent flow here r was assumed to be 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of n conversion and biomass under different nlr conditions when nlr was controlled at 0 66 kg m3 d at an hrt of 2 h 94 0 ammonium was converted and 96 7 nitrite accumulated in the reactor fig 2 indicating aob activity was high the activity of nob was effectively repressed by a low do of 0 27 mg l and a short srt of 10 d the nlr decreased to 0 33 kg m3 d when the hrt was extended to 4 h the ace stayed at 96 0 and the niae dropped to 79 8 thus high aob activity was maintained but nob activity recovered slightly by decreasing the nlr when extending the hrt further to 6 h the nlr was 0 22 kg m3 d the ace remained at a high level of 98 3 while the niae dropped further to 55 1 fig 2 as the nlr was diminished to 0 17 kg m3 d using an hrt of 8 h 98 4 ammonium was converted in contrast only 15 2 nitrite was accumulated and most ammonium was oxidized to nitrate showing nob suppression failed as the hrt was further extended from 10 to 14 h the corresponding influent nlr reduced from 0 13 to 0 09 kg m3 d but the ace was still high 98 5 in contrast niae values were low 2 9 3 8 and ammonium was virtually completely transformed into nitrate indicating the nob inhibition was ineffective at low nlrs of 0 09 0 13 kg m3 d a short srt of 10 d and a low do of 0 27 mg l therefore the ace was always stable above 94 as the nlr reduced from 0 66 to 0 09 kg m3 d by controlling the hrt while the niae decreased gradually from 96 7 to 2 9 fig 2 under the conditions of low do and short srt influent nlr had a significant impact on nob inhibition moreover aob activity was not decreased the simulation results revealed that nlrs should be kept at 0 33 0 66 kg m3 d to suppress nob activity when nlr was below 0 22 kg m3 d nob proliferated under low do and short srt conditions the mlvss decreased steadily from 1302 to 259 mg l in the reactor aob biomass decreased from 354 to 61 mg l when extending hrt from 2 to 14 h accordingly the nlr decreased from 0 66 to 0 09 kg m3 d fig 2 consequently microbial biomass was affected by nlr in the present study a lower nlr resulted in lower microbial biomass in the reactor at the low do and short srt however nob biomass increased from 2 7 to 78 3 mg l by decreasing nlr from 0 66 to 0 22 kg m3 d and then continually reduced to 37 7 mg l when the nlr further declined to 0 09 kg m3 d accordingly during the entire simulated nlr decline the ratio value of nob aob was elevated from 0 01 to 0 62 fig 2 it revealed that nob activity was repressed by the combined controlling of low do level and short srt at high nlrs of 0 33 0 66 kg m3 d under the condition of low influent nlrs 0 22 kg m3 d the nob aob ratio reached 0 57 0 62 nob aob ratios close to 0 8 were reported for a complete nitrification system 18 thus apparent nob proliferation appeared in the reactor at an nlr 0 22 kg m3 d the trends in n conversion and biomass due to nlr changes fig 1 confirmed that an appropriate nlr was critical to achieving inhibition of nob activity at low do and short srt high nlrs inhibited nob activity under low do and short srt conditions according to the literature 17 35 the influent nlr in the strass and changi stps which have both achieved stable and sustainable pn with the combined regulation of do and srt were as high as 1 06 and 0 91 kg m3 d in the aerobic zone respectively however mainstream pn a processes were generally carried out at low nlrs of 0 11 0 16 kg m3 d 20 22 24 accordingly the successful application of short srts combined with low do inhibiting nob activity was limited in both lab reactors and other municipal sewage treatment plants under mainstream conditions this was also validated by our simulations which showed that high nlrs might be critical in achieving stable pn combined with srt and do regulation 3 2 simulation of n conversion and biomass with different sludge discharge strategies when the target srt was shortened from 30 to 10 d with sludge discharge from the reactor with constant daily flow strategy a under the condition of high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d mlvss decreased sharply at the beginning of the dynamic simulation and reached the lowest value of 444 mg l on day 35 fig 3a then it rose gradually from day 36 on and finally remained at around 490 mg l on day 60 when srt was reduced from 30 to 10 d increasing the amount of sludge discharged daily was necessary the mlvss gradually decreased from the initial value of 1665 mg l with the decrease of mlvss the amount of discharged solid sludge should also decrease gradually on the other hand the sludge load should increase with the decrease in mlvss in the reactor theoretically the amount of sludge produced should increase accordingly in the present study nob and aob which accumulated in the reactor belonged to the main physiological groups of autotrophic microorganisms they obtain energy by chemosynthesis using inorganic c and inorganic n as c and n sources therefore the growth rate of autotrophic microorganisms is extremely low when the amount of sludge discharged was much larger than the number of microorganisms produced mlvss decreased sharply in the reactor simulated mlvss showed a linear downward trend from day 1 to 10 in the dynamic simulation with increasing simulation time to day 35 the actual quantity of solid sludge discharged diminished continuously due to the decrease of mlvss fig 3a when the amount of sludge discharged was lower than the production of microorganisms biomass accumulated and the mlvss began to rise in the reactor from days 36 to 60 fig 3a however with the increase of mlvss the amount of discharged sludge gradually increased again after a period of srt adjustment the biomass was stable in the reactor when the amount of discharged sludge was equal to the number of microorganisms produced a new steady state was achieved at an srt of 10 d thus from days 60 to 130 mlvss stabilized at around 490 mg l which was the stable sludge concentration at the target srt of 10 d with identical srt regulation but with the sludge discharged from the bottom of the settling pond strategy b under the condition of high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d during the first 29 days of the dynamic simulation fig 3a mlvss decreased quickly from the initial value of 1665 mg l to 383 mg l from day 30 on mlvss began to rise and recovered and stabilized at 430 mg l at day 54 day in the two strategies of sludge discharge simulated mlvss showed similar trends in the reactor compared with strategy a the time for biomass to decrease to the lowest value was shorter in strategy b during the initial period in addition the decrease rate of mlvss in strategy b was significantly higher than in strategy a this may be because the sludge discharged from the bottom of the settling pond was concentrated and its concentration reached 4 5 times the mlvss in the reactor compared with strategy a the time required to reach a stable sludge concentration at the target srt of 10 d was even shorter in strategy b over the 130 days of the dynamic simulation and under the conditions of high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d fig 3b a sustainable high ace 99 could be achieved with both strategies a and b and a high aob activity was maintained with the daily sludge discharge niae continued to rise from 38 7 and 41 2 to 88 6 and 88 9 at strategy a and strategy b respectively and eventually stabilized at 82 3 88 6 between days 60 and 130 fig 3c this confirmed that shortening the srt was conducive to repress the activity of nob in the study of li et al 19 they also pointed out that short srt was an important strategy to inhibit nob however during the period of srt regulation days 1 to 60 a higher niae was obtained by strategy b than by strategy an under the high nlr of 0 52 kg m3 d at a low nlr of 0 10 kg m3 d and with sludge discharge from the reactor strategy a from day 1 to 55 mlvss gradually declined from 1452 to 133 mg l and finally stabilized at about 133 mg l fig 3a in contrast for strategy b simulated mlvss decreased sharply within first 40 days of operation and eventually remained at 90 mg l similarly at a low nlr a shorter srt adjustment process could be achieved with strategy b however no matter which sludge discharge strategy was adopted under low nlr the stable mlvss was always as low as 90 133 mg l at the target srt of 10 d while other scholars 21 23 found that the biomass could be enriched to 2000 mg l of mlvss in the reactors when nlr in the influent was kept at 0 1 kg m3 d this was because these reactors exhibited rapid growth of heterotrophic microorganisms however in the present study only autotrophic bacteria grew in the reactor it was evident that low nlrs caused low biomass in the reactor under the two sludge discharge strategies of low nlr aces remained above 99 throughout the dynamic simulation niaes gradually increased from 0 to 80 high aob activity could be maintained and stable nob inhibition was expected to be achieved at the low do and the short srt of 10 d at a low nlr moreover as described for the high nlr a higher niae could also be achieved with strategy b at a low nlr however it should be noted that the sludge concentration at the target srt should not be lower than the settleable sludge concentration the sedimentation of activated sludge is mostly due to stratification which requires a certain concentration of mixed liquid mines et al 31 assumed that stratified sedimentation could occur when the sludge concentration exceeded 500 mg l while others 32 considered 1000 mg l as the basic concentration of stratified sedimentation in the model of the present study it was assumed that the ideal settling performance of the activated sludge was maintained in the continuous stirred tank reactor all the time however the real settling performance of the activated sludge was markedly different in the reactor as the sludge concentration was below the settleable sludge concentration at the inappropriate sludge discharge strategy large quantities of sludge was exported from the pn reactor which has been commonly observed by other scholars 19 therefore a high nlr was required for the srt regulation at mainstream conditions in conclusion both at high and low nlrs of 0 52 and 0 1 kg m3 d high aob activities could be maintained with the two sludge discharge strategies during the regulation of srt from 30 to 10 d higher niaes could be achieved under the high nlr condition than the low nlr condition at identical sludge discharge strategies however at the low nlr biomass was always low under identical nlr conditions a higher niae and shorter time for srt regulation could be obtained by discharging sludge from the bottom part of the settling pond than from the reactor overall a reasonable sludge discharge strategy was critical for stable n conversion performance and a shorter srt regulation process in addition a high nlr was required for srt regulation 3 3 experimental study on n conversion under different nlr conditions with different sludge discharge strategies according to the simulation results influent nlr was increased by progressively shortening the hrt fig 4 during reactor operation from day 1 to 33 at an hrt of 5 33 h nlr was in the range of 0 22 0 26 kg m3 d during reactor start up days 1 12 ace remained low 20 4 30 5 because do was controlled below 0 35 mg l subsequently ace rose to 39 4 by increasing do to 0 59 mg l during the start up period niae declined from 12 3 to 7 9 and mlss continued to decline eventually stabilizing around 3242 mg l from day 13 on by discharging sludge from the completely mixed reactor srt was regulated at day 10 during the initial three days of the sludge discharge the ace rose rapidly from 50 7 to 72 4 due to high do concentrations 0 70 1 02 mg l subsequently days 16 33 the level of do was limited to 0 26 0 50 mg l during the early period of low do control days 16 24 the ace initially dropped to 46 1 then gradually rose and eventually stabilized at 59 1 on day 24 the niae kept rising from day 16 to 19 then slightly declined and eventually stabilized at 67 3 on day 24 fig 4 thus at the low nlr of 0 22 0 26 kg m3 d aob activity was kept and the activity of nob was partially repressed by the combined regulation of low do below 0 5 mg l and short srt of 10 d these results were consistent with our simulations in which a similar niae of 55 1 could be obtained at mainstream conditions by the coordinated control of low do and short srt as the reactor continued running days 25 to 33 the ace and niae both diminished and reached 15 2 and 0 respectively on day 33 the aob activity decreased and nob activity recovered gradually during this stage thus nob inhibition failed after experiencing long term operation other scholars 14 15 have found that nob adapt to low do and eventually proliferate in the reactor in fact the low do level could reduce nob activity to a certain extent but could not inhibit their growth completely however a low do level could also reduce aob activity when nob biomass accumulated to a certain extent during the sustainable low do operation for a long period nob activity could be recovered thus it is widely accepted that a single low do strategy cannot effectively inhibit nob 11 14 in the present study even short srt combined with low do regulation could not achieve sustainable and stable suppression of nob activity in the present study it was also found that the mlss reduced sharply from 2459 to 456 mg l from day 25 to 33 in the reactor in the study of li et al 19 a drastic loss of aob biomass occurred in the flocs as srt was shortened from 30 to 20 d at a low do of 0 3 mg l leading to a deterioration of pn therefore the reduction of n conversion capacity in the present study including both ace and niae had a relationship with the biomass trapped in the reactor when the reactor was operating under the condition of low nlr of 0 22 0 26 kg m3 d the growth of microorganisms was slow in theory because of low substrate levels including do and ammonium in addition a short srt control resulted in the expulsion of a large number of microorganisms from the reactor once the sludge discharging speed was greater than microbial growth after a long time of operation much sludge was washed out of the reactor as a result little sludge was intercepted and the reactor could not operate steadily and continuously after shortening the hrt to 3 21 h the nlr increased from day 34 to 64 to 0 34 0 42 kg m3 d from days 34 to 45 the ace and niae gradually rose and stabilized at 24 1 and 15 4 respectively this suggested that aob activity increased and nob activity began to be inhibited when elevating the nlr to 0 34 0 42 kg m3 d still at the low do of 0 18 0 45 mg l and short srt of 10 d accordingly mlss slightly increased to 672 721 mg l in the reactor during this stage this verified the simulation results showing that elevating nlr was beneficial to biomass increase in the reactor however from day 46 on mlss ace and niae all diminished which was most likely related to a short srt control resulting in the expulsion of substantial biomass from the reactor from day 49 on sludge discharge from the reactor was stopped subsequently an apparent increase in mlss was observed from 554 to 1313 mg l on day 64 accordingly the ace also increased from 14 4 to 43 1 however the niae declined from 3 6 to 0 the aob and nob activity increased with biomass without srt regulation a single low do control could not inhibit nob activity to verify the effectiveness of a higher nlr the hrt was further decreased to 2 13 h in response from day 65 to 83 the nlr rose to 0 52 0 70 kg m3 d at the beginning of this stage days 65 72 the ace remained at 37 3 46 9 because of the low do 0 1 mg l then as do increased to 0 1 0 2 mg l days 73 83 the ace gradually rose and stabilized at 58 4 accordingly aob activity would also be restricted due to the low do consistent with ma et al 15 during this stage the niae remained at 0 and mlss increased eventually reaching 1753 1914 mg l this indicated that a high nlr of 0 52 0 70 kg m3 d resulted in a high biomass in the system maintaining a sufficient ammonium conversion capacity at present under mainstream conditions the application of the pn a process depends on solving two problems 8 33 first how to achieve stable nob activity suppression and second how to maintain aob and anaob activity especially at conditions of low temperature and low ammonium here we speculate that a high nlr might be the key to maintaining high aob activity and inhibiting nob activity however the activity of nob was not repressed efficiently in the present study due to too long srts high biomass creates more favorable conditions for the implementation of srt regulation to avoid sludge run off at short srts by shortening hrt to 1 47 h and improving nlr to 0 68 1 05 kg m3 d from day 84 to 105 do remained at 0 14 0 35 mg l fig 4 by discharging sludge from the bottom part of the settling pond srt was controlled at 10 d during the initial operation days 84 90 the ace decreased and fluctuated greatly ranging between 30 4 and 51 7 the niae rose slightly and ranged between 0 and 7 5 the ace increased slightly and stabilized above 48 7 on day 105 in comparison the niae rose rapidly to 55 3 fig 4 after a period of high nlr operation the activity of aob was still high the activity of nob would be inhibited only when srt regulation was combined with low do consistent with gu et al 26 during this stage mlss decreased gradually and remained at 1059 1206 mg l in the pn reactor thereby biomass remained stable during the nlr elevation in the reactor although at a short srt of 10 d in conclusion the experimental results revealed that as the nlr reached to 0 52 1 05 kg m3 d a high ace of 50 could be achieved under conditions of low do below 0 5 mg l furthermore when nlr reached 0 52 1 05 kg m3 d mlss was maintained at 2000 mg l in the reactor which created favorable conditions for implementing a short srt regulation to inhibit nob activity in addition nob inhibition was achieved at the high nlr of 0 68 1 05 kg m3 d maintaining a short srt 10 d by sludge discharge from the bottom of the settling pond 4 conclusions simulation results revealed that high nlr combined with srt and do regulation were critical in achieving stable pn in mainstream sewage treatment additionally compared with discharging sludge directly from the completely mixed reactor it was beneficial to shorten the srt adjustment process and achieve a better nob inhibition effect by discharging sludge from the bottom part of the settling pond at a high nlr experiments demonstrated that as nlr reached 0 52 1 05 kg m3 d a high ace 50 could be achieved under low do conditions below 0 5 mg l furthermore mlss was maintained at 2000 mg l in the reactor which created favorable conditions for implementing a short srt regulation to inhibit nob activity this study provided a critical regulating factor to inhibit nob for promoting successful application of mainstream pn a process funding

12553,the introduction of metal ion impurities into ionic liquids ils when serving as solvents and catalysts is inevitable thus the purification and recovery of ils is essential in view of the quality control of the final products and cost however the highly efficient removal of impurity with minimal il loss is challenging in this work the adsorption of metal ions from 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate emim dep solution generated in the cellulose spinning process was investigated based on the size sieving and ion exchange strategy the modified molecular sieves mmss were used and the effect of particle size on the adsorption performance was systematically studied batch adsorption showed that the mmss with the smaller size of 1 6 mm exhibited the superior advantages over metal ions with fast removal kinetic and higher selectivity the removal ratio of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 could reach 88 9 98 4 98 9 99 6 and 99 9 respectively benefiting from the size sieving effect the loss ratio of emim dep was lower than 0 7 fixed bed adsorption experiments further suggested the benign long term separation performance of metal ions from emim dep aqueous solution moreover the high removal ratios of metal ions from the actual emim dep aqueous solutions indicated the potential application in the purification of real ionic liquids graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ionic liquids ion exchange modified molecular sieves data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently ionic liquids ils are emerging as a new kind of designable solvents with excellent physicochemical properties such as non flammability wide electrochemical window low saturation vapor pressure low volatility and easy recyclability 1 6 these unique and outstanding properties endow them the broad application prospects in different fields such as catalysis extraction separation organic synthesis electrochemistry and biological materials 7 13 although the use of il suffers from high cost complicated synthesis and low toxicity 14 the good news is the emerging synthesis methods and enhanced yield endow ils lower preparation cost and a promising prospect in large scale utility in industry moreover the retrievability of ils make them more attractive in practical use for cellulose which is the most abundant natural polymer compound with the characteristics of non toxic renewable and degradable it has been dissolved with il to produce regenerated cellulose fibers rcfs 15 16 the il systems hold the advantages of high dissolution efficiency mild conditions and environmentally friendly process compared to the early reported dissolution systems eg naoh urea n methylmorpholine n oxide nmmo h2o phosphoric acid pa and n bu4nf dimethyl sulfoxide 17 21 in this case many different kinds of ils have been exploited to be benign solvent for dissolved cellulose such as imidazoles morpholine and pyridines based ionic liquids 22 27 for example 1 allyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride amim cl 28 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate emim dep 29 and 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate emim oac 30 have been used to dissolve cellulose although some of them exhibited benign dissolving performance they suffered from poor thermostability strong corrosivity or serious cellulose depolymerizing as a result emim dep was considered as an ideal solvent because of its excellent ability of dissolving cellulose and one step cost effective synthesis method which has already been used in rcfs manufacturing in henan china 28 31 however it is inevitable that metal ion impurities could make their way into ils during the application process as solvents or catalysts the impurities could not only seriously affect the purity and performance of the target products but the reuse of the ils take the ils based cellulose spinning process as example on account of cellulose degradation trace metal ions na k ca2 mg2 cu2 zn2 and fe3 32 33 will be introduced into ils aqueous solution during the process of traction and stretching 34 36 in the practical spinning process it was found that the mechanical properties and color of rcfs will be affected as the metal ions accumulated especially polyvalent metal ions thus it is essential to develop effective techniques and materials for the sequestration of trace metal ions and recovery of ils from the polluted spinning solutions actually there is a range of available technologies have been explored for the recovery of ils such as distillation extraction membrane separation technologies adsorption and so on 35 37 however the main studies on the recovery of ils were focused on the systems containing trace amount of ils rather than the high concentration il aqueous solutions 37 one of the key challenges of the recovery process was the ils loss minimization for economic reasons toward this point our previous work selected and used 10 molecular sieve as adsorbent to selectively separate metal ions from high concentrated emim dep aqueous solution 39 40 although the molecular sieve exhibited excellent adsorption performance of metal impurities at the specific ph value the equilibrium time was 18 h which was low efficiency in the practical application in this work the size sieving and ion exchange strategy was proposed for the removal of metal ions from emim dep solution generated in the cellulose spinning process the modified molecular sieves mmss were used and systematically studied the effect of particle size 4 6 mm 3 5 mm 2 3 mm and 1 6 mm on the adsorption performance batch adsorption experiments concerning particle size ph value dosage time and temperature were carried out and the adsorption kinetics thermodynamics along with dynamic adsorption were also discussed the results are hopeful to be essential for the separation of impurity metal ions and recovery of high purity ils which could also give deeper understanding about the effect of particle size on the adsorption performance and kinetics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the information about the chemical formula surface area and pore properties of mmss provided by macklin shanghai china were shown in table s1 in the supporting information potassium chloride kcl calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o copper chloride cucl2 and zinc chloride zncl2 with analytical grade purity a r were purchased form macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china the 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate emim dep was synthesized using methyl imidazole and diethyl phosphate by a one step synthesis method in the laboratory and the detailed procedure was described in the previous report 38 subsequently it was characterized by 1h and 13c nmr after drying under vacuum supporting information s1 the feeding solution was prepared using ultrapure water electrical conductivity lower than 0 1 μs cm 1 the molecular sieves used in this work were pre modified by the hcl and naoh solutions before use typically the ms was roasted and activated at 623 15 k for 2 h and then immersed into 0 25 m hcl for 12 h after that it was washed until the residual solution became neutral subsequently the ms was poured into 0 1 m naoh solution and then they were sufficiently washed and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 348 15 k for 24 h and then store sealed in a desiccator there were two reasons for the modification the first one was that the removal of the impurities generated during the synthesis process of ms such as unreacted silica and aluminium species the other was that the na in the structure of ms could be more flexible after modification which was in favor of the ion exchange with other metal ions 37 the characterization of mmss including bet xrd sem ft ir xps were summarized in supporting information 2 2 adsorption process as our previous report the main composition of spinning wastewater generated during drawing traction and washing are 2 wt 10 wt emim dep and 20 100 mg l 1 metal ions such as k ca2 mg2 cu2 zn2 and fe3 39 among them fe3 can be precipitated to remove by simple ph adjusting and the effect of na on the properties of regeneration cellulose is neglectful therefore the removal of na and fe3 was not considered and the k ca2 cu2 mg2 and zn2 metal ions were considered as model ions in the adsorption screen and the parameter optimization in the adsorbent screening stage the initial concentrations of metal ions and emim dep were 100 mg l 1 and 2 wt respectively then 2 5 g of solid adsorbent was exposed to the 100 ml feed solution with ph 3 0 for 24 h at 298 15 k in the condition optimization experiment to determine the amount of adsorbent the dosage of mmss was set at a range of 5 25 g l to further determine the effect of ph on the adsorption ability of mmss to metal ions ph of the feeding solution was adjusted to 3 10 with the hcl and naoh solutions over the temperature range from 288 15 to 328 15 k the appropriate adsorption temperatures were chosen for the adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption kinetics were evaluated by sampling every hour for 24 h and the adsorption efficiency was determined in addition the fixed bed adsorption experiments were further carried out the mmss was filled in a vertical downflow glass column with a radius of 0 6 cm and adsorption bed height of 5 cm the flow rate was controlled by a peristaltic pump at 1 or 2 ml min 1 and monitored by a flowmeter the liquid supernatant was centrifugated and filtered to obtain samples for each group of experiments the concentrations of metal ions were determined by icp oes 9000 shimadzu japan after accurate dilution the concentrations of emim dep were accurately diluted and then analyzed at the maximum absorption wavelength 211 4 nm by uv vis 2600 shimadzu japan the specific analysis method was explained in supporting information then the removal ratio of metal ions and il were obtained with different sizes of mmss all the experiments were performed in triplicate for data accuracy and the average was taken for subsequent calculations 2 3 desorption experiments in the practical application the excellent reusability performance could significantly reduce the operating cost therefore it is one of the key factors to measure the performance of adsorbents the adsorbed mmss were firstly washed by pure water to remove the residual solutions on the surface then it was put into the 0 25 m hcl solution for desorption after stirring for 120 min it was taken out and regenerated by the 0 25 m naoh solution and reused for the next adsorption run after washing by pure water for 3 times 2 4 data processing the removal ratio of il r il and metal ions r m adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 and distribution coefficient k d ml g 1 were calculated using the following equations 41 44 1 r il c 0 il c e il c 0 il 100 2 r m c 0 m c e m c 0 m 100 3 q e mg g 1 c 0 c e v 1 m 1 4 k d c 1 v 2 m 2 100 where c 0 mg l 1 and c e mg l 1 are the concentrations of emim dep and metal ions in the aqueous solution at the initial and equilibrium conditions of adsorption experiment v 1 and v 2 represent the volumes of il solution and eluent m 1 and m 2 are the mass of metal ions before and after the adsorption experiment respectively m represents the different metal ions coexisted i e k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 the adsorption data obtained in the column experiments are fitted by the thomas model which can be described by the follow equation 5 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th v m q 0 c 0 vt where v ml min 1 is the volumetric flow rate q 0 mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity k th l mg min 1 is the rate constant m g is the mass of mmss adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to fit the adsorption ratio to further evaluate the adsorption kinetics of mmss adsorbents for the separation of metal ions the following is the model formula expression pseudo first order model equation 45 dq t dt k 1 q e q t 6 where k 1 min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and q e and q t are the amounts of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t h respectively pseudo second order model equation 20 7 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant q e and q t are the amounts of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t h respectively adsorption thermodynamics in order to further clarify the adsorption behavior of mmss the adsorption thermodynamic fitting was carried out and the equations were listed below 46 8 ln k d s 0 r h 0 r 1 t 9 g 0 h 0 t s 0 where k d refers to the distribution coefficient t k is the temperature r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 the values of δs 0 and δh 0 were obtained from the intercept and slope of van t hoff plot fig 2f and δg 0 was calculated by the above equation 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbents screening to investigate the adsorption performance of metal ions by mmss with different sizes the batch adsorption experiments were carried out so as to screen the optimal particle size for removing metal ions from the emim dep aqueous solution and evaluate the adsorption properties of the adsorbent toward different metal ions interestingly the particle size of mmss played a significant role in removal ratios and kinetics as shown in fig 1a e the r m increased with the increasing adsorption time and the smaller particle size the higher removal ratio of various metal ions and the faster adsorption kinetics as the result in fig 1f the 1 6 mm mms showed the highest removal ratios 85 15 98 4 98 3 99 6 and 99 9 for k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 respectively and shorter equilibrium time 6 8 h however the other mmss showed slightly lower removal ratios for example the removal ratios of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 by mmss of 4 6 mm were 82 14 64 58 68 45 77 87 and 74 49 respectively unfortunately the adsorption equilibrium time reached 24 h as stated in our previous work the removal of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 was achieved via the ion exchange interaction at si o na groups which could be also discussed in the following 39 considering the chemical formulas and adsorption mechanism of the different sizes of mmss were the same the surface area and pore properties were essential to explain this result which were provided in table s1 it was found that the specific surface area and pore volume increased with the decreasing particle size of mmss which was provided more contact areas for metal ions facilitating the adsorption process in general the smaller particle size the larger specific surface area the more adsorption sites exposed better adsorption performance and faster kinetics as a result the 1 6 mm mms obtained high removal ratio and fast adsorption kinetics adsorption equilibrium time for various metal ions within 6 8 h the equilibrium time was much shorter than 10 molecular sieve indicating its superiority in practical application the principle of adsorption material screening was that it has high selectivity and can remove metal ions to a large extent with minimal il loss in this case the concentrations of emim dep after adsorption were also determined which were nearly equal to those in the original il solutions fig 1f showed the adsorption ratio of different adsorbents for emim dep and it was clear that there was almost no emim dep loss during the process of removing metal ions this was mainly attributed to the mismatch between the pore size of the mms 37 and the cationic radius of the emim dep which leads to size sieving effect and the spatial constraints the pore sizes of mmss were ranging from 1 05 to 1 27 nm table s1 however the ionic radius of emim was approximately 3 1 å and in the emim dep h2o mixture there exists the ion interaction between the cation anion of il and water molecules 45 in this case emim dep existed in the form of ion paired aggregates and the mesoscale aggregates made the diameter larger than the pore sizes of mmss 32 37 but this pore sizes were enough for the migration of metal ions leading to the high removal ratios of metal ions and minimal loss of emim dep during adsorption in addition it was crystallized in a cubic structure corresponding to the faujasite x type zeolite as shown in fig 7c for the xrd analysis of 1 6 mm mms and the unique octahedral structure existed a certain hindrance effect on migration for emim dep cluster therefore emim dep was difficult to migrate through pores with a low removal ratio and almost no loss of il to sum up the above discussion 1 6 mm mms was an ideal adsorbent with high selectivity 3 2 optimization of batch adsorption experiment conditions to further determine the optimal adsorption conditions for separating metal ions from emim dep aqueous solution the concentration of emim dep dosage of mms ph temperature and time were investigated the fig 2a indicated that the mms hardly adsorbed ils even if the concentrations of emim dep were increased to 20 100 g l for the reasons explained in adsorbents screening section subsequently the effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal ratios of metal ions and emim dep was shown fig 2b the r m was positively correlated with the input amounts of mms it could be explained that the active adsorption sites became more abundant with the increasing amounts of mms therefore considering the factors of high removal ratio and low cost when the amount of adsorbent was 2 5 g l 1 the satisfactory results could be obtained then it was clearly seen from fig 2c that the r m was investigated at different ph values cu2 and zn2 were not considered because they could precipitate under alkaline conditions the effect of ph the adsorption performance of cu2 and zn2 by 1 6 mm mms were also investigated about the ph range 3 7 and the results were shown fig s7 according to the experimental results ph value has no obvious effect on the r m at dosage of 2 5 g l 1 after that the dosages of mms were reduced from 2 5 to 1 0 g l 1 to verify this phenomenon again the zeta potential of mms was shown in fig s2 it can be seen that the mms surface was negatively charged and the negative charge was enhanced with increasing ph values due to the electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and the negative charge on the mms surface the removal ratios of metal ions showed a slight increase with the increase of ph values this result indicated that the adsorbent could be applied in different kinds of aqueous solutions with a wide ph range compared to the previous reports 47 taking into consideration the case where the ph of the recovered emim dep solution approximate to 3 the feed solution was adjusted to this ph for the subsequent experiments fig 2d showed the influence of temperature on the r m the behavior of mms to adsorb metal ions was a spontaneous endothermic process has been discussed in detail in the section of adsorption thermodynamics therefore an increase in temperature was more favorable for the process in addition fig s6 showed the viscosity of the feed liquid at different temperatures as the temperature increases the viscosity of the feed liquid decreases which accelerates the solute diffusion and facilitates the solute transport thus it could be seen that the r m presented an increasing trend with the increase of temperature considering the energy consumption cost the optimal experimental temperature was determined as 298 15 k fig 2e shows the r m and r il versus time the removal ratios of each metal ion increased rapidly in the first 3 h and then reached the adsorption equilibrium within 6 h which was shorter than those of 10 ms 39 for the consideration of industrialization the adsorption time was selected as 8 h in conclusion the optimal adsorption experiment conditions were carried out at 100 ml of feed liquid into 2 5 g mms metal ions concentrations of 100 mg l 1 emim dep concentration of 20 g l 1 ph 3 0 room temperature and 8 h 3 3 adsorption kinetics adsorption equilibrium time was an important parameter of adsorption materials the r m by mms with time changes were shown in fig 2e to understand the adsorption process the lagergren pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models were fitted 48 and the expression formula of calculation was in the supporting information as shown in fig 3a and b it was found that the r 2 of pseudo second order model was larger than the former indicating that the adsorption behavior of the adsorbent for metal ions were more consistent with the pseudo second order model moreover the adsorption results calculated by the model were in good agreement with the experimental values these results demonstrated the chemisorption process of the adsorption process indicating the chemisorption process according to the adsorption kinetic constant k 2 of pseudo second order model it could be seen that zn2 cu2 ca2 mg2 k which agreed well with the experimental phenomenon in addition the adsorption constant k 2 was greater than that of the existing adsorbent such as 10 molecular sieve 39 resin activated carbon etc 49 51 the larger the k 2 the faster the adsorption kinetic which further exhibited the benign practical application value 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics adsorption thermodynamics is very crucial to understand the adsorption behavior therefore the adsorption performance versus temperature were evaluated and the fig 2f shows fitting results table 1 showed the values of enthalpy δh 0 entropy δs 0 and gibbs free energy δg 0 for impurities metal ions at different temperatures it was clear that δh 0 and δs 0 were all positive indicating the endothermic process while the values of δg 0 were negative indicating that the adsorption behavior of metal ions separation by 1 6 mm mms was a spontaneous process 3 5 dynamic adsorption comparing with the batch adsorption the dynamic adsorption fixed bed adsorption is essential in providing more precise data for the implementation of practical amplification applications in this work the dynamic adsorption was carried out and the flow rates of 1 and 2 ml min 1 were used as shown in fig 4 the saturated adsorption time at different flow rates was at 900 1500 min indicating that the favorable stability of mms which could be used to remove metal ions for a long term during the dynamic adsorption process the lower the flow rate the longer the contact time between the feed solution and the adsorbent which will lead to full adsorption of metal ions thus obtaining a wider dynamic adsorption curve however compared with the dynamic adsorption the contact time between the feed solution and the adsorbent was longer in the batch adsorption process so the r m was higher 52 thus the contact time of dynamic adsorption was relatively short resulting in the slightly lower removal ratio in most case metal ions will diffuse to the surface and interior of the adsorbent at a lower flow rate and the length of the mass transfer zone decreases as the mass transfer driving force decreases 52 as listed in table 2 with the increasing flow rate from 1 0 to 2 0 ml min 1 k th was found to increase with the increasing flow rate resulting from the change in the mass transport resistance these studies provided an important reference value for the formulation of actual process and the determination of process parameters 3 6 adsorbent recycle and regeneration in the desorption process the pre experiment was carried out to screen the optimal eluents such as nacl naoh and hcl with various concentration in comparison with other solvents hcl naoh was found to be good solvent combination thus after adsorption the mms were firstly washed by pure water to remove the residual solutions on the surface then it was put into hcl solution for desorption after stirring for 120 min it was taken out and regenerated by naoh solution and reused for the next adsorption run after washing by pure water for 3 times fig 5 obviously showed that the adsorption ratios of ca2 and zn2 were still high 95 after five times of adsorption although the adsorption ratios of cu2 mg2 and k decreased the removal performance was satisfactory moreover the adsorption of emim dep on the regenerated mms was negligible indicating the stable adsorption performance of mms during the recycle experiments in addition the morphologies of fresh mms fig 6a adsorbed mms fig 6b and eluted adsorbent fig 6c were compared due to the interaction between metal ions and mms the surface of the adsorbent has more protrusions the eds mapping of mms loaded with metal ions was collected as an example indicating that k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 elements were uniformly distributed fig 6d after elution the morphology of the desorbed mms was similar to that of the fresh adsorbent and na al si and o elements were evenly distributed in the structure of the adsorbent verifying the excellent structural stability of the adsorbent during the adsorption desorption process all of these demonstrated the application potential of mms in the metal ions removal from the high concentration emim dep aqueous solutions 3 7 adsorption mechanism the fresh adsorbed k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 and desorbed mms were characterized by xps to further confirm the adsorption mechanism the characteristic peaks of na 1s o 1s si 2p and al 2p appeared at 1071 8 532 2 102 4 and 74 5 ev d in the spectra adsorption respectively fig 7a however after adsorption some fresh characteristic peaks were observed at 1303 2 1022 6 933 2 352 1 and 307 2 ev in the spectra of si 2p which were matched to mg 1s zn 2p cu 2p ca 2p and k 1s illustrating the favorable affinity of mms for metal ions as shown in fig 7b the binding energy of sisi and sio bands decreased by 0 4 ev and 0 3 ev after adsorption which could account for explain by the substitution of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 for na via the ion exchange interaction at si o na group the increase in na concentration after adsorption also indicated the above ion exchange mechanism also the previous adsorption kinetics study further verified the chemical ion exchange process the xrd patterns before and after adsorption fig 7c were similar and the reason was that this ion exchange process occurred but did not change the crystal structure 53 54 the ft ir spectra was shown in fig 7d and the spectrum before and after adsorption were similar the characteristic peak at 3498 and 1655 cm 1 were broad and strong that fall to the stretching and bending vibrations of oh in the h2o molecules the vicinity of 1020 and 482 cm 1 corresponds to the characteristic peak of al o si and si o si structures substantiated the silicate aluminate property of the adsorbents interestingly two peaks were observed around peak 1400 cm 1 because of the cation exchange process 54 in addition as previously stated it was further found that there were no absorption peaks of il was found in ft ir spectra which indicated the negligible adsorption of emim dep into mms and the rejection of emim dep was mainly forced by the pore size and steric hindrance as a result the adsorption mechanism of 1 6 mm mms for metal ions was the synergetic effects of ion exchange process with na and the spatial confinement 3 8 the practical application in addition to verify the removal performance of mms for metal ions from actual ionic liquids aqueous solutions the emim dep spinning solutions 5 wt obtained from xinxiang henan province were used 32 the concentrations of metal ions before and after adsorption were shown in table 3 it could be clearly found that the removal ratios of these impurity ions exceeded 86 7 and most of them could reach about 99 but that for emim dep was negligible 0 4 in this case the residual concentration of the metal ions were below 0 26 mg l 1 moreover the mms developed in this work exhibited considerable removal ratios and faster adsorption kinetics than 10 molecular sieve which exhibited promising application potential table s3 4 conclusion in this work the size sieving and ion exchange strategy was proposed for the removal of metal ions from emim dep solution generated in the cellulose spinning process was investigated the modified molecular sieves mmss with different size were used and the effect of particle size was investigated the 1 6 mm mms exhibited the superior advantages over metal ions with high removal ratios high selectivity and short adsorption equilibrium time 6 8 h benefiting from the size sieving effect the removal ratios of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 could reach 88 9 98 4 98 9 99 6 and 99 9 respectively and the removal ratio of larger emim dep molecule was lower than 0 7 as a result the influence of metal ion impurities on regeneration cellulose could be effectively avoided in addition the adsorption kinetics adsorption thermodynamics dynamic adsorption and the reuse of adsorbent were evaluated the high removal ratios of metal ions from the actual emim dep solutions indicated the potential application in the purification of real ionic liquids in conclusion this cost effective modified molecular sieve could realize the efficient removal of metal ions from the ils

12553,the introduction of metal ion impurities into ionic liquids ils when serving as solvents and catalysts is inevitable thus the purification and recovery of ils is essential in view of the quality control of the final products and cost however the highly efficient removal of impurity with minimal il loss is challenging in this work the adsorption of metal ions from 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate emim dep solution generated in the cellulose spinning process was investigated based on the size sieving and ion exchange strategy the modified molecular sieves mmss were used and the effect of particle size on the adsorption performance was systematically studied batch adsorption showed that the mmss with the smaller size of 1 6 mm exhibited the superior advantages over metal ions with fast removal kinetic and higher selectivity the removal ratio of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 could reach 88 9 98 4 98 9 99 6 and 99 9 respectively benefiting from the size sieving effect the loss ratio of emim dep was lower than 0 7 fixed bed adsorption experiments further suggested the benign long term separation performance of metal ions from emim dep aqueous solution moreover the high removal ratios of metal ions from the actual emim dep aqueous solutions indicated the potential application in the purification of real ionic liquids graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ionic liquids ion exchange modified molecular sieves data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently ionic liquids ils are emerging as a new kind of designable solvents with excellent physicochemical properties such as non flammability wide electrochemical window low saturation vapor pressure low volatility and easy recyclability 1 6 these unique and outstanding properties endow them the broad application prospects in different fields such as catalysis extraction separation organic synthesis electrochemistry and biological materials 7 13 although the use of il suffers from high cost complicated synthesis and low toxicity 14 the good news is the emerging synthesis methods and enhanced yield endow ils lower preparation cost and a promising prospect in large scale utility in industry moreover the retrievability of ils make them more attractive in practical use for cellulose which is the most abundant natural polymer compound with the characteristics of non toxic renewable and degradable it has been dissolved with il to produce regenerated cellulose fibers rcfs 15 16 the il systems hold the advantages of high dissolution efficiency mild conditions and environmentally friendly process compared to the early reported dissolution systems eg naoh urea n methylmorpholine n oxide nmmo h2o phosphoric acid pa and n bu4nf dimethyl sulfoxide 17 21 in this case many different kinds of ils have been exploited to be benign solvent for dissolved cellulose such as imidazoles morpholine and pyridines based ionic liquids 22 27 for example 1 allyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride amim cl 28 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate emim dep 29 and 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate emim oac 30 have been used to dissolve cellulose although some of them exhibited benign dissolving performance they suffered from poor thermostability strong corrosivity or serious cellulose depolymerizing as a result emim dep was considered as an ideal solvent because of its excellent ability of dissolving cellulose and one step cost effective synthesis method which has already been used in rcfs manufacturing in henan china 28 31 however it is inevitable that metal ion impurities could make their way into ils during the application process as solvents or catalysts the impurities could not only seriously affect the purity and performance of the target products but the reuse of the ils take the ils based cellulose spinning process as example on account of cellulose degradation trace metal ions na k ca2 mg2 cu2 zn2 and fe3 32 33 will be introduced into ils aqueous solution during the process of traction and stretching 34 36 in the practical spinning process it was found that the mechanical properties and color of rcfs will be affected as the metal ions accumulated especially polyvalent metal ions thus it is essential to develop effective techniques and materials for the sequestration of trace metal ions and recovery of ils from the

the results are hopeful to be essential for the separation of impurity metal ions and recovery of high purity ils which could also give deeper understanding about the effect of particle size on the adsorption performance and kinetics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the information about the chemical formula surface area and pore properties of mmss provided by macklin shanghai china were shown in table s1 in the supporting information potassium chloride kcl calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o copper chloride cucl2 and zinc chloride zncl2 with analytical grade purity a r were purchased form macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china the 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate emim dep was synthesized using methyl imidazole and diethyl

vacuum supporting information s1 the feeding solution was prepared using ultrapure water electrical conductivity lower than 0 1 μs cm 1 the molecular sieves used in this work were pre modified by the

there were two reasons for the modification the first one was that the removal of the impurities generated during the synthesis process of ms such as unreacted silica and aluminium species the other was that the na in the structure of ms could be more flexible after modification which was in favor of the ion exchange with other metal ions 37 the characterization of mmss including bet xrd sem ft ir xps were summarized in supporting information 2 2 adsorption process as our previous report the main composition of spinning wastewater generated during drawing traction and washing are 2 wt 10 wt emim dep and 20 100 mg l 1 metal ions such as k ca2 mg2 cu2 zn2 and fe3 39 among them fe3 can be precipitated to remove by simple ph adjusting and the effect of na on the properties of regeneration cellulose is neglectful therefore the removal of na and fe3 was not considered and the k ca2 cu2 mg2 and zn2 metal ions were considered as model ions in the adsorption screen and the parameter optimization in the adsorbent screening stage the initial concentrations of metal ions and emim dep were 100 mg l 1 and 2 wt respectively then 2 5 g of solid adsorbent was exposed to the 100 ml feed

effect of ph on the adsorption ability of mmss to metal ions ph of the feeding solution was adjusted to 3 10 with the hcl and naoh solutions over the temperature range from 288 15 to 328 15 k the appropriate adsorption temperatures were chosen for the adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption kinetics were evaluated by sampling every hour for 24 h and the adsorption efficiency was determined in addition the fixed bed adsorption experiments were further carried out the mmss was filled in a vertical downflow glass column with a radius of 0 6 cm and adsorption bed height of 5 cm the flow rate was controlled by a peristaltic pump at 1 or 2 ml min 1 and monitored by a flowmeter the liquid supernatant was centrifugated and filtered to obtain samples for each group of experiments the

reusability performance could significantly reduce the operating cost therefore it is one of the key factors to measure the performance of adsorbents the adsorbed mmss were firstly washed by pure water to remove the residual solutions on the surface then it was put into the 0 25 m hcl solution for desorption after stirring for 120 min it was taken out and regenerated by the 0 25 m naoh solution and reused for the next adsorption run after washing by pure water for 3 times 2 4 data processing the removal ratio of il r il and metal ions r m adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 and distribution coefficient k d ml g 1 were calculated using the following equations 41 44 1 r il c 0 il c e il c 0 il 100 2 r m c 0 m c e m c 0 m 100 3 q e mg g 1 c 0 c e v 1 m 1 4 k d c 1 v 2 m 2 100 where c 0 mg l 1 and c e mg l 1 are the concentrations of emim dep and metal ions in the aqueous solution at the initial and equilibrium conditions of adsorption experiment v 1 and v 2 represent the volumes of il solution and eluent m 1 and m 2 are the mass of metal ions before and after the adsorption experiment respectively m represents the different metal ions coexisted i e k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 the adsorption data obtained in the column experiments are fitted by the thomas model which can be described by the follow equation 5 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th v m q 0 c 0 vt where v ml min 1 is the volumetric flow rate q 0 mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity k th l mg min 1 is the rate constant m g is the mass of mmss adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to fit the adsorption ratio to further evaluate the adsorption kinetics of mmss adsorbents for the separation of metal ions the following is the model formula expression pseudo first order model equation 45 dq t dt k 1 q e q t 6 where k 1 min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and q e and q t are the amounts of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t h respectively pseudo second order model equation 20 7 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant q e and q t are the amounts of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t h respectively adsorption thermodynamics in order to further clarify the adsorption behavior of mmss the adsorption thermodynamic fitting was carried out and the equations were listed below 46 8 ln k d s 0 r h 0 r 1 t 9 g 0 h 0 t s 0 where k d refers to the distribution coefficient t k is the temperature r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 the values of δs 0 and δh 0 were obtained from the intercept and slope of van t hoff plot fig 2f and δg 0 was calculated by the above equation 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbents screening to investigate the adsorption performance of metal ions by mmss with different sizes the batch adsorption experiments were carried out so as to screen the optimal particle size for removing metal ions from the emim dep aqueous solution and evaluate the adsorption properties of the adsorbent toward different metal ions interestingly the particle size of mmss played a significant role in removal ratios and kinetics as shown in fig 1a e the r m increased with the increasing adsorption time and the smaller particle size the higher removal ratio of various metal ions and the faster adsorption kinetics as the result in fig 1f the 1 6 mm mms showed the highest removal ratios 85 15 98 4 98 3 99 6 and 99 9 for k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 respectively and shorter equilibrium time 6 8 h however the other mmss showed slightly lower removal ratios for example the removal ratios of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 by mmss of 4 6 mm were 82 14 64 58 68 45 77 87 and 74 49 respectively unfortunately the adsorption equilibrium time reached 24 h as stated in our previous work the removal of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 was achieved via the ion exchange interaction at si o na groups which could be also discussed in the following 39 considering the chemical formulas and adsorption mechanism of the different sizes of mmss were the same the surface area and pore properties were essential to explain this result which were provided in table s1 it was found that the specific surface area and pore volume increased with the decreasing particle size of mmss which was provided more contact areas for metal ions facilitating the adsorption process in general the smaller particle size the larger specific surface area the more adsorption sites exposed better adsorption performance and faster kinetics as a result the 1 6 mm mms obtained high removal ratio and fast adsorption kinetics adsorption equilibrium time for various metal ions within 6 8 h the equilibrium time was much shorter than 10 molecular sieve indicating its superiority in practical application the principle of adsorption material screening was that it has high selectivity and can remove metal ions to a large extent with minimal il loss in this case the concentrations of emim dep after adsorption were also determined which were nearly equal to those in the original il solutions fig 1f showed the adsorption ratio of different adsorbents for emim dep and it was clear that there was almost no emim dep loss during the process of removing metal ions this was mainly attributed to the mismatch between the pore size of the mms 37 and the cationic radius of the emim dep which leads to size sieving effect and the spatial constraints the pore sizes of mmss were ranging from 1 05 to 1 27 nm table s1 however the ionic radius of emim was approximately 3 1 å and in the emim dep h2o mixture there exists the ion interaction between the cation anion of il and water molecules 45 in this case emim dep existed in the form of ion paired aggregates and the mesoscale aggregates made the diameter larger than the pore sizes of mmss 32 37 but this pore sizes were enough for the migration of metal ions leading to the high removal ratios of metal ions and minimal loss of emim dep during adsorption in addition it was crystallized in a cubic structure corresponding to the faujasite x type zeolite as shown in fig 7c for the xrd analysis of 1 6 mm mms and the unique octahedral structure existed a certain hindrance effect on migration for emim dep cluster therefore emim dep was difficult to migrate through pores with a low removal ratio and almost no loss of il to sum up the above discussion 1 6 mm mms was an ideal adsorbent with high selectivity 3 2 optimization of batch adsorption experiment conditions to further determine the optimal adsorption conditions for separating metal ions from emim dep aqueous solution the concentration of emim dep dosage of mms ph temperature and time were investigated the fig 2a indicated that the mms hardly adsorbed ils even if the concentrations of emim dep were increased to 20 100 g l for the reasons explained in adsorbents screening section subsequently the effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal ratios of metal ions and emim dep was shown fig 2b the r m was positively correlated with the input amounts of mms it could be explained that the active adsorption sites became more abundant with the increasing amounts of mms therefore considering the factors of high removal ratio and low cost when the amount of adsorbent was 2 5 g l 1 the satisfactory results could be obtained then it was clearly seen from fig 2c that the r m was investigated at different ph values cu2 and zn2 were not considered because they could precipitate under alkaline conditions the effect of ph the adsorption performance of cu2 and zn2 by 1 6 mm mms were also investigated about the ph range 3 7 and the results were shown fig s7 according to the experimental results ph value has no obvious effect on the r m at dosage of 2 5 g l 1 after that the dosages of mms were reduced from 2 5 to 1 0 g l 1 to verify this phenomenon again the zeta potential of mms was shown in fig s2 it can be seen that the mms surface was negatively charged and the negative charge was enhanced with increasing ph values due to the electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and the negative charge on the mms surface the removal ratios of metal ions showed a slight increase with the increase of ph values this result indicated that the adsorbent could be applied in different kinds of aqueous solutions with a wide ph range compared to the previous reports 47 taking into consideration the case where the ph of the recovered emim dep solution approximate to 3 the feed solution was adjusted to this ph for the subsequent experiments fig 2d showed the influence of temperature on the r m the behavior of mms to adsorb metal ions was a spontaneous endothermic process has been discussed in detail in the section of adsorption thermodynamics therefore an increase in temperature was more favorable for the process in addition fig s6 showed the viscosity of the feed liquid at different temperatures as the temperature increases the viscosity of the feed liquid decreases which accelerates the solute diffusion and facilitates the solute transport thus it could be seen that the r m presented an increasing trend with the increase of temperature considering the energy consumption cost the optimal experimental temperature was determined as 298 15 k fig 2e shows the r m and r il versus time the removal ratios of each metal ion increased rapidly in the first 3 h and then reached the adsorption equilibrium within 6 h which was shorter than those of 10 ms 39 for the consideration of industrialization the adsorption time was selected as 8 h in conclusion the optimal adsorption experiment conditions were carried out at 100 ml of feed liquid into 2 5 g mms metal ions concentrations of 100 mg l 1 emim dep concentration of 20 g l 1 ph 3 0 room temperature and 8 h 3 3 adsorption kinetics adsorption equilibrium time was an important parameter of adsorption materials the r m by mms with time changes were shown in fig 2e to understand the adsorption process the lagergren pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models were fitted 48 and the expression formula of calculation was in the supporting information as shown in fig 3a and b it was found that the r 2 of pseudo second order model was larger than the former indicating that the adsorption behavior of the adsorbent for metal ions were more consistent with the pseudo second order model moreover the adsorption results calculated by the model were in good agreement with the experimental values these results demonstrated the chemisorption process of the adsorption process indicating the chemisorption process according to the adsorption kinetic constant k 2 of pseudo second order model it could be seen that zn2 cu2 ca2 mg2 k which agreed well with the experimental phenomenon in addition the adsorption constant k 2 was greater than that of the existing adsorbent such as 10 molecular sieve 39 resin activated carbon etc 49 51 the larger the k 2 the faster the adsorption kinetic which further exhibited the benign practical application value 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics adsorption thermodynamics is very crucial to understand the adsorption behavior therefore the adsorption performance versus temperature were evaluated and the fig 2f shows fitting results table 1 showed the values of enthalpy δh 0 entropy δs 0 and gibbs free energy δg 0 for impurities metal ions at different temperatures it was clear that δh 0 and δs 0 were all positive indicating the endothermic process while the values of δg 0 were negative indicating that the adsorption behavior of metal ions separation by 1 6 mm mms was a spontaneous process 3 5 dynamic adsorption comparing with the batch adsorption the dynamic adsorption fixed bed adsorption is essential in providing more precise data for the implementation of practical amplification applications in this work the dynamic adsorption was carried out and the flow rates of 1 and 2 ml min 1 were used as shown in fig 4 the saturated adsorption time at different flow rates was at 900 1500 min indicating that the favorable stability of mms which could be used to remove metal ions for a long term during the dynamic adsorption process the lower the flow rate the longer the contact time between the feed solution and the adsorbent which will lead to full adsorption of metal ions thus obtaining a wider dynamic adsorption curve however compared with the dynamic adsorption the contact time between the feed solution and the adsorbent was longer in the batch adsorption process so the r m was higher 52 thus the contact time of dynamic adsorption was relatively short resulting in the slightly lower removal ratio in most case metal ions will diffuse to the surface and interior of the adsorbent at a lower flow rate and the length of the mass transfer zone decreases as the mass transfer driving force decreases 52 as listed in table 2 with the increasing flow rate from 1 0 to 2 0 ml min 1 k th was found to increase with the increasing flow rate resulting from the change in the mass transport resistance these studies provided an important reference value for the formulation of actual process and the determination of process parameters 3 6 adsorbent recycle and regeneration in the desorption process the pre experiment was carried out to screen the optimal eluents such as nacl naoh and hcl with various concentration in comparison with other solvents hcl naoh was found to be good solvent combination thus after adsorption the mms were firstly washed by pure water to remove the residual solutions on the surface then it was put into hcl solution for desorption after stirring for 120 min it was taken out and regenerated by naoh solution and reused for the next adsorption run after washing by pure water for 3 times fig 5 obviously showed that the adsorption ratios of ca2 and zn2 were still high 95 after five times of adsorption although the adsorption ratios of cu2 mg2 and k decreased the removal performance was satisfactory moreover the adsorption of emim dep on the regenerated mms was negligible indicating the stable adsorption performance of mms during the recycle experiments in addition the morphologies of fresh mms fig 6a adsorbed mms fig 6b and eluted adsorbent fig 6c were compared due to the interaction between metal ions and mms the surface of the adsorbent has more protrusions the eds mapping of mms loaded with metal ions was collected as an example indicating that k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 elements were uniformly distributed fig 6d after elution the morphology of the desorbed mms was similar to that of the fresh adsorbent and na al si and o elements were evenly distributed in the structure of the adsorbent verifying the excellent structural stability of the adsorbent during the adsorption desorption process all of these demonstrated the application potential of mms in the metal ions removal from the high concentration emim dep aqueous solutions 3 7 adsorption mechanism the fresh adsorbed k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 and desorbed mms were characterized by xps to further confirm the adsorption mechanism the characteristic peaks of na 1s o 1s si 2p and al 2p appeared at 1071 8 532 2 102 4 and 74 5 ev d in the spectra adsorption respectively fig 7a however after adsorption some fresh characteristic peaks were observed at 1303 2 1022 6 933 2 352 1 and 307 2 ev in the spectra of si 2p which were matched to mg 1s zn 2p cu 2p ca 2p and k 1s illustrating the favorable affinity of mms for metal ions as shown in fig 7b the binding energy of sisi and sio bands decreased by 0 4 ev and 0 3 ev after adsorption which could account for explain by the substitution of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 for na via the ion exchange interaction at si o na group the increase in na concentration after adsorption also indicated the above ion exchange mechanism also the previous adsorption kinetics study further verified the chemical ion exchange process the xrd patterns before and after adsorption fig 7c were similar and the reason was that this ion exchange process occurred but did not change the crystal structure 53 54 the ft ir spectra was shown in fig 7d and the spectrum before and after adsorption were similar the characteristic peak at 3498 and 1655 cm 1 were broad and strong that fall to the stretching and bending vibrations of oh in the h2o molecules the vicinity of 1020 and 482 cm 1 corresponds to the characteristic peak of al o si and si o si structures substantiated the silicate aluminate property of the adsorbents interestingly two peaks were observed around peak 1400 cm 1 because of the cation exchange process 54 in addition as previously stated it was further found that there were no absorption peaks of il was found in ft ir spectra which indicated the negligible adsorption of emim dep into mms and the rejection of emim dep was mainly forced by the pore size and steric hindrance as a result the adsorption mechanism of 1 6 mm mms for metal ions was the synergetic effects of ion exchange process with na and the spatial confinement 3 8 the practical application in addition to verify the removal performance of mms for metal ions from actual ionic liquids aqueous solutions the emim dep spinning solutions 5 wt obtained from xinxiang henan province were used 32 the concentrations of metal ions before and after adsorption were shown in table 3 it could be clearly found that the removal ratios of these impurity ions exceeded 86 7 and most of them could reach about 99 but that for emim dep was negligible 0 4 in this case the residual concentration of the metal ions were below 0 26 mg l 1 moreover the mms developed in this work exhibited considerable removal ratios and faster adsorption kinetics than 10 molecular sieve which exhibited promising application potential table s3 4 conclusion in this work the size sieving and ion exchange strategy was proposed for the removal of metal ions from emim dep solution generated in the cellulose spinning process was investigated the modified molecular sieves mmss with different size were used and the effect of particle size was investigated the 1 6 mm mms exhibited the superior advantages over metal ions with high removal ratios high selectivity and short adsorption equilibrium time 6 8 h benefiting from the size sieving effect the removal ratios of k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 could reach 88 9 98 4 98 9 99 6 and 99 9 respectively and the removal ratio of larger emim dep molecule was lower than 0 7 as a result the influence of metal ion impurities on regeneration cellulose could be effectively avoided in addition the adsorption kinetics adsorption thermodynamics dynamic adsorption and the reuse of adsorbent were evaluated the high removal ratios of metal ions from the actual emim dep solutions indicated the potential application in the purification of real ionic liquids in conclusion this cost effective modified molecular sieve could realize the efficient removal of metal ions from the ils

12554,ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is the most common pollutant in wastewater which consumes dissolved oxygen in water and causes eutrophication in water bodies and is an important control indicator in wastewater treatment biological process is not suitable for wastewater with poor biodegradability and difficult to meet increasing strict discharge standards physical chemical methods such as ion exchange fold point chlorination and fenton oxidation would introduce new substances to wastewater leading to potential pollutants catalytic ozonation technology can effectively remove ammonia nitrogen without introducing other substances and improve the nitrogen selectivity of reaction products by controlling the reaction conditions however studies on catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen were scattered and systematic induction was necessary in this paper the removal effect product distribution and reaction mechanism of metal oxide catalyst composite metal catalyst and activated carbon catalyst in catalytic ozonation for ammonia nitrogen were summarized catalyst is one of the keys to achieve high nitrogen selectivity by catalytic ozonation of ammonia and the nitrogen selectivity was compared for different catalysts in this paper besides based on literatures the figures for mechanism of catalytic ozonation by several catalysts were drawn to help others understand easily according to the discussion of literatures the emphasis in future studies were proposed it is important to study the catalytic mechanism in depth further improve the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen and nitrogen selectivity in products explore the effect of the actual composition of the wastewater on catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and pay attention to the catalyst loss rate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic ozonation metal oxide catalyst composite metal catalyst activated carbon ammonia nitrogen data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is one of the common pollutants in wastewater which is primarily existed in the form of ammonium ions nh4 and free ammonia nh3 1 ammonia nitrogen has a wide range of sources mainly originating from industrial agricultural and municipal wastewater discharges ammonia nitrogen depletes dissolved oxygen in water causing eutrophication of water bodies and disrupting ecological balance 2 3 in addition ammonia nitrogen in water is produced as nitrate and nitrite by the action of microorganisms which affects water organisms and human health ammonia nitrogen pollutant has become a key object affecting the environmental quality of surface water and is the second binding control target after cod which is controlled in all kinds of water quality standards the chinese environmental quality standard for surface water specifies the limit value of ammonia nitrogen in class v surface water as 2 0 mg l 4 the ammonia nitrogen limit value in drinking water standards was lower than 0 5 mg l in china the european union france germany south korea and so on 5 6 currently the main technologies for the treatment of low concentration ammonia nitrogen wastewater are biological physical chemical and advanced oxidation methods which have been reviewed by researchers 7 8 biological and physical chemical methods have been used commercially for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater but both have application limitations biological methods are strongly influenced by water quality and can generate large amounts of sludge especially for high salt wastewater which is poorly biochemical and difficult to meet discharge standards 9 the physical chemical methods mainly include ion exchange method fold point chlorination method and membrane separation method the ion exchange capacity of the ion exchange method is limited and the ion exchanger needs frequent regeneration then the ammonia nitrogen removal rate will be reduced 10 the introduction of chlorine gas by the folding point chlorination method will inevitably leave residual chlorine and cause secondary pollution 11 12 in the membrane separation method the membrane is easy to be polluted blocked and leaked the replacement or backwashing of the membrane increases the treatment cost 10 with the increasingly strict requirements for ammonia nitrogen emission around the world it is necessary to find more effective methods for ammonia nitrogen treatment advanced oxidation method generates strong oxidizing hydroxyl radical oh which can oxidize and degrade the refractory substances into low toxic or non toxic small molecule substances 13 ozonation as one of the advanced oxidation methods has a wide range of applications in the field of water treatment and it has the advantages of strong oxidation no introduction of other substances and no secondary pollution compared with other advanced oxidation methods 14 the addition of catalysts can promote ozone decomposition and generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals to improve the pollutant removal rate it has been researched that ozonation can effectively realize the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen and generate nitrate and nitrogen under the action of catalyst 15 17 so far the research of catalytic ozonation technology to treat ammonia nitrogen is still in laboratory and pilot scale usually using column reactor reaction solution and catalyst are preplaced in the reactor and ozone is aerated from the bottom to the top and a gas liquid solid three phase reaction occurs there is no doubt that the optimized design of the reactor to enhance the gas liquid solid contact can improve the removal of ammonia nitrogen however in order to maximize the harmless treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by catalytic ozonation technology the key is to find and select appropriate catalysts to improve the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and the selectivity of nitrogen in the product in the research heterogeneous catalysts are mainly used in catalytic ozonation for ammonia nitrogen treatment including metal oxide catalysts composite oxide catalysts active carbon and its supported catalysts etc however most of the current research only focuses on one or a few kinds of catalysts which is fragmented and lacks systematic summary and generalization as follows i the current study only explores the reaction conditions for the catalytic effect of one type of catalyst and there is a lack of horizontal comparison of the catalytic effect of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen by various types of catalysts ii the mechanism of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with various catalysts in the existing studies has not been conclusively established and needs to be further sorted out iii the influence of wastewater composition on catalyst performance needs to be explored in depth this paper summarizes the mechanism of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and deeply analyzes the effect of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with various types of heterogeneous catalysts the catalytic mechanisms of different catalysts and the reaction pathways of ammonia nitrogen are summarized based on the literature in addition the shortcomings of the present study are analyzed and future research priorities are proposed to provide a basis for the subsequent catalyst selection and modification 2 status of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen 2 1 introduction of ozonation technology the oxidation performance of an oxidant is closely related to its redox potential the redox potential of ozone is greatly affected by ph value 2 07 v under acidic condition and 1 24 v under alkaline condition as in eqs 1 and 2 the ozonation technology treats pollutants in wastewater mainly depends on the direct oxidation by ozone and the indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals under acidic conditions direct oxidation by ozone is dominant under alkaline conditions indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is dominant 18 19 2 1 1 direct ozone oxidation ozone is a strong oxidizing agent that provides direct oxidation of organic and inorganic substances in water acidic condition 1 o 3 2 h 2 e o 2 h 2 o alkaline condition 2 o 3 h 2 o e o 2 2 oh reaction eqs 1 and 2 are redox reactions with a direct mechanism of action in addition there are cycloaddition reactions electrophilic substitution reactions and nucleophilic reactions 20 21 but nucleophilic reactions have not been confirmed in aqueous solutions yet 2 1 2 indirect oxidation of hydroxyl radicals the reaction of ozone is more complex in aqueous solution generating hydroxyl radicals and other radicals table 1 lists the redox potentials of several common oxidants among them the hydroxyl radical redox potential is 2 80 v it is highly oxidizing less selective for reactants and can act directly on organic and inorganic substances 22 23 depending on the ph of the aqueous solution there exist different pathways for hydroxyl radical and other types of radicals generation mainly including the following two 25 26 1 when the solution ph is at neutral hydroxyl radical generation follows the sbh model proposed by staehelin hoigne and buhler et al as in eqs 3 6 and 2 when the solution ph is high hydroxyl radical generation follows the tfg model proposed by tomiyasu fukutomi and gordon et al as in eqs 7 11 sbh 3 o 3 oh o 2 h o 2 4 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 5 o 3 h h o 3 6 h o 3 oh o 2 tfg 7 o 3 oh ho 2 o 2 8 ho 2 o 3 o 3 ho 2 9 ho 2 o 2 h 10 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 11 o 3 h 2 o oh o 2 oh in addition when the solution ph is very high ozone and oh can react directly to form hydroxyl radicals 25 as in eqs 12 13 although the hydroxyl radicals are generated by different reaction processes they are all generated through the initiation reaction of oh as an initiator with o3 12 o 3 oh o 3 oh 13 o 3 h 2 o oh o 2 oh ozonation technology mainly conducts oxidation reaction with pollutants through ozone and hydroxyl radicals the reaction rate is fast and the reaction products are mainly o2 co2 and h2o which will not produce secondary pollution 2 2 mechanism and research status of ozonation technology for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater ozonation technology is generally used for wastewater pretreatment or advanced treatment when ozonation is used as pretreatment of wastewater it can oxidize difficult macromolecular organics to easily degradable micromolecular organics and improve the biochemical properties of wastewater for subsequent biological treatment and other water purification processes 27 28 and when ozonation is used for the advanced treatment it mainly targets the pollutants that are difficult to biodegrade in wastewater to meet the wastewater discharge standards 29 31 ammonia nitrogen is one of the common pollutants in wastewater there is an ionization equilibrium between ammonium ions and free ammonia in water as shown in eq 14 the higher the ph the higher the proportion of nh3 the lower the ph the higher the proportion of nh4 at ph value is 7 of the wastewater ammonia nitrogen exists mainly in the form of nh4 while 90 is free ammonia at ph value is 11 14 nh 4 o h n h 3 h 2 o the degradation of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozonation is strongly influenced by ph when ph is neutral ammonia nitrogen exists mainly as nh4 and the reaction process is mainly o3 oxidation of nh4 as in eqs 15 17 32 at high ph it is conducive to the formation of free ammonia in eq 14 at this time a small amount of ammonia nitrogen is blown out as free ammonia however a study 33 showed that only about 3 of ammonia nitrogen was blown out even at ph of 11 which was also confirmed by our experiments therefore it is usually ignored for ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen in addition high ph accelerates the decomposition of ozone to react with oh to form various types of free radicals and oh as shown in eqs 3 and 13 the reaction rate of o3 with free ammonia is about 20 times faster compared to that of ammonium ion 34 at this point the direct interaction of ozone with free ammonia eqs 18 20 and the indirect interaction of oh with free ammonia eqs 21 23 occur the ozonation process generates a variety of free radicals and the researcher xiong et al 35 explored the active substances acting in the degradation of phenol in the ac o3 system and verified the presence of o2 h2o2 and oh by adding the corresponding free radical quenchers among which oh plays a major role however few studies have made a detailed and independent discussion on the treatment of ammonia nitrogen a large number of experiments have verified the existence of oh by adding tert butanol a hydroxyl radical inhibitor 33 36 37 and some experiments showed that the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency decreased by as much as about 45 after the addition of tert butanol 37 therefore it is speculated that hydroxyl radical is the main radical for ozone oxidation treatment of ammonia nitrogen and superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide radical are the auxiliary radicals the main radicals and the main mechanism of action may be different under different reaction conditions catalyst ph etc and more detailed and extensive research experiments are needed to supplement this research gap 15 nh 4 3 o 3 2 h n o 2 h 2 o 3 o 2 16 nh 4 4 o 3 2 h n o 3 h 2 o 4 o 2 17 2 nh 4 3 o 3 n 2 3 h 2 o 2 h 3 o 2 ammonia nitrogen degradation products are usually nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and n2 there are also a small amount of other gaseous nitrogen products no no2 n2o in general due to the instability of nitrite only a very small amount of nitrite is present in the ammonia nitrogen degradation products and most of the generated nitrite is oxidized to nitrate as in eqs 24 and 25 therefore the degradation products of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen are mainly nitrate nitrogen and nitrogen gas and the summation of nitrogen gas selectivity and nitrate nitrogen selectivity is almost 1 when the nitrogen selectivity increased the nitrate selectivity decreased accordingly at present researchers are not only committed to reducing the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in wastewater but also committed to the removal of total nitrogen in wastewater among them the key to reduce total nitrogen is to convert ammonia nitrogen into harmless nitrogen and improve nitrogen selectivity 18 nh 3 3 o 3 h n o 2 h 2 o 3 o 2 19 nh 3 4 o 3 h n o 3 h 2 o 4 o 2 20 4 nh 3 o 3 2 n 2 3 h 2 o 6 h 21 nh 3 6 oh h n o 2 4 h 2 o 22 nh 3 8 oh h n o 3 5 h 2 o 23 2 nh 3 oh n 2 h 2 o 5 h 24 n o 2 o 3 no 3 o 2 25 no 2 2 oh no 3 h 2 o however the direct treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozonation technology is not very effective it was shown that nh4 hardly reacts with o3 38 and the primary reaction rate of nh3 with o3 is only 20 m 1 s 1 39 sun 40 studied ozonation technology for treating high concentration ammonia nitrogen wastewater and found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate increased with the increase of ph however under the condition of ph 10 and reaction time of 120 min the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen 500 mg l treated with 715 2 mg l ozone was only 26 3 of which 85 3 was converted to nitrate nitrogen the results of this study indicated that ozonation alone is not effective in removing ammonia nitrogen and its conversion products may cause secondary pollution and hazards zhang et al 41 showed that the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen 200 mg l treated by ozonation was almost 0 under neutral conditions and it was only 16 7 at ph 11 therefore ozonation alone is not very effective in treating ammonia nitrogen which is due to the low ozone utilization and critically the low production of hydroxyl radicals the research shows that the presence of catalysts can promote the production of hydroxyl radicals by ozone 42 and the removal of ammonia nitrogen can be greatly improved by choosing a suitable catalyst coupled with ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen 43 46 3 current status of research on catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen wastewater the catalysts for catalytic ozonation are mainly homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts most of the homogeneous catalysts are transition metal ions generally fe ii co ii mn ii cu ii ni ii cd ii etc which are soluble in water difficult to recover and remove causing secondary pollution to wastewater and limiting its wide application heterogeneous catalysts appear as solid phase avoiding the disadvantages of homogeneous catalysts that are not easily separated from water and they have low solubility good stability the ability to be reused and reduce wastewater treatment costs which are very promising applications 47 48 the main heterogeneous catalysts are metal oxides metal and metal oxide composites supported catalysts and carbon based materials etc 49 metal oxides such as co3o4 cuo mgo mno2 and tio2 are common catalysts in ozonation processes and their surface properties crystalline form and pore structure have an effect on catalyst activity 50 composite catalysts combine two and more catalysts and the different components produce synergistic effects making the activity of the composite catalysts better than that of single components supported catalysts use high temperature calcination process to load active metal salts on the carrier generally γ al2o3 molecular sieves ceramics and activated carbon as carriers carbon based materials include activated carbon activated coke graphene etc these materials are commonly used because of their large specific surface area and high mechanical strength the effectiveness of catalytic ozonation for treating actual wastewater with ammonia nitrogen is influenced by the composition of the wastewater among them the presence of organic matter would compete with ammonia nitrogen for ozone and reactive radicals and the current studies focused on the effect of several common inorganic ions in water on ammonia nitrogen in catalytic ozonation system it has been shown that inorganic anions co3 2 so4 2 po4 3 etc would consume hydroxyl radicals generated in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen thereby reducing the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen 51 in addition there are also some ions that will have a promotional effect some studies have shown that cl and br would generate activity on heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and enhance the removal of ammonia nitrogen 52 nh4cl and nh4 2so4 were usually used for simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater in ozone catalytic oxidation experiment thus the influence of cl and so4 2 on ammonia nitrogen removal was concerned in current studies there are also some inorganic cations such as na k and ca2 which almost have no effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen and will not be discussed later the catalytic ozonation technology with heterogeneous catalysts has been widely studied in the treatment of organic pollutants and the related mechanism has been thoroughly discussed in the following the mechanism is expressed and mapped which is expected to enlighten the mechanism study of catalytic oxidation technology for treating ammonia nitrogen legube et al 53 proposed two mechanisms for catalytic ozonation by heterogeneous catalysts 1 chemisorption of organic matter on the catalyst surface leading to further reactions with gas or liquid phase ozone as shown in fig 1 a 2 mutual reactions between chemisorbed sites occurring when both organic matter and ozone are chemisorbed on the catalyst surface as shown in fig 1 b kasprzyk hordern et al 54 suggested a third mechanism of action for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 3 chemisorption of ozone on the catalyst surface to generate an active substance that can react with non chemisorbed organic molecules in contrast to catalytic ozonation of organics there are few studies on the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozonation with heterogeneous catalysts this chapter will review some of the heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic ozonation technology to treat ammonia nitrogen 3 1 metal oxide catalysts among the catalytic ozonation technologies metal oxide catalysts are commonly used class for treating wastewater with high efficiency and fast reaction rate the catalytic properties exhibited by different surface properties of metal oxides are also different in recent years many scholars have studied metal oxide catalytic ozonation for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater and the reaction conditions and treatment effects are shown in table 2 3 1 1 co3o4 scholars mahardiani et al 55 conducted a laboratory scale study on the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl by a variety of metal oxides mox m fe mn co sn cu mg ni and al and found that co3o4 has high nitrogen selectivity and activity and low solubility in the liquid phase at the reaction temperature of 333 k initial ph of 5 4 catalyst dosage of 1 g l and o3 flow rate of 100 ml min the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen catalyzed by co3o4 catalyst reached 74 n2 accounted for 88 and no3 accounted for 12 in the products the article found that the standard molar enthalpy of production per molar oxygen atom of metal oxide h f is one of the factors affecting the nitrogen selectivity of the catalyst and the smaller the value of h f the weaker the mo bond of the metal oxide the lower the active oxygen density on the catalyst surface and the high nitrogen selectivity subsequently mahardiani et al 56 explored the stability of co3o4 and the catalytic activity of the co3o4 catalyst was found to increase with the number of uses when the catalytic ozonation process of ammonia nitrogen was repeated under the same reaction conditions the co3o4 catalyst was used in ozonation to treat the ammonia nitrogen with an initial concentration of 540 mg l and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 80 from 30 after nine times of reuse it was found that the reaction between the hydroxyl group on the surface of co3o4 and nh4 in the solution produced co nhx group on the surface of co3o4 catalyst which increased the activity of co3o4 meanwhile the co3o4 catalytic ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen still maintained 80 nitrogen selectivity after nine times of reuse it can be seen that co3o4 not only has high catalytic activity but also strong stability which is a good choice of catalyst for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen in 2020 krisbiantoro et al 15 investigated the mechanism of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl nh4 2so4 with co3o4 catalyst it was shown that cl played a key role in this process o3 would oxidize cl to clo in the presence of cl and then clo oxidized nh4 to form nitrate chloramine and gaseous products on the surface of catalyst co3o4 based on the above study the mechanism of action is mapped in this paper as shown in fig 2 however the paper indicated that in the presence of so4 2 the removal of ammonia nitrogen was 0 under o3 alone and co3o4 o3 system but when chloride ions were added to this solution it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate and gaseous nitrogen selectivity increased with the increase of chloride ion concentration it is evident that chloride ions are indispensable for the system to degrade ammonia nitrogen however there are two questions that need to be further investigated i it is unclear which substances play the main oxidation action in the system besides clo whether there are active substances such as oh or cl present needs further clarification after all it has been indicated that both oh and cl exist in the ozonation of ammonia nitrogen when cl is present in the solution 57 ii does so4 2 play an inhibitory role if oh is present in the system so4 2 has a trapping effect on hydroxyl radicals and so4 2 may also be adsorbed or complexed on the catalyst surface affecting the catalyst activity therefore the roles of chloride ions and sulfate need to be explored in depth in conclusion it is clear from the above study that co3o4 is suitable for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen in wastewater where cl is also present most of the wastewater has different concentrations of cl which is very favorable for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation with co3o4 catalyst 3 1 2 mgo guo et al 58 developed mgo catalyst for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen 50 mg l by precipitation method the results showed that the mgo exhibited the highest catalytic activity at a calcination temperature of 500 c when the ph was 9 the ozone flow rate was 12 mg min the catalyst dosage was 1 g l and the reaction temperature was 60 c the ammonia removal rate reached 96 after 120 min the article verified that oh was formed in the system of mgo o3 degradation of ammonia nitrogen by adding oh inhibitor tert butanol indicating that the degradation process was direct o3 action and indirect oh action the ability of mgo o3 system to treat ammonia nitrogen was also investigated by mahardiani 55 et al it was found that mgo possesses high catalytic activity which can achieve 95 removal rate of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation at a reaction temperature of 60 c however the nitrogen selectivity of mgo was low and the main product of ammonia nitrogen conversion was nitrate nitrogen which would cause secondary pollution to water bodies under higher temperature conditions 50 60 c mgo has excellent ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in ozonation process but maintaining high catalytic activity at low temperatures such as room temperature or winter is very important and a key step to improve the economic efficiency liu et al 17 investigated the efficiency of mgo catalytic ozonation for ammonia nitrogen removal at low temperatures and found that in the temperature range of 0 c 10 c obtained 77 53 80 17 ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency compared with the conventional biological treatment catalytic ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen at low temperatures is a promising treatment technology in addition the mechanism of mgo catalytic ozonation for the removal of ammonia nitrogen was discussed in this paper although mgo was a heterogeneous catalyst it was still partially dissolved in water which made the reaction solution alkaline and promoted the oxidation of free ammonia in water by o3 o3 and nh3 were adsorbed on the surface of mgo for the reaction in the presence of cl part of the ammonia nitrogen was degraded by clo oxidation krisbiantoro et al 15 also found that mgo dissolved in water to generate oh so that the ph of the reaction solution could be maintained at about 9 ensuring the reaction of oh with o3 to generate oh for the removal of ammonia nitrogen but this also made the leaching of mg2 severe through the above literature the mechanism of ammonia nitrogen removal by mgo o3 system is summarized in this paper as the following three points as shown in fig 3 i mgo surface adsorbs o3 and free ammonia and the two react on the catalyst surface releasing the active site after the reaction to prepare for the next surface reaction ii mgo dissolves in water to generate oh which keeps the ph of the reaction solution at alkaline on the one hand it increases the concentration of free ammonia in the solution on the other hand oh reacts with o3 to produce more oh finally it promotes the reaction of o3 and oh with free ammonia to produce nitrate nitrogen and gaseous nitrogen products iii when cl is present in the solution o3 reacts with cl to produce clo which oxidizes the small amount of nh4 present in the solution to produce nitrate nitrogen and gaseous nitrogen products a comprehensive analysis of the above mentioned literatures concluded that the mgo catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen still has the following problems that need to be further investigated i mgo dissolved in water will introduce mg2 into the solution and cause catalyst loss but most of the studies have not done quantitative analysis of mg2 dissolved in water and catalyst loss ii the nitrogen selectivity of mgo catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is low and the main product of ammonia nitrogen degradation is nitrate nitrogen and no study has been conducted to improve the nitrogen selectivity iii whether cl is involved in the reaction and whether clo is produced and involved in the degradation of ammonia nitrogen is still doubtful and more in depth studies are needed 3 1 3 al2o3 al2o3 often appears as a catalyst carrier but it can also be used as a catalyst for catalytic ozonation processes al2o3 exists in several crystalline forms mainly α al2o3 β al2o3 and γ al2o3 and different structures have different properties several researchers 59 60 indicated that when the ph of the solution is the one corresponding to the zero charge point on the surface of al2o3 ph phpzc 8 9 al2o3 has the highest activity which facilitates the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radicals on the catalyst surface the surface hydroxyl density of al2o3 is positively correlated with the catalytic ozone capacity and the higher the surface hydroxyl density the more favorable to catalyze the decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals 59 wu et al 37 investigated the treatment of ammonia nitrogen 50 mg l wastewater by γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation when the initial ph of the solution was 9 the catalyst dosage was 100 g l and the ozone concentration was 50 mg l the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was 62 72 after the reaction for 60 min almost all converted to nitrate nitrogen the highest ammonia removal rate was not at ph phpzc 8 9 but the higher ph the higher ammonia removal rate for ammonia nitrogen wastewater ph has a great influence on the fraction of free ammonia and ammonium ions at ph 11 free ammonia is mainly present in the wastewater and the reaction rate between ozone and free ammonia is faster in addition the paper hypothesized that γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen was an indirect action of hydroxyl radicals by adding hydroxyl radical inhibitors tert butanol ernst et al 61 investigated the degradation of organic acids by γ al2o3 catalytic oxidation according to its mechanism this paper speculates on the mechanism of γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen as follows o3 reacts with the hydroxyl radical on the surface of γ al2o3 to produce ho3 which can decompose to produce oh oh and o3 oxidize ammonia nitrogen as shown in fig 4 in general the study of al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is not deep enough and some of the findings are inconsistent as follows i the ph value to achieve the maximum ammonia nitrogen removal rate is inconclusive ii the product distribution of γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is not studied and iii the mechanism of al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with different crystal types needs to be explored in depth 3 1 4 cao2 cao2 is a peroxide that acts as an oxygen releasing and oxidizing agent it is often used in wastewater treatment as an oxidizing agent that reacts with h in water to form h2o2 62 some studies have shown that the ammonia nitrogen in the overlying water can be removed significantly by adding a certain amount of cao2 to the substrate of the water body 63 64 in addition huang 65 studied the ability of several peroxides mox m ca mn zn to treat wastewater and the results of the study showed that cao2 had some effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen in 2022 diao et al 66 investigated several common metal oxides mox m ca mn nb ti al sb and ce for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen 10 mg l among them cao2 was the most effective catalyst at the cao2 dosage of 80 mg l the initial ph of 10 68 and the ozone flow rate of 2 5 g h the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 95 in only 15 min of reaction and the degradation products were almost all nitrate nitrogen in addition the authors found that the effect of cao2 catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen was much greater than the simple summation of single o3 and single cao2 system indicating the synergistic effect of both cao2 and o3 the mechanism of cao2 catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen was explained as follows i most cao2 underwent hydrolysis to form ca oh 2 resulting in an alkaline reaction solution and an increase in oh concentration in the solution which promoted the reaction between o3 oh and nh3 and ii a small amount of cao2 reacted with aqueous solution to form h2o2 and h2o2 reacted with o3 to form oh which promoted oh to oxidize ammonia nitrogen according to the above study the mechanism of cao2 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is mapped in this paper as shown in fig 5 the presence of cao2 increases the pathway of oh production in the solution making the cao2 o3 system fast in treating ammonia nitrogen and consuming less amount of catalyst its presence adds a new option for metal oxide catalytic ozonation to treat ammonia nitrogen however the products of cao2 o3 synergistic degradation of ammonia nitrogen are almost all converted to nitrate nitrogen which can cause secondary pollution to water bodies the reaction conditions need to be explored in the future to move the reaction products toward gaseous nitrogen in addition most of cao2 produced a large amount of ca2 by hydrolysis reaction whether the whole reaction system becomes homogeneous catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen remains to be discussed 3 2 composite oxide catalysts composite catalysts combine two and more components and the different components produce synergistic effects which make the performance and activity of the complexes improved and achieve better effects than those of single components in addition to metal oxide catalysts researchers have also worked on mixing different active components to prepare new composite catalysts and explore their effectiveness in catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen wastewater as shown in table 3 3 2 1 mgo co3o4 from section 3 1 it is known that the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen using mgo and co3o4 catalysts alone is effective the researchers prepared mgo co3o4 composite catalyst for catalytic ozonation to investigate the effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen chen et al 67 used co precipitation method to produce the mgo co3o4 catalyst to catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen 50 mg l and explored its optimal working conditions it was shown that the catalytic activity of the mgo co3o4 catalyst was highest when the mgo co3o4 molar ratio was 8 2 the calcination temperature was 500 c and the calcination time was 3 h at this time the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 85 2 and the gaseous nitrogen selectivity was 44 8 by catalytic ozonation with mgo co3o4 catalyst this study found that under the same experimental conditions the o3 mgo co3o4 system achieved high gaseous nitrogen selectivity at high ammonia nitrogen removal rate compared with o3 mgo and o3 co3o4 system in addition zhang et al 51 also conducted a laboratory scale study on the treatment of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl by catalytic ozonation with mgo co3o4 catalyst molar ratio of 2 1 calcination temperature of 500 c calcination time of 2 h it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was nearly 100 after 1 h of reaction at a reaction temperature of 30 c initial ph of 8 and catalyst dosage of 2 0 g l where the gaseous nitrogen selectivity was 84 26 the mgo co3o4 composite catalyst has many oxygen vacancies the oxygen vacancy can be regarded as an active oxygen reactant serving as the active center of molecular adsorption and catalytic reaction which is conducive to the adsorption and decomposition of ozone 68 69 the existence of cl is the key to the degradation of ammonia nitrogen in this system because when nh4 2so4 is used as the source of ammonia nitrogen the system has little ammonia nitrogen removal 5 at the active site of the catalyst cl reacted with ozone to generate clo which acted on ammonia nitrogen the relevant degradation mechanism is basically consistent with that of co3o4 synergistically ozonating ammonia nitrogen as shown in fig 1 in 2022 zhang et al 70 developed a novel mgo co3o4 ceo2 catalyst molar ratio of 4 1 1 calcination temperature of 700 c calcination time of 3 h by adding another active component ceo2 and explored the effect influencing factors and the corresponding mechanism of the catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl the results showed that under the optimal working conditions initial ph of 8 catalyst dosage of 2 0 g l and ozone concentration of 85 mg min the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 100 and the nitrogen selectivity was 86 94 under the same conditions the selectivity of nitrogen was 73 57 using mgo co3o4 catalyst molar ratio of 4 1 the element ce has a special 4f electron layer structure and redox pairs ce iii and ce iv which allows its oxide ceo2 to form a large number of oxygen vacancies 71 the presence of oxygen vacancies increases the catalytic reaction sites and enhances the ability of cerium based catalysts to store and release oxygen and the interaction with active components 72 73 applied in ozone catalytic oxidation it promotes the decomposition of ozone to form reactive radicals and accelerates the rate of pollutant removal the mgcoce composite metal oxide catalyst prepared in this paper possessed a large number of oxygen vacancies on its surface due to the addition of ceo2 and cl played an important role in the catalytic ozonation degradation of simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater nh4cl the oxygen vacancies adsorbed a large amount of ozone and promoted the reaction between ozone and cl to generate clo for oxidative degradation of ammonia nitrogen which promoted the transfer of products to gaseous nitrogen the reaction mechanism is shown in fig 6 from the above study it is clear that the combination of mg and co or the addition of ce components makes the prepared mgo co3o4 composite oxide catalyst rich in surface oxygen vacancies which increases the catalytic reaction sites and promotes the decomposition of ozone its application in catalytic ozonation is an effective feasible and promising method for ammonia nitrogen treatment at the same time it can be known that the high ammonia nitrogen removal rate and high nitrogen selectivity of mgo co3o4 composite catalyst are inseparable from the existence of cl in the solution however whether there is the role of other active substances such as cl remains to be further analyzed 3 2 2 γ al2o3 supported composite catalyst in addition some scholars have discussed the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by γ al2o3 supported catalyst combined with ozonation wu 74 used the impregnation method to prepare the co3o4 γ al2o3 composite metal catalyst by loading the active component co in the form of co3o4 on γ al2o3 support impregnation time of 24 h calcination temperature of 600 c and calcination time of 4 h and the loading of co was 14 75 mg 1 g γ al2o3 the degradation of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation with co3o4 γ al2o3 at ambient temperature and pressure 298 k 0 1 mpa was investigated it was found that under the conditions of ph 6 84 catalyst dosage of 200 g l and ozone concentration of 25 mg l the removal rate of 100 mg l ammonia solution could reach 100 after 360 min reaction ammonia nitrogen was converted into harmless n2 in large amount with only a small amount of no3 meanwhile the co3o4 γ al2o3 catalyst maintained 95 ammonia nitrogen removal rate after six times of repeated use and the co ions leached very little 0 04 mg l which had high stability the co element exists in two valence states co ii and co iii in the co3o4 γ al2o3 catalyst the transform of electrons in different valence states on the catalyst surface can promote the ozone decomposition to produce free radicals as shown in eqs 26 27 75 the study confirmed the presence of hydroxyl radicals in solution by epr electron paramagnetic resonance and speculated that they may oxidize free ammonia to generate the unstable substance nh2 which in turn generates n2h4 and nho which are oxidized to n2 no2 and no3 by ozone as shown in eqs 28 34 from the above article it is clear that co3o4 γ al2o3 catalyst can achieve 100 conversion of ammonia nitrogen and high nitrogen selectivity which can be a candidate for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation technology however this catalyst also has the disadvantages of relatively long treatment time and high catalyst consumption making the economic efficiency not very high 26 m n 1 o 3 m n oh h o 2 o 2 27 m n o 3 h m n 1 oh o 2 28 oh n h 3 h 2 o n h 2 29 2 n h 2 n 2 h 4 30 n 2 h 4 o 3 n 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 31 n 2 h 2

impregnation time of 8 h calcination temperature of 500 c calcination time of 6 h to explore its catalytic ozonation effect on ammonia nitrogen 200 mg l when the ph was neutral the catalyst dosage was 150 g l the ozone concentration was 30 mg l it was showed that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was 68 and most of the reaction products were n2 after 180 min treatment in addition the stability of mn cuox γ al2o3 catalyst was tested after repeated use for 5 times and the results showed that the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen remained above 65 and the leaching of mn ions and cu ions was only 0 31 mg l and 0 11 mg l respectively in this research hydroxyl radicals were identified as the main active substance by adding tert butanol with epr experiments but only sem and bet characterization were used to perform the prepared composite catalysts which made the mechanism of catalytic ozonation ambiguous li 77 also prepared mn cu al2o3 catalyst for catalytic ozonation to remove ammonia nitrogen in high salt wastewater from coal chemical industry the active components were loaded on alumina in the form of mno2 and cuo it was speculated that there was electron transfer between different valence states of the active components mn and cu which promoted the ozone decomposition to oh to act on the reactants however the valence state analysis of mn and cu elements was not conducted the ammonia removal rate of the mn cuox γ al2o3 catalyst is low so it is not the best catalyst for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen by ozonation technology the catalytic mechanism needs to be analyzed in more detail and reliably in combination with more structural characterization of the catalyst ling et al 78 prepared γ al2o3 fe mg5 fe mg molar ratio 1 5 calcination temperature of 500 c calcination time of 3 h composite catalyst with γ al2o3 as support and fe and mg as active components by impregnation method the surface of this composite catalyst was rich in acid base sites and oxygen vacancies which made it possess high activity specifically mg was loaded on the carrier in the form of mgo which increased the solution alkalinity through hydration and promoted the production of oh fe was loaded on the carrier in the form of fe2o3 and feo which promoted ozone decomposition through electron transfer between fe iii and fe ii at the initial ph of 7 catalyst dosage of 112 88 g l and o3 concentration of 2 4 mg min the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 98 73 of which the gaseous nitrogen selectivity accounted for 67 82 meanwhile the γ al2o3 fe mg5 catalyst had good stability and it was found that this catalyst still maintained high activity after 10 times of repeated use and the efficiency of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen decreased by 10 this new catalyst had both adsorption and catalytic effects in the γ al2o3 fe mg5 catalyzed ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with catalysis being the main mechanism of the reaction process the presence of the active species oh o2 and 1o2 was detected by epr and the addition of the corresponding inhibitors further determined that oh plays a major role through the structural characterization of the catalyst before and after the reaction the article indicates that the abundant acid base sites and oxygen vacancies on the surface of this catalyst are responsible for its high nitrogen selectivity in addition the effects of cuni loading rates of cu ni al2o3 catalyst were studied in catalytic ozonation treatment of landfill leachate which ammonia nitrogen concentration was 1000 to 2500 mg l the composite catalyst was obtained by the impregnation method when the molar ratio of cu and ni was 1 1 the calcination temperature was 800 c and the cuni loading rate was 2 6764 and the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation reached the maximum of 25 it was also indicated that ammonia nitrogen removal sometimes showed negative values at several different loading rates 79 the reason is that some organic nitrogen in the landfill leachate was oxidized to ammonia nitrogen by ozone and reactive radicals in the pre reaction period 80 it not only increased the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen but also consumed ozone and reactive radicals and both were not favorable for ammonia nitrogen removal the above cu ni al2o3 composite catalyst was only explored for the effect of cuni loading rate on ammonia nitrogen removal and the ammonia nitrogen degradation products and related catalytic mechanism were not studied it is believed that the ammonia nitrogen removal rates will be further improved with the optimization of reaction conditions which will provide basis for practical applications in conclusion adding active components increasing the active sites acid base sites oxygen vacancies surface hydroxyl groups of the γ al2o3 based composite catalysts or enhancing redox between metal ions of different valence can promote ozone decomposition and achieve higher ammonia removal rates and nitrogen selectivity the results of the application of related al2o3 based composite catalysts in landfill leachate also present the ability of such catalysts to remove actual wastewater at high concentrations the catalysts prepared in most of the above studies are stable and their active components have low leaching rates but how to reduce the catalyst loss and accelerate the reaction rate is the focus of future research 3 2 3 other composite catalysts liu et al 16 prepared the ctab nio composite catalyst by adding the active agent ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide to the surface of metal oxides calcination temperature is 300 c calcination time is 2 h its specific surface area is about 2 5 times larger than that of single nio providing more active sites the ctab nio composite catalyst was used in the catalytic ozonation system for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen with good results 81 at room temperature under the conditions of ph 9 ozone flow rate of 12 mg min catalyst dosage of 1 0 g l reaction time of 120 min the ctab nio coupled ozonation system achieved 95 93 removal of ammonia nitrogen of which the selectivity for gaseous nitrogen was 80 98 through hydroxyl radical quenching experiment it was confirmed that there was an indirect effect of hydroxyl radical on the degradation of ammonia nitrogen in the reaction system xrd characterization of the catalyst before and after the reaction showed that the diffraction peak of nh4br in the catalyst after use disappeared suggesting that it played a role in the degradation of ammonia nitrogen however the stability of this composite catalyst is relatively poor after repeated use for three times the ammonia nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen selectivity are reduced to 68 5 and 78 7 respectively the nickel ion leaching is relatively serious in the future the catalyst stability needs to be further improved nguyen et al 82 developed fe2o3 co3o4 modified dolomite catalyst and applied it to catalytic ozonation of simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater nh4cl the dolomite is mainly composed of mgo and caco3 the presence of mgo could keep the solution alkaline the addition of active components fe and co produced redox pairs of fe and co with different valence states which enhanced the redox ability of this composite catalyst in addition from section 3 1 1 it is known that co3o4 has low h f value and high nitrogen selectivity so the composite catalyst has high activity and nitrogen selectivity the results showed that this catalyst could achieve 96 ammonia nitrogen removal and 77 82 nitrogen selectivity in the ozonation process but its active substance and stability need to be explored subsequently to ensure its practicality it is known from section 3 2 1 that ceo2 can provide a large number of oxygen vacancies to promote ozone decomposition its composite catalysts were applied for ammonia nitrogen removal by catalytic ozonation he et al 83 produced a ceo2 mno2 composite catalyst molar ratio of 2 1 calcination temperature of 400 c calcination time of 3 h to study its efficiency in treating ammonia nitrogen solution it was found that the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and selectivity to gaseous nitrogen reached 88 14 and 53 67 respectively under the optimal working conditions the stability of the catalyst was good and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate could still reach 70 after five times of repeated use a series of characterization analyses indicated that mno2 played an important role but no specific catalytic mechanism for ceo2 mno2 was derived in this paper we speculate that there is electron transfer of ce and mn redox pairs in the composite catalyst which promotes ozone to generate hydroxyl radicals to degrade ammonia nitrogen krisbiantoro et al 84 developed a new composite catalyst pd ceo2 by using the impregnation method to load the precious metal pd as the active component on ceo2 calcination temperature of 250 c calcination time of 3 h and pd loading of 5 wt the electronic structures of several noble metals pd ag ru rh ir and pt were analyzed and it was indicated that pd has a moderate value of the d band center relative to the fermi level which made it highly nitrogen selective meanwhile the efficiencies of several carriers al2o3 sio2 ceo2 tio2 and ac activated carbon loaded with pd for catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen were also explored it was found that pd ceo2 had high ammonia nitrogen removal and nitrogen selectivity but the carrier characteristics were not analyzed at a reaction temperature of 333 k initial ph of 7 catalyst dosing of 1 0 g l and o3 concentration of 100 ml min the pd ceo2 catalyst was used in the catalytic ozonation of nh4cl solution 180 mg l the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 99 among them the gaseous selectivity could reach 90 80 chloramines however it was found that when the treated ammonia solution was nh4 2so4 the pd ceo2 catalyst was completely deactivated and had no effect on ammonia removal it indicates that this catalyst may be strongly influenced by so4 2 or the catalyst exhibits high catalytic activity only in the presence of cl in conclusion it is necessary to further investigate whether cl promotes or so4 2 inhibits the catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen which is important for the application of the catalyst to actual ammonia nitrogen wastewater many researchers have devoted themselves to the development of catalysts with high removal rate and high nitrogen selectivity so that ammonia nitrogen can be transformed into a harmless direction the composite catalyst combines the advantages of different components making them effective in catalytic ozonation of ammonia wastewater treatment there are many kinds of composite catalysts and their existence provides new ideas for the selection of efficient catalysts for ozonation however each composite catalyst has different active components resulting in different catalytic mechanisms and the synergistic interaction between different components needs to be further studied meanwhile the specific acting active substances in the catalytic ozonation system of the composite catalyst need to be further explored 3 3 activated carbon and its supported catalysts activated carbon ac has a large specific surface area microporous structure and surface activity and that is frequently used as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment 85 86 however generally activated carbon has a weak adsorption capacity for ammonia nitrogen 87 88 riyanto et al 89 used activated carbon adsorption to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing ammonia nitrogen and found that the activated carbon settling time had a significant effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen when treating 100 ml of pharmaceutical wastewater with an ammonia nitrogen concentration of about 30 mg l the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen reached about 95 at an activated carbon dosing amount and precipitation time of 60 g and 60 min respectively however this process has a large amount of activated carbon and takes a long time which does not have obvious economic benefits some studies 90 91 showed that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for ammonia nitrogen was improved after ozone pretreatment indicating that ozone has a better synergistic effect with activated carbon in addition to acting as an adsorbent activated carbon can also be used as a catalyst for catalytic ozonation to treat wastewater it has been shown that the alkalinity of activated carbon surface has an important effect on catalytic ozonation which can promote the decomposition of ozone in the liquid phase to form oh 92 94 o3 ac system can promote ozone oxidation adsorption and regeneration of activated carbon i activated carbon acts as an adsorbent and catalyst to adsorb micromolecular pollutants in water and catalyze ozone to produce oh 95 96 ii ozone oxidation oxidizes refractory macromolecular organic matter to micromolecular organic matter then promoting the adsorption of activated carbon 97 and iii ozone can partially regenerate activated carbon which promotes the recycling of activated carbon 98 99 the mechanism of activated carbon catalytic ozonation of pollutants differs when the solutions are at different ph levels 100 101 as shown in fig 7 when the solution is acidic activated carbon mainly acts as an adsorbent most of the organic matter is adsorbed while the others are oxidized and degraded to intermediate products by ozone as shown in fig 7 a when the solution is alkaline activated carbon mainly acts as a catalyst catalyzing ozone to produce hydroxyl radicals on its surface and most of the organic matter is oxidized and degraded to intermediate products by ozone and hydroxyl radicals the others are adsorbed by activated carbon as shown in fig 7 b catalytic ozonation with activated carbon and its supported catalysts were more effective in treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater as shown in table 4 shang et al 102 conducted a laboratory scale investigation of activated carbon catalytic ozonation for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater and analyzed the corresponding influencing factors and activated carbon stability it was found that the initial concentration of 35 mg l ammonia nitrogen solution was degraded to 0 84 mg l at an initial ph of 11 an activated carbon dosing rate of 10 g l an ozone flow rate of 30 mg min and a reaction time of 90 min in addition this study found that the activated carbon had good stability and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate could be maintained above 90 after five times of repeated use however this study did not investigate the distribution of products and mechanism of ammonia nitrogen degradation in the o3 ac system but only speculated that hydroxyl radicals were generated and acted on ammonia nitrogen in this process further studies on the active substances and the properties of activated carbon in this system are needed studies have shown that the catalytic activity of activated carbon can be enhanced by loading metal oxides as active components 103 in recent years some researchers have explored catalytic ozonation with activated carbon supported catalysts for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater dong et al 104 supported femn oxides on activated carbon and treated printing and dyeing wastewater ammonia nitrogen concentration of 14 85 mg l by catalytic ozonation with it the results showed that 90 of the ammonia nitrogen was removed at a fe mn ac dosage of 20 g l ozone flow rate of 0 2 l min ph of 5 and reaction time of 60 min xiong et al 75 prepared mn gac catalyst by loading mn on granular activated carbon to treat secondary petrochemical wastewater it was shown that the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater increased from 3 0 to 5 0 mg l to 33 0 mg l within 5 min and after 90 min of reaction decreased to 0 8 mg l it has been shown that the reaction rate of oh with general organic matter is 108 1010 l mol s 1 105 which is greater than the reaction rate of oh with ammonia nitrogen 1 7 107 8 7 107 l mol s 1 106 hydroxyl radicals are non selective and highly reactive when both organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen are present in the water the organic nitrogen will be oxidized to ammonia nitrogen by oh at the early stage of the reaction leading to the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen increasing 107 thus more catalysts and ozone should be added to achieve efficient degradation of ammonia nitrogen the actual wastewater has complex components and many kinds of organic nitrogen sources some organic nitrogen sources will be degraded into organic by products and inorganic nitrogen nitrate nitrogen nitrite nitrogen ammonia nitrogen etc by catalytic ozonation 108 ammonia nitrogen is a common pollutant so it is necessary to study its degradation mechanism and harmless reaction products ma et al 33 investigated the removal of tailing leaching wastewater ammonia nitrogen concentration of about 40 mg l by catalytic ozonation with cu ac catalyst and found that an increase in ph value facilitated the degradation of ammonia nitrogen when the ph was 11 43 o3 cu ac system could achieve 99 ammonia nitrogen removal and the final conversion product of ammonia nitrogen was nitrate nitrogen it was showed that the specific surface area of copper loaded activated carbon was about 5 times larger than that of untreated activated carbon from 17 69 m2 g to 87 84 m2 g at ph of 9 57 cu ac catalyst only adsorbed 2 52 of ammonia nitrogen which indicated that catalytic ozonation was dominant in this process in addition a copper supported activated carbon catalyst was used for catalytic ozonation of landfill leachate with ammonia nitrogen concentration of 2100 mg l by wang et al 109 it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate did not fluctuate significantly with increasing ph while the cod removal rate decreased significantly when ph was 3 the degradation rate of ammonia nitrogen and cod reached 99 04 and 81 9 respectively it can be seen that the o3 cu ac system also has a great potential to degrade high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen the relevant degradation mechanisms were not explored in this study however it is clear that the main mechanism of degradation of ammonia nitrogen by o3 ac system is not the indirect effect of hydroxyl radical at ph of 3 because ozone decomposes slowly under acidic conditions oh is required to induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals ammonia nitrogen mainly exists in the form of nh4 in acidic environment and the possibility of ammonia nitrogen being blown out in the form of nh3 is very small however it needs further study to determine whether the adsorption of activated carbon plays a key role from the above it can be seen that activated carbon and modified activated carbon have good results in degrading ammonia nitrogen by synergistic ozonation and have satisfactory results in treating actual wastewater containing ammonia nitrogen compared with metal oxide and complex oxide catalysts activated carbon has high mechanical strength which makes it less leaching in solution and has good stability besides activated carbon has a high specific surface area which can synergize with ozone adsorption catalytic oxidation furthermore its relatively low price makes it economically efficient finally activated carbons are also good carriers and can be modified to prepare new catalysts however the analysis of ammonia nitrogen degradation is not thorough in the above mentioned studies of activated carbon and its supported catalysts for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen which only focus on the ammonia nitrogen removal rate without evaluating the product distribution and gaseous nitrogen selectivity converting ammonia nitrogen into gaseous nitrogen products is one of the most environmentally friendly ways to degrade ammonia nitrogen and improving nitrogen selectivity while guaranteeing the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen is the focus of future research in addition the mechanism of activated carbon catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen is not well understood and the structure of activated carbon and loaded activated carbon catalysts needs to be analyzed and discussed in conjunction with relevant characterization tools to clarify the mechanism meanwhile ph has a great influence on the catalytic ozonation process and the form of ammonia nitrogen present for the activated carbon ph also has a great influence on its main role so further in depth study with ph is needed 4 conclusion and perspectives in this paper it is concluded that catalytic ozonation technology is feasible and effective when applied to ammonia nitrogen degradation by summarizing previous research studies compared with the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozone oxidation catalytic ozonation technology can promote the production of hydroxyl radicals accelerate the reaction rate and increase the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen by adding catalysts the specific conclusions are as follows i heterogeneous catalytic ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen could obtain high ammonia nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen selectivity among them the metal oxide co3o4 obtained high nitrogen selectivity due to its low h f value the composite catalysts combined different active components to produce abundant active sites such as oxygen vacancies acid base sites surface hydroxyl groups etc which improved the efficiency of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrogen selectivity however the product distribution of activated carbon and its loaded catalysts for catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen has been little studied and this research gap needs to be filled in the future ii the main mechanism of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen is the direct oxidation by o3 and the indirect oxidation by oh but when chloride ions are present the reaction mechanism is different from the current studies it was clear that co3o4 mgo co3o4 and pd ceo2 catalysts coupled with ozonation were highly active for ammonia nitrogen removal in the presence of chloride ions and that clo replaced o3 and oh as the main oxidizing agents in addition to clo induced ammonia nitrogen degradation whether other active substances such as cl exist and play a role should be explored in depth in subsequent studies and the effect of other components in the wastewater such as heavy metals and organic matter on the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen should be further analyzed iii mgo and cao2 would react with aqueous solution to generate corresponding hydroxides during the catalytic reaction which could maintain the alkaline environment required for hydroxyl radical generation and promote the degradation of ammonia nitrogen however it also led to severe leaching of metal ions and the inevitable loss of other catalysts during the reaction less attention has been paid to catalyst losses in the existing studies and related studies should be strengthened to reduce losses iv catalytic ozonation technology can treat wastewater with high concentration of ammonia nitrogen the cu ac o3 system can degrade 99 of ammonia nitrogen when treating landfill leachate with ammonia nitrogen concentration of 2100 mg l some of the organic nitrogen sources in the actual wastewater will be converted to ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation which increases the difficulty of ammonia nitrogen removal it is necessary to conduct research on catalytic ozonation technology for treating actual ammonia nitrogen wastewater at laboratory scale to make the technology more relevant to practical applications credit authorship contribution statement huiru ma drafted the manuscript guifang chen provided the initial

12554,ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is the most common pollutant in wastewater which consumes dissolved oxygen in water and causes eutrophication in water bodies and is an important control indicator in wastewater treatment biological process is not suitable for wastewater with poor biodegradability and difficult to meet increasing strict discharge standards physical chemical methods such as ion exchange fold point chlorination and fenton oxidation would introduce new substances to wastewater leading to potential pollutants catalytic ozonation technology can effectively remove ammonia nitrogen without introducing other substances and improve the nitrogen selectivity of reaction products by controlling the reaction conditions however studies on catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen were scattered and systematic induction was necessary in this paper the removal effect product distribution and reaction mechanism of metal oxide catalyst composite metal catalyst and activated carbon catalyst in catalytic ozonation for ammonia nitrogen were summarized catalyst is one of the keys to achieve high nitrogen selectivity by catalytic ozonation of ammonia and the nitrogen selectivity was compared for different catalysts in this paper besides based on literatures the figures for mechanism of catalytic ozonation by several catalysts were drawn to help others understand easily according to the discussion of literatures the emphasis in future studies were proposed it is important to study the catalytic mechanism in depth further improve the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen and nitrogen selectivity in products explore the effect of the actual composition of the wastewater on catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and pay attention to the catalyst loss rate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic ozonation metal oxide catalyst composite metal catalyst activated carbon ammonia nitrogen data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is one of the common pollutants in wastewater which is primarily existed in the form of ammonium ions nh4 and free ammonia nh3 1 ammonia nitrogen has a wide range of sources mainly originating from industrial agricultural and municipal wastewater discharges ammonia nitrogen depletes dissolved oxygen in water causing eutrophication of water bodies and disrupting ecological balance 2 3 in addition ammonia nitrogen in water is produced as nitrate and nitrite by the action of microorganisms which affects water organisms and human health ammonia nitrogen pollutant has become a key object affecting the environmental quality of surface water and is the second binding control target after cod which is controlled in all kinds of water quality standards the chinese environmental quality standard for surface water specifies the limit value of ammonia nitrogen in class v surface water as 2 0 mg l 4 the ammonia nitrogen limit value in drinking water standards was lower than 0 5 mg l in china the european union france germany south korea and so on 5 6 currently the main technologies for the treatment of low concentration ammonia nitrogen wastewater are biological physical chemical and advanced oxidation methods which have been reviewed by researchers 7 8 biological and physical chemical methods have been used commercially for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater but both have application limitations biological methods are strongly influenced by water quality and can generate large amounts of sludge especially for high salt wastewater which is poorly biochemical and difficult to meet discharge standards 9 the physical chemical methods mainly include ion exchange method fold point chlorination method and membrane separation method the ion exchange capacity of the ion exchange method is limited and the ion exchanger needs frequent regeneration then the ammonia nitrogen removal rate will be reduced 10 the introduction of chlorine gas by the folding point chlorination method will inevitably leave residual chlorine and cause secondary pollution 11 12 in the membrane separation method the membrane is easy to be polluted blocked and leaked the replacement or backwashing of the membrane increases the treatment cost 10 with the increasingly strict requirements for ammonia nitrogen emission around the world it is necessary to find more effective methods for ammonia nitrogen treatment advanced oxidation method generates strong oxidizing hydroxyl radical oh which can oxidize and degrade the refractory substances into low toxic or non toxic small molecule substances 13 ozonation as one of the advanced oxidation methods has a wide range of applications in the field of water treatment and it has the advantages of strong oxidation no introduction of other substances and no secondary pollution compared with other advanced oxidation methods 14 the addition of catalysts can promote ozone decomposition and generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals to improve the pollutant removal rate it has been researched that ozonation can effectively realize the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen and generate nitrate and nitrogen under the action of catalyst 15 17 so far the research of catalytic ozonation technology to treat ammonia nitrogen is still in laboratory and pilot scale usually using column reactor reaction solution and catalyst are preplaced in the reactor and ozone is aerated from the bottom to the top and a gas liquid solid three phase reaction occurs there is no doubt that the optimized design of the reactor to enhance the gas liquid solid contact can improve the removal of ammonia nitrogen however in order to maximize the harmless treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by catalytic ozonation technology the key is to find and select appropriate catalysts to improve the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and the selectivity of nitrogen in the product in the research heterogeneous catalysts are mainly used in catalytic ozonation for ammonia nitrogen treatment including metal oxide catalysts composite oxide catalysts active carbon and its supported catalysts etc however most of the current research only focuses on one or a few kinds of catalysts which is fragmented and lacks systematic summary and generalization as follows i the current study only explores the reaction conditions for the catalytic effect of one type of catalyst and there is a lack of horizontal comparison of the catalytic effect of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen by various types of catalysts ii the mechanism of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with various catalysts in the existing studies has not been conclusively established and needs to be further sorted out iii the influence of wastewater composition on catalyst performance needs to be explored in depth this paper summarizes the mechanism of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and deeply analyzes the effect of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with various types of heterogeneous catalysts the catalytic mechanisms of different catalysts and the reaction pathways of ammonia nitrogen are summarized based on the literature in addition the shortcomings of the present study are analyzed and future research priorities are proposed to provide a basis for the subsequent catalyst selection and modification 2 status of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen 2 1 introduction of ozonation technology the oxidation performance of an oxidant is closely related to its redox potential the redox potential of ozone is greatly affected by ph value 2 07 v under acidic condition and 1 24 v under alkaline condition as in eqs 1 and 2 the ozonation technology treats pollutants in wastewater mainly depends on the direct oxidation by ozone and the indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals under acidic conditions direct oxidation by ozone is dominant under alkaline conditions indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is dominant 18 19 2 1 1 direct ozone oxidation ozone is a strong oxidizing agent that provides direct oxidation of organic and inorganic substances in water acidic condition 1 o 3 2 h 2 e o 2 h 2 o alkaline condition 2 o 3 h 2 o e o 2 2 oh reaction eqs 1 and 2 are redox reactions with a direct mechanism of action in addition there are cycloaddition reactions electrophilic substitution reactions and nucleophilic reactions 20 21 but nucleophilic reactions have not been confirmed in aqueous solutions yet 2 1 2 indirect oxidation of hydroxyl radicals the reaction of ozone is more complex in aqueous solution generating hydroxyl radicals and other radicals table 1 lists the redox potentials of several common oxidants among them the hydroxyl radical redox potential is 2 80 v it is highly oxidizing less selective for reactants and can act directly on organic and inorganic substances 22 23 depending on the ph of the aqueous solution there exist different pathways for hydroxyl radical and other types of radicals generation mainly including the following two 25 26 1 when the solution ph is at neutral hydroxyl radical generation follows the sbh model proposed by staehelin hoigne and buhler et al as in eqs 3 6 and 2 when the solution ph is high hydroxyl radical generation follows the tfg model proposed by tomiyasu fukutomi and gordon et al as in eqs 7 11 sbh 3 o 3 oh o 2 h o 2 4 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 5 o 3 h h o 3 6 h o 3 oh o 2 tfg 7 o 3 oh ho 2 o 2 8 ho 2 o 3 o 3 ho 2 9 ho 2 o 2 h 10 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 11 o 3 h 2 o oh o 2 oh in addition when the solution ph is very high ozone and oh can react directly to form hydroxyl radicals 25 as in eqs 12 13 although the hydroxyl radicals are generated by different reaction processes they are all generated through the initiation reaction of oh as an initiator with o3 12 o 3 oh o 3 oh 13 o 3 h 2 o oh o 2 oh ozonation technology mainly conducts oxidation reaction with pollutants through ozone and hydroxyl radicals the reaction rate is fast and the reaction products are mainly o2 co2 and h2o which will not produce secondary pollution 2 2 mechanism and research status of ozonation technology for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater ozonation technology is generally used for wastewater pretreatment or advanced treatment when ozonation is used as pretreatment of wastewater it can oxidize difficult macromolecular organics to easily degradable micromolecular organics and improve the biochemical properties of wastewater for subsequent biological treatment and other water purification processes 27 28 and when ozonation is used for the advanced treatment it mainly targets the pollutants that are difficult to biodegrade in wastewater to meet the wastewater discharge standards 29 31 ammonia nitrogen is one of the common pollutants in wastewater there is an ionization equilibrium between ammonium ions and free ammonia in water as shown in eq 14 the higher the ph the higher the proportion of nh3 the lower the ph the higher the proportion of nh4 at ph value is 7 of the wastewater ammonia nitrogen exists mainly in the form of nh4 while 90 is free ammonia at ph value is 11 14 nh 4 o h n h 3 h 2 o the degradation of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozonation is strongly influenced by ph when ph is neutral ammonia nitrogen exists mainly as nh4 and the reaction process is mainly o3 oxidation of nh4 as in eqs 15 17 32 at high ph it is conducive to the formation of free ammonia in eq 14 at this time a small amount of ammonia nitrogen is blown out as free ammonia however a study 33 showed that only about 3 of ammonia nitrogen was blown out even at ph of 11 which was also confirmed by our experiments therefore it is usually ignored for ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen in addition high ph accelerates the decomposition of ozone to react with oh to form various types of free radicals and oh as shown in eqs 3 and 13 the reaction rate of o3 with free ammonia is about 20 times faster compared to that of ammonium ion 34 at this point the direct interaction of ozone with free ammonia eqs 18 20 and the indirect interaction of oh with free ammonia eqs 21 23 occur the ozonation process generates a variety of free radicals and the researcher xiong et al 35 explored the active substances acting in the degradation of phenol in the ac o3 system and verified the presence of o2 h2o2 and oh by adding the corresponding free radical quenchers among which oh plays a major role however few studies have made a detailed and independent discussion on the treatment of ammonia nitrogen a large number of experiments have verified the existence of oh by adding tert butanol a hydroxyl radical inhibitor 33 36 37 and some experiments showed that the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency decreased by as much as about 45 after the addition of tert butanol 37 therefore it is speculated that hydroxyl radical is the main radical for ozone oxidation treatment of ammonia nitrogen and superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide radical are the auxiliary radicals the main radicals and the main mechanism of action may be different under different reaction conditions catalyst ph etc and more detailed and extensive research experiments are needed to supplement this research gap 15 nh 4 3 o 3 2 h n o 2 h 2 o 3 o 2 16 nh 4 4 o 3 2 h n o 3 h 2 o 4 o 2 17 2 nh 4 3 o 3 n 2 3 h 2 o 2 h 3 o 2 ammonia nitrogen degradation products are usually nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and n2 there are also a small amount of other gaseous nitrogen products no no2 n2o in general due to the instability of nitrite only a very small amount of nitrite is present in the ammonia nitrogen degradation products and most of the generated nitrite is oxidized to nitrate as in eqs 24 and 25 therefore the degradation products of ozonation of ammonia nitrogen are mainly nitrate nitrogen and nitrogen gas and the summation of nitrogen gas selectivity and nitrate nitrogen selectivity is almost 1 when the nitrogen selectivity increased the nitrate selectivity decreased accordingly at present researchers are not only committed to reducing the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in wastewater but also committed to the removal of total nitrogen in wastewater among them the key to reduce total nitrogen is to convert ammonia nitrogen into harmless nitrogen and improve nitrogen selectivity 18 nh 3 3 o 3 h n o 2 h 2 o 3 o 2 19 nh 3 4 o 3 h n o 3 h 2 o 4 o 2 20 4 nh 3 o 3 2 n 2 3 h 2 o 6 h 21 nh 3 6 oh h n o 2 4 h 2 o 22 nh 3 8 oh h n o 3 5 h 2 o 23 2 nh 3 oh n 2 h 2 o 5 h 24 n o 2 o 3 no 3 o 2 25 no 2 2 oh no 3 h 2 o however the direct treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozonation technology is not very effective it was shown that nh4 hardly reacts with o3 38 and the primary reaction rate of nh3 with o3 is only 20 m 1 s 1 39 sun 40 studied ozonation technology for treating high concentration ammonia nitrogen wastewater and found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate increased with the increase of ph however under the condition of ph 10 and reaction time of 120 min the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen 500 mg l treated with 715 2 mg l ozone was only 26 3 of which 85 3 was converted to nitrate nitrogen the results of this study indicated that ozonation alone is not effective in removing ammonia nitrogen and its conversion products may cause secondary pollution and hazards zhang et al 41 showed that the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen 200 mg l treated by ozonation was almost 0 under neutral conditions and it was only 16 7 at ph 11 therefore ozonation alone is not very effective in treating ammonia nitrogen which is due to the low ozone utilization and critically the low production of hydroxyl radicals the research shows that the presence of catalysts can promote the production of hydroxyl radicals by ozone 42 and the removal of ammonia nitrogen can be greatly improved by choosing a suitable catalyst coupled with ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen 43 46 3 current status of research on catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen wastewater the catalysts for catalytic ozonation are mainly homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts most of the homogeneous catalysts are transition metal ions generally fe ii co ii mn ii cu ii ni ii cd ii etc which are soluble in water difficult to recover and remove causing secondary pollution to wastewater and limiting its wide application heterogeneous catalysts appear as solid phase avoiding the disadvantages of homogeneous catalysts that are not easily separated from water and they have low solubility good stability the ability to be reused and reduce wastewater treatment costs which are very promising applications 47 48 the main heterogeneous catalysts are metal oxides metal and metal oxide composites supported catalysts and carbon based materials etc 49 metal oxides such as co3o4 cuo mgo mno2 and tio2 are common catalysts in ozonation processes and their surface properties crystalline form and pore structure have an effect on catalyst activity 50 composite catalysts combine two and more catalysts and the different components produce synergistic effects making the activity of the composite catalysts better than that of single components supported catalysts use high temperature calcination process to load active metal salts on the carrier generally γ al2o3 molecular sieves ceramics and activated carbon as carriers carbon based materials include activated carbon activated coke graphene etc these materials are commonly used because of their large specific surface area and high mechanical strength the effectiveness of catalytic ozonation for treating actual wastewater with ammonia nitrogen is influenced by the composition of the wastewater among them the presence of organic matter would compete with ammonia nitrogen for ozone and reactive radicals and the current studies focused on the effect of several common inorganic ions in water on ammonia nitrogen in catalytic ozonation system it has been shown that inorganic anions co3 2 so4 2 po4 3 etc would consume hydroxyl radicals generated in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen thereby reducing the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen 51 in addition there are also some ions that will have a promotional effect some studies have shown that cl and br would generate activity on heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and enhance the removal of ammonia nitrogen 52 nh4cl and nh4 2so4 were usually used for simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater in ozone catalytic oxidation experiment thus the influence of cl and so4 2 on ammonia nitrogen removal was concerned in current studies there are also some inorganic cations such as na k and ca2 which almost have no effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen and will not be discussed later the catalytic ozonation technology with heterogeneous catalysts has been widely studied in the treatment of organic pollutants and the related mechanism has been thoroughly discussed in the following the mechanism is expressed and mapped which is expected to enlighten the mechanism study of catalytic oxidation technology for treating ammonia nitrogen legube et al 53 proposed two mechanisms for catalytic ozonation by heterogeneous catalysts 1 chemisorption of organic matter on the catalyst surface leading to further reactions with gas or liquid phase ozone as shown in fig 1 a 2 mutual reactions between chemisorbed sites occurring when both organic matter and ozone are chemisorbed on the catalyst surface as shown in fig 1 b kasprzyk hordern et al 54 suggested a third mechanism of action for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 3 chemisorption of ozone on the catalyst surface to generate an active substance that can react with non chemisorbed organic molecules in contrast to catalytic ozonation of organics there are few studies on the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozonation with heterogeneous catalysts this chapter will review some of the heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic ozonation technology to treat ammonia nitrogen 3 1 metal oxide catalysts among the catalytic ozonation technologies metal oxide catalysts are commonly used class for treating wastewater with high efficiency and fast reaction rate the catalytic properties exhibited by different surface properties of metal oxides are also different in recent years many scholars have studied metal oxide catalytic ozonation for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater and the reaction conditions and treatment effects are shown in table 2 3 1 1 co3o4 scholars mahardiani et al 55 conducted a laboratory scale study on the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl by a variety of metal oxides mox m fe mn co sn cu mg ni and al and found that co3o4 has high nitrogen selectivity and activity and low solubility in the liquid phase at the reaction temperature of 333 k initial ph of 5 4 catalyst dosage of 1 g l and o3 flow rate of 100 ml min the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen catalyzed by co3o4 catalyst reached 74 n2 accounted for 88 and no3 accounted for 12 in the products the article found that the standard molar enthalpy of production per molar oxygen atom of metal oxide h f is one of the factors affecting the nitrogen selectivity of the catalyst and the smaller the value of h f the weaker the mo bond of the metal oxide the lower the active oxygen density on the catalyst surface and the high nitrogen selectivity subsequently mahardiani et al 56 explored the stability of co3o4 and the catalytic activity of the co3o4 catalyst was found to increase with the number of uses when the catalytic ozonation process of ammonia nitrogen was repeated under the same reaction conditions the co3o4 catalyst was used in ozonation to treat the ammonia nitrogen with an initial concentration of 540 mg l and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 80 from 30 after nine times of reuse it was found that the reaction between the hydroxyl group on the surface of co3o4 and nh4 in the solution produced co nhx group on the surface of co3o4 catalyst which increased the activity of co3o4 meanwhile the co3o4 catalytic ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen still maintained 80 nitrogen selectivity after nine times of reuse it can be seen that co3o4 not only has high catalytic activity but also strong stability which is a good choice of catalyst for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen in 2020 krisbiantoro et al 15 investigated the mechanism of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl nh4 2so4 with co3o4 catalyst it was shown that cl played a key role in this process o3 would oxidize cl to clo in the presence of cl and then clo oxidized nh4 to form nitrate chloramine and gaseous products on the surface of catalyst co3o4 based on the above study the mechanism of action is mapped in this paper as shown in fig 2 however the paper indicated that in the presence of so4 2 the removal of ammonia nitrogen was 0 under o3 alone and co3o4 o3 system but when chloride ions were added to this solution it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate and gaseous nitrogen selectivity increased with the increase of chloride ion concentration it is evident that chloride ions are indispensable for the system to degrade ammonia nitrogen however there are two questions that need to be further investigated i it is unclear which substances play the main oxidation action in the system besides clo whether there are active substances such as oh or cl present needs further clarification after all it has been indicated that both oh and cl exist in the ozonation of ammonia nitrogen when cl is present in the solution 57 ii does so4 2 play an inhibitory role if oh is present in the system so4 2 has a trapping effect on hydroxyl radicals and so4 2 may also be adsorbed or complexed on the catalyst surface affecting the catalyst activity therefore the roles of chloride ions and sulfate need to be explored in depth in conclusion it is clear from the above study that co3o4 is suitable for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen in wastewater where cl is also present most of the wastewater has different concentrations of cl which is very favorable for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation with co3o4 catalyst 3 1 2 mgo guo et al 58 developed mgo catalyst for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen 50 mg l by precipitation method the results showed that the mgo exhibited the highest catalytic activity at a calcination temperature of 500 c when the ph was 9 the ozone flow rate was 12 mg min the catalyst dosage was 1 g l and the reaction temperature was 60 c the ammonia removal rate reached 96 after 120 min the article verified that oh was formed in the system of mgo o3 degradation of ammonia nitrogen by adding oh inhibitor tert butanol indicating that the degradation process was direct o3 action and indirect oh action the ability of mgo o3 system to treat ammonia nitrogen was also investigated by mahardiani 55 et al it was found that mgo possesses high catalytic activity which can achieve 95 removal rate of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation at a reaction temperature of 60 c however the nitrogen selectivity of mgo was low and the main product of ammonia nitrogen conversion was nitrate nitrogen which would cause secondary pollution to water bodies under higher temperature conditions 50 60 c mgo has excellent ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in ozonation process but maintaining high catalytic activity at low temperatures such as room temperature or winter is very important and a key step to improve the economic efficiency liu et al 17 investigated the efficiency of mgo catalytic ozonation for ammonia nitrogen removal at low temperatures and found that in the temperature range of 0 c 10 c obtained 77 53 80 17 ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency compared with the conventional biological treatment catalytic ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen at low temperatures is a promising treatment technology in addition the mechanism of mgo catalytic ozonation for the removal of ammonia nitrogen was discussed in this paper although mgo was a heterogeneous catalyst it was still partially dissolved in water which made the reaction solution alkaline and promoted the oxidation of free ammonia in water by o3 o3 and nh3 were adsorbed on the surface of mgo for the reaction in the presence of cl part of the ammonia nitrogen was degraded by clo oxidation krisbiantoro et al 15 also found that mgo dissolved in water to generate oh so that the ph of the reaction solution could be maintained at about 9 ensuring the reaction of oh with o3 to generate oh for the removal of ammonia nitrogen but this also made the leaching of mg2 severe through the above literature the mechanism of ammonia nitrogen removal by mgo o3 system is summarized in this paper as the following three points as shown in fig 3 i mgo surface adsorbs o3 and free ammonia and the two react on the catalyst surface releasing the active site after the reaction to prepare for the next surface reaction ii mgo dissolves in water to generate oh which keeps the ph of the reaction solution at alkaline on the one hand it increases the concentration of free ammonia in the solution on the other hand oh reacts with o3 to produce more oh finally it promotes the reaction of o3 and oh with free ammonia to produce nitrate nitrogen and gaseous nitrogen products iii when cl is present in the solution o3 reacts with cl to produce clo which oxidizes the small amount of nh4 present in the solution to produce nitrate nitrogen and gaseous nitrogen products a comprehensive analysis of the above mentioned literatures concluded that the mgo catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen still has the following problems that need to be further investigated i mgo dissolved in water will introduce mg2 into the solution and cause catalyst loss but most of the studies have not done quantitative analysis of mg2 dissolved in water and catalyst loss ii the nitrogen selectivity of mgo catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is low and the main product of ammonia nitrogen degradation is nitrate nitrogen and no study has been conducted to improve the nitrogen selectivity iii whether cl is involved in the reaction and whether clo is produced and involved in the degradation of ammonia nitrogen is still doubtful and more in depth studies are needed 3 1 3 al2o3 al2o3 often appears as a catalyst carrier but it can also be used as a catalyst for catalytic ozonation processes al2o3 exists in several crystalline forms mainly α al2o3 β al2o3 and γ al2o3 and different structures have different properties several researchers 59 60 indicated that when the ph of the solution is the one corresponding to the zero charge point on the surface of al2o3 ph phpzc 8 9 al2o3 has the highest activity which facilitates the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radicals on the catalyst surface the surface hydroxyl density of al2o3 is positively correlated with the catalytic ozone capacity and the higher the surface hydroxyl density the more favorable to catalyze the decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals 59 wu et al 37 investigated the treatment of ammonia nitrogen 50 mg l wastewater by γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation when the initial ph of the solution was 9 the catalyst dosage was 100 g l and the ozone concentration was 50 mg l the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was 62 72 after the reaction for 60 min almost all converted to nitrate nitrogen the highest ammonia removal rate was not at ph phpzc 8 9 but the higher ph the higher ammonia removal rate for ammonia nitrogen wastewater ph has a great influence on the fraction of free ammonia and ammonium ions at ph 11 free ammonia is mainly present in the wastewater and the reaction rate between ozone and free ammonia is faster in addition the paper hypothesized that γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen was an indirect action of hydroxyl radicals by adding hydroxyl radical inhibitors tert butanol ernst et al 61 investigated the degradation of organic acids by γ al2o3 catalytic oxidation according to its mechanism this paper speculates on the mechanism of γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen as follows o3 reacts with the hydroxyl radical on the surface of γ al2o3 to produce ho3 which can decompose to produce oh oh and o3 oxidize ammonia nitrogen as shown in fig 4 in general the study of al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is not deep enough and some of the findings are inconsistent as follows i the ph value to achieve the maximum ammonia nitrogen removal rate is inconclusive ii the product distribution of γ al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is not studied and iii the mechanism of al2o3 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with different crystal types needs to be explored in depth 3 1 4 cao2 cao2 is a peroxide that acts as an oxygen releasing and oxidizing agent it is often used in wastewater treatment as an oxidizing agent that reacts with h in water to form h2o2 62 some studies have shown that the ammonia nitrogen in the overlying water can be removed significantly by adding a certain amount of cao2 to the substrate of the water body 63 64 in addition huang 65 studied the ability of several peroxides mox m ca mn zn to treat wastewater and the results of the study showed that cao2 had some effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen in 2022 diao et al 66 investigated several common metal oxides mox m ca mn nb ti al sb and ce for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen 10 mg l among them cao2 was the most effective catalyst at the cao2 dosage of 80 mg l the initial ph of 10 68 and the ozone flow rate of 2 5 g h the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 95 in only 15 min of reaction and the degradation products were almost all nitrate nitrogen in addition the authors found that the effect of cao2 catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen was much greater than the simple summation of single o3 and single cao2 system indicating the synergistic effect of both cao2 and o3 the mechanism of cao2 catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen was explained as follows i most cao2 underwent hydrolysis to form ca oh 2 resulting in an alkaline reaction solution and an increase in oh concentration in the solution which promoted the reaction between o3 oh and nh3 and ii a small amount of cao2 reacted with aqueous solution to form h2o2 and h2o2 reacted with o3 to form oh which promoted oh to oxidize ammonia nitrogen according to the above study the mechanism of cao2 catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen is mapped in this paper as shown in fig 5 the presence of cao2 increases the pathway of oh production in the solution making the cao2 o3 system fast in treating ammonia nitrogen and consuming less amount of catalyst its presence adds a new option for metal oxide catalytic ozonation to treat ammonia nitrogen however the products of cao2 o3 synergistic degradation of ammonia nitrogen are almost all converted to nitrate nitrogen which can cause secondary pollution to water bodies the reaction conditions need to be explored in the future to move the reaction products toward gaseous nitrogen in addition most of cao2 produced a large amount of ca2 by hydrolysis reaction whether the whole reaction system becomes homogeneous catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen remains to be discussed 3 2 composite oxide catalysts composite catalysts combine two and more components and the different components produce synergistic effects which make the performance and activity of the complexes improved and achieve better effects than those of single components in addition to metal oxide catalysts researchers have also worked on mixing different active components to prepare new composite catalysts and explore their effectiveness in catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen wastewater as shown in table 3 3 2 1 mgo co3o4 from section 3 1 it is known that the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen using mgo and co3o4 catalysts alone is effective the researchers prepared mgo co3o4 composite catalyst for catalytic ozonation to investigate the effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen chen et al 67 used co precipitation method to produce the mgo co3o4 catalyst to catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen 50 mg l and explored its optimal working conditions it was shown that the catalytic activity of the mgo co3o4 catalyst was highest when the mgo co3o4 molar ratio was 8 2 the calcination temperature was 500 c and the calcination time was 3 h at this time the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 85 2 and the gaseous nitrogen selectivity was 44 8 by catalytic ozonation with mgo co3o4 catalyst this study found that under the same experimental conditions the o3 mgo co3o4 system achieved high gaseous nitrogen selectivity at high ammonia nitrogen removal rate compared with o3 mgo and o3 co3o4 system in addition zhang et al 51 also conducted a laboratory scale study on the treatment of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl by catalytic ozonation with mgo co3o4 catalyst molar ratio of 2 1 calcination temperature of 500 c calcination time of 2 h it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was nearly 100 after 1 h of reaction at a reaction temperature of 30 c initial ph of 8 and catalyst dosage of 2 0 g l where the gaseous nitrogen selectivity was 84 26 the mgo co3o4 composite catalyst has many oxygen vacancies the oxygen vacancy can be regarded as an active oxygen reactant serving as the active center of molecular adsorption and catalytic reaction which is conducive to the adsorption and decomposition of ozone 68 69 the existence of cl is the key to the degradation of ammonia nitrogen in this system because when nh4 2so4 is used as the source of ammonia nitrogen the system has little ammonia nitrogen removal 5 at the active site of the catalyst cl reacted with ozone to generate clo which acted on ammonia nitrogen the relevant degradation mechanism is basically consistent with that of co3o4 synergistically ozonating ammonia nitrogen as shown in fig 1 in 2022 zhang et al 70 developed a novel mgo co3o4 ceo2 catalyst molar ratio of 4 1 1 calcination temperature of 700 c calcination time of 3 h by adding another active component ceo2 and explored the effect influencing factors and the corresponding mechanism of the catalytic ozonation for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen nh4cl the results showed that under the optimal working conditions initial ph of 8 catalyst dosage of 2 0 g l and ozone concentration of 85 mg min the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 100 and the nitrogen selectivity was 86 94 under the same conditions the selectivity of nitrogen was 73 57 using mgo co3o4 catalyst molar ratio of 4 1 the element ce has a special 4f electron layer structure and redox pairs ce iii and ce iv which allows its oxide ceo2 to form a large number of oxygen vacancies 71 the presence of oxygen vacancies increases the catalytic reaction sites and enhances the ability of cerium based catalysts to store and release oxygen and the interaction with active components 72 73 applied in ozone catalytic oxidation it promotes the decomposition of ozone to form reactive radicals and accelerates the rate of pollutant removal the mgcoce composite metal oxide catalyst prepared in this paper possessed a large number of oxygen vacancies on its surface due to the addition of ceo2 and cl played an important role in the catalytic ozonation degradation of simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater nh4cl the oxygen vacancies adsorbed a large amount of ozone and promoted the reaction between ozone and cl to generate clo for oxidative degradation of ammonia nitrogen which promoted the transfer of products to gaseous nitrogen the reaction mechanism is shown in fig 6 from the above study it is clear that the combination of mg and co or the addition of ce components makes the prepared mgo co3o4 composite oxide catalyst rich in surface oxygen vacancies which increases the catalytic reaction sites and promotes the decomposition of ozone its application in catalytic ozonation is an effective feasible and promising method for ammonia nitrogen treatment at the same time it can be known that the high ammonia nitrogen removal rate and high nitrogen selectivity of mgo co3o4 composite catalyst are inseparable from the existence of cl in the solution however whether there is the role of other active substances such as cl remains to be further analyzed 3 2 2 γ al2o3 supported composite catalyst in addition some scholars have discussed the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by γ al2o3 supported catalyst combined with ozonation wu 74 used the impregnation method to prepare the co3o4 γ al2o3 composite metal catalyst by loading the active component co in the form of co3o4 on γ al2o3 support impregnation time of 24 h calcination temperature of 600 c and calcination time of 4 h and the loading of co was 14 75 mg 1 g γ al2o3 the degradation of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation with co3o4 γ al2o3 at ambient temperature and pressure 298 k 0 1 mpa was investigated it was found that under the conditions of ph 6 84 catalyst dosage of 200 g l and ozone concentration of 25 mg l the removal rate of 100 mg l ammonia solution could reach 100 after 360 min reaction ammonia nitrogen was converted into harmless n2 in large amount with only a small amount of no3 meanwhile the co3o4 γ al2o3 catalyst maintained 95 ammonia nitrogen removal rate after six times of repeated use and the co ions leached very little 0 04 mg l which had high stability the co element exists in two valence states co ii and co iii in the co3o4 γ al2o3 catalyst the transform of electrons in different valence states on the catalyst surface can promote the ozone decomposition to produce free radicals as shown in eqs 26 27 75 the study confirmed the presence of hydroxyl radicals in solution by epr electron paramagnetic resonance and speculated that they may oxidize free ammonia to generate the unstable substance nh2 which in turn generates n2h4 and nho which are oxidized to n2 no2 and no3 by ozone as shown in eqs 28 34 from the above article it is clear that co3o4 γ al2o3 catalyst can achieve 100 conversion of ammonia nitrogen and high nitrogen selectivity which can be a candidate for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation technology however this catalyst also has the disadvantages of relatively long treatment time and high catalyst consumption making the economic efficiency not very high 26 m n 1 o 3 m n oh h o 2 o 2 27 m n o 3 h m n 1 oh o 2 28 oh n h 3 h 2 o n h 2 29 2 n h 2 n 2 h 4 30 n 2 h 4 o 3 n 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 31 n 2 h 2

impregnation time of 8 h calcination temperature of 500 c calcination time of 6 h to explore its catalytic ozonation effect on ammonia nitrogen 200 mg l when the ph was neutral the catalyst dosage was 150 g l the ozone concentration was 30 mg l it was showed that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was 68 and most of the reaction products were n2 after 180 min treatment in addition the stability of mn cuox γ al2o3 catalyst was tested after repeated use for 5 times and the results showed that the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen remained above 65 and the leaching of mn ions and cu ions was only 0 31 mg l and 0 11 mg l respectively in this research hydroxyl radicals were identified as the main active substance by adding tert butanol with epr experiments but only sem and bet characterization were used to perform the prepared composite catalysts which made the mechanism of catalytic ozonation ambiguous li 77 also prepared mn cu al2o3 catalyst for catalytic ozonation to remove ammonia nitrogen in high salt wastewater from coal chemical industry the active components were loaded on alumina in the form of mno2 and cuo it was speculated that there was electron transfer between different valence states of the active components mn and cu which promoted the ozone decomposition to oh to act on the reactants however the valence state analysis of mn and cu elements was not conducted the ammonia removal rate of the mn cuox γ al2o3 catalyst is low so it is not the best catalyst for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen by ozonation technology the catalytic mechanism needs to be analyzed in more detail and reliably in combination with more structural characterization of the catalyst ling et al 78 prepared γ al2o3 fe mg5 fe mg molar ratio 1 5 calcination temperature of 500 c calcination time of 3 h composite catalyst with γ al2o3 as support and fe and mg as active components by impregnation method the surface of this composite catalyst was rich in acid base sites and oxygen vacancies which made it possess high activity specifically mg was loaded on the carrier in the form of mgo which increased the solution alkalinity through hydration and promoted the production of oh fe was loaded on the carrier in the form of fe2o3 and feo which promoted ozone decomposition through electron transfer between fe iii and fe ii at the initial ph of 7 catalyst dosage of 112 88 g l and o3 concentration of 2 4 mg min the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 98 73 of which the gaseous nitrogen selectivity accounted for 67 82 meanwhile the γ al2o3 fe mg5 catalyst had good stability and it was found that this catalyst still maintained high activity after 10 times of repeated use and the efficiency of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen decreased by 10 this new catalyst had both adsorption and catalytic effects in the γ al2o3 fe mg5 catalyzed ozonation of ammonia nitrogen with catalysis being the main mechanism of the reaction process the presence of the active species oh o2 and 1o2 was detected by epr and the addition of the corresponding inhibitors further determined that oh plays a major role through the structural characterization of the catalyst before and after the reaction the article indicates that the abundant acid base sites and oxygen vacancies on the surface of this catalyst are responsible for its high nitrogen selectivity in addition the effects of cuni loading rates of cu ni al2o3 catalyst were studied in catalytic ozonation treatment of landfill leachate which ammonia nitrogen concentration was 1000 to 2500 mg l the composite catalyst was obtained by the impregnation method when the molar ratio of cu and ni was 1 1 the calcination temperature was 800 c and the cuni loading rate was 2 6764 and the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation reached the maximum of 25 it was also indicated that ammonia nitrogen removal sometimes showed negative values at several different loading rates 79 the reason is that some organic nitrogen in the landfill leachate was oxidized to ammonia nitrogen by ozone and reactive radicals in the pre reaction period 80 it not only increased the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen but also consumed ozone and reactive radicals and both were not favorable for ammonia nitrogen removal the above cu ni al2o3 composite catalyst was only explored for the effect of cuni loading rate on ammonia nitrogen removal and the ammonia nitrogen degradation products and related catalytic mechanism were not studied it is believed that the ammonia nitrogen removal rates will be further improved with the optimization of reaction conditions which will provide basis for practical applications in conclusion adding active components increasing the active sites acid base sites oxygen vacancies surface hydroxyl groups of the γ al2o3 based composite catalysts or enhancing redox between metal ions of different valence can promote ozone decomposition and achieve higher ammonia removal rates and nitrogen selectivity the results of the application of related al2o3 based composite catalysts in landfill leachate also present the ability of such catalysts to remove actual wastewater at high concentrations the catalysts prepared in most of the above studies are stable and their active components have low leaching rates but how to reduce the catalyst loss and accelerate the reaction rate is the focus of future research 3 2 3 other composite catalysts liu et al 16 prepared the ctab nio composite catalyst by adding the active agent ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide to the surface of metal oxides calcination temperature is 300 c calcination time is 2 h its specific surface area is about 2 5 times larger than that of single nio providing more active sites the ctab nio composite catalyst was used in the catalytic ozonation system for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen with good results 81 at room temperature under the conditions of ph 9 ozone flow rate of 12 mg min catalyst dosage of 1 0 g l reaction time of 120 min the ctab nio coupled ozonation system achieved 95 93 removal of ammonia nitrogen of which the selectivity for gaseous nitrogen was 80 98 through hydroxyl radical quenching experiment it was confirmed that there was an indirect effect of hydroxyl radical on the degradation of ammonia nitrogen in the reaction system xrd characterization of the catalyst before and after the reaction showed that the diffraction peak of nh4br in the catalyst after use disappeared suggesting that it played a role in the degradation of ammonia nitrogen however the stability of this composite catalyst is relatively poor after repeated use for three times the ammonia nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen selectivity are reduced to 68 5 and 78 7 respectively the nickel ion leaching is relatively serious in the future the catalyst stability needs to be further improved nguyen et al 82 developed fe2o3 co3o4 modified dolomite catalyst and applied it to catalytic ozonation of simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater nh4cl the dolomite is mainly composed of mgo and caco3 the presence of mgo could keep the solution alkaline the addition of active components fe and co produced redox pairs of fe and co with different valence states which enhanced the redox ability of this composite catalyst in addition from section 3 1 1 it is known that co3o4 has low h f value and high nitrogen selectivity so the composite catalyst has high activity and nitrogen selectivity the results showed that this catalyst could achieve 96 ammonia nitrogen removal and 77 82 nitrogen selectivity in the ozonation process but its active substance and stability need to be explored subsequently to ensure its practicality it is known from section 3 2 1 that ceo2 can provide a large number of oxygen vacancies to promote ozone decomposition its composite catalysts were applied for ammonia nitrogen removal by catalytic ozonation he et al 83 produced a ceo2 mno2 composite catalyst molar ratio of 2 1 calcination temperature of 400 c calcination time of 3 h to study its efficiency in treating ammonia nitrogen solution it was found that the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and selectivity to gaseous nitrogen reached 88 14 and 53 67 respectively under the optimal working conditions the stability of the catalyst was good and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate could still reach 70 after five times of repeated use a series of characterization analyses indicated that mno2 played an important role but no specific catalytic mechanism for ceo2 mno2 was derived in this paper we speculate that there is electron transfer of ce and mn redox pairs in the composite catalyst which promotes ozone to generate hydroxyl radicals to degrade ammonia nitrogen krisbiantoro et al 84 developed a new composite catalyst pd ceo2 by using the impregnation method to load the precious metal pd as the active component on ceo2 calcination temperature of 250 c calcination time of 3 h and pd loading of 5 wt the electronic structures of several noble metals pd ag ru rh ir and pt were analyzed and it was indicated that pd has a moderate value of the d band center relative to the fermi level which made it highly nitrogen selective meanwhile the efficiencies of several carriers al2o3 sio2 ceo2 tio2 and ac activated carbon loaded with pd for catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen were also explored it was found that pd ceo2 had high ammonia nitrogen removal and nitrogen selectivity but the carrier characteristics were not analyzed at a reaction temperature of 333 k initial ph of 7 catalyst dosing of 1 0 g l and o3 concentration of 100 ml min the pd ceo2 catalyst was used in the catalytic ozonation of nh4cl solution 180 mg l the ammonia nitrogen removal rate reached 99 among them the gaseous selectivity could reach 90 80 chloramines however it was found that when the treated ammonia solution was nh4 2so4 the pd ceo2 catalyst was completely deactivated and had no effect on ammonia removal it indicates that this catalyst may be strongly influenced by so4 2 or the catalyst exhibits high catalytic activity only in the presence of cl in conclusion it is necessary to further investigate whether cl promotes or so4 2 inhibits the catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen which is important for the application of the catalyst to actual ammonia nitrogen wastewater many researchers have devoted themselves to the development of catalysts with high removal rate and high nitrogen selectivity so that ammonia nitrogen can be transformed into a harmless direction the composite catalyst combines the advantages of different components making them effective in catalytic ozonation of ammonia wastewater treatment there are many kinds of composite catalysts and their existence provides new ideas for the selection of efficient catalysts for ozonation however each composite catalyst has different active components resulting in different catalytic mechanisms and the synergistic interaction between different components needs to be further studied meanwhile the specific acting active substances in the catalytic ozonation system of the composite catalyst need to be further explored 3 3 activated carbon and its supported catalysts activated carbon ac has a large specific surface area microporous structure and surface activity and that is frequently used as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment 85 86 however generally activated carbon has a weak adsorption capacity for ammonia nitrogen 87 88 riyanto et al 89 used activated carbon adsorption to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing ammonia nitrogen and found that the activated carbon settling time had a significant effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen when treating 100 ml of pharmaceutical wastewater with an ammonia nitrogen concentration of about 30 mg l the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen reached about 95 at an activated carbon dosing amount and precipitation time of 60 g and 60 min respectively however this process has a large amount of activated carbon and takes a long time which does not have obvious economic benefits some studies 90 91 showed that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for ammonia nitrogen was improved after ozone pretreatment indicating that ozone has a better synergistic effect with activated carbon in addition to acting as an adsorbent activated carbon can also be used as a catalyst for catalytic ozonation to treat wastewater it has been shown that the alkalinity of activated carbon surface has an important effect on catalytic ozonation which can promote the decomposition of ozone in the liquid phase to form oh 92 94 o3 ac system can promote ozone oxidation adsorption and regeneration of activated carbon i activated carbon acts as an adsorbent and catalyst to adsorb micromolecular pollutants in water and catalyze ozone to produce oh 95 96 ii ozone oxidation oxidizes refractory macromolecular organic matter to micromolecular organic matter then promoting the adsorption of activated carbon 97 and iii ozone can partially regenerate activated carbon which promotes the recycling of activated carbon 98 99 the mechanism of activated carbon catalytic ozonation of pollutants differs when the solutions are at different ph levels 100 101 as shown in fig 7 when the solution is acidic activated carbon mainly acts as an adsorbent most of the organic matter is adsorbed while the others are oxidized and degraded to intermediate products by ozone as shown in fig 7 a when the solution is alkaline activated carbon mainly acts as a catalyst catalyzing ozone to produce hydroxyl radicals on its surface and most of the organic matter is oxidized and degraded to intermediate products by ozone and hydroxyl radicals the others are adsorbed by activated carbon as shown in fig 7 b catalytic ozonation with activated carbon and its supported catalysts were more effective in treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater as shown in table 4 shang et al 102 conducted a laboratory scale investigation of activated carbon catalytic ozonation for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater and analyzed the corresponding influencing factors and activated carbon stability it was found that the initial concentration of 35 mg l ammonia nitrogen solution was degraded to 0 84 mg l at an initial ph of 11 an activated carbon dosing rate of 10 g l an ozone flow rate of 30 mg min and a reaction time of 90 min in addition this study found that the activated carbon had good stability and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate could be maintained above 90 after five times of repeated use however this study did not investigate the distribution of products and mechanism of ammonia nitrogen degradation in the o3 ac system but only speculated that hydroxyl radicals were generated and acted on ammonia nitrogen in this process further studies on the active substances and the properties of activated carbon in this system are needed studies have shown that the catalytic activity of activated carbon can be enhanced by loading metal oxides as active components 103 in recent years some researchers have explored catalytic ozonation with activated carbon supported catalysts for the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater dong et al 104 supported femn oxides on activated carbon and treated printing and dyeing wastewater ammonia nitrogen concentration of 14 85 mg l by catalytic ozonation with it the results showed that 90 of the ammonia nitrogen was removed at a fe mn ac dosage of 20 g l ozone flow rate of 0 2 l min ph of 5 and reaction time of 60 min xiong et al 75 prepared mn gac catalyst by loading mn on granular activated carbon to treat secondary petrochemical wastewater it was shown that the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater increased from 3 0 to 5 0 mg l to 33 0 mg l within 5 min and after 90 min of reaction decreased to 0 8 mg l it has been shown that the reaction rate of oh with general organic matter is 108 1010 l mol s 1 105 which is greater than the reaction rate of oh with ammonia nitrogen 1 7 107 8 7 107 l mol s 1 106 hydroxyl radicals are non selective and highly reactive when both organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen are present in the water the organic nitrogen will be oxidized to ammonia nitrogen by oh at the early stage of the reaction leading to the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen increasing 107 thus more catalysts and ozone should be added to achieve efficient degradation of ammonia nitrogen the actual wastewater has complex components and many kinds of organic nitrogen sources some organic nitrogen sources will be degraded into organic by products and inorganic nitrogen nitrate nitrogen nitrite nitrogen ammonia nitrogen etc by catalytic ozonation 108 ammonia nitrogen is a common pollutant so it is necessary to study its degradation mechanism and harmless reaction products ma et al 33 investigated the removal of tailing leaching wastewater ammonia nitrogen concentration of about 40 mg l by catalytic ozonation with cu ac catalyst and found that an increase in ph value facilitated the degradation of ammonia nitrogen when the ph was 11 43 o3 cu ac system could achieve 99 ammonia nitrogen removal and the final conversion product of ammonia nitrogen was nitrate nitrogen it was showed that the specific surface area of copper loaded activated carbon was about 5 times larger than that of untreated activated carbon from 17 69 m2 g to 87 84 m2 g at ph of 9 57 cu ac catalyst only adsorbed 2 52 of ammonia nitrogen which indicated that catalytic ozonation was dominant in this process in addition a copper supported activated carbon catalyst was used for catalytic ozonation of landfill leachate with ammonia nitrogen concentration of 2100 mg l by wang et al 109 it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal rate did not fluctuate significantly with increasing ph while the cod removal rate decreased significantly when ph was 3 the degradation rate of ammonia nitrogen and cod reached 99 04 and 81 9 respectively it can be seen that the o3 cu ac system also has a great potential to degrade high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen the relevant degradation mechanisms were not explored in this study however it is clear that the main mechanism of degradation of ammonia nitrogen by o3 ac system is not the indirect effect of hydroxyl radical at ph of 3 because ozone decomposes slowly under acidic conditions oh is required to induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals ammonia nitrogen mainly exists in the form of nh4 in acidic environment and the possibility of ammonia nitrogen being blown out in the form of nh3 is very small however it needs further study to determine whether the adsorption of activated carbon plays a key role from the above it can be seen that activated carbon and modified activated carbon have good results in degrading ammonia nitrogen by synergistic ozonation and have satisfactory results in treating actual wastewater containing ammonia nitrogen compared with metal oxide and complex oxide catalysts activated carbon has high mechanical strength which makes it less leaching in solution and has good stability besides activated carbon has a high specific surface area which can synergize with ozone adsorption catalytic oxidation furthermore its relatively low price makes it economically efficient finally activated carbons are also good carriers and can be modified to prepare new catalysts however the analysis of ammonia nitrogen degradation is not thorough in the above mentioned studies of activated carbon and its supported catalysts for catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen which only focus on the ammonia nitrogen removal rate without evaluating the product distribution and gaseous nitrogen selectivity converting ammonia nitrogen into gaseous nitrogen products is one of the most environmentally friendly ways to degrade ammonia nitrogen and improving nitrogen selectivity while guaranteeing the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen is the focus of future research in addition the mechanism of activated carbon catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen is not well understood and the structure of activated carbon and loaded activated carbon catalysts needs to be analyzed and discussed in conjunction with relevant characterization tools to clarify the mechanism meanwhile ph has a great influence on the catalytic ozonation process and the form of ammonia nitrogen present for the activated carbon ph also has a great influence on its main role so further in depth study with ph is needed 4 conclusion and perspectives in this paper it is concluded that catalytic ozonation technology is feasible and effective when applied to ammonia nitrogen degradation by summarizing previous research studies compared with the treatment of ammonia nitrogen wastewater by ozone oxidation catalytic ozonation technology can promote the production of hydroxyl radicals accelerate the reaction rate and increase the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen by adding catalysts the specific conclusions are as follows i heterogeneous catalytic ozonation treatment of ammonia nitrogen could obtain high ammonia nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen selectivity among them the metal oxide co3o4 obtained high nitrogen selectivity due to its low h f value the composite catalysts combined different active components to produce abundant active sites such as oxygen vacancies acid base sites surface hydroxyl groups etc which improved the efficiency of catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrogen selectivity however the product distribution of activated carbon and its loaded catalysts for catalytic ozonation degradation of ammonia nitrogen has been little studied and this research gap needs to be filled in the future ii the main mechanism of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen is the direct oxidation by o3 and the indirect oxidation by oh but when chloride ions are present the reaction mechanism is different from the current studies it was clear that co3o4 mgo co3o4 and pd ceo2 catalysts coupled with ozonation were highly active for ammonia nitrogen removal in the presence of chloride ions and that clo replaced o3 and oh as the main oxidizing agents in addition to clo induced ammonia nitrogen degradation whether other active substances such as cl exist and play a role should be explored in depth in subsequent studies and the effect of other components in the wastewater such as heavy metals and organic matter on the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen should be further analyzed iii mgo and cao2 would react with aqueous solution to generate corresponding hydroxides during the catalytic reaction which could maintain the alkaline environment required for hydroxyl radical generation and promote the degradation of ammonia nitrogen however it also led to severe leaching of metal ions and the inevitable loss of other catalysts during the reaction less attention has been paid to catalyst losses in the existing studies and related studies should be strengthened to reduce losses iv catalytic ozonation technology can treat wastewater with high concentration of ammonia nitrogen the cu ac o3 system can degrade 99 of ammonia nitrogen when treating landfill leachate with ammonia nitrogen concentration of 2100 mg l some of the organic nitrogen sources in the actual wastewater will be converted to ammonia nitrogen by catalytic ozonation which increases the difficulty of ammonia nitrogen removal it is necessary to conduct research on catalytic ozonation technology for treating actual ammonia nitrogen wastewater at laboratory scale to make the technology more relevant to practical applications credit authorship contribution statement huiru ma drafted the manuscript guifang chen provided the initial
