13110,metal cutting fluids mcfs are used in the manufacture of metal parts and the machining industry for lubrication and cooling they are mainly composed of water and oils but to increase efficiency and life of mcf various additives such as antioxidants antifoams anti corrosives biocides fungicides etc are also added to mcfs the complex composition of mcfs make it hazardous to the environment so treatment before disposal becomes necessary in this study the catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater by scwo using ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts was investigated the effects of temperature 400 600 c pressure 20 35 mpa and residence time 60 150 s on the treatment efficiency based on total organic carbon toc removal were investigated in the presence of ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts it was observed that the treatment efficiency increased sharply in the temperature range of 450 500 c a residence time of 60 s and a pressure of 25 mpa at 600 c conversion of more than 93 was obtained for both catalysts a treatment efficiency of 99 was achieved when hydrogen peroxide as oxidant was used at a ratio of 2 1 to the initial concentration of metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw overall it was found that the use of a ru al2o3 catalyst gave a higher treatment efficiency than a pt al2o3 catalyst using the obtained data a reaction kinetic model was constructed and a correlation coefficient of more than 95 was obtained when comparing the experimental data and the model data graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal cutting fluids wastewater treatment pt al2o3 ru al2o3 supercritical water 1 introduction one of the critical threats to the environment is metal cutting fluids mcfs which are used in the machinery industry 1 mcfs are extensively used in metal manufacturing processes such as cutting milling grinding drilling etc providing cooling and lubrication between the workpiece and tools in the aforementioned processes are the primary functions of mcfs but they also have duties like removing small remnants of tools and metals out of the process as well as diminishing and inhibiting rusting corrosion and friction which results in an increased lifetime of tools increased cutting speed and improved process efficiency 2 3 water based mcfs are composed of water and mineral oils and depending on the composition of mixing the oil composition in water based mcfs usually varies from 1 to 5 and water composition becomes between 94 and 98 4 5 because of its long life period suitability at high cutting speeds and fewer maintenance requirements water based mcfs are the widely preferred type in the industry and accounts for approximately 80 of the total annual consumption of 2 million m3 mcfs worldwide because it is used in industry diluted with water at a ratio of 5 95 the amount of wastewater discharged to the environment can be more than ten times the mcfs spent 4 6 8 besides that the composition of mcfs is very complex and more than 300 different kinds of substances such as anti foam additives anti corrosion additives anti weld agents high pressure agents anti wear additives dispersing agents surfactant materials biocides and some toxic substances are added to achieve better performance and to prevent the growth of bacterial microorganisms 8 9 however the long usage of mcfs results in physical and chemical contamination and though the used biocides some microorganisms could proliferate in the presence of water as a result mcfs degrades in quality so replacement is necessary the metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw must be disposed of as efficiency is lost but due to contamination and the existence of hazardous toxic and non bio degradable substances it is considered a primary source of oil and hazardous sewages with high turbidity and strong cod about 104 105 mg l therefore it must be treated before disposal to the environment 10 12 in addition to environmental hazards mcfw has also adverse effects on human health according to the literature skin contact with mcfs can cause allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis and in case of inhalation of vapor of mcfs it can cause about pancreas rectum throat and prostate cancers as well as asthma chronic bronchitis airway irritation and even laryngeal cancer 12 13 traditional disposal of mcfw is mainly by incineration which causes disposal of harmful nox so2 and hcl gases to the environment or sent to landfill which can result in soil and underground water pollution because of that the european union water directive 2000 76 ec and landfill england and wales regulations no 1375 2004 accepted legislation with a strict framework for sustainable and safe disposal and traditional incineration and into landfill methods for disposal of mcfw are restricted 6 currently many chemical physicochemical physico mechanical electrochemical methods such as thermal evaporation chemical emulsion breaking 9 adsorption 7 ultrafiltration nanofiltration and microfiltration 14 16 distillation 17 membrane processes 18 coagulation and flocculation 19 coagulation or electrocoagulation 4 11 14 coagulation integrated with dissolved air floatation daf 20 electro oxidation 10 and various advanced oxidation processes such as ozonation fenton photo fenton ultrasonic fenton oxidation 2 12 21 22 are studied these methods are not suitable due to several disadvantages such as expensive equipment setup high operation costs and usage of different chemicals which produces a large amount of sludge waste to the environment 22 23 also there are a wide number of research about the biological treatment methods 24 25 for disposal of mcfw and many works have been carried out by coupling biological methods with different methods 8 26 27 however processes based on biological treatment methods are insufficient as biocides added to raw mcfs for inhibiting bacterial growth prevent the activity of biological species slow down the process and decrease the efficiency of treatment 8 18 27 these methods are not suitable due to several disadvantages such as expensive equipment setup high operation costs and usage of different chemicals which produces a large amount of sludge waste to the environment 22 23 also there are a wide number of research about the biological treatment methods 24 25 for disposal of mcfw and many works have been carried out by coupling biological methods with different methods however processes based on biological treatment methods are insufficient as biocides added to raw mcfs for inhibiting bacterial growth prevent the activity of biological species slow down the process and decrease the efficiency of treatment 8 18 27 as an alternative to all these methods hydrothermal oxidation in supercritical conditions named supercritical water oxidation scwo is more advantageous because it is efficient and clean compared to other methods during the scwo process organic substances oxidize to carbon dioxide water nitrogen and some other gases depending on the composition of wastewater in scwo water in supercritical conditions i e over 374 1 c of temperature and over 22 1 mpa of pressure which are critical points for water is used as a solvent that has low polarity at these conditions and organic substances can be easily dissolved in water which means it is completely miscible besides at supercritical conditions the diffusivity of water increases while its viscosity decreases and because of that thermal reaction rates increase and organic substances are decomposed efficiently and rapidly in short very residence times 28 31 in the last two decades scwo gained popularity for wastewater treatment and many studies cover the treatment of wastewater from different industries which contains a high amount of different organic substances 29 40 the abovementioned works have been carried out by using oxidative scwo which means oxidizing agent has been used in the system for creating free radicals these free radicals are highly reactive and unstable and because of that they rapidly react unselectively with all organic substances in the system and oxidize them to different gases and water in addition to that there is a catalytic scwo that utilizes catalysts in the system for decomposing organics into gases 41 there are also several studies that catalytic scwo was used for the treatment of wastewater and gasification of different organic compounds 28 42 45 however there are not many studies about the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater by scwo in the literature portela et al 41 46 have researched the treatment of mcfw in supercritical water and achieved 98 of decomposition of organic substances in less than 10 s residence time at 500 c temperature similar works have been done for the treatment of mcfw in supercritical water by sánchez oneto et al 47 48 for comparing two different mcfw for the former study and identifying the effect of oxygen on the kinetics of scwo of metal cutting fluid wastewater for the latter one respectively moreover garcía jarana et al 49 have examined the effect of temperature excess oxygen and catalyst addition on the yield of oxidation and composition of the gaseous effluent it has been observed that a rise in temperature increased cod removal and the addition of catalyst had a positive impact on gasification yield the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater with catalytic scwo is not investigated deeply so for contributing to the deficient knowledge on this topic catalytic scwo for treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater in the presence of ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts in the tubular reactor was studied ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 were preferred as catalysts since it was seen in previous studies that these catalysts increase the treatment efficiency by lowering the severity of the reaction and its temperature and therefore the energy consumption and to improve the oxidized product 43 50 51 the efficiency of treatment was determined by identifying the toc conversion of the processes at different conditions the effect of temperature residence time pressure amount of oxidant initial concentration of mcfw on toc conversion was investigated the composition of gases product was monitored and kinetic equation and parameters for catalytic scwo of metal cutting fluid wastewater were obtained by performing regression analysis for both catalysts 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercially from alfa aesar obtained ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts were utilized in the experiment without additional processing fig 1 illustrates the sem images and xrf spectrums of both catalysts ru al2o3 catalyst had a cylindrical shape and pt al2o3 catalyst had a spherical shape in the experiments with oxidant peroxide tekkim with 50 wt grade was used as the oxygen source it was mixed directly with mcfw to obtain the desired molar ratio of oxidant to mcfw the density of peroxide was 1 20 g ml and the amount of active oxygen was 24 2 2 characteristics of the used metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw the metal cutting fluid that was used for experimentation is hangsterfer s s 388 water emulsified mineral oil mineral based coolant and it was bought from atlas import export and trade ltd in table 1 the physical properties of the original mcf are given the original metal cutting fluid is used mixing with water in 5 95 ratio 5 units raw mcf and 95 units water in practice therefore it was diluted to 5 95 ratio with deionized water as a model wastewater solution before the start of the experiment some properties of used mcfw are given in table 2 2 3 experimental procedure the packed bed reactor system that was used for the catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw in supercritical conditions is illustrated in fig 2 the system consisted of a high pressure mcfw feed pump autoclave engineers a heat exchanger a gas liquid separator a back pressure regulator go regulator inc a 0 5 μm filter and a split furnace protherm there was a preheating line 50 cm 4 35 mm i d and a packed bed reactor 10 cm length x 2 cm i d inside the pid controlled furnace ru al2o3 ρ cat 1 82 g cm3 and pt al2o3 ρ cat 1 96 g cm3 were packed inside the reactor and 20 84 g and 31 38 g of catalysts were used respectively all hoses and pipes in the system from feed pump to gas liquid separator was made of 316 ss the mcfw feed in prepared concentrations were pumped to the system with the help of a pump the stream was heated to the required temperature by passing through the preheating zone and then supplied to the reactor where catalytic oxidation at supercritical conditions took place as the effluent left the split furnace it was cooled instantly in the heat exchanger to stop reactions that occur at supercritical conditions the pressure of the system was controlled by using a back pressure regulator with 0 1 mpa precision after that the products were separated in a gas liquid separator samples were taken from liquid effluent for further total organic carbon toc analysis also qualitative analysis of gaseous effluent was performed in gas chromatography clarus 500 model perkin elmer arnel 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of mcfw feed solutions and liquid products were characterized according to their toc values these values were obtained by performing toc analyses in a total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer hagh lange in the analyzer a highly sensitive multi channel non dispersive infrared detector was used to identify total and inorganic carbon concentrations by combustion catalytic oxidation method and toc was calculated from these concentrations the conversion of treatment toc conversion was calculated according to the total organic carbon toc concentrations of feed and liquid product effluent with eq 1 1 toc conversion 1 toc mg l toc 0 mg l 100 the chemical oxygen demand cod value of metal cutting fluid wastewater was determined according to standard methods 52 the gas samples were analyzed according to astm d2597 astm d1946 astm d1945 and din 51872 4 methods by perkin elmer clarus 500 rga 1115 model gc coupled with one fid and two tcd detectors the volumetric flow rates of mcfw for different reaction conditions temperature pressure residence time were determined with the help of eq 2 2 f v void τ ρ sc t p ρ l here f was volumetric flow rate ml s τ was residence time s and ρ l and ρ sc were densities g ml of mcfw at feed conditions and supercritical conditions respectively as the mcfw feed was diluted with deionized water it was assumed that mcfw had the same density of pure water and ρ l and ρ sc values were obtained from steam tables for corresponding conditions 53 v void was the void volume ml inside the packed bed reactor 3 results and discussions the catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater in supercritical conditions was investigated by using ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts the research was conducted to identify the effects of temperature residence time pressure the molar ratio of oxidant to mcfw and mcfw feed concentration on treatment efficiency i e toc removal the experiments were performed in the temperature range of 400 600 c and in the reaction time range of 60 150 s with and without the oxidant h2o2 at a constant pressure of 25 mpa in order to comprehend the effects of catalyst noncatalytic experiments were also carried out for two reaction times 60 and 120 s in the same aforesaid temperature interval the volumetric flow rates calculated according to the various reaction conditions as temperature pressure and reaction time vary from 0 44 ml min to 2 5 ml min and from 0 57 ml min to 3 24 ml min for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively 3 1 effect of temperature and residence time on treatment efficiency for determining the effect of temperature and residence time on the treatment efficiency of mcfw in supercritical conditions various experiments in the temperature range and the residence time range mentioned above were performed at a constant pressure of 25 mpa and an initial toc concentration of 8500 mg l by utilizing ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts the results obtained at aforesaid reaction conditions are presented in fig 3 it is seen from the figure that the treatment efficiency increased sharply by increasing temperature as expected and there were only moderate changes in toc removal values by increasing residence time at low temperatures 500 c and infinitesimal changes at high temperatures 500 c it is found that the effect of temperature was significant compared to residence time a similar trend was observed by yu et al 45 while studying treatment of oily wastewater by scwo fig 4 illustrates the change of toc removal against temperature for different catalysts and residence times in general the toc removal increases with rising temperature sharp increases in toc removal were obtained between the temperature range of 450 550 c for pt al2o3 catalyst and 400 550 c for ru al2o3 catalyst but the slope of increase was the highest in the temperature range of 450 500 c compared to others for both catalysts at the temperature of 500 c 55 87 of conversions were achieved while at 550 c 85 90 toc removals were obtained for each catalyst respectively after that the slope of increase was insignificant for both catalysts while temperature substantially raise by 500 c to 600 c thus 500 c temperature is the optimum temperature for catalytic oxidation of organics in supercritical water medium a similar trend was observed by yang et al 44 while studying the impact of temperature on the efficiency of oxidation of various aromatic compounds by catalytic scwo moreover angeles hernández et al 42 investigated the destruction of quinoline over mno2 cuo catalyst by scwo and determined that the toc removal increased to by increasing temperature and at 500 c temperature almost 99 of toc removal is achieved in addition blank experiments were also carried out without any catalysts to comprehend the effect of catalysts on treatment efficiency it can be observed that there was a significant increase in toc removal by using a catalyst the toc removal raises only up to 50 at 600 c and 120 s without any catalyst but a maximum of 94 of toc removal was obtained by utilizing any catalyst at these conditions while comparing used catalysts toc conversion was more for ru al2o3 catalyst than for pt al2o3 catalyst which means ru al2o3 catalyst is more effective compared to pt al2o3 catalyst karakuş et al 50 have reported a similar trend for catalytic gasification of 2 propanol to hydrogen in the presence of ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts in supercritical water they observed that ru al2o3 is more active and more than 90 of toc conversion could be achieved for ru al2o3 catalyst while only around 75 of toc conversion attained for pt al2o3 catalyst at 550 c temperature and 30 s residence time under 25 mpa pressure the effect of residence time on toc removal at different temperatures in presence of different catalysts is shown in fig 5 according to the figure there were reasonable increases of up to 5 at the efficiency of treatment by increasing residence time from 60 s to 90 s for the temperature of 450 c while at 600 c temperature the change was negligible for both catalysts the changes in toc conversion at residence times between 90 s and 150 s at any temperature in presence of both catalysts were trivial which means the effect of residence time on treatment efficiency can be neglected after 90s previously civan et al 28 detected the comparable results for treatment of landfill leachate over ni al2o3 catalyst they observed that the efficiency of treatment did not change while increasing residence time from 90 s to 150 s for scwo processes while determining the suitable reaction time both treatment efficiency and process economy must be considered thus the optimal reaction time for this experimentation was selected as 60 s to get maximum efficiency in shortest reaction times 3 2 effect of pressure on treatment efficiency for investigating the effect of pressure experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 500 c and a residence time of 60 s while pressure was changed between 20 mpa and 35 mpa the initial concentration of used mcfw was 8500 mg l fig 6 illustrates the change of toc removal with respect to pressure with utilizing both pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts it was clear from the figure that increasing the pressure from 25 mpa to 35 mpa decreased the toc conversion from 54 to 40 for the former catalyst and from 72 to 46 for the latter one while the pressure was reduced from supercritical to subcritical region i e from 25 mpa to 20 mpa the toc removal increased by 18 and 12 and consisted of 72 and 84 for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively in general increase in pressure has a negative effect on treatment efficiency and the pressure must be kept as little as possible besides that high pressure is not only increasing the thickness of reactor wall subsequently equipment costs but also escalates the power consumption of pumps this situation had also been observed in previous studies which involved the non catalytic scwo treatment of olive mill wastewater catalytic treatment of landfill leachate over ni al2o3 catalyst and non catalytic treatment of glyphosate wastewater 28 29 33 however decreasing the pressure to the subcritical region might result in carbonization on catalysts due to decreased fluid density and system blockages might happen with time therefore the best operational pressure for the catalytic treatment of mcfw in supercritical conditions can be considered as 25 mpa 3 3 effect of initial toc concentration on treatment efficiency to investigate the influence of feed toc concentration on the efficiency of treatment the feed toc concentration was varied between 8000 and 20 000 mg l at a temperature of 500 c a residence time of 60 s and a pressure of 25 mpa in the presence of pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts change of toc removal in that abovementioned range of initial toc concentrations was illustrated in fig 7 it is seen that an increase in the feed toc concentration increased treatment efficiency by increasing initial toc concentration from 8000 mg l to 20 000 mg l a reasonable 5 increase was observed from 57 to 72 and from 70 to 75 for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively the slope of change of toc removal is escalating in the range of from 16 000 to 20 000 mg l which means the initial concentration of mcfw affects the treatment efficiency intensely at higher concentrations based on that it can be anticipated that the order of reaction with respect to initial toc concentration is more than one for both catalysts moreover oxidation of mcfw under experiment conditions is an exothermic reaction and heat release from the reaction increases the temperature which affects toc removal percentage positively heat release from reaction and toc concentration is correlated to each other directly proportional and the slope of change of toc removal is increasing due to released heat 33 40 3 4 kinetic evaluation of catalytic treatment of mcfw in supercritical conditions as an adequate number of experiments were conducted to understand the effects of temperature residence time pressure and initial concentrations on treatment efficiency the rate equation of the catalytic decomposition of metal cutting fluids by supercritical water oxidation can also be evaluated based on the sem images of catalysts from fig 1 it is obvious that the catalyst particles were impermeable and reactions took place on the surface of the catalyst that is why the kinetic equation of reaction would only contain the rate equation of surface reaction and the rate equations of adsorption desorption or diffusion would be neglected the global rate expression for scwo is usually described by power exponential equations in terms of concentration changes of reactants but not intermediates 54 the reactants in the system were organics and water because of that the kinetic model for catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluids can be described mathematically with eq 3 3 d c d τ k 0 e e a rt c n h 2 o n here k 0 is pre exponential factor and e a is the activation energy of the reaction r and t are universal gas constant and temperature respectively c and h 2 o are the total concentration of organics and water respectively n and m are reaction orders for each reactant respectively since the water was used in excess in the system and the change of concentration of water was minuscule m can be assumed to be 0 which means the global kinetic equation would be depending only on the change of organic compounds concentration 50 54 then the abovementioned equation can be expressed as follow in terms of toc concentrations 4 d toc dτ k 0 e e a rt toc n eqs 1 and 4 can be combined to define the rate expression of the reaction in terms of toc conversion x and after rearranging the following equation is obtained 5 d x dτ k 0 e e a rt toc 0 n 1 1 x n toc 0 is the concentration mol l at the entrance of the reactor in supercritical conditions eq 5 can be integrated by applying the boundary condition of x 0 at residence time t 0 and can be expressed as eq 6 to identify the dependence of toc conversion x on process parameters t τ toc0 6 x 1 1 n 1 k 0 e e a rt toc 0 n 1 τ 1 1 n for n 1 the nonlinear regression analysis of eq 6 for obtained data of temperature residence time initial toc concentration and toc conversion was performed and kinetic parameters of catalytic oxidation of metal cutting fluid wastewater in supercritical conditions was predicted in table 3 the order of reaction rate according to toc concentration n the pre exponential factor k 0 and the activation energy of reaction e a are given for both pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts the order of the reaction was identified as 1 21 and 1 45 for each catalyst respectively moreover the activation energy of the reaction for ru al2o3 catalyst was lower compared to pt al2o3 catalyst which proves that ru al2o3 catalyst is more active than pt al2o3 catalyst in fig 8 the comparison of predicted data from the model rate equation and experimental data were illustrated almost all data were between the dashed lines which show a deviation of 5 toc removal from 45 line the correlation coefficient of the regression analysis was 0 958 and 0 962 for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively which means the predicted model for the reaction fits the experimental data satisfactorily 3 5 the composition analysis of gaseous effluent the gaseous effluent from the top of the gas liquid separator was sent to gas chromatography to figure out the composition of the products fig 9 illustrates the qualitative composition of gaseous products at the temperature range of 400 550 c as it is seen from the figure the wastewater was decomposed not only to final products which were carbon dioxide and water but also to some intermediates such as carbon monoxide hydrogen methane ethane propane and propylene besides it was observed that the effect of temperature on the catalytic treatment of the mcfw is crucial as the composition of products differed considerably for each temperature the peaks for carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at 400 and 450 c temperatures were higher than 500 and 550 c while for hydrocarbons they were vice versa which means the mole fraction of co and co2 in the gaseous effluent was decreasing while the mole fractions of methane ethane and other hydrocarbons were increasing by increasing temperature moreover at 400 c the amount of carbon dioxide was significantly big compared to other products all these contradictions were due to the dependence of ionization of water on temperature as the temperature increases from 400 c to 550 c the dissociation constant of water decreases from 10 16 57 to 10 19 11 at 25 mpa pressure 55 it shows that in supercritical conditions the water dissociates to h and oh ions and reacts with the organic compounds in the wastewater to form co2 similar trends were observed in a previous paper by kıpçak and akgün 43 while studying biofuel production from olive mill wastewater by using ni al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts they observed maximum 82 mole and 79 mole of co2 in the gaseous effluent at 400 c temperature for ni al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts respectively 3 6 effect of oxidant ratio on treatment efficiency the effect of temperature residence time pressure and initial toc concentration on the treatment of mcfw in supercritical water over ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 was studied without utilizing any oxidant and a maximum of 94 of toc removal was achieved at a pressure of 25 mpa a temperature of 600 c and a residence time of 150 s however the conversion of treatment could be increased by using an oxidant and a higher level of toc removal could be attained so the effect of oxidant on toc removal was investigated at optimal conditions of 25 mpa pressure 500 c temperature and 60 s residence time and results were shown in fig 10 there were several oxidants such as air oxygen or hydrogen peroxide that could be used as a source of oxygen and each of them has different reaction mechanism hydrogen peroxide was the most effective one among them and it is easy to mix with mcfw and to pump into the reactor so in this study hydrogen peroxide is opted as an oxidant the required oxidant concentrations were calculated according to the cod value of utilized mcfw in the experiments the ratio of oxidant to mcfw was set as 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 and 2 1 and a substantial positive impact on the treatment efficiency was observed by adding an oxidant the usage of oxidant in 0 5 1 ratio to mcfw increased the efficiency of treatment significantly from 55 to 72 for pt al2o3 catalyst and a slight 2 of increase from 73 to 75 was noticed for ru al2o3 catalyst besides increasing the ratio of used oxidant to mcfw to 1 5 1 raised the toc removal to almost 99 for both catalysts and then the change of toc removal became negligible by increasing the oxidant ratio to further concentrations addition of oxidant to reaction apparently increase the toc removal because of radical reactions take place in the reactor scwo with addition of oxidant follows the free radical reaction mechanism mainly including initiation propagation and termination stages at supercritical conditions hydrogen peroxide decomposes to oh radicals which initiate the chain reactions and increase the toc removal 33 56 addition of excess oxidant in 2 1 ratio to the mcfw barely change the treatment efficiency which means excess oxidant leaves the reactor without taking part in the reaction 28 4 conclusions this study was carried out to test the convenience of catalytic scwo for the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater by employing pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts the results revealed that up to 94 of conversion could be achieved at operating conditions of 600 c temperature 25 mpa pressure and 150 s residence time also the conversion could be raised to 99 by utilizing an oxidant in the process it was also found that the temperature had a prominent effect on toc removal compared to the pressure as temperature is the main factor for determining the physical properties of water particularly the viscosity and diffusion coefficient under supercritical conditions while impact of pressure is barely perceptible what is more the impact of residence time was negligible in general the catalytic scwo method is very suitable for the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater and high conversion rates could be reached in short residence times declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work has been supported by

13110,metal cutting fluids mcfs are used in the manufacture of metal parts and the machining industry for lubrication and cooling they are mainly composed of water and oils but to increase efficiency and life of mcf various additives such as antioxidants antifoams anti corrosives biocides fungicides etc are also added to mcfs the complex composition of mcfs make it hazardous to the environment so treatment before disposal becomes necessary in this study the catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater by scwo using ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts was investigated the effects of temperature 400 600 c pressure 20 35 mpa and residence time 60 150 s on the treatment efficiency based on total organic carbon toc removal were investigated in the presence of ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts it was observed that the treatment efficiency increased sharply in the temperature range of 450 500 c a residence time of 60 s and a pressure of 25 mpa at 600 c conversion of more than 93 was obtained for both catalysts a treatment efficiency of 99 was achieved when hydrogen peroxide as oxidant was used at a ratio of 2 1 to the initial concentration of metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw overall it was found that the use of a ru al2o3 catalyst gave a higher treatment efficiency than a pt al2o3 catalyst using the obtained data a reaction kinetic model was constructed and a correlation coefficient of more than 95 was obtained when comparing the experimental data and the model data graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal cutting fluids wastewater treatment pt al2o3 ru al2o3 supercritical water 1 introduction one of the critical threats to the environment is metal cutting fluids mcfs which are used in the machinery industry 1 mcfs are extensively used in metal manufacturing processes such as cutting milling grinding drilling etc providing cooling and lubrication between the workpiece and tools in the aforementioned processes are the primary functions of mcfs but they also have duties like removing small remnants of tools and metals out of the process as well as diminishing and inhibiting rusting corrosion and friction which results in an increased lifetime of tools increased cutting speed and improved process efficiency 2 3 water based mcfs are composed of water and mineral oils and depending on the composition of mixing the oil composition in water based mcfs usually varies from 1 to 5 and water composition becomes between 94 and 98 4 5 because of its long life period suitability at high cutting speeds and fewer maintenance requirements water based mcfs are the widely preferred type in the industry and accounts for approximately 80 of the total annual consumption of 2 million m3 mcfs worldwide because it is used in industry diluted with water at a ratio of 5 95 the amount of wastewater discharged to the environment can be more than ten times the mcfs spent 4 6 8 besides that the composition of mcfs is very complex and more than 300 different kinds of substances such as anti foam additives anti corrosion additives anti weld agents high pressure agents anti wear additives dispersing agents surfactant materials biocides and some toxic substances are added to achieve better performance and to prevent the growth of bacterial microorganisms 8 9 however the long usage of mcfs results in physical and chemical contamination and though the used biocides some microorganisms could proliferate in the presence of water as a result mcfs degrades in quality so replacement is necessary the metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw must be disposed of as efficiency is lost but due to contamination and the existence of hazardous toxic and non bio degradable substances it is considered a primary source of oil and hazardous sewages with high turbidity and strong cod about 104 105 mg l therefore it must be treated before disposal to the environment 10 12 in addition to environmental hazards mcfw has also adverse effects on human health according to the literature skin contact with mcfs can cause allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis and in case of inhalation of vapor of mcfs it can cause about pancreas rectum throat and prostate cancers as well as asthma chronic bronchitis airway irritation and even laryngeal cancer 12 13 traditional disposal of mcfw is mainly by incineration which causes disposal of harmful nox so2 and hcl gases to the environment or sent to landfill which can result in soil and underground water pollution because of that the european union water directive 2000 76 ec and landfill england and wales regulations no 1375 2004 accepted legislation with a strict framework for sustainable and safe disposal and traditional incineration and into landfill methods for disposal

are a wide number of research about the biological treatment methods 24 25 for disposal of mcfw and many works have been carried out by coupling biological methods with different methods 8 26 27 however processes based on biological treatment methods are insufficient as biocides added to raw mcfs for inhibiting bacterial growth prevent the activity of biological species slow down the process and decrease the efficiency of treatment 8 18 27 these methods are not suitable due to several disadvantages such as expensive equipment setup high operation costs and usage of different chemicals which produces a large amount of sludge waste to the environment 22 23 also there are a wide number of research about the biological treatment methods 24 25 for disposal of mcfw and many works have been carried out by coupling biological methods with different methods however processes based on biological treatment methods are insufficient as biocides added to raw mcfs for inhibiting bacterial growth prevent the activity of biological species slow down the process and decrease the efficiency of treatment 8 18 27 as an alternative to all these methods hydrothermal oxidation in supercritical conditions named supercritical water oxidation scwo is more advantageous because it is efficient and clean compared to other methods during the scwo process organic substances oxidize to carbon dioxide water nitrogen and some other gases depending on the composition of wastewater in scwo water in supercritical conditions i e over 374 1 c of temperature and over 22 1 mpa of pressure which are critical points for water is used as a solvent that has low polarity at these conditions and organic substances can be easily dissolved in water which means it is completely miscible besides at supercritical conditions the diffusivity of water increases while its viscosity decreases and because of that thermal reaction rates increase and organic substances are decomposed efficiently and rapidly in short very residence times 28 31 in the last two decades scwo gained popularity for wastewater treatment and many studies cover the treatment of wastewater from different industries which contains a high amount of different organic substances 29 40 the abovementioned works have been carried out by using oxidative scwo which means oxidizing agent has been used in the system for creating free radicals these free radicals are highly reactive and unstable and because of that they rapidly react unselectively with all organic substances in the system and oxidize them to different gases and water in addition to that there is a catalytic scwo that utilizes catalysts in the system for decomposing organics into gases 41 there are also several studies that catalytic scwo was used for the treatment of wastewater and gasification of different organic compounds 28 42 45 however there are not many studies about the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater by scwo in the literature portela et al 41 46 have researched the treatment of mcfw in supercritical water and achieved 98 of decomposition of organic substances in less than 10 s residence time at 500 c temperature similar works have been done for the treatment of mcfw in supercritical water by sánchez oneto et al 47 48 for comparing two different mcfw for the former study and identifying the effect of oxygen on the kinetics of scwo of metal cutting fluid wastewater for the latter one respectively moreover garcía jarana et al 49 have examined the effect of temperature excess oxygen and catalyst addition on the yield of oxidation and composition of the gaseous effluent it has been observed that a rise in temperature increased cod removal and the addition of catalyst had a positive impact on gasification yield the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater with catalytic scwo is not investigated deeply so for contributing to the deficient knowledge on this topic catalytic scwo for treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater in the presence of ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts in the tubular reactor was studied ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 were preferred as catalysts since it was seen in previous studies that these catalysts increase the treatment efficiency by lowering the severity of the reaction and its temperature and therefore the energy consumption and to improve the oxidized product 43 50 51 the efficiency of treatment was determined by identifying the toc conversion of the processes at different conditions the effect of temperature residence time pressure amount of oxidant initial concentration of mcfw on toc conversion was investigated the composition of gases product was monitored and kinetic equation and parameters for catalytic scwo of metal cutting fluid wastewater were obtained by performing regression analysis for both catalysts 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercially from alfa aesar obtained ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts were utilized in the experiment without additional processing fig 1 illustrates the sem images and xrf spectrums of both catalysts ru al2o3 catalyst had a cylindrical shape and pt al2o3 catalyst had a spherical shape in the experiments with oxidant peroxide tekkim with 50 wt grade was used as the oxygen source it was mixed directly with mcfw to obtain the desired molar ratio of oxidant to mcfw the density of peroxide was 1 20 g ml and the amount of active oxygen was 24 2 2 characteristics of the used metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw the metal cutting fluid that was used for experimentation is hangsterfer s s 388 water emulsified mineral oil mineral based coolant and it was bought from atlas import export and trade ltd in table 1 the physical properties of the original mcf are given the original metal cutting fluid is used mixing with water in 5 95 ratio 5 units raw mcf and 95 units water in practice therefore it was diluted to 5 95 ratio with deionized water as a model wastewater solution before the start of the experiment some properties of used mcfw are given in table 2 2 3 experimental procedure the packed bed reactor system that was used for the catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater mcfw in supercritical conditions is illustrated in fig 2 the system consisted of a high pressure mcfw feed pump autoclave engineers a heat exchanger a gas liquid separator a back pressure regulator go regulator inc a 0 5 μm filter and a split furnace protherm there was a preheating line 50 cm 4 35 mm i d and a packed bed reactor 10 cm length x 2 cm i d inside the pid controlled furnace ru al2o3 ρ cat 1 82 g cm3 and pt al2o3 ρ cat 1 96 g cm3 were packed inside the reactor and 20 84 g and 31 38 g of catalysts were used respectively all hoses and pipes in the system from feed pump to gas liquid separator was made of 316 ss the mcfw feed in prepared concentrations were pumped to the system with the help of a pump the stream was heated to the required temperature by passing through the preheating zone and then supplied to the reactor where catalytic oxidation at supercritical conditions took place as the effluent left the split furnace it was cooled instantly in the heat exchanger to stop reactions that occur at supercritical conditions the pressure of the system was controlled by using a back pressure regulator with 0 1 mpa precision after that the products were separated in a gas liquid separator samples were taken from liquid effluent for further total organic carbon toc analysis also qualitative analysis of gaseous effluent was performed in gas chromatography clarus 500 model perkin elmer arnel 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of mcfw feed solutions and liquid products were characterized according to their toc values these values were obtained by performing toc analyses in a total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer hagh lange in the analyzer a highly sensitive multi channel non dispersive infrared detector was used to identify total and inorganic carbon concentrations by combustion catalytic oxidation method and toc was calculated from these concentrations the conversion of treatment toc conversion was calculated according to the total organic carbon toc concentrations of feed and liquid product effluent with eq 1 1 toc conversion 1 toc mg l toc 0 mg l 100 the chemical oxygen demand cod value of metal cutting fluid wastewater was determined according to standard methods 52 the gas samples were analyzed according to astm d2597 astm d1946 astm d1945 and din 51872 4 methods by perkin elmer clarus 500 rga 1115 model gc coupled with one fid and two tcd detectors the volumetric flow rates of mcfw for different reaction conditions temperature pressure residence time were determined with the help of eq 2 2 f v void τ ρ sc t p ρ l here f was volumetric flow rate ml s τ was residence time s and ρ l and ρ sc were densities g ml of mcfw at feed conditions and supercritical conditions respectively as the mcfw feed was diluted with deionized water it was assumed that mcfw had the same density of pure water and ρ l and ρ sc values were obtained from steam tables for corresponding conditions 53 v void was the void volume ml inside the packed bed reactor 3 results and discussions the catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater in supercritical conditions was investigated by using ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts the research was conducted to identify the effects of temperature residence time pressure the molar ratio of oxidant to mcfw and mcfw feed concentration on treatment efficiency i e toc removal the experiments were performed in the temperature range of 400 600 c and in the reaction time range of 60 150 s with and without the oxidant h2o2 at a constant pressure of 25 mpa in order to comprehend the effects of catalyst noncatalytic experiments were also carried out for two reaction times 60 and 120 s in the same aforesaid temperature interval the volumetric flow rates calculated according to the various reaction conditions as temperature pressure and reaction time vary from 0 44 ml min to 2 5 ml min and from 0 57 ml min to 3 24 ml min for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively 3 1 effect of temperature and residence time on treatment efficiency for determining the effect of temperature and residence time on the treatment efficiency of mcfw in supercritical conditions various experiments in the temperature range and the residence time range mentioned above were performed at a constant pressure of 25 mpa and an initial toc concentration of 8500 mg l by utilizing ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts the results obtained at aforesaid reaction conditions are presented in fig 3 it is seen from the figure that the treatment efficiency increased sharply by increasing temperature as expected and there were only moderate changes in toc removal values by increasing residence time at low temperatures 500 c and infinitesimal changes at high temperatures 500 c it is found that the effect of temperature was significant compared to residence time a similar trend was observed by yu et al 45 while studying treatment of oily wastewater by scwo fig 4 illustrates the change of toc removal against temperature for different catalysts and residence times in general the toc removal increases with rising temperature sharp increases in toc removal were obtained between the temperature range of 450 550 c for pt al2o3 catalyst and 400 550 c for ru al2o3 catalyst but the slope of increase was the highest in the temperature range of 450 500 c compared to others for both catalysts at the temperature of 500 c 55 87 of conversions were achieved while at 550 c 85 90 toc removals were obtained for each catalyst respectively after that the slope of increase was insignificant for both catalysts while temperature substantially raise by 500 c to 600 c thus 500 c temperature is the optimum temperature for catalytic oxidation of organics in supercritical water medium a similar trend was observed by yang et al 44 while studying the impact of temperature on the efficiency of oxidation of various aromatic compounds by catalytic scwo moreover angeles hernández et al 42 investigated the destruction of quinoline over mno2 cuo catalyst by scwo and determined that the toc removal increased to by increasing temperature and at 500 c temperature almost 99 of toc removal is achieved in addition blank experiments were also carried out without any catalysts to comprehend the effect of catalysts on treatment efficiency it can be observed that there was a significant increase in toc removal by using a catalyst the toc removal raises only up to 50 at 600 c and 120 s without any catalyst but a maximum of 94 of toc removal was obtained by utilizing any catalyst at these conditions while comparing used catalysts toc conversion was more for ru al2o3 catalyst than for pt al2o3 catalyst which means ru al2o3 catalyst is more effective compared to pt al2o3 catalyst karakuş et al 50 have reported a similar trend for catalytic gasification of 2 propanol to hydrogen in the presence of ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts in supercritical water they observed that ru al2o3 is more active and more than 90 of toc conversion could be achieved for ru al2o3 catalyst while only around 75 of toc conversion attained for pt al2o3 catalyst at 550 c temperature and 30 s residence time under 25 mpa pressure the effect of residence time on toc removal at different temperatures in presence of different catalysts is shown in fig 5 according to the figure there were reasonable increases of up to 5 at the efficiency of treatment by increasing residence time from 60 s to 90 s for the temperature of 450 c while at 600 c temperature the change was negligible for both catalysts the changes in toc conversion at residence times between 90 s and 150 s at any temperature in presence of both catalysts were trivial which means the effect of residence time on treatment efficiency can be neglected after 90s previously civan et al 28 detected the comparable results for treatment of landfill leachate over ni al2o3 catalyst they observed that the efficiency of treatment did not change while increasing residence time from 90 s to 150 s for scwo processes while determining the suitable reaction time both treatment efficiency and process economy must be considered thus the optimal reaction time for this experimentation was selected as 60 s to get maximum efficiency in shortest reaction times 3 2 effect of pressure on treatment efficiency for investigating the effect of pressure experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 500 c and a residence time of 60 s while pressure was changed between 20 mpa and 35 mpa the initial concentration of used mcfw was 8500 mg l fig 6 illustrates the change of toc removal with respect to pressure with utilizing both pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts it was clear from the figure that increasing the pressure from 25 mpa to 35 mpa decreased the toc conversion from 54 to 40 for the former catalyst and from 72 to 46 for the latter one while the pressure was reduced from supercritical to subcritical region i e from 25 mpa to 20 mpa the toc removal increased by 18 and 12 and consisted of 72 and 84 for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively in general increase in pressure has a negative effect on treatment efficiency and the pressure must be kept as little as possible besides that high pressure is not only increasing the thickness of reactor wall subsequently equipment costs but also escalates the power consumption of pumps this situation had also been observed in previous studies which involved the non catalytic scwo treatment of olive mill wastewater catalytic treatment of landfill leachate over ni al2o3 catalyst and non catalytic treatment of glyphosate wastewater 28 29 33 however decreasing the pressure to the subcritical region might result in carbonization on catalysts due to decreased fluid density and system blockages might happen with time therefore the best operational pressure for the catalytic treatment of mcfw in supercritical conditions can be considered as 25 mpa 3 3 effect of initial toc concentration on treatment efficiency to investigate the influence of feed toc concentration on the efficiency of treatment the feed toc concentration was varied between 8000 and 20 000 mg l at a temperature of 500 c a residence time of 60 s and a pressure of 25 mpa in the presence of pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts change of toc removal in that abovementioned range of initial toc concentrations was illustrated in fig 7 it is seen that an increase in the feed toc concentration increased treatment efficiency by increasing initial toc concentration from 8000 mg l to 20 000 mg l a reasonable 5 increase was observed from 57 to 72 and from 70 to 75 for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively the slope of change of toc removal is escalating in the range of from 16 000 to 20 000 mg l which means the initial concentration of mcfw affects the treatment efficiency intensely at higher concentrations based on that it can be anticipated that the order of reaction with respect to initial toc concentration is more than one for both catalysts moreover oxidation of mcfw under experiment conditions is an exothermic reaction and heat release from the reaction increases the temperature which affects toc removal percentage positively heat release from reaction and toc concentration is correlated to each other directly proportional and the slope of change of toc removal is increasing due to released heat 33 40 3 4 kinetic evaluation of catalytic treatment of mcfw in supercritical conditions as an adequate number of experiments were conducted to understand the effects of temperature residence time pressure and initial concentrations on treatment efficiency the rate equation of the catalytic decomposition of metal cutting fluids by supercritical water oxidation can also be evaluated based on the sem images of catalysts from fig 1 it is obvious that the catalyst particles were impermeable and reactions took place on the surface of the catalyst that is why the kinetic equation of reaction would only contain the rate equation of surface reaction and the rate equations of adsorption desorption or diffusion would be neglected the global rate expression for scwo is usually described by power exponential equations in terms of concentration changes of reactants but not intermediates 54 the reactants in the system were organics and water because of that the kinetic model for catalytic treatment of metal cutting fluids can be described mathematically with eq 3 3 d c d τ k 0 e e a rt c n h 2 o n here k 0 is pre exponential factor and e a is the activation energy of the reaction r and t are universal gas constant and temperature respectively c and h 2 o are the total concentration of organics and water respectively n and m are reaction orders for each reactant respectively since the water was used in excess in the system and the change of concentration of water was minuscule m can be assumed to be 0 which means the global kinetic equation would be depending only on the change of organic compounds concentration 50 54 then the abovementioned equation can be expressed as follow in terms of toc concentrations 4 d toc dτ k 0 e e a rt toc n eqs 1 and 4 can be combined to define the rate expression of the reaction in terms of toc conversion x and after rearranging the following equation is obtained 5 d x dτ k 0 e e a rt toc 0 n 1 1 x n toc 0 is the concentration mol l at the entrance of the reactor in supercritical conditions eq 5 can be integrated by applying the boundary condition of x 0 at residence time t 0 and can be expressed as eq 6 to identify the dependence of toc conversion x on process parameters t τ toc0 6 x 1 1 n 1 k 0 e e a rt toc 0 n 1 τ 1 1 n for n 1 the nonlinear regression analysis of eq 6 for obtained data of temperature residence time initial toc concentration and toc conversion was performed and kinetic parameters of catalytic oxidation of metal cutting fluid wastewater in supercritical conditions was predicted in table 3 the order of reaction rate according to toc concentration n the pre exponential factor k 0 and the activation energy of reaction e a are given for both pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts the order of the reaction was identified as 1 21 and 1 45 for each catalyst respectively moreover the activation energy of the reaction for ru al2o3 catalyst was lower compared to pt al2o3 catalyst which proves that ru al2o3 catalyst is more active than pt al2o3 catalyst in fig 8 the comparison of predicted data from the model rate equation and experimental data were illustrated almost all data were between the dashed lines which show a deviation of 5 toc removal from 45 line the correlation coefficient of the regression analysis was 0 958 and 0 962 for pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts respectively which means the predicted model for the reaction fits the experimental data satisfactorily 3 5 the composition analysis of gaseous effluent the gaseous effluent from the top of the gas liquid separator was sent to gas chromatography to figure out the composition of the products fig 9 illustrates the qualitative composition of gaseous products at the temperature range of 400 550 c as it is seen from the figure the wastewater was decomposed not only to final products which were carbon dioxide and water but also to some intermediates such as carbon monoxide hydrogen methane ethane propane and propylene besides it was observed that the effect of temperature on the catalytic treatment of the mcfw is crucial as the composition of products differed considerably for each temperature the peaks for carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at 400 and 450 c temperatures were higher than 500 and 550 c while for hydrocarbons they were vice versa which means the mole fraction of co and co2 in the gaseous effluent was decreasing while the mole fractions of methane ethane and other hydrocarbons were increasing by increasing temperature moreover at 400 c the amount of carbon dioxide was significantly big compared to other products all these contradictions were due to the dependence of ionization of water on temperature as the temperature increases from 400 c to 550 c the dissociation constant of water decreases from 10 16 57 to 10 19 11 at 25 mpa pressure 55 it shows that in supercritical conditions the water dissociates to h and oh ions and reacts with the organic compounds in the wastewater to form co2 similar trends were observed in a previous paper by kıpçak and akgün 43 while studying biofuel production from olive mill wastewater by using ni al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts they observed maximum 82 mole and 79 mole of co2 in the gaseous effluent at 400 c temperature for ni al2o3 and pt al2o3 catalysts respectively 3 6 effect of oxidant ratio on treatment efficiency the effect of temperature residence time pressure and initial toc concentration on the treatment of mcfw in supercritical water over ru al2o3 and pt al2o3 was studied without utilizing any oxidant and a maximum of 94 of toc removal was achieved at a pressure of 25 mpa a temperature of 600 c and a residence time of 150 s however the conversion of treatment could be increased by using an oxidant and a higher level of toc removal could be attained so the effect of oxidant on toc removal was investigated at optimal conditions of 25 mpa pressure 500 c temperature and 60 s residence time and results were shown in fig 10 there were several oxidants such as air oxygen or hydrogen peroxide that could be used as a source of oxygen and each of them has different reaction mechanism hydrogen peroxide was the most effective one among them and it is easy to mix with mcfw and to pump into the reactor so in this study hydrogen peroxide is opted as an oxidant the required oxidant concentrations were calculated according to the cod value of utilized mcfw in the experiments the ratio of oxidant to mcfw was set as 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 and 2 1 and a substantial positive impact on the treatment efficiency was observed by adding an oxidant the usage of oxidant in 0 5 1 ratio to mcfw increased the efficiency of treatment significantly from 55 to 72 for pt al2o3 catalyst and a slight 2 of increase from 73 to 75 was noticed for ru al2o3 catalyst besides increasing the ratio of used oxidant to mcfw to 1 5 1 raised the toc removal to almost 99 for both catalysts and then the change of toc removal became negligible by increasing the oxidant ratio to further concentrations addition of oxidant to reaction apparently increase the toc removal because of radical reactions take place in the reactor scwo with addition of oxidant follows the free radical reaction mechanism mainly including initiation propagation and termination stages at supercritical conditions hydrogen peroxide decomposes to oh radicals which initiate the chain reactions and increase the toc removal 33 56 addition of excess oxidant in 2 1 ratio to the mcfw barely change the treatment efficiency which means excess oxidant leaves the reactor without taking part in the reaction 28 4 conclusions this study was carried out to test the convenience of catalytic scwo for the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater by employing pt al2o3 and ru al2o3 catalysts the results revealed that up to 94 of conversion could be achieved at operating conditions of 600 c temperature 25 mpa pressure and 150 s residence time also the conversion could be raised to 99 by utilizing an oxidant in the process it was also found that the temperature had a prominent effect on toc removal compared to the pressure as temperature is the main factor for determining the physical properties of water particularly the viscosity and diffusion coefficient under supercritical conditions while impact of pressure is barely perceptible what is more the impact of residence time was negligible in general the catalytic scwo method is very suitable for the treatment of metal cutting fluid wastewater and high conversion rates could be reached in short residence times declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work has been supported by

13111,the h2o2 o2 oh and ho2 generated by the anode and cathode are considered the possible sources of the oxidizing power of the electro fenton system for improving the current efficiency the assessment of the degradability of anode and various active substances to pollutants is an important prerequisite the cod removal ratio was used as a judgment index for the first time and the effect of various active substances produced by the electro fenton anode and cathode on the removal of cod in benzene containing wastewater was analyzed the results revealed that the contribution rate of the active substances produced by the cathode for the cod removal is 63 21 among the active substances the contribution rate of oh which is the most important active substance is 58 86 the contribution rate of the anode is 36 79 the cod removal ratio of the system is considered the best when i 200 ma ph 3 and feso4 0 60 mg l which is estimated as 72 59 the contribution rate of oh which is produced by the cathode to the removal of cod is positively correlated with the total cod removal ratio these findings are of great significance that is only by improving the utilization rate of oh and reducing the ineffective consumption of oh the removal of cod can be promoted and the bottleneck problem of low electro fenton current efficiency can be solved graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords benzene floating cathode electro fenton cod active substances 1 introduction benzene is considered a typical aromatic volatile substance widely used in rubber synthetic fiber pesticides adhesives and plastic manufacturing the output and consumption of benzene are increasing annually with the development of petroleum and petrochemical industries 1 2 a large number of benzene containing wastewater from oil and gas exploration oil refineries printing leather and rubber manufacturing industries seriously pollute the ecosystem in addition due to the leakage of underground oil storage tanks and the terminal leakage of oil production wells and refineries a large amount of benzene containing wastewater is discharged 3 benzene poses a great threat to the health of humans and the us environmental protection agency has reported benzene as one of the top 100 chemicals in the list of priority hazardous substances 4 the exposure to benzene for a long term adversely affects the skin health respiratory and other senses and the central nervous system 5 therefore the treatment of benzene containing wastewater is imperative the electro fenton technology is considered a new fenton derivative system in the recent past researchers have used electro fenton technology for the treatment of benzene containing wastewater 6 7 in this method at first h2o2 is generated in situ at the cathode by using the oxygen reduction reaction orr reaction 1 8 next h2o2 reacts with fe2 in the system in order to generate fe3 and a hydroxyl radical oh with strong oxidizability reaction 2 9 thereafter h2o2 reacts with oh in the system to form ho2 reaction 3 10 then ho2 can further generate o2 reaction 4 simultaneously fe3 at the cathode undergoes a reduction reaction in order to generate fe2 reaction 5 this method has many advantages such as less secondary pollution low storage and transportation costs mild process conditions and easy operation 11 12 moreover due to the existence of the fe3 to fe2 conversion reaction reaction 5 in the electro fenton technology the iron sludge content of the electro fenton system is greatly reduced compared with the traditional fenton technology 1 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 4 ho 2 o 2 h 5 fe 3 e fe 2 current efficiency is an important parameter of the electro fenton technology however the current efficiency of the electro fenton system is not high which is also a bottleneck in restricting the further development of the electro fenton technology many researchers have begun to pay attention to current efficiency and trying to improve it by adjusting reaction conditions and other methods 13 14 but they have not analyzed the mechanism the purpose of the article is to study the effect of active substances and solve the problem of low current efficiency by analyzing the mechanism of the electro fenton reaction the analysis shows that the oxidizing substances h2o2 o2 oh and ho2 are generated by the electro fenton system and electrical energy is required for generating these oxidizing substances in this process electric energy is consumed but a large amount of substances with the weak oxidizing ability to pollutants is generated which inevitably leads to an ineffective consumption of a large amount of electric energy and reduces the current efficiency therefore by recognizing the behavior of the anode and various active substances and identifying the most critical active substances in the system the original reaction path can be regulated less electric energy can be consumed to generate more useful active substances and the current efficiency can be fundamentally improved some researchers have tried to use the active substances of the electro fenton system to degrade dyes and some typical pollutants 15 17 however these studies have directly used the concentration of pollutants on a judgmental basis the reduction of the pollutant concentration only indicates that the original structure of the pollutant is destroyed and it is likely transformed into other pollutants or other pollutants with smaller broken bonds however cod does not necessarily decrease which is considered the most important indicator for estimating whether sewage and wastewater can meet the discharge standards it is possible that the active substances that break the bonds of the pollutants and completely mineralize the pollutants may be different therefore it is not necessarily reasonable to directly measure the concentration of pollutants in order to estimate the active substances for degrading the pollutants considering the treatment of benzene containing wastewater as an example fig 1 shows possible degradation pathways of benzene the bond breaking process of benzene often forms intermediate products such as quinones phenols and maleic anhydride 18 19 it is easy to create secondary pollution from the water body as a variety of intermediate products are generated in the degradation process of benzene and are likely not completely mineralized into co2 and h2o the benzene containing wastewater has not been truly purified although the removal ratio of benzene has increased therefore only the bond breaking effect of benzene and the removal ratio of benzene cannot really assess the treatment effect of benzene containing wastewater moreover cod often indicates the degree of pollution of water bodies caused by organic matter 20 which is considered an important basis for whether sewage can meet the discharge standards therefore it is more important to identify the active substances that remove cod however there are almost no other parameters or research studies to measure the removal of cod by different active substances in this paper the behavior of the anode and various active substances in the system is studied during the cod removal process the changes in the removal of cod by the anode and the main active substances were estimated under the conditions of different current intensities ph values and fe ii concentrations in order to treat benzene containing wastewater this study adopted a floating cathode electro fenton system without bubbling oxygen into the solution so that the experimental error caused by benzene volatilization is greatly reduced the results reported the mechanism of the cod removal in benzene containing wastewater by using the floating cathode electro fenton system and the directional control reaction path and provided a theoretical basis for realizing the efficient use of the current efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials benzene tert butanol pyrogallic acid sodium tris sulfate na2so4 ferrous sulfate feso4 dilute sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from aladdin shanghai china all reagents used in the experiments were of the analytical grade 2 2 experimental method the experiment was performed in an electrolytic cell with dual reaction chambers separated by ion exchange membranes nafion 117 and the volume of a single reaction chamber was estimated as 100 ml a graphite felt 2 cm 2 cm cathode with a thickness of 0 5 cm was placed in one of the reaction chambers and floated above the liquid surface a 2 cm 2 cm mixed metal oxide mmo anode was placed in the other reaction chamber as the traditional electro fenton treatment process requires oxygen to be blown from the outside it causes serious volatilization of benzene in this study we adopted the floating cathode electro fenton system proposed by qiao et al 21 hence there is no need to blow in oxygen manually and the problem of benzene volatilization is resolved fig 2 shows a system comparison diagram of the traditional electro fenton system and the dual cell floating cathode electro fenton system the ph value of the solution was adjusted with naoh and diluted h2so4 before the initiation of the chemical reaction a ph meter phs 25 rex electric chemical instrument factory china was used to record the ph value of the solution electrodes were connected to the digital dc power supply ms1003d maisheng power supply co china with two modes of the constant current and voltage a desired amount of feso4 was added when the dc power supply was switched on a certain amount of na2so4 was dissolved in the solution in order to obtain the desired conductivity required for the electro fenton process when analyzing the anodizing effect a benzene solution with a concentration of 1000 mg l and an initial cod of 1236 mg l were prepared in advance 80 ml of the benzene solution was added to each reaction chamber and then the power supply was switched on in this process the samples were transferred in test tubes at 0 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min and the digestion instrument and the water quality detector were used for testing the cod drop 2 ml of the solution into the detection reagent and then digest it with a multifunctional fast digester for 30 min after standing at room temperature cod was measured with a water quality detector after each operation electrodes were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature in addition a 200 ml electrolytic cell with 150 ml of the benzene solution was selected when analyzing the removal effect of h2o2 on cod 10 mg l and 20 mg l h2o2 solutions were added respectively and 25 c was maintained during the reaction then the cod was tested at different time intervals respectively the tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 2 was used to prepare 1000 mg l of the benzene solution and then different concentrations of pyrogallol were added to it which was continuously decomposed in the tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 2 in order to produce o2 22 again the cod was tested at different time intervals and the cod removal effect of o2 was measured when studying the effect of oh and ho2 on the removal of cod 0 5 mol l of tert butanol was added to the system under the same working conditions 23 and then all oh were captured comparing the cod removal ability before and after adding tert butanol the cod removal abilities of oh and ho2 were analyzed after obtaining the floating cathode electro fenton system anode and various active materials for the removal of cod and the contribution rate of benzene containing wastewater change the current ph and fe ii concentration and the digestion instrument and the water quality detector were used to analyze the cod removal effect of each part and the change of the contribution rate in a similar manner 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of active substances in removing cod from benzene containing wastewater by using the floating cathode electro fenton system 3 1 1 removal mechanism of cod in benzene containing wastewater by using the electro fenton cathode active substances such as h2o2 o2 oh and ho2 can be generated by the electro fenton cathode the following experimental analysis is carried out to determine the effect of different active substances on the removal of cod from benzene containing wastewater h2o2 at concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l were used to directly react with 1000 mg l of benzene and kept at a constant temperature to measure the effect of h2o2 during the electro fenton process these two concentrations of h2o2 simulate the common concentration of h2o2 in the system for producing other oxidizing substances no catalyst was added to prevent the decomposition of h2o2 fig 3a shows the corresponding results fig 3a demonstrates that two different concentrations of h2o2 have no effect on the cod removal in benzene containing wastewater which shows that h2o2 does not have the ability to directly remove cod in the system we used biphenyltriol to generate o2 in the tris hcl weakly alkaline buffer system in order to analyze the effect of o2 on cod removal 24 which has proven to be a stable and reliable method for providing o2 fig 3b illustrates that the cod of the system is almost unchanged within 60 min when only pyrogallol is added pyrogallol decomposed to produce a large amount of o2 after adding the buffer solution and cod showed no obvious removal effect after 60 min under different concentration conditions which indicates that o2 has almost no ability to remove cod from benzene containing wastewater in addition recent studies have proved that ho2 has a certain ability to oxidize and degrade pollutants 25 27 however the effect of ho2 on the removal of cod is rarely studied excess tert butanol was added under the conditions of an initial benzene concentration of 1000 mg l and i 200 ma to capture all oh in order to analyze the effect of ho2 on the removal of cod in benzene containing wastewater by investigating the change of cod removal with the addition of tert butanol in the system the effect of ho2 is reflected the addition of tert butanol to capture oh reflects the removal of cod by ho2 as shown in fig 3c after 60 min the cod removal ratio is 3 15 which indicates a contribution rate of 4 35 3 15 72 59 100 oh is considered an important active substance in the electro fenton system and plays a vital role in the process of pollutant degradation and cod removal according to the above mentioned experimental research we have obtained the removal ratio and the contribution rate of other active substances and anode in the floating cathode electro fenton system except oh to cod in benzene containing wastewater therefore the remaining removal capacity is determined from oh fig 3d shows the analysis of the removal ratio of various active substances and anodes to cod and their respective contribution rates of the floating cathode electro fenton system after 60 min 3 1 2 removal mechanism of cod in benzene containing wastewater by using the electro fenton anode fig 4 shows the results of the floating cathode electro fenton system and the anode to remove cod from benzene containing wastewater the anode cod removal ratio was 26 71 after 60 min and for the entire floating cathode electro fenton system the cod removal ratio reached 72 59 after 60 min hence the contribution rate of the cod removal by the anode was 36 79 26 71 72 59 100 which shows that the cod removal capacity of the electrochemical system mainly depends on the active substances produced by the electro fenton cathode the effect of removing cod by the anode is also very important because the reaction of pollutants on the anode can be divided into the following processes 1 the formation of adsorbed active substances the water on the anode surface can be oxidized into adsorbed hydroxyl radical mox oh with a high redox potential reaction 6 28 2 the removal of cod these mox oh usually react non selectively with pollutants at a certain rate if the anode electrode is very active its ability to produce mox oh on the surface is enhanced which can thus form more oxidizing oxides or superoxides mo reaction 7 in order to further improve ability of cod removal anodic oxidation also plays a significant role 6 mo x h 2 o mo x oh h e 7 mo x oh mo h e 3 2 the influence of main reaction conditions on the formation of anode and cathode active substances and the removal of cod in the floating cathode electro fenton system the current intensity ph and fe ii concentration are three important parameters they play a significant role in the generation of active substances in the electro fenton system the stability of anode and cathode materials and the mass transfer rate of pollutants in order to study the influence of main reaction conditions on the anode and various active materials in the removal and contribution rate of cod from benzene containing wastewater in this paper a double reaction chamber electrolyzer separated by ion exchange membranes was used as a reactor 3 2 1 effect of the current intensity the current intensity is considered substantially important in the floating cathode electro fenton system under different current intensity conditions the changes in the cod removal ratio of benzene containing wastewater are shown in fig 5a the contribution rate of the anode and active substances produced by the cathode to cod removal is shown in fig 5b fig 5a illustrates that the current intensity has a significant effect on the removal of cod in the system first the removal effect of cod increases with the current and then it weakens with the current the cod removal ratio is positively correlated with the current intensity in the range of 100 200 ma and 200 ma is considered the best current intensity however the cod removal effect will be weakened once the current is too high in the production of h2o2 the current intensity plays an important role reaction 1 29 the increase in h2o2 improves the activity of the fenton reaction and provides more oh which is necessary for cod removal reaction 2 however the production of h2o2 in the system decreases instead when the current is too high 30 and h2o2 is decomposed in a variety of ways 31 which is not found conducive for the generation of oh in addition the excessive current accelerates the blockage of the pores of the floating cathode and reduces the performance of the cathode 32 which results in a poor cod removal effect in addition the pollutant mass transfer speed increases and the electron transfer between the electrode surface and the pollutant speeds up as the current increases the surface of the anode produces more physically adsorbed oh 27 which effectively destroys the complex morphology of organic matter and realizes the efficient removal of cod however the anode is extremely vulnerable to damage once the current continues to increase thus resulting in weakened oxidation in this process excessive electrons are consumed in side reactions 33 which inhibits the removal of cod by the active substances and reduces the current efficiency fig 5b demonstrates that the contribution rate of the anode oh and ho2 to the cod removal is also different in the floating cathode electro fenton system under different current intensities the contribution rate of oh is found to be the variation trend of the total cod removal rate of the system the higher the contribution rate of oh is the higher the total cod removal rate of the system would be which indicates that oh plays a decisive role in the removal of cod in the system under different current intensities the oh contribution rate of the system is the highest and the cod removal effect is the best when the optimal current intensity is 200 ma 3 2 2 effect of the ph under different ph conditions the effect of electro fenton treatment is significantly different this paper studies the cod removal effect of benzene containing wastewater under different ph conditions as shown in fig 6a fig 6b shows the contribution rate of the anode and active substances produced by the cathode in the cod removal fig 6a shows that the cod removal effect is the best when ph 3 because the dissolved oxygen in the system is easier to convert into h2o2 when ph 3 and there are sufficient protons in the system the available protons of h2o2 promote the two electron reaction reaction 1 of the electro fenton process 34 36 the increase in h2o2 improves the production of oh in the system and oh shows the highest oxidation potential 2 85 v under acidic conditions 37 which exhibits the best cod removal effect in addition the iron in the system mainly exists in the form of fe2 when ph 3 which does not form a large amount of iron precipitation 38 but promotes the generation of oh and improves the cod removal effect fig 6b illustrates that the cod removal contribution rate significantly varies under different acid base conditions when the solution changes from acidic to alkaline the contribution rate of oh gradually decreases the contribution rate of ho2 basically remains unchanged and the contribution rate of anode increases accordingly the contribution rate of oh is the highest when the ph is 3 this is attributed to the dissociation of oh when the solution is alkaline reaction 8 39 thus resulting in a decrease in the quantity of oh and the redox potential of oh significantly decreases with an increase in the ph value 40 thus resulting in a decrease in oh consequently the cod removal ability decreases and the contribution rate also decreases 8 oh o h when the ph value of the solution is 3 the oxidation reduction potential of oh is the highest the quantity is the highest and the cod removal ability is the strongest consequently the cod removal contribution rate of oh is the highest and the cod removal effect is the best 3 2 3 effect of the fe ii concentration fe ii plays a key role in the floating cathode electro fenton system it generates fe3 and oh by reaction 2 fig 7a reveals the effect of different fe ii concentrations on the cod removal from benzene containing wastewater fig 7b shows an analysis of the contribution rate of anode and active substances produced by the cathode to the cod removal fig 7a shows that too high or too low concentration of fe ii weakens the removal of cod because fe ii has the ability to catalyze the formation of oh from h2o2 when the fe ii concentration is low the amount of oh produced by the cathode is too low thus resulting in a weak cod removal effect and when the concentration of fe ii is too high excessive fe ii induces side reactions thus causing oh to be invalid consumption reaction 9 some researchers reported that as the reaction progresses the excessive iron salt reduces the oxygen transfer capacity and the performance of the floating cathode 30 9 fe 2 oh fe 3 oh when the concentration of fe ii is too high the excess fe ii reacts with the physically adsorbed oh generated at the anode reaction 7 which is not conducive to the removal of cod fig 7b shows that the concentration of fe ii exhibits little effect on the cod removal contribution rate of the anode and active substances produced by the cathode it can be analyzed in combination with fig 7a that when the fe ii concentration is 60 mg l the contribution rate of oh to the cod removal is the highest and the cod removal effect is the best 4 conclusions this study explores the main active substances for cod removal in the process of benzene containing wastewater treatment by using the floating cathode electro fenton system the results show that the active substances produced by the cathode contribute 63 21 to the removal of cod among them oh which is the most important active substance in the system shows the strongest cod removal effect with a contribution rate of 58 86 however ho2 shows a certain cod removal ability with a contribution rate of 4 35 the anode also achieves the cod removal by producing oh with a contribution rate of 36 79 however oh produced by the anode exists in the form of adsorbed hydroxyl radical mox oh and h2o2 and o2 have little contribution to the removal of cod in the system the cod removal ratio and the contribution rate of various effects to the removal of cod were analyzed under different current intensities ph values and fe ii concentrations the result shows that the cod removal effect of the system is the best and the removal ratio reaches 72 59 when i 200 ma ph 3 and feso4 0 60 mg l the contribution rate of oh to the removal of cod is found to be proportional to the removal ratio of cod finally the results of the study confirm the removal mechanism of the floating cathode electro fenton system for cod in benzene containing wastewater and the direction of reaction path regulation

13111,the h2o2 o2 oh and ho2 generated by the anode and cathode are considered the possible sources of the oxidizing power of the electro fenton system for improving the current efficiency the assessment of the degradability of anode and various active substances to pollutants is an important prerequisite the cod removal ratio was used as a judgment index for the first time and the effect of various active substances produced by the electro fenton anode and cathode on the removal of cod in benzene containing wastewater was analyzed the results revealed that the contribution rate of the active substances produced by the cathode for the cod removal is 63 21 among the active substances the contribution rate of oh which is the most important active substance is 58 86 the contribution rate of the anode is 36 79 the cod removal ratio of the system is considered the best when i 200 ma ph 3 and feso4 0 60 mg l which is estimated as 72 59 the contribution rate of oh which is produced by the cathode to the removal of cod is positively correlated with the total cod removal ratio these findings are of great significance that is only by improving the utilization rate of oh and reducing the ineffective consumption of oh the removal of cod can be promoted and the bottleneck problem of low electro fenton current efficiency can be solved graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords benzene floating cathode electro fenton cod active substances 1 introduction benzene is considered a typical aromatic volatile substance widely used in rubber synthetic fiber pesticides adhesives and plastic manufacturing the output and consumption of benzene are increasing annually with the development of petroleum and petrochemical industries 1 2 a large number of benzene containing wastewater from oil and gas exploration oil refineries printing leather and rubber manufacturing industries seriously pollute the ecosystem in addition due to the leakage of underground oil storage tanks and the terminal leakage of oil production wells and refineries a large amount of benzene containing wastewater is discharged 3 benzene poses a great threat to the health of humans and the us environmental protection agency has reported benzene as one of the top 100 chemicals in the list of priority hazardous substances 4 the exposure to benzene for a long term adversely affects the skin health respiratory and other senses and the central nervous system 5 therefore the treatment of benzene containing wastewater is imperative the electro fenton technology is considered a new fenton derivative system in the recent past researchers have used electro fenton technology for the treatment of benzene containing wastewater 6 7 in this method at first h2o2 is generated in situ at the cathode by using the oxygen reduction reaction orr reaction 1 8 next h2o2 reacts with fe2 in the system in order to generate fe3 and a hydroxyl radical oh with strong oxidizability reaction 2 9 thereafter h2o2 reacts with oh in the system to form ho2 reaction 3 10 then ho2 can further generate o2 reaction 4 simultaneously fe3 at the cathode undergoes a reduction reaction in order to generate fe2 reaction 5 this method has many advantages such as less secondary pollution low storage and transportation costs mild process conditions and easy operation 11 12 moreover due to the existence of the fe3 to fe2 conversion reaction reaction 5 in the electro fenton technology the iron sludge content of the electro fenton system is greatly reduced compared with the traditional fenton technology 1 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 4 ho 2 o 2 h 5 fe 3 e fe 2 current efficiency is an important parameter of the electro fenton technology however the current efficiency of the electro fenton system is not high which is also a bottleneck in restricting the further development of the electro fenton technology many researchers have begun to pay attention to current efficiency and trying to improve it by adjusting reaction conditions and other methods 13 14 but they have not analyzed the mechanism the purpose of the article is to study the effect of active substances and solve the problem of low current efficiency by analyzing the mechanism of the electro fenton reaction the analysis shows that the oxidizing substances h2o2 o2 oh and ho2 are generated by the electro fenton system and electrical energy is required for generating these oxidizing substances in this process electric energy is consumed but a large amount of substances with the weak oxidizing ability to pollutants is generated which inevitably leads to an ineffective consumption of a large amount of electric energy and reduces the current efficiency therefore by recognizing the behavior of the anode and various active substances and identifying the most critical active substances in the system the original reaction path can be regulated less electric energy can be consumed to generate more useful active substances and the current efficiency can be fundamentally improved some researchers have tried to use the active substances of the electro fenton system to degrade dyes and some typical pollutants 15 17 however these studies have directly used the concentration of pollutants on a judgmental basis the reduction of the pollutant concentration only indicates that the original structure of the pollutant is destroyed and it is likely transformed into other pollutants or other pollutants with smaller broken bonds however cod does not necessarily decrease which is considered the most important indicator for estimating whether sewage and wastewater can meet the discharge standards it is possible that the active substances that break the bonds of the pollutants and completely mineralize the pollutants may be different therefore it is not necessarily reasonable to directly measure the concentration of pollutants in order to estimate the active substances for degrading the pollutants considering the treatment of benzene containing wastewater as an example fig 1 shows possible degradation pathways of benzene the bond breaking process of benzene often forms intermediate products such as quinones phenols and maleic anhydride 18 19 it is easy to create secondary pollution from the water body as a variety of intermediate products are generated in the degradation process of benzene and are likely not completely mineralized into co2 and h2o the benzene containing wastewater has not been truly purified although the removal ratio of benzene has increased therefore only the bond breaking effect of benzene and the removal ratio of benzene cannot really assess the treatment effect of benzene containing wastewater moreover cod often indicates the degree of pollution of water bodies caused by organic matter 20 which is considered an important basis for whether sewage can meet the discharge standards therefore it is more important to identify the active substances that remove cod however there are almost no other parameters or research studies to measure the removal of cod by different active substances in this paper the behavior of the anode and various active substances in the system is studied during the cod removal process the changes in the removal of cod by the anode and the main active substances were estimated under the conditions of different current intensities ph values and fe ii concentrations in order to treat benzene containing wastewater this study adopted a floating cathode electro fenton system without bubbling oxygen into the solution so that the experimental error caused by benzene volatilization is greatly reduced the results reported the mechanism of the cod removal in benzene containing wastewater by using the floating cathode electro fenton system and the directional control reaction path and provided a theoretical basis for realizing the efficient use of the current efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials benzene tert butanol pyrogallic acid sodium tris sulfate na2so4 ferrous sulfate feso4 dilute sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from aladdin shanghai china all reagents used in the experiments were of the analytical grade 2 2 experimental method the experiment was performed in an electrolytic cell with dual reaction chambers separated by ion exchange membranes nafion 117 and the volume of a single reaction chamber was estimated as 100 ml a graphite felt 2 cm 2 cm cathode with a thickness of 0 5 cm was placed in one of the reaction chambers and floated above the liquid surface a 2 cm 2 cm mixed metal oxide mmo anode was placed in the other reaction chamber as the traditional electro fenton treatment process requires oxygen to be blown from the outside it causes serious volatilization of benzene in this study we adopted the floating cathode electro fenton system proposed by qiao et al 21 hence there is no need to blow in oxygen manually and the problem of benzene volatilization is resolved fig 2 shows a system comparison diagram of the traditional electro fenton system and the dual cell floating cathode electro fenton system the ph value of the solution was adjusted with naoh and diluted h2so4 before the initiation of the chemical reaction a ph meter phs 25 rex electric chemical instrument factory china was used to record the ph value of the solution electrodes were connected to the digital dc power supply ms1003d maisheng power supply co china with two modes of the constant current and voltage a desired amount of feso4 was added when the dc power supply was switched on a certain amount of na2so4 was dissolved in the solution in order to obtain the desired conductivity required for the electro fenton process when analyzing the anodizing effect a benzene solution with a concentration of 1000 mg l and an initial cod of 1236 mg l were prepared in advance 80 ml of the benzene solution was added to each reaction chamber and then the power supply was switched on in this process the samples were transferred in test tubes at 0 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min and the digestion instrument and the water quality detector were used for testing the cod drop 2 ml of the solution into the detection reagent and then digest it with a multifunctional fast digester for 30 min after standing at room temperature cod was measured with a water quality detector after each operation electrodes were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature in addition a 200 ml electrolytic cell with 150 ml of the benzene solution was selected when analyzing the removal effect of h2o2 on cod 10 mg l and 20 mg l h2o2 solutions were added respectively and 25 c was maintained during the reaction then the cod was tested at different time intervals respectively the tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 2 was used to prepare 1000 mg l of the benzene solution and then different concentrations of pyrogallol were added to it which was continuously decomposed in the tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 2 in order to produce o2 22 again the cod was tested at different time intervals and the cod removal effect of o2 was measured when studying the effect of oh and ho2 on the removal of cod 0 5 mol l of tert butanol was added to the system under the same working conditions 23 and then all oh were captured comparing the cod removal ability before and after adding tert butanol the cod removal abilities of oh and ho2 were analyzed after obtaining the floating cathode electro fenton system anode and various active materials for the removal of cod and the contribution rate of benzene containing wastewater change the current ph and fe ii concentration and the digestion instrument and the water quality detector were used to analyze the cod removal effect of each part and the change of the contribution rate in a similar manner 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of active substances in

pyrogallol is added pyrogallol decomposed to produce a large amount of o2 after adding the buffer solution and cod showed no obvious removal effect after 60 min under different concentration conditions which indicates that o2 has almost no ability to remove cod from benzene containing wastewater in addition recent studies have proved that ho2 has a certain ability to oxidize and degrade

the effect of ho2 is reflected the addition of tert butanol to capture oh reflects the removal of cod by ho2 as shown in fig 3c after 60 min the cod removal ratio is 3 15 which indicates a contribution rate of 4 35 3 15 72 59 100 oh is considered an important active substance in the electro fenton system and plays a vital role in the process of pollutant degradation and cod removal according to the above mentioned experimental research we have obtained the removal ratio and the contribution rate of other active substances and anode in the floating cathode electro fenton system except oh to cod in benzene containing wastewater therefore the remaining removal capacity is determined from oh fig 3d shows the analysis of the removal ratio of various active substances and anodes to cod and their respective contribution rates of the floating cathode electro fenton system after 60 min 3 1 2 removal mechanism of cod in benzene containing wastewater by using the electro fenton anode fig 4 shows the results of the floating cathode electro fenton system and the anode to remove cod from benzene containing wastewater the anode cod removal ratio was 26 71 after 60 min and for the entire floating cathode electro fenton system the cod removal ratio reached 72 59 after 60 min hence the contribution rate of the cod removal by the anode was 36 79 26 71 72 59 100 which shows that the cod removal capacity of the electrochemical system mainly depends on the active substances produced by the electro fenton cathode the effect of removing cod by the anode is also very

changes in the cod removal ratio of benzene containing wastewater are shown in fig 5a the contribution rate of the anode and active substances produced by the cathode to cod removal is shown in fig 5b fig 5a illustrates that the current intensity has a significant effect on the removal of cod in the system first the removal effect of cod increases with the current and then it weakens with the current the cod removal ratio is positively correlated with the current intensity in the range of 100 200 ma and 200 ma is considered the best current intensity however the cod removal effect will be weakened once the current is too high in the production of h2o2 the current intensity plays an important role reaction 1 29 the increase in h2o2 improves the activity of the fenton reaction and provides more oh which is necessary for cod removal reaction 2 however the production of h2o2 in the system decreases instead when the current is too high 30 and h2o2 is decomposed in a variety of

intensities the oh contribution rate of the system is the highest and the cod removal effect is the best when the optimal current intensity is 200 ma 3 2 2 effect of the ph under different ph conditions the effect of electro fenton treatment is significantly different this paper studies the cod removal effect of benzene containing wastewater under different ph conditions as shown in fig 6a fig 6b shows the contribution rate of the anode and active substances produced by the cathode in the cod removal fig 6a shows that the cod removal effect is the best when ph 3 because the dissolved

fig 7a reveals the effect of different fe ii concentrations on the cod removal from benzene containing wastewater fig 7b shows an analysis of the contribution rate of anode and active substances produced by the cathode to the cod removal fig 7a shows that too high or too low concentration of fe ii weakens the removal of cod because fe ii has the ability to catalyze the formation of oh from h2o2 when the fe ii concentration is low the amount of oh produced by the cathode is too low thus resulting in a weak cod removal effect and when the concentration of fe ii is too high excessive fe ii

is not conducive to the removal of cod fig 7b shows that the concentration of fe ii exhibits little effect on the cod removal contribution rate of the anode and active substances produced by the cathode it can be analyzed in combination with fig 7a that when the fe ii concentration is 60 mg l the contribution rate of oh to the cod removal is the highest and the cod removal effect is the best 4 conclusions this study explores the main active substances for cod removal in the process of benzene containing wastewater treatment by using the floating cathode electro fenton system the results show that the active substances produced by the cathode contribute 63 21 to the removal of cod among them oh which is the most important active substance in the system shows the strongest cod removal

13112,temperature plays a critical role in turbidity removal by coagulation a widely used method for removing suspended charged particles this study therefore examines the effect of temperature on turbidity removal through the coagulation process streaming potential sp was measured during the experiment at different temperatures in combination with other parameters such as ph hydraulic conditions and sludge recirculation and coagulation flocculation efficiencies were evaluated in terms of turbidity removal results show lower sp at lower ph ph 7 and lower temperature 20 c conditions whereas higher sp at higher ph and higher temperatures thus the adequate coagulant doses to neutralise the charged particles are proportional to the ph and temperature results also exhibit that the turbidity removal efficiency is significantly affected by temperature turbidity removal efficiency after 10 min of sedimentation time at ph 7 was calculated to be 83 at 2 c and reduced to 78 at 40 c that is also affected by the solubility of the inorganic coagulant used sludge recirculation was observed to be an effective method of improving turbidity reduction under all the conditions investigated and the amount of reuse sludge was found to be temperature dependent graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords temperature streaming potential coagulation turbidity sludge reuse 1 introduction turbidity is problematic in drinking water treatment processes causing issues such as high chemical demand in the coagulation process 1 head loss in sand filters 2 and membrane fouling 3 natural organic matter nom and clay particles are contributors to turbidity in most drinking water sources 4 nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds that vary from high to low molecular weight hydrophilic to hydrophobic with aliphatic to aromatic structures it nom is a mixture of humic and fulvic acids tannins proteins amines hydrocarbons sugars and many more the chemicals have their molecular weight ranging from less than 100 da to more than 10 000 da 5 nom can add color as well as introduce odour and taste in water 5 6 although there are usually no health effects caused directly by nom it can provide food and shelter to pathogens it is the major contributor to the formation of disinfection by products dbps dbps are formed during the disinfection process when nom is present in the water 5 the other components that generate turbidity in drinking water sources are clay and mineral particles with charged surfaces that stay dispersed in solution and are hard to settle by gravity 7 microorganisms are often associated with these particles in water which means turbidity removal can be a surrogate measurement of the removal of microorganisms 8 the coagulation flocculation sedimentation cfs process is widely used as a pre treatment method in water treatment plants and has been proven effective in removing turbidity from source water 9 11 nom and the other colloids are generally negatively charged whilst the coagulants are usually ionic metal oxide hydroxide upon addition in water the coagulants neutralise the surface charges of nom that allow flocs to form however many factors involved in cfs processes are site specific including temperature ph turbidity nom composition and coagulant type 12 ph plays a significant role in coagulation as it changes the surface charge of suspended colloids which can have a large impact on coagulant use and dose 13 14 metal ion speciation is also dependent on ph which can influence the behaviour and efficiency of metal ion coagulants 15 most importantly the solubility of metal ions depends on the temperature liu et al 16 reported that iron iii hydroxides solubility increases as temperature decreases from 25 c to 5 c further the solubilities are higher at lower temperatures and low ph there is a large volume of published studies describing the role of the solubility of inorganic species in the presence of organic compounds 17 18 kuma et al 19 have reported that the organic substances increase the solubility of iron iii hydroxides up to 32 65 at ph 8 1 in the form of fe iii organic complexes coagulant aids can also be used to affect coagulation efficiency conventional coagulant aids include activated silica sodium alginates soluble starch products and chitosan 20 some of these have positively charged sites to neutralise negatively charged surfaces and can adsorb particle surfaces 21 coagulation is often more effective in high turbidity water 100 ntu than in lower turbidity water 5 10 ntu because of higher collision frequencies increased van der waals attractions and faster aggregation 22 24 it is assumed that recirculating the sludge increases turbidity and hence can enhance coagulation process 25 whilst the factors mentioned above have been the subject of many investigations in the past a little attention has been paid on how temperature impacts the overall cfs process past studies of suspended colloids and adsorption processes reported that temperature change can alter surface charge flocculation the extent of adsorption floc settling viscosity and collision frequency whilst all of these mechanisms can affect water treatment efficiency role of temperature should be investigated meticulously 26 27 the literature available on coagulation under low temperature conditions 4 c to 17 c reveals that coagulation is less efficient 28 given that natural water conditions temperatures can change seasonally and regionally by up to around 40 c it is remarkable that enough work has not been done in this area this study investigates the impacts of temperature on the efficiency of a cfs process and attempts to optimise and compare requirements for coagulant dose ph and mixing conditions for turbidity removal over a range of temperature conditions moreover sludge recirculation and its influence in the coagulation process is investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical preparation reagent grade chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich australia ferric chloride fecl3 97 and non ionic polyacrylamide pam m w 5 6 103 da were used as coagulants fecl3 was dissolved in 400 ml of milli q mq water to produce a 0 25 dosing solution the organic coagulant pam was dissolved in mq water using a magnetic stirrer humic acid sodium salt ha was used as a model compound for nom and the two clays used were kaolinite anhydrous cec 13 5 meq 100 g 29 and bentonite fine powder cec 86 4 meq 100 g 29 2 2 experiments for effects of temperature coagulation efficiency was measured using synthetic water samples with initial ha concentration of 5 mg l the water samples were prepared using mq water and the ph values were adjusted from 5 to 9 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions a jar test was used to simulate the coagulation and flocculation processes 30 water samples were prepared and transferred to 1 l jars and the jars were placed in a thermoplastic container 1 cm thick to maintain a constant temperature in this study the temperatures tested were 2 c 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c pre cooled water samples at 2 c and 10 c were used for the low temperature jar and coagulation tests the endpoint of coagulation was determined using the streaming potential of the suspensions a laboratory charge analyser lca chemtrac systems inc model no lca3 serial no lca319l032 was used to measure the streaming potential whilst adding coagulants and polyelectrolytes the streaming potential sp can be compared directly to the electrokinetic potential using eq 1 31 32 1 u str p ε rs ε 0 ζ η k l where ustr streaming potential v δp the pressure difference pa εrs the relative permittivity of the electrolyte solution dimensionless ε0 the electric permittivity of vacuum fm 1 ζ is the electrokinetic potential v η is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid kgm 1 s 1 kl is the specific conductivity sm 1 32 after adding coagulants the velocity gradient g was set at 20 5 s 1 40 rpm for 10 min for the flocculation process then the mixing paddles were removed and a 10 min settling period was allowed 2 3 sludge recirculating experiments sludge recycle experiments fig 1 were conducted using pre settled sludge synthetic water was coagulated and sludge was separated and then stored in centrifuge tubes the lowest sludge volume was observed from the first experiment series and the sludge recycles experiments were conducted with the sludge volume dosage of 1 to 10 ml 2 4 analysis after flocculation the supernatant was taken out every minute using a pipet and placed in a cuvette for the turbidity analysis a turbidity logger sensor nlu 231 was used to measure water turbidity the sample ph was measured using a laqua benchtop ph probe which was calibrated with standard ph buffers each time before use 2 5 statistical analysis turbidity removal performances under different conditions were examined and results are presented as mean standard deviation t test was performed to understand the significance of the changes in coagulant dose and turbidity removal with temperature changes ms excel 365 and orignpro 2019 academic software were used for the statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 choosing a coagulant aid bentonite and kaolinite the presence of a coagulant aid provides an additional mechanism for nom to interact with surfaces and hence increases the tendency to remove the nom from suspension this study investigated bentonite and kaolinite clays as possible coagulant aids and are often used in water treatment settings bentonite clays are swelling clays with relatively high cation exchange capacity cec hence having a higher surface charge and higher surface area compared to the non swelling kaolinite fig 2 indeed fig 2a shows that much higher doses of cationic coagulant are required to neutralise surface charge in the bentonite systems compared to kaolinite at the same mass fig 2b shows the settling times after the suspensions were titrated to zero sp kaolinite systems tended to settle more rapidly than bentonite and hence for this system kaolinite was the better choice for more efficient turbidity reduction whilst both clays visually produced floc structures in suspension the bentonite structures were larger and more gelatinous in appearance whilst the kaolinite flocs were smaller but clearly denser and probably the reason the kaolinite flocs settled faster the differing floc structures are likely linked to the higher surface charge and increased counter ion concentration at bentonites surfaces which will play a significant role in the surface interaction with nom overall fig 2 shows that kaolinite is the better flocculant aid in this system because of a a lower requirement of ionic flocculant to reach zero sp where optimum flocculation occurs and b the faster settling rate of kaolinite flocs over the bentonite systems whilst the conclusion that kaolinite is the better flocculant aid this is unlikely to be a general conclusion for all possible water compositions in the real world however it is helpful in this study to identify a system that can monitor the impact of temperature then 3 2 estimating hydraulic conditions for flocculation hydraulic conditions play an essential role in flocculation we investigated slow mixing conditions and measured the final turbidity after 10 min of settling time the variation of turbidity over time are shown in fig 3 the final total turbidity reduction increased as the pre settling mixing rate increased from 7 2 s 1 to 47 5 s 1 very slow mixing g 7 2 s 1 and 13 3 s 1 conditions lead to less settling of flocs compared to that achieved when the velocity gradient was above 20 5 s 1 floc growth involves the initial aggregation of smaller particles followed by a series of coagulation and breakage events until a steady state is reached where flocs maintain a roughly similar size and character interparticle collision at the initial aggregation phase is important because higher collision energies can overcome repulsive forces preventing coagulation 33 as flocs grow and become larger the collision frequency of large floc and small particles is reduced further floc growth is restricted by fluid shear and floc breakage can occur fluid shear and floc morphology control the character of the steady state floc size distribution 33 faster mixing increases fluid shear and so mixing speed is an important parameter in floc formation and character fig 3 shows that sedimentation increased as mixing velocity increased because high of more frequent and higher energy particle collisions created denser flocs that settled better floc formation is slower under slower mixing conditions with less dense and more open floc structures that settle more slowly the data in fig 3 suggests that 40 rpm is optimal in our systems and little improvement is obtained at higher shear rates whilst lower shear conditions produce floc structures that settle less efficiently 3 3 temperature effects for the streaming potential coagulant dose and residual turbidity because coagulation is highly dependent on the charge of the nom surfaces and other additives any variable that can alter the charge can also impact coagulation ph is well known to have a dramatic impact on coagulation because of the potential to alter the charge of the dissolved and suspended species present in general flocculation is favoured when nom is less ionised because it is less water soluble when a greater proportion of the function groups are neutral 5 34 temperature can also influence charge and species tend to become more ionised as both soluble and surfaces become more charged at higher temperatures 35 36 that can impact the required coagulant dosage and the efficiency of floc formation moreover bulk properties such as viscosity diffusivities electric conductivity and permittivity are also temperature dependent laboratory charge analyser lca consists of two electrodes placed at either end of a teflon coated cylinder and piston and through which a known pressure difference can be applied teflon generally carries a negative charge in aqueous environments and so an electric double layer is formed at the teflon surface the movement of the piston causes a flow of charged particles creating a streaming current sc between the electrodes the magnitude of the electrical current varies with fluid velocity and charge density 37 the fluid velocity is constant if the lca s piston moves consistently so the charge density is the variable factor proportional to the magnitude of the zeta potential charge density increases as temperature decreases which could increase the sc however εrs ε0 decrease and η increase correspondingly 38 humic substances in the solution also influence the variation of sc the dissolution kinetics of humic acid particles also influence the sc because the dissolution rate of humic acid increases as temperature increases 39 the ionic product of water kw depends on the temperature and thus the changes of kw might influence the sc fig 4a shows how increasing the temperature impacts the sp which is an indirect measure of charge a more negative value of the sp at higher temperatures indicates an increasing negative charge on the species present a modest increase in temperature of around 10 c will require an increased dose of fe counterions to bring the zero sp conditions for optimal flocculation the experimental data in fig 4b shows that as both ph and temperature increase then higher doses of coagulant are required t test was performed for two independent means to identify the significance of data at different temperature conditions the t value of the coagulant doses at 2 c and 40 c ph 7 is estimated to be 6 22218 then the p value is calculated to be 0 000049 therefore the result is significant at p 05 at low ph 2 to 5 the solubilities of fe species are higher at lower temperatures 16 whilst the temperature rises the dominant species varies as fe3 fe oh 2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 fe oh 4 eqs 2 5 16 17 2 fe 3 h 2 o fe oh 2 h 3 fe 3 2 h 2 o fe oh 2 2 h 4 fe 3 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 5 fe 3 4 h 2 o fe oh 4 4 h therefore charge neutralisation is the dominant mechanism at lower ph and lower temperatures as a result turbidity removal efficiency is higher in comparison adoption plays a significant role at higher ph and higher temperatures and needs more fe coagulants resulting in lower turbidity removal efficiencies turbidity removal efficiency is also temperature dependent as shown in fig 4c as temperature increases viscosity decreases and settling is faster over the temperature range 2 to 30 c the result at 40 c is interesting but consistent at all ph values and suggests that different floc structures and or additional particles are present at 40 c the average floc is larger and more buoyant an effect that has been noted previously 40 41 that may also result from the higher concentrations of ferric ions added to overcome the negative charge at this higher temperature fig 4b and the higher ionic strength is altering the character of flocs and floc formation or even resulting in the formation of other colloidal species such as amorphous iron oxides oxyhydroxides certainly as ph increases surface charge increases and thus required coagulant dose increases above ph 7 9 the hydrolysis species of fe iii is precipitated as hydroxides and even if they have the ability to interact with nom and kaolinite they increase the total turbidity and therefore turbidity removal efficiency decreases fig 4c clearly demonstrates that even narrow temperature changes can bring significant changes in the behaviour of the coagulation system the turbidity removal is significant when the temperature rises from 2 c to 40 c estimated t value is 3 22592 p value is 0 006065 p 0 05 3 4 turbidity reduction with temperature and ph changes several reports have shown that floc settling is temperature dependent 42 44 at low temperatures the coagulation process is slow thus flocculation decreases because particle aggregation follows the arrhenius law 44 and was studied examined and explained by xiao et al 44 by plotting the aggregation constant with variable temperature according to eq 2 6 ln k lna e a r t where k is an aggregation constant min 1 a is a pre exponential factor e a is the activation energy kj mol t is the thermodynamic temperature k and r is the gas constant 8 315 j mol k eq 6 states thermodynamic reaction behaviours and predicts that a decrease in temperature will reduce the proportion of particles activated to overcome repulsive forces to aggregate thus reducing the overall aggregation rate in this study however floc settling reduced at 40 c fig 5 indicating some other factors involved with the flocculation process are altered at higher temperatures as mentioned earlier this change in behaviour at 40 c is likely because of increased concentration of added ferric ions to initiate flocculation and hence changed solution conditions which caused precipitation or formation of other smaller colloids because of the higher ionic strength at 40 c polymer adsorption is also temperature dependant and temperature influenced conformational changes in the pam can alter floc character and settling an increase of negative charge at the kaolinite and ha particle surfaces at higher temperature may also contribute to a decrease polymer bridging and flocculation performance 45 leaving smaller flocs and reduced settling 3 5 turbidity reduction with sludge reuse and effects of temperature reutilisation of sludge allows for maintinance of suspension conditions that are favourable for continuing floc formation and hence create more efficient overall nom removal in this study sludge reuse volumes tested were 5 ml l and 10 ml l which was pre sludge for an hour and separated from the jar and stored in centrifuge tubes the sludge samples were shaken before use and the volume was measured using a 10 ml pipette no sp changes were noted when sludge was added to the water sample and so no extra coagulant was required because the introduced sludge carried little excess charge the pre settled sludge enhanced the floc settling because of physical adsorption and sweep flocculation by hydroxide precipitates and improved collision frequencies the particle s collision frequency is explained by eq 7 43 7 n 12 πβ n 2 d 3 ξ μ where n 1 cm3 sec is the frequency of collision β counts cm3 is a constant n is the concentration of particles d cm is the diameter of particles ξ is dissipation rate of water energy in per time per volume and μ pa sec is dynamic viscosity when pre settled sludge is added to the water samples before the coagulation the concentration of particles increases and the collision frequency increases therefore coagulation and flocculation are more efficient with the reuse sludge added eq 7 at low temperatures sludge reuse is useful to improve floc settling and the settling improves further as reuse sludge volume is increased at 2 c fig 6 at 10 c to 30 c there was no significant difference in turbidity reductions as reuse sludge was increased again there were interesting observations at 40 c where floc settling was noticeably improved for the 5 ml addition but had little effect at 10 ml compared to the system with no sludge reuse this is perhaps because buoyancy forces are higher when flocs grow larger but are less compact also at higher temperatures the thermal motion of molecules increases and therefore the less compact flocs are formed however the observed difference between 5 ml and 10 ml sludge reuse in this study was significant in the temperature of 40 c thus 5 ml of sludge is enough to facilitate fast settling overall these results suggest that sludge reuse provided significantly improved settling at all temperatures though there was little improvement when the dose doubled from 5 to 10 ml and at the highest temperature the 10 ml addition provided no improvement over the settling without any sludge added 4 conclusion this study was designed to determine the effect of temperature on coagulation of nom and turbidity removal efficiency the results suggest that there is an important interplay between temperature and the other parameters such as ph flocculant dosing and hydraulic conditions the changes observed from 2 to 40 c demonstrated that temperature plays a significant role in the efficiency of nom removal the findings of this study offer several observations and conclusions that might be useful for future water treatment practice kaolinite is a better flocculant aid than bentonite clay because of better floc characteristics and faster settling behaviour hydraulic conditions play a significant role in flocculation and g is 20 5 s 1 to 28 7 s 1 40 60 rpm range is better for faster settling of flocs streaming potential increases as temperature increases requiring an increased coagulant dose to optimise flocculation conditions for even modest temperature changes 10 c similarly an increase in negative charge of components at higher ph also required increased flocculant loads sludge recycling is a suitable method for facilitating faster settling across the various temperature ranges of most natural water systems but optimal recycling volumes depend on the temperature of

results and discussion 3 1 choosing a coagulant aid bentonite and kaolinite the presence of a coagulant aid provides an additional mechanism for nom to interact with surfaces and hence increases the tendency to remove the nom from suspension this study investigated bentonite and kaolinite clays as possible coagulant aids and are often used in water treatment settings bentonite clays are swelling clays with relatively high cation exchange capacity cec hence having a higher surface charge and higher surface area compared to the non swelling kaolinite fig 2 indeed fig 2a shows that much higher doses of cationic coagulant are required to neutralise surface charge in the bentonite systems compared to kaolinite at the same mass fig 2b shows the settling times after the suspensions were titrated to zero sp kaolinite systems tended to settle more rapidly than bentonite and hence for this system kaolinite was the better choice for more efficient turbidity reduction whilst both clays visually produced floc structures in suspension the bentonite structures were larger and more gelatinous in appearance whilst the kaolinite flocs were smaller but clearly denser and probably the reason the kaolinite flocs settled faster the differing floc structures are likely linked to the higher surface charge and increased counter ion concentration at bentonites surfaces which will play a significant role in the surface interaction with nom overall fig 2 shows that kaolinite is the better flocculant aid in this system because of a a lower requirement of ionic flocculant to reach zero sp where optimum flocculation occurs and b the faster settling rate of kaolinite flocs over the bentonite systems whilst the conclusion that kaolinite is the better flocculant aid this is unlikely to be a general conclusion for all possible water compositions in the real world however it is helpful in this study to identify a system that can monitor the impact of temperature then 3 2 estimating hydraulic conditions for flocculation hydraulic conditions play an essential role in flocculation we investigated slow mixing conditions and measured the final turbidity after 10 min of settling time the variation of turbidity over time are shown in fig 3 the final total turbidity reduction increased as the pre settling mixing rate increased from 7 2 s 1 to 47 5 s 1 very slow mixing g 7 2 s 1 and 13 3 s 1 conditions lead to less settling of flocs compared to that achieved when the velocity gradient was above 20 5 s 1 floc growth involves the initial aggregation of smaller particles followed by a series of coagulation and breakage events until a steady state is reached where flocs maintain a roughly similar size and character interparticle collision at the initial aggregation phase is important because higher collision energies can overcome repulsive forces preventing coagulation 33 as flocs grow and become larger the collision frequency of large floc and small particles is reduced further floc growth is restricted by fluid shear and floc breakage can occur fluid shear and floc morphology control the character of the steady state floc size distribution 33 faster mixing increases fluid shear and so mixing speed is an important parameter in floc formation and character fig 3 shows that sedimentation increased as mixing velocity increased because high of more frequent and higher energy particle collisions created denser flocs that settled better floc formation is slower under slower mixing conditions with less dense and more open floc structures that settle more slowly the data in fig 3 suggests that 40 rpm is optimal in our systems and little improvement is obtained at higher shear rates whilst lower shear conditions produce floc structures that settle less efficiently 3 3 temperature effects for the streaming potential coagulant dose and residual turbidity because coagulation is highly dependent on the charge of the nom surfaces and other additives any variable that can alter the charge can also impact coagulation ph is well known to have a dramatic impact on coagulation because of the potential to alter the charge of the dissolved and suspended species present in general flocculation is favoured when nom is less ionised because it is less water soluble when a greater proportion of the function groups are neutral 5 34 temperature can also influence charge and species tend to become more ionised as both soluble and surfaces become more charged at higher temperatures 35 36 that can impact the required coagulant dosage and the efficiency of floc formation moreover bulk properties such as viscosity diffusivities electric conductivity and permittivity are also temperature dependent laboratory charge analyser lca consists of two electrodes placed at either end of a teflon coated cylinder and piston and through which a known pressure difference can be applied teflon generally carries a negative charge in aqueous environments and so an electric double layer is formed at the teflon surface the movement of the piston causes a flow of charged particles creating a streaming current sc between the electrodes the magnitude of the electrical current varies with fluid velocity and charge density 37 the fluid velocity is constant if the lca s piston moves consistently so the charge density is the variable factor proportional to the magnitude of the zeta potential charge density increases as temperature decreases which could increase the sc however εrs ε0 decrease and η increase correspondingly 38 humic substances in the solution also influence the variation of sc the dissolution kinetics of humic acid particles also influence the sc because the dissolution rate of humic acid increases as temperature increases 39 the ionic product of water kw depends on the temperature and thus the changes of kw might influence the sc fig 4a shows how increasing the temperature impacts the sp which is an indirect measure of charge a more negative value of the sp at higher temperatures indicates an increasing negative charge on the species present a modest increase in temperature of around 10 c will require an increased dose of fe counterions to bring the zero sp conditions for optimal flocculation the experimental data in fig 4b shows that as both ph and temperature increase then higher doses of coagulant are required t test was performed for two independent means to identify the significance of data at different temperature conditions the t value of the coagulant doses at 2 c and 40 c ph 7 is estimated to be 6 22218 then the p value is calculated to be 0 000049 therefore the result is significant at p 05 at low ph 2 to 5 the solubilities of fe species are higher at lower temperatures 16 whilst the temperature rises the dominant species varies as fe3 fe oh 2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 fe oh 4 eqs 2 5 16 17 2 fe 3 h 2 o fe oh 2 h 3 fe 3 2 h 2 o fe oh 2 2 h 4 fe 3 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 5 fe 3 4 h 2 o fe oh 4 4 h therefore charge neutralisation is the dominant mechanism at lower ph and lower temperatures as a result turbidity removal efficiency is higher in comparison adoption plays a significant role at higher ph and higher temperatures and needs more fe coagulants resulting in lower turbidity removal efficiencies turbidity removal efficiency is also temperature dependent as shown in fig 4c as temperature increases viscosity decreases and settling is faster over the temperature range 2 to 30 c the result at 40 c is interesting but consistent at all ph values and suggests that different floc structures and or additional particles are present at 40 c the average floc is larger and more buoyant an effect that has been noted previously 40 41 that may also result from the higher concentrations of ferric ions added to overcome the negative charge at this higher temperature fig 4b and the higher ionic strength is altering the character of flocs and floc formation or even resulting in the formation of other colloidal species such as amorphous iron oxides oxyhydroxides certainly as ph increases surface charge increases and thus required coagulant dose increases above ph 7 9 the hydrolysis species of fe iii is precipitated as hydroxides and even if they have the ability to interact with nom and kaolinite they increase the total turbidity and therefore turbidity removal efficiency decreases fig 4c clearly demonstrates that even narrow temperature changes can bring significant changes in the behaviour of the coagulation system the turbidity removal is significant when the temperature rises from 2 c to 40 c estimated t value is 3 22592 p value is 0 006065 p 0 05 3 4 turbidity reduction with temperature and ph changes several reports have shown that floc settling is temperature dependent 42 44 at low temperatures the coagulation process is slow thus flocculation decreases because particle aggregation follows the arrhenius law 44 and was studied examined and explained by xiao et al 44 by plotting the aggregation constant with variable temperature according to eq 2 6 ln k lna e a r t where k is an aggregation constant min 1 a is a pre exponential factor e a is the activation energy kj mol t is the thermodynamic temperature k and r is the gas constant 8 315 j mol k eq 6 states thermodynamic reaction behaviours and predicts that a decrease in temperature will reduce the proportion of particles activated to overcome repulsive forces to aggregate thus reducing the overall aggregation rate in this study however floc settling reduced at 40 c fig 5 indicating some other factors involved with the flocculation process are altered at higher temperatures as mentioned earlier this change in behaviour at 40 c is likely because of increased concentration of added ferric ions to initiate flocculation and hence changed solution conditions which caused precipitation or formation of other smaller colloids because of the higher ionic strength at 40 c polymer adsorption is also temperature dependant and temperature influenced conformational changes in the pam can alter floc character and settling an increase of negative charge at the kaolinite and ha particle surfaces at higher temperature may also contribute to a decrease polymer bridging and flocculation performance 45 leaving smaller flocs and reduced settling 3 5 turbidity reduction with sludge reuse and effects of temperature reutilisation of sludge allows for maintinance of suspension conditions that are favourable for continuing floc formation and hence create more efficient overall nom removal in this study sludge reuse volumes tested were 5 ml l and 10 ml l which was pre sludge for an hour and separated from the jar and stored in centrifuge tubes the sludge samples were shaken before use and the volume was measured using a 10 ml pipette no sp changes were noted when sludge was added to the water sample and so no extra coagulant was required because the introduced sludge carried little excess charge the pre settled sludge enhanced the floc settling because of physical adsorption and sweep flocculation by hydroxide precipitates and improved collision frequencies the particle s collision frequency is explained by eq 7 43 7 n 12 πβ n 2 d 3 ξ μ where n 1 cm3 sec is the frequency of collision β counts cm3 is a constant n is the concentration of particles d cm is the diameter of particles ξ is dissipation rate of water energy in per time per volume and μ pa sec is dynamic viscosity when pre settled sludge is added to the water samples before the coagulation the concentration of particles increases and the collision frequency increases therefore coagulation and flocculation are more efficient with the reuse sludge added eq 7 at low temperatures sludge reuse is useful to improve floc settling and the settling improves further as reuse sludge volume is increased at 2 c fig 6 at 10 c to 30 c there was no significant difference in turbidity reductions as reuse sludge was increased again there were interesting observations at 40 c where floc settling was noticeably improved for the 5 ml addition but had little effect at 10 ml compared to the system with no sludge reuse this is perhaps because buoyancy forces are higher when flocs grow larger but are less compact also at higher temperatures the thermal motion of molecules increases and therefore the less compact flocs are formed however the observed difference between 5 ml and 10 ml sludge reuse in this study was significant in the temperature of 40 c thus 5 ml of sludge is enough to facilitate fast settling overall these results suggest that sludge reuse provided significantly improved settling at all temperatures though there was little improvement when the dose doubled from 5 to 10 ml and at the highest temperature the 10 ml addition provided no improvement over the settling without any sludge added 4 conclusion this study was designed to determine the effect of temperature on coagulation of nom and turbidity removal efficiency the results suggest that there is an important interplay between temperature and the other parameters such as ph flocculant dosing and hydraulic conditions the changes observed from 2 to 40 c demonstrated that temperature plays a significant role in the efficiency of nom removal the findings of this study offer several observations and conclusions that might be useful for future water treatment practice kaolinite is a better flocculant aid than bentonite clay because of better floc characteristics and faster settling behaviour hydraulic conditions play a significant role in flocculation and g is 20 5 s 1 to 28 7 s 1 40 60 rpm range is better for faster settling of flocs streaming potential increases as temperature increases requiring an increased coagulant dose to optimise flocculation conditions for even modest temperature changes 10 c similarly an increase in negative charge of components at higher ph also required increased flocculant loads sludge recycling is a suitable method for facilitating faster settling across the various temperature ranges of most natural water systems but optimal recycling volumes depend on the temperature of

13113,recently there are numerous organic and inorganic micropollutants exist in the water environment thus it is necessary to develop a new versatile adsorbent for simultaneous removal of different water pollutants the aim of this study was to evaluate natural thermally treated bentonites 0 700 c and bentonite carbon nanotubes composites ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh in terms of their capabilities for simultaneous adsorption of organic micropollutants and heavy metals from rainwater ben cnt composites consisted of 60 wt of bentonite ben100 and 40 wt of single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt or single walled carbon nanotubes with hydroxyl groups swcnt oh the composition of the rainwater has been modified by adding lead nitrate zinc nitrate and other organic micropollutants including benzotriazole bzt and anthracene ant overall removal of bzt and ant varied from 4 5 to 93 and from 50 to 95 5 respectively ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited increased removal percentage to 93 bzt and 95 5 ant respectively the fitting degree showed that freundlich model was the most suitable for bzt and ant adsorption on ben100 and ben100 swcnt while langmuir provided the best fit for ben100 swcnt oh from bentonites 0 700 c the highest removal of both zinc and lead was observed for ben100 and ben300 while the lowest for ben500 and ben700 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh composites demonstrated over 90 removal percentage of zinc and lead during adsorption of these compounds the time required to reach equilibrium was very short 30 min for both composites the study showed that ben cnt composites are the effective adsorbents for removing micropollutants and heavy metals from aqueous solutions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bentonite carbon nanotubes micropollutants heavy metal adsorption rainwater 1 introduction the distribution of clean water has recently become a critical issue due to the rising global scarcity of water so research into improving rainwater quality has garnered significant attention rainwater requires an appropriate treatment in order to be a source of water that is suitable for irrigation drinking laundering and other applications 1 unfortunately rainwater is often contaminated with organic and inorganic substances due to anthropogenic activity 2 contamination of rainwater is a result of dissolving particulate matter and atmospheric gases in the lower troposphere rainwater composition varies regionally and seasonally as an origin of particulates and gases includes road dust industrial emission and flue gases the occurrence of organic micropollutants in rainwater such as dioxins polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and corrosion inhibitors are an effect of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and wood waste burning home heating coke production or emission from vehicles streets and buildings from these sources first they enter to the atmosphere and then are redistributed in gas or particle phases and after that they can migrate by wet or dry deposition 3 4 5 apart from these sources of contamination rainwater can contain some constitutes of rainwater piping building materials galvanizing steel and lead flashing paint 6 therefore rainwater can be contaminated with trace heavy metals such as zn pb ni cd cu 7 and organic micropollutants such as anthracene benzo a pyrene naphthalene and benzotriazole 8 9 even if they exist in rainwater in trace amounts these pollutants can ultimately disrupt plant growth therefore there is an urgent need to develop specific technology that can remove both organic and inorganic pollutants from rainwater there are a variety of available methods that remove both heavy metals and organic micropollutants from water matrices they include precipitation coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation processes nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and adsorption 10 chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation and oxidation processes require a use of different chemicals that can be expensive tio2 toxic clo2 and non reusable coagulants and finally generate waste sludge precipitation and coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation releases an undesirable water oxidation by product 11 membrane filtration seems to be complicated and expensive as nf and ro produce concentrated retentate require pretreatment and use much more energy than other techniques 12 on the other hand adsorption has gained significant attention owing to its convenience ease of operation simplicity of design adaptation for wide range of target pollutants and adsorbent reusability in recent decades many types of adsorbents such as activated carbon resins clays and zeolites have been used to remove pollutants from water matrices 13 18 bentonite clay al2 si4o10 oh 2 nh2o is cheap almost zero price and available naturally existed adsorbent especially in egypt compared to other sorbents such as activated carbon or resins mineral clays are greener cheaper and more naturally available 19 thus bentonite offers an attractive and inexpensive option for rainwater and wastewater treatment since it exhibits high affinity for heavy metal ions e g zn co cu ni cu pb and se 20 21 22 23 for example concentration of iron zinc and nickel was reduced by 97 9 98 9 and 98 9 respectively using adsorption with 0 05 g l of nanobentonite 24 on the other hand natural bentonite represents a poor uptake of organic micropollutants due to its strong hydrophilicity small interlayer spacing and large surface energy 19 therefore much effort had been put to improve adsorption potential of bentonite including thermal treatment chemical functionalization or preparation of bentonite composites 25 for example removal percentages of 16 pahs specified by the us environmental protection agency excepting naphthalene were more than 90 by adsorption on organobentonite 25 in another study local low value bentonite from southern spain was modified with fe3 hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma and chitosan biopolymer ch to improve the adsorption capacity of pesticides the modified bentonites removed the targeted pesticides in the range from 30 to 100 26 zhang et al presented that uptake of benzotriazole increased from 1 28 mg g to 15 89 mg g when bentonite was modified by gemni surfactants to organomontmorillonite 27 comparing thermal treatment and chemical functionalization chemical functionalization of bentonite seems to be less advantageous since consumed chemicals affect the natural environment another promising approach involves using carbon nanotube bentonite composites because carbon nanotubes cnts achieve fast and effective adsorption of organics 28 cnts are expensive materials but have superior functional properties which give a high adsorption efficiency 29 31 thus combining bentonite with cnts in composite material results in novel and attractive adsorbent with optimum qualifications regarding to economic feasibility and removal efficiency 32 despite numerous studies involving bentonite and bentonite composites to our knowledge in these reports target adsorbates belong to one group of pollutants with similar properties such as pesticides pahs dyes or heavy metals pollutants with similar properties reveal the similar adsorption behavior as for example due to strong hydrophobicity or ionic form 33 that approach did not reflect conditions occurring in real water matrices which are in fact multicomponent solution with different substances affecting the adsorption process in that context there is an increasing need to study simultaneous adsorption of different groups of pollutants from natural rainwater by thermally modified bentonite and novel bentonite carbon nanotubes ben cnt composite adsorbent therefore we hypothesized that the thermally modified bentonite and ben cnt composites could be effective in simultaneous uptake of mixed pollutants with different properties as target adsorbates for this study we selected zinc lead benzotriazole bzt and anthracene ant as representatives of heavy metals corrosion inhibitor and pahs in rainwater respectively zinc and lead are the most important heavy metals found in rainwater 34 35 anthracene was identified by european parliament in water framework directive as particularly dangerous and priority substance in the water policy 36 benzotriazole is not considered as photodegradable in the natural environment thus its total amount from atmosphere is allocated in wet and dry deposition 37 the main objective of the present study is to investigate the adsorption potential of thermally treated bentonite and ben cnt composites for removing zn and pb as well as bzt and ant from rainwater additionally this study provides information about the most suitable temperature to modify bentonite before preparation of ben cnt composites 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials egyptian bentonite ben powder was supplied by the egypt bentonite and derivatives company alexandria egypt single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt and single walled carbon nanotubes with hydroxyl groups swcnt oh were obtained from chengdu organic chemistry co ltd chengdu china the purity of swcnt and swcnt oh was 95 and 90 respectively deionized water was taken directly from ultrapure lab water system rephile bioscience shanghai china acetonitrile gc purity methanol gc purity and nitric acid were purchased from avantor performance materials gliwice poland ant purity 99 and bzt purity 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich poznań poland surfactant brij 35 was taken from vwr international llc gdansk poland bentonite chemical analysis is shown in table 1 while the characteristics of the nanotubes is shown in table 2 the properties of anthracene ant and benzotriazole bzt are presented in table 3 2 2 thermal treatment of bentonite the very fine raw bentonite particle size 0 1 mm was subjected to thermal activation at different temperatures 100 300 500 or 700 c in high temperature muffle furnace xd 1400s of zhengzhou brother furnace co ltd zhengzhou china the furnace uses sic rods as heating element max temperature inside furnace can be reached up to 1400 c and the dimension of inside chamber is 200 200 250 mm the furnace temperature profile can be set up by 30 segments and run automatically by the 708p type temperature controller the duration of thermal activation was 120 min the thermally treated bentonite samples were designated as ben100 ben300 ben500 and ben700 respectively and the untreated natural sample was labeled ben0 calcination of bentonite was carried out by modifying previously presented methods of thermal modification of bentonite 38 39 2 3 preparation of ben cnt composites ben cnt composites ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh were prepared from ben100 and two different types of carbon nanotubes i e swcnt and swcnt oh respectively selection of ben100 among other bentonites was due to its proper porosity and good adsorption potential which has been investigated within this study bentonite powder and carbon nanotubes were mixed with a mass ratio of 60 40 wt then 1 nitric acid solution containing surfactant brij 4 g l was added with a solid to liquid ratio of 30 g 10 ml and mixed for 30 min finally the grease was heated for 120 min at 250 c and then crushed into a powder the ben cnt composites were prepared by modifying previously developed methods of the preparation of clay carbon nanotubes composite adsorbents 40 41 2 4 rainwater characterization and feed water preparation rainwater was collected in october from the roof of the house covered with steel tiles in dąbrowa górnicza poland the dust content in the air in this period was 38 μg m3 and the amount of precipitation was 49 mm the rainwater harvesting system was equipped with rainwater concrete tank and atlas filtri fa bx filter that removes mechanical impurities such as sand rust silt corrosion particles turbidity sediments some sparingly soluble iron compounds a 25 μm cartridge was used to remove contaminants not less than 25 μm rainwater as taken was spiked with a sufficient volume of micropollutants stock solution 1 g l in methanol or acetone to obtain an initial concentration of ant and bzt equal to 1 0 1 5 or 2 0 mg l then zinc and lead nitrates zn no3 2 and pb no3 2 were added to the rainwater and the following concentrations were obtained 1 mg l zn2 and pb2 or 2 mg l zn2 and pb2 the rainwater prepared according above procedure was used in the adsorption tests as feed water the basic physicochemical characteristic of rainwater as taken and feed water is presented in table 4 it is clear that the addition of zinc and lead nitrates changed the values of conductivity and n no3 concentration the addition of ant and bzt standards dissolved in methanol acetone increased the values of toc cod and absorbance uv254 due to higher content of organic carbon 2 5 characterization of adsorbents the surface morphology of the studied bentonite and bentonite cnt composites was investigated by scanning electron microscope jsm 6360la jeol musashino japan the structural properties of the adsorbents were determined by measuring the surface area and pore size distribution using the low temperature nitrogen adsorption and desorption technique and volumetric adsorption analyzer asap 2010 micrometrics usa according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method surface area and porous structure parameters were calculated pore size distribution was determined using method of density functional theory 42 2 6 adsorption experiments in this study all adsorption tests were performed in 250 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml of feed solution at a constant temperature 20 c and ph 6 5 in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm after reaching equilibrium the adsorbent samples were separated from the liquid and concentrations of adsorbates were measured each experiment was performed in duplicate and the mean value was computed to ensure quality assurance the data obtained in this study are presented as means standard deviation the effect of adsorbent type and dosage on removal percentage of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 was studied for all bentonites 0 700 c and ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh for this purpose a feed solution containing 1 mg l of ant and bzt and 2 mg l of pb2 and zn2 was shaken with adsorbent dosages 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 25 g 100 ml the removal percentage r of adsorbates was calculated from the eq 1 1 r c 0 c f c 0 100 where c 0 and c f mg l are the initial and final concentrations of adsorbate respectively in studies of adsorption isotherms and kinetics ben0 raw bentonite and ben300 700 c were not included due to their low potential for simultaneous adsorption of organic micropollutants and heavy metals this was confirmed in the first stage of study i e the effect of adsorbent type and dosage on removal percentage of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 as well as by measurements of bet specific surface area the adsorption capacity of ant bzt zn2 and pb2 by ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh was studied by shaking feed solutions with various initial concentrations of adsorbates 1 2 mg l and adsorbent dosage 0 0505 0 262 g 100 ml using batch experiment adsorption thermodynamics of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 was studied for ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh at 293 k 303 k and 313 k the kinetic experiments were carried out for the ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh by adding 0 1 g of adsorbent to feed water with 1 mg l of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 the adsorbent samples were separated from the liquid at following time intervals 5 10 15 30 45 60 120 180 240 min the adsorbed amount was calculated from the eq 2 43 2 q e c 0 c e v m where q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorbed amount c 0 and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of adsorbates respectively m g is the mass of adsorbent and v l is the volume of the feed water 2 7 adsorption kinetics the kinetic experimental data were fitted using pseudo second order kinetic equations expressed as shown in the eq 3 44 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t are the amounts of micropollutants adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant based on this pseudo second order model the half adsorption time t 1 2 eq 4 and the initial adsorption rate h eq 5 were calculated according to the following relationships 45 4 t 1 2 1 k 2 q e 5 h k 2 q e 2 2 8 adsorption isotherms the experimental data were fitted by three common adsorption isotherms models the langmuir model which assumes monolayer adsorption in which molecules only interact with the sorbent s surface it is represented by the eq 6 46 6 1 q e 1 q m k l 1 c e 1 q m where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the langmuir fitting parameter the freundlich model adsorption on heterogeneous surface energy systems is well described by the freundlich model which is empirical the model is useful for chemisorption and some situations of physisorption and it can be stated as the eq 7 46 shows 7 log q e log k f 1 n l o g c e where k f mg g l mg n is the freundlich adsorption coefficient and n is the number describing surface heterogeneity and sorption intensity the dubinin radushkevich d r model has been a crucial equation for quantitatively modelling the adsorption of gases and vapors by microporous sorbents since it was first suggested as an empirical adaption of the polanyi adsorption potential theory the equation which is based on the idea that pore filling rather than layer by layer surface covering is the process for adsorption in micropores applies to adsorption systems requiring just van der waals forces and is particularly useful for characterizing adsorption on a microporous adsorbent the d r equation is written as the eq 8 43 8 ln q e ln a dr e 2 ε 2 where a dr mg g is the amount of adsorbate that can be adsorbed in micropores this can be obtained by plotting lnq e as a function of ε 2 e kj mol is the adsorption energy which can be read from the slope of that line and ε is the adsorption potential which is defined by the eq 9 43 9 ε r t ln c s c e ε r t ln csce where r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the ideal gas constant t k is the temperature and c s mg l is the solubility in water 2 9 thermodynamic studies to determine thermodynamics parameters of adsorption of bzt ant zn2 and pb2 the gibbs free energy change was calculated from the following relationships 47 10 g 0 rt k d 11 k d q e c e where g 0 kj mol is the gibbs free energy change k d is the distribution coefficient then the enthalpy change h 0 and entropy change s 0 were calculated from the relationships 47 12 ln k d s 0 r h 0 rt h 0 kj mol and s 0 j mol k were estimated from the slope and intercept of plot ln k d f 1 t respectively 2 10 water quality analysis a gas chromatograph gc 6500gc system gc fid yl instrument co ltd hogye dong anyang korea was used to measure the amounts of ant and bzt a 30 m 0 25 mm inner diameter slb 5 ms fused silica capillary column with a 0 25 m film thickness was employed in the apparatus as the carrier gas helium 5 0 was employed a temperature program for the column oven ranging from 80 to 320 c was used to chromatographically separate micropollutants the temperature of the injector was fixed at 240c degrees prior to analysis chemicals were extracted from the samples using a previously developed solid phase extraction spe method phase c18 supelco 27 the amounts of zinc and lead ions were measured spectrophotometrically with merck test kits 3 results and discussion 3 1 material structure the surface morphologies of bentonites 0 700 c and bentonite cnt composites were observed using sem the sem images of ben0 ben100 ben300 ben500 and ben700 are presented in fig 1 and the sem images of ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are shown in fig 2 based on the obtained images it can be that the raw bentonite contains rock like macromolecules with rough and heterogeneous surfaces changes in the structure of bentonite were observed as the activation temperature increased and agglomerates deformed and shrank lower agglomeration is a consequence of eliminating water from the bentonite structure at higher temperatures 48 similarly lina al attar et al 40 found that the bentonite structure was intact up to 300 c based on powder x ray diffraction they also observed that the thermal treatment 150 600 c caused the gradual disappearance of the main montmorillonite peak and the minimization of calcite additionally thermogravimetric analysis confirmed dehydration and dehydroxylation of the materials during heating 40 carbon nanotubes are clearly visible in both composite samples fig 2 it is important to emphasize that some cnts can be located within the bentonite structure due to the small diameter of cnts 2 nm and the relatively high porosity of bentonite 41 as shown in fig 3 higher temperature also affected the bentonite color as a result of iron oxidation the nitrogen sorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of ben0 ben100 ben300 ben500 ben700 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are shown in fig 4 according to the iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry classification nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were type ii for ben0 ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh while ben300 ben500 and ben700 were type iii the type ii adsorption isotherms indicate unlimited adsorption due to multilayer physical adsorption after the saturation of the monolayer in contrast type iii adsorption isotherms are typical for highly macroporous adsorbents and indicate slow adsorbate adsorbent interactions interestingly the shape of the isotherms changed from type ii to type iii when bentonite was heated at temperatures of 300 500 and 700o c this is due to the elimination of water from the clay structure and the formation of larger pores 49 from the hysteresis loops it is clear that ben0 ben100 and ben300 presented the h4 class while ben500 and ben700 correspond to the h3 class both h3 and h4 hysteresis loops are characteristic of non rigid agglomerated materials with the same pore geometry however type h4 indicates also larger pores these results correspond well with the sem images because all sorbents create agglomerates with non rigid surfaces 27 50 the ben0 ben100 ben300 and ben500 samples exhibited micro and mesoporosity while ben700 was macro and mesoporous as the treatment temperature increased micropores turned into mesopores due to progressive dehydration and dehydroxylation 51 based on the sem images significant contraction of bentonite particles was observed at 300 c this may be related to dehydratation and dehydroxylation which causes a large loss of bentonite mass and a transformation of the crystal structure the porosity of ben100 swcnt was influenced by the porosity of the original materials i e ben100 and swcnt since swcnt were dominated by micropores we observed increased microporosity of ben100 swcnt similarly the increased mesoporosity of ben100 swcnt oh was related to the mesopores of swcnt oh fig s1 the ben0 ben100 ben300 and ben500 samples exhibited micro and mesoporosity while ben700 was macro and mesoporous as the treatment temperature increased micropores turned into mesopores due to progressive dehydration and dehydroxylation 51 based on the sem images significant contraction of bentonite particles was observed at 300 c this may be related to dehydratation and dehydroxylation which causes a large loss of bentonite mass and a transformation of the crystal structure the porosity of ben100 swcnt was influenced by the porosity of the original materials i e ben100 and swcnt since swcnt were dominated by micropores we observed increased microporosity of ben100 swcnt similarly the increased mesoporosity of ben100 swcnt oh was related to the mesopores of swcnt oh fig s1 it was found that the calcination of bentonite changed its structure because the increase in temperature caused a multi stage dehydration of the clays starting with water removal from the surface 50 120 c then dehydration of structural water 200 400 c and finally dehydroxylation of the inner layer 400 550 c this phenomenon increased the porosity and expanded the structure 52 the ben100 and ben300 changes in pore size from micropores to mesopores after heating to 100 and 300 c respectively resulted in lower ssa table 5 this confirms the importance of well defined micropores for the material s adsorptive specific surface area further heating up to 700 c caused further increase in pore size and decrease in ssa this result showed that it is not worthwhile to use higher temperature to activate the bentonite in this case it was enough to preheat the bentonite at 100 c to obtain larger pores 53 the addition of cnts reduced the pore size in the ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh and increase their ssa it is generally accepted that a large specific surface area and greater microporosity of an adsorbent indicates the presence of many active adsorption sites 54 55 3 2 adsorption of bzt and ant by thermally treated bentonites and bentonite cnt composites 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent type and its dose on removal percentage as seen in fig 5 the adsorption of anthracene was much higher comparing with benzotriazol overall removal percentage varied from 4 5 to 93 and from 50 to 95 5 for bzt and ant respectively this can be explained by lower water solubility and strong hydrophobicity of ant comparing with bzt these properties greatly affect an affinity of adsorbates to adsorption 56 the highest removal percentage of micropollutants was observed for ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh fig 5 this was especially important for removal of bzt since bentonites itself 0 700 c exhibited poor adsorption performance of this substance for example removal percentage of bzt among all bentonites 0 700 c reached maximally 21 while for ben100 swcnt increased to 93 it is also clear that the removal of ant and bzt slightly increased with increasing adsorbent dose since higher dose provides the higher specific surface area and more active adsorption sites 57 more specifically adsorption of bzt and ant increased 9 5 20 and 54 74 with an increase in ben100 dose 0 05 0 25 g 100 ml respectively this trend was observed for all adsorbents ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited increased adsorption of diverse organic micropollutants both with strong hydrophilicity bzt and hydrophobicity ant comparing with other bentonite based composites 58 for example unuabonah et al 59 reported a reduction of concentration of ant by 85 using humic acid modified bentonite 59 on the other hand adsorption capacity of ant by ben cnt composites is comparable with other conventional adsorbents such as zeolite and activated carbon 56 60 hedayati 56 reached 90 removal of anthracene using surfactant modified clinoptilolites zeolite on the contrary novel type of adsorbent as for example n doped reduced graphene oxide exhibited lower 58 removal efficiency of anthracene 61 in case of benzotriazole adsorption capacity of conventional adsorbents activated carbon was lower comparing to ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh 62 meinel et al 63 reported that the elimination percentage of bzt by powdered activated carbon was around 40 in single adsorption cycle 63 over 80 adsorption efficiency of bzt was observed employing granular activated carbon in filtration bed 64 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh figs 6 and 7 show the isotherms of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh from these data it was determined that ben100 swcnt exhibited the highest uptake of ant and bzt furthermore sorption uptake followed the relationship ant bzt for all sorbents to elucidate the factors controlling the adsorption mechanism and sorption affinity of organic micropollutants it is necessary to consider their hydrophobicity molecular weight ionic form and solubility the fact that adsorption of bzt was a few times lower than that of ant can be explained by its high solubility in water and low value of log k ow table 3 therefore the greater sorption uptake of ant was attributed to its hydrophobic character and low solubility in water the parameters calculated from the freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich models are presented in table 6 the fitting degree based on the correlation factor r2 showed that freundlich model was the most suitable for ben100 and ben100 swcnt while langmuir provided the best fit for ben100 swcnt oh these distinctions indicate different sorption mechanisms arising mainly from differences in the structures of these sorbents as previously mentioned ben100 and ben100 swcnt were dominated by micropores while ben100 swcnt oh had both micro and mesopores further discussion in this report is primarily focused on the parameters derived from freundlich and langmuir computations considering the adsorption of bzt as an example the k f values are 0 052 1 149 and 2 393 for ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh respectively higher values indicate greater adsorption so these results show that the ben cnt composites had a better adsorption capacity compared with bentonite alone this finding corresponds well with the ssa since sorbents with higher ssa exhibited higher adsorption capacity for organic micropollutants the n value smaller than 10 indicates favorable adsorption and heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface the significant difference in the n values between ben100 and ben cnt composites can be attributed to different chemical natures of these adsorbents due to carbon nanotubes content in ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the adsorption kinetic curves of micropollutants on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are presented in fig 8 for all sorbents the kinetic equilibrium was reached faster for bzt than ant this can be explained by the much lower molecular size of bzt compared with ant the pseudo second order model described the adsorption of micropollutants on the studied samples very well and the calculated parameters are presented in table 7 the calculated q t cal values corresponded well with experimental data q t exp this suggests that the adsorption of micropollutants followed second order kinetics and that the applied model could be used to determine the corresponding kinetic parameters based on these parameters it was determined that adsorption of bzt was the fastest thus the values of parameters h and k 2 were higher for bzt than for ant which further suggests a negative correlation between the molecular size and the adsorption rate when separately comparing the kinetic parameters for each compound the bzt adsorption kinetics increased in the order ben100 swcnt oh ben100 swcnt ben100 while for ant they increased in the order ben100 swcnt oh ben100 ben100 swcnt it is clear that more microporous sorbents i e ben100 and ben100 swcnt adsorbed both compounds faster than the mesoporous ben100 swcnt oh despite the high ssa of ben100 swcnt oh its adsorption kinetics was the slowest thus in terms of affecting the adsorption rate the microporosity of sorbents was more influential than their ssa to better understand the adsorption mechanism for these systems a weber morris intra particle diffusion model was applied 3 2 4 adsorption rate controlling mechanisms the intra particle diffusion model shows that there are several separate stages of the sorption process i e external diffusion and intra particle diffusion the non linear course of the entire adsorption process suggests a multi stage adsorption mechanism to evaluate the rate controlling mechanism the experimental data were fitted using a weber morris intra particle diffusion model shown in eq 13 65 13 q t q e t k d t 0 5 i where k d is the rate constant for intra particle diffusion and i represents the thickness of the boundary layer the kinetics of intra particle diffusion for the adsorption of bzt and ant on bentonite and bentonite cnt composites are presented in fig 9 the calculated kinetic parameters for the weber morris model are listed in table 8 for the first step of the adsorption process if the adsorption occurs solely via intra particle diffusion then the relationship q t f t 1 2 is linear and the curve passes through the origin as illustrated in fig 9a and c q t f t 1 2 for ben100 and ben100 swcnt oh consist of broken lines and do not pass through the origin this means that several processes are involved in the overall adsorption mechanism and the adsorption rate is not only controlled by intra particle diffusion the first line corresponds to adsorption on the outer surface of the adsorbent grain or to an immediate adsorption step the second line corresponds to a staged mild adsorption step where intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling mechanism of the overall adsorption process in contrast for ben100 swcnt the q t f t 1 2 is almost constant especially for bzt meaning that equilibrium was not achieved fig 9b 3 3 adsorption of zn2 and pb2 by thermally treated bentonites and ben cnt composites 3 3 1 effect of adsorbent type and its dose on percentage removal the effect of doses of bentonites 0 700 c and ben cnt composites on the removal of zn2 and pb2 are presented in fig 10 overall removal both zinc and lead were over 70 for all adsorbents from bentonites 0 700 c the highest removal of both zinc and lead was observed for ben100 and ben300 while the lowest for ben500 and ben700 decrease in adsorption performance of ben500 and ben700 can be attributed to the reduction of ssa and the increase in pore size when calcination temperature increased both the ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh composites also demonstrated high adsorption efficiencies reaching around 90 increase in the adsorbent s concentration from 0 05 to 0 25 g 100 ml did not significantly increase the removal of lead this trend was observed both for bentonites 0 700 c and ben cnt adsorbents for zinc adsorption effect of dose of bentonites 0 700 c was negligible while increase in ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh dose from 0 05 to 0 25 g 100 ml resulted in increase in zinc adsorption from 72 to 89 and from 90 5 to 98 7 respectively with increasing ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh doses more adsorption sites were provided by carbon nanotubes that effectively capture zinc 66 good adsorption potential of ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh for zinc and lead corresponds well with literature data many previous studies have confirmed the capabilities of clay materials to remove heavy metal ions 66 67 kakaei et al 68 achieved 90 removal of lead in adsorption on imidazole modified bentonite they also found that an increase in the mass of the adsorbent resulted in a higher removal efficiency in adsorption of heavy metal ions 68 high efficiency i e 88 zinc removal was demonstrated using bentonite zeolite adsorbent 69 other studies have shown that bentonite zeolite composites exhibit high efficiency for removing copper and zinc ions 69 lower effectiveness of pb2 removal maximum 43 7 was achieved with the use of pine cone activated carbon 70 adsorption study of zinc and lead by multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnt show the increase in their removal from 47 3 to 72 9 for pb2 and from 37 60 up to 65 5 for zn2 with increase in mass of mwcnt from 0 05 g to 0 25 g 71 for example saif chaudhry 72 described the adsorption of zinc and lead by sand coated with manganese oxide where they achieved a maximum lead and zinc uptake of 83 3 and 88 9 respectively 72 while esmaeili et al 67 found that the so called red earth achieved the removal of zinc and lead ions in the range of 84 99 9 depending on adsorbent dose 67 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms of zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh in this study the equilibrium data obtained for the adsorption of zinc by ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh concentration of zn2 was 0 mg l after adsorption by ben100 and lead by ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh was analyzed by langmuir freundlich and dubinin raduskevich equations here only the langmuir adsorption isotherms are presented for showing the interactions between adsorbates and adsorbents figs 11 and 12 as correlation coefficients r2 0 9 obtained from the langmuir was closer to unity than freundlich and dubinin raduskevich models from the higher q m values for zinc table 9 it was identified that ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited better potential to remove zinc than lead from aqueous solution this corresponds well with removal percentage results as they show the same tendency better adsorption of zinc is probably related to its smaller ionic radius 0 074 nm than that for lead 0 119 nm 73 74 owing to this zn2 diffuses easier into porous structure of adsorbents and is adsorbed metal s ions can be adsorbed via physical adsorption chemisorption or ion exchange 75 from the values of adsorption energy sorption mechanism can be determined adsorption energy e value below 8 kj mol shows a physisorption process between 8 kj mol and 16 kj mol indicates ion exchange mechanism while that above 16 kj mol indicates a chemisorption process 76 as can be seen in table 9 the value of adsorption energy shows that the ion exchange was the main adsorption mechanism of zinc and lead by ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh in case of adsorption of lead by ben100 the adsorption behavior was related to chemisorption 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics of zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the kinetic adsorption curves for zn2 and pb2 on ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are shown in fig 13 for ben100 adsorption of both metals was completed immediately thus determination of kinetics in this system adsorbent adsorbate was not possible no data points this may be because bentonite has a phenomenal adsorption capacity which is related to its pore structure in terms of the adsorption of zinc and lead ions the calculated values q t cal corresponded well with the experimental data q t exp this suggests that their adsorption kinetics were consistent with the model which can therefore be used to determine appropriate kinetic parameters in each case the time needed to reach the equilibrium was very short 30 min which indicates easy availability of the adsorption sites as seen in fig 13 and table 10 zinc was adsorbed faster than lead for both ben cnt composites more specifically adsorption rate h of zinc was 3 mg g min for ben100 swcnt and 23 mg g min for ben100 swcnt oh while for lead 0 26 mg g min and 0 28 mg g min for ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh respectively it means that zinc was adsorbed preferentially by both composite adsorbents xue et al found that adsorption depends on competition between different metals for adsorption sites 77 kinetic constant for zinc adsorption by ben100 swcnt oh was 28 7 g mg min while 3 25 g mg min for ben100 swcnt it means that adsorption of zinc on ben100 swcnt oh was much faster than on ben100 swcnt it is attributed with the sorption mechanism results mainly from the cloud interactions between metal ions and functional groups of the swcnt oh surface 78 however for lead opposite trend was observed so its adsorption kinetics was faster on ben100 swcnt thus these results indicate that the mechanism of different metal ions adsorption by the ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh is not the same 3 4 thermodynamic analysis of adsorption of bzt ant zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the thermodynamics calculations showed that adsorption process of bzt ant zn2 and pb2 on ben100 and ben cnt composites differ in nature as seen in table 11 the gibbs free energy change g 0 had a negative value for adsorption of bzt and ant on ben cnt composites while positive for ben100 on the other hand for adsorption of zn2 and pb2 was negative for all adsorbents the negative values of g 0 suggested that adsorption is spontaneous thermodynamically favorable and physical in nature as g 0 was in the range of 0 20 kj mol 79 moreover a positive values of enthalpy change h 0 indicates an endothermic adsorption of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh which was also confirmed by the increase in adsorption capacity with the increasing temperature 80 on the contrary adsorption of zn2 and pb2 was exothermic as both enthalpy and entropy changes were negative which was related to the decrease in adsorption capacity with the increasing temperature from 293 to 313 k 4 adsorbents feasibility and future perspectives polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and heavy metals are hazardous pollutants that commonly coexist in water the adsorption study carried out with the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants bzt and ant and heavy metals zn2 and pb2 by the ben cnt composites showed high removal efficiency of both groups of pollutants in the case of conventional adsorbents such as bentonite halloysite and activated carbon the adsorption efficiency in multi component systems show that adsorption efficiency is lower compared to solutions containing only one type of contaminants 81 the effectiveness of both pahs and heavy metals removal depends on several parameters such as the size of the adsorbent particles adsorbents dose and ph temperature solubility salinity of the solution therefore it is difficult to unequivocally compare a feasibility of adsorbents in removal of organic and inorganic pollutants as seen in table 12 adsorption potential of ben cnt composites against other adsorbents is comparable or even higher especially when we consider organic and inorganic adsorbates ben cnt composites are more versatile than pure clay adsorbents considering a significant improvement of adsorption capacity of ben cnt composites 40 wt loading of carbon nanotubes is reasoned first of all we prepared adsorbents with an advantageous cost quality and efficiency balance comparing with other alternative adsorbent such as carbon nanotubes table 13 presents a comparison of costs of different adsorbents it is clear that using bentonite as a base material for composite has significantly lowered the cost of this adsorbent due to its almost zero price on the other hand carbon nanotubes are expensive materials but have superior functional properties which give high adsorption efficiency and fast kinetics thus combining bentonite with carbon nanotubes in composite material results in novel and attractive adsorbent with optimum qualifications regarding to economic feasibility and removal efficiency many factors can influence or limit the use of the new materials including environmental considerations cost and efficiency of disposal therefore it is important to study their adsorption capacity in lab scale before practical applications in that context the results of batch adsorption experiments can provide valuable information compared to other adsorbents the effectiveness of removing micropollutants and heavy metals at the same time was higher which indicates that it is an excellent adsorbent with a higher adsorption capacity and faster adsorption rate the research in the batch system presented in this paper is therefore the basis for further research in the engineering aspect 5 summary in this study adsorption potential of bentonites 0 700 c and ben cnt composites for simultaneous removal of benzotriazole anthracene and trace heavy metals zn and pb from rainwater was evaluated increase in heating temperature of bentonite resulted in the higher surface area and pore size of ben 100 700 c comparing with ben0 ben100 was selected for the preparation of ben cnt composites as having relatively high ssa and pore size suitable to upload carbon nanotubes ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited the largest specific surface area and greater microporosity comparing with bentonites themselves the presented results suggest that bentonites are a suitable sorbent material for adsorbing metal ions from aqueous solutions while poorly adsorb organic compounds especially that with strong hydrophilicity from bentonites 0 700 c the highest removal of both zinc and lead was observed for ben100 and ben300 while the lowest for ben500 and ben700 this is important to emphasize that these results uniquely confirm that ben cnt composites have a great potential for simultaneous removal of diverse organic micropollutants with strong hydrophilicity bzt or hydrophobicity ant as well as heavy metlas the highest removal of bzt 93 was obtained for ben100 swcnt during adsorption of ant and bzt the time required to reach equilibrium was very short 30 min using ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the maximum adsorption capacity based on the freundlich equation was observed for ben100 swcnt for ant complete adsorption of zinc ions 100 and over 90 adsorption of lead ions were achieved by ben100 adsorption of zinc on ben100 swcnt oh was much faster than on ben100 swcnt while for lead opposite trend was observed thermodynamic analysis showed that adsorption of bzt and ant was endothermic while exothermic for zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh significantly this study shows that this is worthful to prepare bentonite cnt composites as these adsorbents represent satisfied cost feasibility balance comparing with others alternative adsorbents the following is the

13113,recently there are numerous organic and inorganic micropollutants exist in the water environment thus it is necessary to develop a new versatile adsorbent for simultaneous removal of different water pollutants the aim of this study was to evaluate natural thermally treated bentonites 0 700 c and bentonite carbon nanotubes composites ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh in terms of their capabilities for simultaneous adsorption of organic micropollutants and heavy metals from rainwater ben cnt composites consisted of 60 wt of bentonite ben100 and 40 wt of single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt or single walled carbon nanotubes with hydroxyl groups swcnt oh the composition of the rainwater has been modified by adding lead nitrate zinc nitrate and other organic micropollutants including benzotriazole bzt and anthracene ant overall removal of bzt and ant varied from 4 5 to 93 and from 50 to 95 5 respectively ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited increased removal percentage to 93 bzt and 95 5 ant respectively the fitting degree showed that freundlich model was the most suitable for bzt and ant adsorption on ben100 and ben100 swcnt while langmuir provided the best fit for ben100 swcnt oh from bentonites 0 700 c the highest removal of both zinc and lead was observed for ben100 and ben300 while the lowest for ben500 and ben700 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh composites demonstrated over 90 removal percentage of zinc and lead during adsorption of these compounds the time required to reach equilibrium was very short 30 min for both composites the study showed that ben cnt composites are the effective adsorbents for removing micropollutants and heavy metals from aqueous solutions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bentonite carbon nanotubes micropollutants heavy metal adsorption rainwater 1 introduction the distribution of clean water has recently become a critical issue due to the rising global scarcity of water so research into improving rainwater quality has garnered significant attention rainwater requires an appropriate treatment in order to be a source of water that is suitable for irrigation drinking laundering and other applications 1 unfortunately rainwater is often contaminated with organic and inorganic substances due to anthropogenic activity 2 contamination of rainwater is a result of dissolving particulate matter and atmospheric gases in the lower troposphere rainwater composition varies regionally and seasonally as an origin of particulates and gases includes road dust industrial emission and flue gases the occurrence of organic micropollutants in rainwater such as dioxins polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and corrosion inhibitors are an effect of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and wood waste burning home heating coke production or emission from vehicles streets and buildings from these sources first they enter to the atmosphere and then are redistributed in gas or particle phases and after that they can migrate by wet or dry deposition 3 4 5 apart from these sources of contamination rainwater can contain some constitutes of rainwater piping building materials galvanizing steel and lead flashing paint 6 therefore rainwater can be contaminated with trace heavy metals such as zn pb ni cd cu 7 and organic micropollutants such as anthracene benzo a pyrene naphthalene and benzotriazole 8 9 even if they exist in rainwater in trace amounts these pollutants can ultimately disrupt plant growth therefore there is an urgent need to develop specific technology that can remove both organic and inorganic pollutants from rainwater there are a variety of available methods that remove both heavy metals and organic micropollutants from water matrices they include precipitation coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation processes nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and adsorption 10 chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation and oxidation processes require a use of different chemicals that can be expensive tio2 toxic clo2 and non reusable coagulants and finally generate waste sludge precipitation and coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation releases an undesirable water oxidation by product 11 membrane filtration seems to be complicated and expensive as nf and ro produce concentrated retentate require pretreatment and use much more energy than other techniques 12 on the other hand adsorption has gained significant attention owing to its convenience ease of operation simplicity of design adaptation for wide range of target pollutants and adsorbent reusability in recent decades many types of adsorbents such as activated carbon resins clays and zeolites have been used to remove pollutants from water matrices 13 18 bentonite clay al2 si4o10 oh 2 nh2o is cheap almost zero price and available naturally existed adsorbent especially in egypt compared to other sorbents such as activated carbon or resins mineral clays are greener cheaper and more naturally available 19 thus bentonite offers an attractive and inexpensive option for rainwater and wastewater treatment since it exhibits high affinity for heavy metal ions e g zn co cu ni cu pb and se 20 21 22 23 for example concentration of iron zinc and nickel was reduced by 97 9 98 9 and 98 9 respectively using adsorption with 0 05 g l of nanobentonite 24 on the other hand natural bentonite represents a poor uptake of organic micropollutants due to its strong hydrophilicity small interlayer spacing and large surface energy 19 therefore much effort had been put to improve adsorption potential of bentonite including thermal treatment chemical functionalization or preparation of bentonite composites 25 for example removal percentages of 16 pahs specified by the us environmental protection agency excepting naphthalene were more than 90 by adsorption on organobentonite 25 in another study local low value bentonite from southern spain was modified with fe3 hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma and chitosan biopolymer ch to improve the adsorption capacity of pesticides the modified bentonites removed the targeted pesticides in the range from 30 to 100 26 zhang et al presented that uptake of benzotriazole increased from 1 28 mg g to 15 89 mg g when bentonite was modified by gemni surfactants to organomontmorillonite 27 comparing thermal treatment and chemical functionalization chemical functionalization of bentonite seems to be less advantageous since consumed chemicals affect the natural environment another promising approach involves using carbon nanotube bentonite composites because carbon nanotubes cnts achieve fast and effective adsorption of organics 28 cnts are expensive materials but have superior functional properties which give a high adsorption efficiency 29 31 thus combining bentonite with cnts in composite material results in novel and attractive adsorbent with optimum qualifications regarding to economic feasibility and removal efficiency 32 despite numerous studies involving bentonite and bentonite composites to our knowledge in these reports target adsorbates belong to one group of pollutants with similar properties such as pesticides pahs dyes or heavy metals pollutants with similar properties reveal the similar adsorption behavior as for example due to strong hydrophobicity or ionic form 33 that approach did not reflect conditions occurring in real water matrices which are in fact multicomponent solution with different substances affecting the adsorption process in that context there is an increasing need to study simultaneous adsorption of different groups of pollutants from natural rainwater by thermally modified bentonite and novel bentonite carbon nanotubes ben cnt composite adsorbent therefore we hypothesized that the thermally modified bentonite and ben cnt composites could be effective in simultaneous uptake of mixed pollutants with different properties as target adsorbates for this study we selected zinc lead benzotriazole bzt and anthracene ant as representatives of heavy metals corrosion inhibitor and pahs in rainwater respectively zinc and lead are the most important heavy metals found in rainwater 34 35 anthracene was identified by european parliament in water framework directive as particularly dangerous and priority substance in the water policy 36 benzotriazole is not considered as photodegradable in the natural environment thus its total amount from atmosphere is allocated in wet and dry deposition 37 the main objective of the present study is to investigate the adsorption potential of thermally treated bentonite and ben cnt composites for removing zn and pb as well as bzt and ant from rainwater additionally this study provides information about the most suitable temperature to modify bentonite before preparation of ben cnt composites 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials egyptian bentonite ben powder was supplied by the egypt bentonite and derivatives company alexandria egypt single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt and single walled carbon nanotubes with hydroxyl groups swcnt oh were obtained from chengdu organic chemistry co ltd chengdu china the purity of swcnt and swcnt oh was 95 and 90 respectively deionized water was taken directly from ultrapure lab water system rephile bioscience shanghai china acetonitrile gc purity methanol gc purity and nitric acid were purchased from avantor performance materials gliwice poland ant purity 99 and bzt purity 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich poznań poland surfactant brij 35 was taken from vwr international llc gdansk poland bentonite chemical analysis is shown in table 1 while the characteristics of the nanotubes is shown in table 2 the properties of anthracene ant and benzotriazole bzt are presented in table 3 2 2 thermal treatment of bentonite the very fine raw bentonite particle size 0 1 mm was subjected to thermal activation at different temperatures 100 300 500 or 700 c in high temperature muffle furnace xd 1400s of zhengzhou brother furnace co ltd zhengzhou china the furnace uses sic rods as heating element max temperature inside furnace can be reached up to 1400 c and the dimension of inside chamber is 200 200 250 mm the furnace temperature profile can be set up by 30 segments and run automatically by the 708p type temperature controller the duration of thermal activation was 120 min the thermally treated bentonite samples were designated as ben100 ben300 ben500 and ben700 respectively and the untreated natural sample was labeled ben0 calcination of bentonite was carried out by modifying previously presented methods of thermal modification of bentonite 38 39 2 3 preparation of ben cnt composites ben cnt composites ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh were prepared from ben100 and two different types of carbon nanotubes i e swcnt and swcnt oh respectively selection of ben100 among other bentonites was due to its proper porosity and good adsorption potential which has been investigated within this study bentonite powder and carbon nanotubes were mixed with a mass ratio of 60 40 wt then 1 nitric acid solution containing surfactant brij 4 g l was added with a solid to liquid ratio of 30 g 10 ml and mixed for 30 min finally the grease was heated for 120 min at 250 c and then crushed into a powder the ben cnt composites were prepared by modifying previously developed methods of the preparation of clay carbon nanotubes composite adsorbents 40 41 2 4 rainwater characterization and feed water preparation rainwater was collected in october from the roof of the house covered with steel tiles in dąbrowa górnicza poland the dust content in the air in this period was 38 μg m3 and the amount of precipitation was 49 mm the rainwater harvesting system was equipped with rainwater concrete tank and atlas filtri fa bx filter that removes mechanical impurities such as sand rust silt corrosion particles turbidity sediments some sparingly soluble iron compounds a 25 μm cartridge was used to remove contaminants not less than 25 μm rainwater as taken was spiked with a sufficient volume of micropollutants stock solution 1 g l in methanol or acetone to obtain an initial concentration of ant and bzt equal to 1 0 1 5 or 2 0 mg l then zinc and lead nitrates zn no3 2 and pb no3 2 were added to the rainwater and the following concentrations were obtained 1 mg l zn2 and pb2 or 2 mg l zn2 and pb2 the rainwater prepared according above procedure was used in the adsorption tests as feed water the basic physicochemical characteristic of rainwater as taken and feed water is presented in table 4 it is clear that the addition of zinc and lead nitrates changed the values of conductivity and n no3 concentration the addition of ant and bzt standards dissolved in methanol acetone increased the values of toc cod and absorbance uv254 due to higher content of organic carbon 2 5 characterization of adsorbents the surface morphology of the studied bentonite and bentonite cnt composites was investigated by scanning electron microscope jsm 6360la jeol musashino japan the structural properties of the adsorbents were determined by measuring the surface area and pore size distribution using the low temperature nitrogen adsorption and desorption technique and volumetric adsorption analyzer asap 2010 micrometrics usa according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method surface area and porous structure parameters were calculated pore size distribution was determined using method of density functional theory 42 2 6 adsorption experiments in this study all adsorption tests were performed in 250 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml of feed solution at a constant temperature 20 c and ph 6 5 in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm after reaching equilibrium the adsorbent samples were separated from the liquid and concentrations of adsorbates were measured each experiment was performed in duplicate and the mean value was computed to ensure quality assurance the data obtained in this study are presented as means standard deviation the effect of adsorbent type and dosage on removal percentage of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 was studied for all bentonites 0 700 c and ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh for this purpose a feed solution containing 1 mg l of ant and bzt and 2 mg l of pb2 and zn2 was shaken with adsorbent dosages 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 25 g 100 ml the removal percentage r of adsorbates was calculated from the eq 1 1 r c 0 c f c 0 100 where c 0 and c f mg l are the initial and final concentrations of adsorbate respectively in studies of adsorption isotherms and kinetics ben0 raw bentonite and ben300 700 c were not included due to their low potential for simultaneous adsorption of organic micropollutants and heavy metals this was confirmed in the first stage of study i e the effect of adsorbent type and dosage on removal percentage of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 as well as by measurements of bet specific surface area the adsorption capacity of ant bzt zn2 and pb2 by ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh was studied by shaking feed solutions with various initial concentrations of adsorbates 1 2 mg l and adsorbent dosage 0 0505 0 262 g 100 ml using batch experiment adsorption thermodynamics of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 was studied for ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh at 293 k 303 k and 313 k the kinetic experiments were carried out for the ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh by adding 0 1 g of adsorbent to feed water with 1 mg l of ant bzt pb2 and zn2 the adsorbent samples were separated from the liquid at following time intervals 5 10 15 30 45 60 120 180 240 min the adsorbed amount was calculated from the eq 2 43 2 q e c 0 c e v m where q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorbed amount c 0 and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of adsorbates respectively m g is the mass of adsorbent and v l is the volume of the feed water 2 7 adsorption kinetics the kinetic experimental data were fitted using pseudo second order kinetic equations expressed as shown in the eq 3 44 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t are the amounts of micropollutants adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant based on this pseudo second order model the half adsorption time t 1 2 eq 4 and the initial adsorption rate h eq 5 were calculated according to the following relationships 45 4 t 1 2 1 k 2 q e 5 h k 2 q e 2 2 8 adsorption isotherms the experimental data were fitted by three common adsorption isotherms models the langmuir model which assumes monolayer adsorption in which molecules only interact with the sorbent s surface it is represented by the eq 6 46 6 1 q e 1 q m k l 1 c e 1 q m where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the langmuir fitting parameter the freundlich model adsorption on heterogeneous surface energy systems is well described by the freundlich model which is empirical the model is useful for chemisorption and some situations of physisorption and it can be stated as the eq 7 46 shows 7 log q e log k f 1 n l o g c e where k f mg g l mg n is the freundlich adsorption coefficient and n is the number describing surface heterogeneity and sorption intensity the dubinin radushkevich d r model has been a crucial equation for quantitatively modelling the adsorption of gases and vapors by microporous sorbents since it was first suggested as an empirical adaption of the polanyi adsorption potential theory the equation which is based on the idea that pore filling rather than layer by layer surface covering is the process for adsorption in micropores applies to adsorption systems requiring just van der waals forces and is particularly useful for characterizing adsorption on a microporous adsorbent the d r equation is written as the eq 8 43 8 ln q e ln a dr e 2 ε 2 where a dr mg g is the amount of adsorbate that can be adsorbed in micropores this can be obtained by plotting lnq e as a function of ε 2 e kj mol is the adsorption energy which can be read from the slope of that line and ε is the adsorption potential which is defined by the eq 9 43 9 ε r t ln c s c e ε r t ln csce where r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the ideal gas constant t k is the temperature and c s mg l is the solubility in water 2 9 thermodynamic studies to determine thermodynamics parameters of adsorption of bzt ant zn2 and pb2 the gibbs free energy change was calculated from the following relationships 47 10 g 0 rt k d 11 k d q e c e where g 0 kj mol is the gibbs free energy change k d is the distribution coefficient then the enthalpy change h 0 and entropy change s 0 were calculated from the relationships 47 12 ln k d s 0 r h 0 rt h 0 kj mol and s 0 j mol k were estimated from the slope and intercept of plot ln k d f 1 t respectively 2 10 water quality analysis a gas chromatograph gc 6500gc system gc fid yl instrument co ltd hogye dong anyang korea was used to measure the amounts of ant and bzt a 30 m 0 25 mm inner diameter slb 5 ms fused silica capillary column with a 0 25 m film thickness was employed in the apparatus as the carrier gas helium 5 0 was employed a temperature program for the column oven ranging from 80 to 320 c was used to chromatographically separate micropollutants the temperature of the injector was fixed at 240c degrees prior to analysis chemicals were extracted from the samples using a previously developed solid phase extraction spe method phase c18 supelco 27 the amounts of zinc and lead ions were measured spectrophotometrically with merck test kits 3 results and discussion 3 1 material structure the surface morphologies of bentonites 0 700 c and bentonite cnt composites were observed using sem the sem images of ben0 ben100 ben300 ben500 and ben700 are presented in fig 1 and the sem images of ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are shown in fig 2 based on the obtained images it can be that the raw bentonite contains rock like macromolecules with rough and heterogeneous surfaces changes in the structure of bentonite were observed as the activation temperature increased and agglomerates deformed and shrank lower agglomeration is a consequence of eliminating water from the bentonite structure at higher temperatures 48 similarly lina al attar et al 40 found that the bentonite structure was intact up to 300 c based on powder x ray diffraction they also observed that the thermal treatment 150 600 c caused the gradual disappearance of the main montmorillonite peak and the minimization of calcite additionally thermogravimetric analysis confirmed dehydration and dehydroxylation of the materials during heating 40 carbon nanotubes are clearly visible in both composite samples fig 2 it is important to emphasize that some cnts can be located within the bentonite structure due to the small diameter of cnts 2 nm and the relatively high porosity of bentonite 41 as shown in fig 3 higher temperature also affected the bentonite color as a result of iron oxidation the nitrogen sorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of ben0 ben100 ben300 ben500 ben700 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are shown in fig 4 according to the iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry classification nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were type ii for ben0 ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh while ben300 ben500 and ben700 were type iii the type ii adsorption isotherms indicate unlimited adsorption due to multilayer physical adsorption after the saturation of the monolayer in contrast type iii adsorption isotherms are typical for highly macroporous adsorbents and indicate slow adsorbate adsorbent interactions interestingly the shape of the isotherms changed from type ii to type iii when bentonite was heated at temperatures of 300 500 and 700o c this is due to the elimination of water from the clay structure and the formation of larger pores 49 from the hysteresis loops it is clear that ben0 ben100 and ben300 presented the h4 class while ben500 and ben700 correspond to the h3 class both h3 and h4 hysteresis loops are characteristic of non rigid agglomerated materials with the same pore geometry however type h4 indicates also larger pores these results correspond well with the sem images because all sorbents create agglomerates with non rigid surfaces 27 50 the ben0 ben100 ben300 and ben500 samples exhibited micro and mesoporosity while ben700 was macro and mesoporous as the treatment temperature increased micropores turned into mesopores due to progressive dehydration and dehydroxylation 51 based on the sem images significant contraction of bentonite particles was observed at 300 c this may be related to dehydratation and dehydroxylation which causes a large loss of bentonite mass and a transformation of the crystal structure the porosity of ben100 swcnt was influenced by the porosity of the original materials i e ben100 and swcnt since swcnt were dominated by micropores we observed increased microporosity of ben100 swcnt similarly the increased mesoporosity of ben100 swcnt oh was related to the mesopores of swcnt oh fig s1 the ben0 ben100 ben300 and ben500 samples exhibited micro and mesoporosity while ben700 was macro and mesoporous as the treatment temperature increased micropores turned into mesopores due to progressive dehydration and dehydroxylation 51 based on the sem images significant contraction of bentonite particles was observed at 300 c this may be related to dehydratation and dehydroxylation which causes a large loss of bentonite mass and a transformation of the crystal structure the porosity of ben100 swcnt was influenced by the porosity of the original materials i e ben100 and swcnt since swcnt were dominated by micropores we observed increased microporosity of ben100 swcnt similarly the increased mesoporosity of ben100 swcnt oh was related to the mesopores of swcnt oh fig s1 it was found that the calcination of bentonite changed its structure because the increase in temperature caused a multi stage dehydration of the clays starting with water removal from the surface 50 120 c then dehydration of structural water 200 400 c and finally dehydroxylation of the inner layer 400 550 c this phenomenon increased the porosity and expanded the structure 52 the ben100 and ben300 changes in pore size from micropores to mesopores after heating to 100 and 300 c respectively resulted in lower ssa table 5 this confirms the importance of well defined micropores for the material s adsorptive specific surface area further heating up to 700 c caused further increase in pore size and decrease in ssa this result showed that it is not worthwhile to use higher temperature to activate the bentonite in this case it was enough to preheat the bentonite at 100 c to obtain larger pores 53 the addition of cnts reduced the pore size in the ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh and increase their ssa it is generally accepted that a large specific surface area and greater microporosity of an adsorbent indicates the presence of many active adsorption sites 54 55 3 2 adsorption of bzt and ant by thermally treated bentonites and bentonite cnt composites 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent type and its dose on removal percentage as seen in fig 5 the adsorption of anthracene was much higher comparing with benzotriazol overall removal percentage varied from 4 5 to 93 and from 50 to 95 5 for bzt and ant respectively this can be explained by lower water solubility and strong hydrophobicity of ant comparing with bzt these properties greatly affect an affinity of adsorbates to adsorption 56 the highest removal percentage of micropollutants was observed for ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh fig 5 this was especially important for removal of bzt since bentonites itself 0 700 c exhibited poor adsorption performance of this substance for example removal percentage of bzt among all bentonites 0 700 c reached maximally 21 while for ben100 swcnt increased to 93 it is also clear that the removal of ant and bzt slightly increased with increasing adsorbent dose since higher dose provides the higher specific surface area and more active adsorption sites 57 more specifically adsorption of bzt and ant increased 9 5 20 and 54 74 with an increase in ben100 dose 0 05 0 25 g 100 ml respectively this trend was observed for all adsorbents ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited increased adsorption of diverse organic micropollutants both with strong hydrophilicity bzt and hydrophobicity ant comparing with other bentonite based composites 58 for example unuabonah et al 59 reported a reduction of concentration of ant by 85 using humic acid modified bentonite 59 on the other hand adsorption capacity of ant by ben cnt composites is comparable with other conventional adsorbents such as zeolite and activated carbon 56 60 hedayati 56 reached 90 removal of anthracene using surfactant modified clinoptilolites zeolite on the contrary novel type of adsorbent as for example n doped reduced graphene oxide exhibited lower 58 removal efficiency of anthracene 61 in case of benzotriazole adsorption capacity of conventional adsorbents activated carbon was lower comparing to ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh 62 meinel et al 63 reported that the elimination percentage of bzt by powdered activated carbon was around 40 in single adsorption cycle 63 over 80 adsorption efficiency of bzt was observed employing granular activated carbon in filtration bed 64 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh figs 6 and 7 show the isotherms of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh from these data it was determined that ben100 swcnt exhibited the highest uptake of ant and bzt furthermore sorption uptake followed the relationship ant bzt for all sorbents to elucidate the factors controlling the adsorption mechanism and sorption affinity of organic micropollutants it is necessary to consider their hydrophobicity molecular weight ionic form and solubility the fact that adsorption of bzt was a few times lower than that of ant can be explained by its high solubility in water and low value of log k ow table 3 therefore the greater sorption uptake of ant was attributed to its hydrophobic character and low solubility in water the parameters calculated from the freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich models are presented in table 6 the fitting degree based on the correlation factor r2 showed that freundlich model was the most suitable for ben100 and ben100 swcnt while langmuir provided the best fit for ben100 swcnt oh these distinctions indicate different sorption mechanisms arising mainly from differences in the structures of these sorbents as previously mentioned ben100 and ben100 swcnt were dominated by micropores while ben100 swcnt oh had both micro and mesopores further discussion in this report is primarily focused on the parameters derived from freundlich and langmuir computations considering the adsorption of bzt as an example the k f values are 0 052 1 149 and 2 393 for ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh respectively higher values indicate greater adsorption so these results show that the ben cnt composites had a better adsorption capacity compared with bentonite alone this finding corresponds well with the ssa since sorbents with higher ssa exhibited higher adsorption capacity for organic micropollutants the n value smaller than 10 indicates favorable adsorption and heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface the significant difference in the n values between ben100 and ben cnt composites can be attributed to different chemical natures of these adsorbents due to carbon nanotubes content in ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the adsorption kinetic curves of micropollutants on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are presented in fig 8 for all sorbents the kinetic equilibrium was reached faster for bzt than ant this can be explained by the much lower molecular size of bzt compared with ant the pseudo second order model described the adsorption of micropollutants on the studied samples very well and the calculated parameters are presented in table 7 the calculated q t cal values corresponded well with experimental data q t exp this suggests that the adsorption of micropollutants followed second order kinetics and that the applied model could be used to determine the corresponding kinetic parameters based on these parameters it was determined that adsorption of bzt was the fastest thus the values of parameters h and k 2 were higher for bzt than for ant which further suggests a negative correlation between the molecular size and the adsorption rate when separately comparing the kinetic parameters for each compound the bzt adsorption kinetics increased in the order ben100 swcnt oh ben100 swcnt ben100 while for ant they increased in the order ben100 swcnt oh ben100 ben100 swcnt it is clear that more microporous sorbents i e ben100 and ben100 swcnt adsorbed both compounds faster than the mesoporous ben100 swcnt oh despite the high ssa of ben100 swcnt oh its adsorption kinetics was the slowest thus in terms of affecting the adsorption rate the microporosity of sorbents was more influential than their ssa to better understand the adsorption mechanism for these systems a weber morris intra particle diffusion model was applied 3 2 4 adsorption rate controlling mechanisms the intra particle diffusion model shows that there are several separate stages of the sorption process i e external diffusion and intra particle diffusion the non linear course of the entire adsorption process suggests a multi stage adsorption mechanism to evaluate the rate controlling mechanism the experimental data were fitted using a weber morris intra particle diffusion model shown in eq 13 65 13 q t q e t k d t 0 5 i where k d is the rate constant for intra particle diffusion and i represents the thickness of the boundary layer the kinetics of intra particle diffusion for the adsorption of bzt and ant on bentonite and bentonite cnt composites are presented in fig 9 the calculated kinetic parameters for the weber morris model are listed in table 8 for the first step of the adsorption process if the adsorption occurs solely via intra particle diffusion then the relationship q t f t 1 2 is linear and the curve passes through the origin as illustrated in fig 9a and c q t f t 1 2 for ben100 and ben100 swcnt oh consist of broken lines and do not pass through the origin this means that several processes are involved in the overall adsorption mechanism and the adsorption rate is not only controlled by intra particle diffusion the first line corresponds to adsorption on the outer surface of the adsorbent grain or to an immediate adsorption step the second line corresponds to a staged mild adsorption step where intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling mechanism of the overall adsorption process in contrast for ben100 swcnt the q t f t 1 2 is almost constant especially for bzt meaning that equilibrium was not achieved fig 9b 3 3 adsorption of zn2 and pb2 by thermally treated bentonites and ben cnt composites 3 3 1 effect of adsorbent type and its dose on percentage removal the effect of doses of bentonites 0 700 c and ben cnt composites on the removal of zn2 and pb2 are presented in fig 10 overall removal both zinc and lead were over 70 for all adsorbents from bentonites 0 700 c the highest removal of both zinc and lead was observed for ben100 and ben300 while the lowest for ben500 and ben700 decrease in adsorption performance of ben500 and ben700 can be attributed to the reduction of ssa and the increase in pore size when calcination temperature increased both the ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh composites also demonstrated high adsorption efficiencies reaching around 90 increase in the adsorbent s concentration from 0 05 to 0 25 g 100 ml did not significantly increase the removal of lead this trend was observed both for bentonites 0 700 c and ben cnt adsorbents for zinc adsorption effect of dose of bentonites 0 700 c was negligible while increase in ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh dose from 0 05 to 0 25 g 100 ml resulted in increase in zinc adsorption from 72 to 89 and from 90 5 to 98 7 respectively with increasing ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh doses more adsorption sites were provided by carbon nanotubes that effectively capture zinc 66 good adsorption potential of ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh for zinc and lead corresponds well with literature data many previous studies have confirmed the capabilities of clay materials to remove heavy metal ions 66 67 kakaei et al 68 achieved 90 removal of lead in adsorption on imidazole modified bentonite they also found that an increase in the mass of the adsorbent resulted in a higher removal efficiency in adsorption of heavy metal ions 68 high efficiency i e 88 zinc removal was demonstrated using bentonite zeolite adsorbent 69 other studies have shown that bentonite zeolite composites exhibit high efficiency for removing copper and zinc ions 69 lower effectiveness of pb2 removal maximum 43 7 was achieved with the use of pine cone activated carbon 70 adsorption study of zinc and lead by multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnt show the increase in their removal from 47 3 to 72 9 for pb2 and from 37 60 up to 65 5 for zn2 with increase in mass of mwcnt from 0 05 g to 0 25 g 71 for example saif chaudhry 72 described the adsorption of zinc and lead by sand coated with manganese oxide where they achieved a maximum lead and zinc uptake of 83 3 and 88 9 respectively 72 while esmaeili et al 67 found that the so called red earth achieved the removal of zinc and lead ions in the range of 84 99 9 depending on adsorbent dose 67 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms of zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh in this study the equilibrium data obtained for the adsorption of zinc by ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh concentration of zn2 was 0 mg l after adsorption by ben100 and lead by ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh was analyzed by langmuir freundlich and dubinin raduskevich equations here only the langmuir adsorption isotherms are presented for showing the interactions between adsorbates and adsorbents figs 11 and 12 as correlation coefficients r2 0 9 obtained from the langmuir was closer to unity than freundlich and dubinin raduskevich models from the higher q m values for zinc table 9 it was identified that ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited better potential to remove zinc than lead from aqueous solution this corresponds well with removal percentage results as they show the same tendency better adsorption of zinc is probably related to its smaller ionic radius 0 074 nm than that for lead 0 119 nm 73 74 owing to this zn2 diffuses easier into porous structure of adsorbents and is adsorbed metal s ions can be adsorbed via physical adsorption chemisorption or ion exchange 75 from the values of adsorption energy sorption mechanism can be determined adsorption energy e value below 8 kj mol shows a physisorption process between 8 kj mol and 16 kj mol indicates ion exchange mechanism while that above 16 kj mol indicates a chemisorption process 76 as can be seen in table 9 the value of adsorption energy shows that the ion exchange was the main adsorption mechanism of zinc and lead by ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh in case of adsorption of lead by ben100 the adsorption behavior was related to chemisorption 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics of zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the kinetic adsorption curves for zn2 and pb2 on ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh are shown in fig 13 for ben100 adsorption of both metals was completed immediately thus determination of kinetics in this system adsorbent adsorbate was not possible no data points this may be because bentonite has a phenomenal adsorption capacity which is related to its pore structure in terms of the adsorption of zinc and lead ions the calculated values q t cal corresponded well with the experimental data q t exp this suggests that their adsorption kinetics were consistent with the model which can therefore be used to determine appropriate kinetic parameters in each case the time needed to reach the equilibrium was very short 30 min which indicates easy availability of the adsorption sites as seen in fig 13 and table 10 zinc was adsorbed faster than lead for both ben cnt composites more specifically adsorption rate h of zinc was 3 mg g min for ben100 swcnt and 23 mg g min for ben100 swcnt oh while for lead 0 26 mg g min and 0 28 mg g min for ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh respectively it means that zinc was adsorbed preferentially by both composite adsorbents xue et al found that adsorption depends on competition between different metals for adsorption sites 77 kinetic constant for zinc adsorption by ben100 swcnt oh was 28 7 g mg min while 3 25 g mg min for ben100 swcnt it means that adsorption of zinc on ben100 swcnt oh was much faster than on ben100 swcnt it is attributed with the sorption mechanism results mainly from the cloud interactions between metal ions and functional groups of the swcnt oh surface 78 however for lead opposite trend was observed so its adsorption kinetics was faster on ben100 swcnt thus these results indicate that the mechanism of different metal ions adsorption by the ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh is not the same 3 4 thermodynamic analysis of adsorption of bzt ant zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the thermodynamics calculations showed that adsorption process of bzt ant zn2 and pb2 on ben100 and ben cnt composites differ in nature as seen in table 11 the gibbs free energy change g 0 had a negative value for adsorption of bzt and ant on ben cnt composites while positive for ben100 on the other hand for adsorption of zn2 and pb2 was negative for all adsorbents the negative values of g 0 suggested that adsorption is spontaneous thermodynamically favorable and physical in nature as g 0 was in the range of 0 20 kj mol 79 moreover a positive values of enthalpy change h 0 indicates an endothermic adsorption of bzt and ant on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh which was also confirmed by the increase in adsorption capacity with the increasing temperature 80 on the contrary adsorption of zn2 and pb2 was exothermic as both enthalpy and entropy changes were negative which was related to the decrease in adsorption capacity with the increasing temperature from 293 to 313 k 4 adsorbents feasibility and future perspectives polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and heavy metals are hazardous pollutants that commonly coexist in water the adsorption study carried out with the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants bzt and ant and heavy metals zn2 and pb2 by the ben cnt composites showed high removal efficiency of both groups of pollutants in the case of conventional adsorbents such as bentonite halloysite and activated carbon the adsorption efficiency in multi component systems show that adsorption efficiency is lower compared to solutions containing only one type of contaminants 81 the effectiveness of both pahs and heavy metals removal depends on several parameters such as the size of the adsorbent particles adsorbents dose and ph temperature solubility salinity of the solution therefore it is difficult to unequivocally compare a feasibility of adsorbents in removal of organic and inorganic pollutants as seen in table 12 adsorption potential of ben cnt composites against other adsorbents is comparable or even higher especially when we consider organic and inorganic adsorbates ben cnt composites are more versatile than pure clay adsorbents considering a significant improvement of adsorption capacity of ben cnt composites 40 wt loading of carbon nanotubes is reasoned first of all we prepared adsorbents with an advantageous cost quality and efficiency balance comparing with other alternative adsorbent such as carbon nanotubes table 13 presents a comparison of costs of different adsorbents it is clear that using bentonite as a base material for composite has significantly lowered the cost of this adsorbent due to its almost zero price on the other hand carbon nanotubes are expensive materials but have superior functional properties which give high adsorption efficiency and fast kinetics thus combining bentonite with carbon nanotubes in composite material results in novel and attractive adsorbent with optimum qualifications regarding to economic feasibility and removal efficiency many factors can influence or limit the use of the new materials including environmental considerations cost and efficiency of disposal therefore it is important to study their adsorption capacity in lab scale before practical applications in that context the results of batch adsorption experiments can provide valuable information compared to other adsorbents the effectiveness of removing micropollutants and heavy metals at the same time was higher which indicates that it is an excellent adsorbent with a higher adsorption capacity and faster adsorption rate the research in the batch system presented in this paper is therefore the basis for further research in the engineering aspect 5 summary in this study adsorption potential of bentonites 0 700 c and ben cnt composites for simultaneous removal of benzotriazole anthracene and trace heavy metals zn and pb from rainwater was evaluated increase in heating temperature of bentonite resulted in the higher surface area and pore size of ben 100 700 c comparing with ben0 ben100 was selected for the preparation of ben cnt composites as having relatively high ssa and pore size suitable to upload carbon nanotubes ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh exhibited the largest specific surface area and greater microporosity comparing with bentonites themselves the presented results suggest that bentonites are a suitable sorbent material for adsorbing metal ions from aqueous solutions while poorly adsorb organic compounds especially that with strong hydrophilicity from bentonites 0 700 c the highest removal of both zinc and lead was observed for ben100 and ben300 while the lowest for ben500 and ben700 this is important to emphasize that these results uniquely confirm that ben cnt composites have a great potential for simultaneous removal of diverse organic micropollutants with strong hydrophilicity bzt or hydrophobicity ant as well as heavy metlas the highest removal of bzt 93 was obtained for ben100 swcnt during adsorption of ant and bzt the time required to reach equilibrium was very short 30 min using ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh the maximum adsorption capacity based on the freundlich equation was observed for ben100 swcnt for ant complete adsorption of zinc ions 100 and over 90 adsorption of lead ions were achieved by ben100 adsorption of zinc on ben100 swcnt oh was much faster than on ben100 swcnt while for lead opposite trend was observed thermodynamic analysis showed that adsorption of bzt and ant was endothermic while exothermic for zn2 and pb2 on ben100 ben100 swcnt and ben100 swcnt oh significantly this study shows that this is worthful to prepare bentonite cnt composites as these adsorbents represent satisfied cost feasibility balance comparing with others alternative adsorbents the following is the

13114,antibiotic resistance genes args carried by antibiotic resistant bacteria arb have been present in large numbers in wastewater wastewater treatment plants wwtps are regarded as reservoirs and sources for a wide variety of args a large number of mobile genetic elements mges heavy metals and emerging pollutants e g microplastics nanomaterials pharmaceuticals and personal care products and quorum sensing inhibitors detected in wwtps can impact the proliferation of args moreover the removal efficiency of args is limited in wastewater treatment processes therefore it is of significance to summarize the research status of args in wwtps this paper reviewed the occurrence and transmission of args the problem of multiple drug resistance and elimination of arb were assessed in wwtps also the effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on args in wwtps were summarized furthermore physical treatment and advanced oxidation processes for args removal were critically discussed future research prospects were proposed with the ultimate goal to reduce the potential harm of args to ecological environments and to provide guidance for practical applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistance genes wastewater treatment plant mobile genetic elements antibiotic resistant bacteria heavy metal and emerging pollutants removal methods 1 introduction antibiotics are widely released into the environment as a result of their use and abuse for human applications and animal husbandry 1 a large number of antibiotic types have been detected in soil surface water and groundwater in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and even in drinking water 2 4 the increase of antibiotics into the environment over time has been accompanied by the proliferation and transmission of antibiotic resistance genes args in microorganisms 5 args are emerging environmental pollution problems 6 which have been identified as one of the most significant challenges to human health by the world health organization who 7 and are more difficult to control than traditional chemical pollutants especially wwtps are regarded as major reservoirs of resistance genes 5 because here urban and agricultural wastewater polluted by potentially large amounts of antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and their args as a result of veterinary and medical use are collected for treatment fig 1 the biological treatment process in wwtps creates a potentially favorable environment for the development and spread of resistance genes as bacteria are constantly exposed to antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations promoting the proliferation of args and resulting in more and novel arb 8 10 as such wwtps can be considered as major sources of the spread of arb and their args that subsequently contaminate a variety of environments 3 the effluent from wwtps that is discharged into the downstream water environment fig 1 still contains args and studies have confirmed that the abundance of effluent args has increased significantly relative to the concentration in the influx water 11 13 resistance genes have even been detected in aerosols above the wwtps 14 16 therefore the investigation of args and arb in wwtps is of great importance a number of important review articles have recently been published that summarize the occurrence characteristics and transmission of args in an aquatic environment and especially in wastewater treatment systems 2 3 17 22 these articles also summarized some mitigation strategies to control the occurrence and transmission of args in wwtps providing important references for the current and future research on args in wwtps the main strategies to limit spread of args attempt to degrade the antibiotics to which they refer resistance or to destroy the bacteria carrying these genes the subject of args in wwtps continuously needs to be updated and summarized as new studies become available especially for publications on efficient removal methods for args moreover more and more industrial wastewater is entering wwtps that contains heavy metals and the presence of heavy metals may aggravate the harm of args to the environment 23 24 copper zinc nickel and cadmium ions can all commonly be detected in wwtps and these can result in an increased abundance of args and affect the spread of args 25 26 although the spread of metal resistance genes mrgs under stress of different contaminants needs to be further studied correlations between mrgs and args can be assumed other emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products disinfectants quorum sensing inhibitors and nanomaterials 25 27 29 may not only pose novel threats to human health even at low concentrations but they may also have effects on args although data on this is still relatively limited this review concentrates on args in wwtps and is divided into five parts 1 the occurrence characteristics and dissemination of args in wwtps 2 arb and multiple drug resistance in wwtps 3 the effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on args 4 the efficiency of physical treatment processes and advanced oxidation processes aops on the removal of args from wastewater and 5 the prospects for args in wwtps this study proposed targeted prospects regarding args in wwtps to provide guidance for reducing the harm of args in the ecological environment 2 scientometric analysis the data used in this paper was collected from the web of science that was searched with terms antibiotic resistance genes and wastewater or activated sludge or wwtps relevant to args and wastewater treatment systems in 2006 pruden and colleagues were the first to describe args as emerging pollutants rather than being a consequence of pollutants that could affect human health 6 therefore the literature review was limited on the progress and emerging trends in this area published between 2006 and 2020 exact date range 2006 01 01 2020 12 31 the collected data were analyzed and visualized using citespace fig s1 the number of publications and the main journals in which these works have been published as well as partnerships between research institutions were identified to gain an in depth understanding of current research hotspots and trends in this field fig 2 an increase in the number of articles published on the subject was observed since 2013 and this increase has been more rapid since 2018 fig 2a indicating that the research related to args in wastewater treatment has gained

research attention is drawn to the research on args in wastewater treatment systems which is of significance to solve the long term potential problems of args to ecological environments and ensure human health 3 occurrence characteristics and transmission routes of args in wwtps 3 1 occurrence characteristics of args some characteristics of antibiotics and args in studies are summarized in table 1 as the production of many kinds of antibiotics is huge eventually a fraction of those used antibiotics turn up in wwtps in particular tetracycline sulfonamides quinolones and macrolides the genes resulting in their resistance are equally widely spread in microbial communities of wwtps for instance args were detected in the effluent from 62 wwtps in the netherlands which were active against macrolides ermb sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 fluoroquinolones qnra and ultra broad spectrum lactams bla ctm 14 while in the aeration tanks of 16 wwtps in china genes resulting in resistance against aminoglycosides aac aacc1 etc lactamases bla bla cmy 2 1 etc tetracycline tetc tetq etc sulfonamide sul1 sul2 etc and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mlsb erea ermb etc were detected 30 a number of studies originating from various geographical regions dealt with different types of influents and different treatment processes most of the studied args were genes providing resistance to β lactams bla kpc bla ndm etc macrolides ermb ermc etc fluroquinolone qnrs qnrc etc chloramphenicol cmx cmtb3 etc and trimethoprim qfra17 and qfra12 etc and these were detected in wwtps from different countries including various regions in china the yangtze river delta and the pearl river table 1 the studied wastewater was mainly urban domestic industrial and medical wastewater 15 31 36 the water treatment methods included conventional microbial treatment processes anoxic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o treatment sequencing batch reactors sbr and membrane bioreactors mbr these have relatively poor removal efficiency for args bla tem bla oxa 48 tetc etc and may even result in their enrichment 14 37 40 this may be because these processes have been optimized for removal of traditional pollutants such as organics and nutrients which may be suboptimal for removal of args other treatment processes such as electrochemical disinfection microbial fuel cells mfcs and thermal hydrolysis pretreatment were more effective as the abundance of args detected in their effluent was significantly reduced for instance treatment of wastewater containing 23 different args aacc sul1 vanwb etc by electrochemical disinfection resulted in a decrease of arb between 9 and 100 38 the mfc method could not only remove norfloxacin a fluoroquinolone with an efficiency of 65 5 but resistance genes towards this antibiotic were decreased as well 41 these methods seem to be promising technologies for wastewater treatment containing antibiotics and have the potential to reduce or avoid args selection or transfer one study described thermal hydrolysis pretreatment in anaerobic digestion which almost completely decreased all args sul1 tetw aacc1 etc in activated sludge and thus provided effective clues for controlling the spread of args 42 the occurrence of args in aerosols above a wwtp has also been investigated aerosols containing args carrying bacteria that are pathogenic upon inhalation may represent a health hazard some studies have investigated the occurrence characteristics of args strb teta ermb etc in aerosols pm2 5 and pm10 of wwtps near farms hospitals and laboratory from china table 1 at least one of these detected a large number of args including bla tem tetw ermb and dnrs 15 the spatial and temporal differentiation of bacterial communities and args abundance and the compositions mobility and potential hosts of args found in air have strong implications for the spatial and temporal scale of human inhalation exposure a study reported the spatial and temporal differentiation of args tetq cmla1 etc in air total suspended particles above the oxidation ditch in the wwtps near animal farms from southern china 16 this suggests that analysis of args in airborne particles can enhance our overall understanding of environmental args transmission and their potential health threats the investigation of args present in aerosols is an interesting approach but has not received much attention so far in summary the current literature has focused on args detected in influent and effluent in wwtps while the data on args present in aerosols near wwtps is still limited and would need further investigation 3 2 transmission routes of args in wwtps in addition to args present on bacteriophages and plasmids which are readily transferable between bacterial cells the spread of args between microorganism cells strains and species is also accommodated by mobile genetic elements mges such as integrons or transposons these allow for horizontal transfer as well as vertical transmission high abundance of mge genes inti1 inti2 and tnpa 02 was detected in water from wwtps from multiple countries table 1 the integrase gene inti1 is a marker for presence of class 1 integrons and frequent detection of this gene 31 43 45 suggests that these mges are important for persistence and proliferation of args moreover transposons typified by the genes tnpa and tnpa 02 were detected in aerosols of wwtps in beijing and the yangtze river delta which was directly related to the transmission of resistance genes 15 inferring a cross regional correlation between args and mges interestingly rainfall was found to significantly reduce the removal efficiency of inti1 containing entities in wwtps 14 an observation that is worth further study the extensive use of antibiotics can lead to the rapid proliferation of arb through both horizontal migration and vertical transmission of args thus posing a threat to animal and human health 46 the challenges connected to the study of args in environmental reservoirs are mainly related to the processes behind the transport of contaminants in the different environmental matrices sludge water etc the antibiotic resistome in wwtps according to the treatment processes has been intensively studied a long term investigation of wwtps has showed remarkable changes in the antibiotic resistome every 2 3 years and some args tetx ermb etc have already been transferred in activated sludge 47 freshwater environments are considered reservoirs and transmission routes for args 48 a study has found that the transmission of args in human impacted river sites is much higher than in pristine rivers sites 49 moreover the effluent from wwtps around rivers has an obvious impact on transmission of args in water 50 therefore the study of transmission of args is of great value at present 4 multidrug resistance and arb in wwtps 4 1 multidrug resistance in wwtps the different types of args detected in wwtps strongly suggest the presence of multi resistant bacteria although this is only indirectly inferred from the evidence unless multiple args are detected in single bacterial cells or in single dna entities however it is well known that args are often combined in multidrug resistant organisms frequently found in combination on integrons wastewater contains a large number of different types of antibiotics which was shown to be conducive to the formation of multi drug resistance 46 some types of args detected in wwtps were consistent with the type of antibiotics that are widely used in that geographic region in line with the assumption that selection by antibiotic contaminants determines the type of args in wwtps in addition there were some args found in wwtps against less commonly used drugs such as chloramphenicol fosfomycin and rifamycin as exemplified from wwtps in hong kong 45 and chloramphenicol in seoul south korea 51 table 1 these args were also found to be widespread in ecosystems and in natural hosts such as human and livestock although now less frequently used antibiotics such as chloramphenicol have been used widely in the past selecting for resistance in microbes at the time of use and the presently detected args are still remnants of those past selection pressures other args are possibly the result of co selection with more commonly used antibiotics cos election is common as multiple args are often present on integrons and transposons wwtps are a source of dissemination and reservoirs of multidrug resistant bacteria necessitating strategies to limit this 4 2 arb in wwtps a number of studies concentrated on drug resistant bacteria and pathogenic bacteria detected in wwtps examples are actinomycetes species or helicobacter pylori detected in wwtps in seoul south korea 51 proteobacteria detected in zhuozhou hebei 38 and pseudomonas and campylobacter species detected in finland 52 table 1 the arb in these wwtps were diverse and the composition and structure of the microbial community including fractions of arb changed as a result of water treatment the drug resistant bacteria and pathogens in wastewater contained a variety of args including genes giving resistance to macrolides β lactams and aminoglycosides fosfomycin polymyxin and tetracycline 53 55 for escherichia coli only a minor fraction of 0 7 could be found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics but for enterococci this could be as high as 100 56 57 a number of studies reported slightly higher multi drug resistance rates in the effluent than in influent of wwtps but other studies have reported the opposite one publication described that 3 8 of the bacteria isolated from influent were resistant to six antibiotics while that proportion rose to 6 9 in chlorinated effluent 57 the drug resistance rates of enterococcus to vancomycin 1 0 and ciprofloxacin 4 0 in wastewater a o treatment only reduced to 0 7 and 3 4 respectively 58 after wastewater treatment some pathogens remained present in the discharge and these may carry args 59 in summary it is very important to study all kinds of arb in wwtps and the research towards this needs to be further strengthened 5 effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on args in wwtps 5 1 effects of heavy metals on args combined presence of heavy metals and antibiotics has become a common phenomenon in environmental pollution recently more attention is given to microbial co resistance towards heavy metals and antibiotics their combined pollution and the relationship between args and mrgs the studies that we have identified are summarized in table 2 the number of publications is currently limited and it is difficult to draw strong conclusions as more pollutants are present the interaction between these pollutants becomes more complex and the outcome on bacterial communities is more uncertain heavy metals can form complexes with antibiotics in the environment and their formation may be relevant to their combined toxicological effects presence of zinc and lead significantly positively correlated with args resulting in erythromycin resistance ereb mefa mefe ermb indicating that combined pollution can have synergistic effects on bacteria and water quality 60 there is no consensus on the consequences of combined pollution of args and heavy metals it has been reported that long term exposure of both cu ii and tetracycline results in lower abundance of args in effluent of an sbr than presence of cu ii or tetracycline alone 61 in contrast the coexistence of cu ii and chloramphenicol had a significant impact on the relative abundance of args in this case sulfonamide resistance genes indicating that their combined presence would aggravate the pollution of effluent 62 resistance genes acting towards antibiotics and heavy metals could persist the treatment processes in wwtps and their shared association with mges most likely contributes to their linked transmission 63 64 that most likely explains why mrgs active towards cd cu or zn were positively correlated with args in medical wastewater 65 69 further investigations are needed to study how heavy metals and their resistance genes may affect the proliferation and transmission of args in wastewater treatment systems 5 2 effects of emerging pollutants on args a number of publications were identified that described the impact of emerging pollutants on args these described nanomaterials disinfectants or personal care products containing either of these and quorum sensing inhibitors of which nanomaterials were the most frequently studied emerging pollutants in this context 70 74 table 3 microplastics can concentrate args by providing a support on which arg bearing bacteria multiply as was demonstrated by metagenomic analysis of seawater 75 the development of quorum sensing inhibitors which are considered a promising alternative to antibiotics means that microorganisms are increasingly being exposed to these compounds alongside with antibiotics present in the environment so it is necessary to study the effect of quorum sensing inhibitors on args it has been confirmed that the quorum sensing inhibitor 2 5h furanone may indeed influence the proliferation and transmission of args 76 the antibacterial compound triclocarban which was once a common ingredient in personal care products but has since been phased out had little effect on mges triclosan which is still frequently used could promote the proliferation of specific args in particular tetracycline resistance genes and mexb mfd mdtb mexw pata and mexk 77 78 it can be expected that in the future more emerging pollutants will be recognized that have an impact on args 6 methods for removal of args in wwtps multiple studies have been carried out that aim to remove arb and their args from wastewater using different processes the efficiency of arg removal using physical treatment processes has been studied under different operating conditions membrane filtration was compared for membranes of different pore sizes giving microfiltration a pore size of 0 45 to 0 1 μm ultrafiltration and nanofiltration these removed bla tem from wastewater at different efficiencies with microfiltration removing up to 1 log unit gene copies 100 ml wastewater increasing to 1 7 log units removal at 100 kda 4 7 log units at 10 kda and 5 7 log units at 1 kda 79 granular filtration combined with adsorption on granular activated carbon gac was investigated for reduction of args under different operational conditions different filter media grain sizes and backwash protocols but no obvious gain in removal efficiency of args was observed compared to sand filtration 80 81 a study has found that physical treatment processes adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration did not cause release args from arb and were powerful methods to eradicate arb args especially for low budget communities 82 compared with such physical treatment processes advanced oxidation processes aops are more efficient for removal of args ultraviolet uv disinfection alone could significantly remove genes conferring resistance to tetracycline and sulfonamides from wastewater with reductions of tetw and teto in the effluent of around 1 3 log 83 84 however although uv disinfection can kill bacteria and damage dna its potential for removal of args is limited 85 86 the bactericidal effect of ozone another treatment frequently applied depends on the type of microbial communities being present and while full scale ozone treatment of wastewater could reduce concentrations of arb limited removal of args vana bla vim has been reported during wastewater compared to removal of arb enterococci p aeruginosa 7 87 chlorination is the most widely used disinfection method in wastewater treatment some researchers have reported that chlorination can efficiently remove arb and the optimal chlorination concentration for removal of chloramphenicol resistant bacteria was determined 88 nevertheless other studies have shown that this method is inefficient for the removal of arb 89 nanocomposite materials have been synthesized that assist in removal of pollutants from water researchers have reviewed the studies on args removal efficiency by nanotechnology 90 and nanoparticles synthesized from metal and metal oxide significantly reduced the diversity of args with a decreased abundance by 1 4 3 2 orders of magnitude 29 ezeuko et al have reviewed the potential of silver and silica oxide nanoparticles for removal of arb args pseudomonas aeruginosa methicillin resistant s aureus etc in wastewater considering that incorporating metallic nanoparticles is desirable a way to remove them in wastewater 91 the nanocomposite tio2 ag go was shown to significantly remove tetracycline resistant bacteria e coli hb101 but the horizontal gene transfer was promoted from 1 to 2 folds with the addition of it 28 ceo2 as rare metals can also remove free dna carrying resistance genes from tap water 92 these studies provide a theoretical basis for the synthesis of new nanomaterials to deal with args in wastewater however aops still have some shortcomings the previous study has reported that secondary pollution of args resistomes co selecting and nucleobase responses were main defects of aops indicating that aops should not be regarded as state of the art processing technology 93 in addition although both physical treatment methods and aops can remove args from wastewater it is not possible to determine the total removal amounts 94 overall these removal methods are effective for specific args and the combination of them may improve removal efficiency 7 conclusion and prospects args present in wastewater accumulate and propagate in wwtps their presence depends on the wastewater source and water quality and args can also be detected in aerosols in the direct vicinity of wwtps the removal of args from wastewater depends on the treatment process of the wwtp but frequently args remain present in the effluent the removal efficiency of args by conventional biological water treatment processes is low mges can be present at high abundance in wwtps and these may promote the proliferation and propagation of args likewise arb are frequently found in wastewater treatment systems and the efficiency of their removal is low the presence of heavy metals their resistance genes and other emerging pollutants all have an effect on args in wwtps however the interactions between these in complex wastewater environments has not been clearly explained compared other removal methods aops showed a relatively high removal efficiency for args and arb but these complex processes also have limitations such as high operation costs and unsatisfactory removal efficiency which needs to be improved research directions should continue to investigate args in wwtps to control their spread and provide guidance for future applications fig 3 we put forward the following prospects according to the current situation of args in wwtps 1 it is needed to explore efficient rapid and comprehensive methods for args detection so that these genes can be monitored in water treatment processes in a high throughput manner this will lead to a better understanding of their fate in wastewater treatment and the corresponding aerosol environment and this will provide a basis for quantitative ecological risk evaluation of arb and args 2 the most common arb should be accurately identified and investigated to identify the major transmission routes for args 3 the effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on the performance of activated sludge systems should be analyzed and synergistic effects of these and antimicrobial residues in wastewater on the microorganisms their resistances and the proliferation and transmission of args need to be studied 4 the combination of multiple aops should be adopted and developed to allow for synergistic removal of antibiotics and args to improve the removal from effluent and to reduce the costs of treatment 5 clarification of the mechanism of args removal and their relationships with operating parameters in different processes in wwtps is necessary for process optimization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13114,antibiotic resistance genes args carried by antibiotic resistant bacteria arb have been present in large numbers in wastewater wastewater treatment plants wwtps are regarded as reservoirs and sources for a wide variety of args a large number of mobile genetic elements mges heavy metals and emerging pollutants e g microplastics nanomaterials pharmaceuticals and personal care products and quorum sensing inhibitors detected in wwtps can impact the proliferation of args moreover the removal efficiency of args is limited in wastewater treatment processes therefore it is of significance to summarize the research status of args in wwtps this paper reviewed the occurrence and transmission of args the problem of multiple drug resistance and elimination of arb were assessed in wwtps also the effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on args in wwtps were summarized furthermore physical treatment and advanced oxidation processes for args removal were critically discussed future research prospects were proposed with the ultimate goal to reduce the potential harm of args to ecological environments and to provide guidance for practical applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistance genes wastewater treatment plant mobile genetic elements antibiotic resistant bacteria heavy metal and emerging pollutants removal methods 1 introduction antibiotics are widely released into the environment as a result of their use and abuse for human applications and animal husbandry 1 a large number of antibiotic types have been detected in soil surface water and groundwater in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and even in drinking water 2 4 the increase of antibiotics into the environment over time has been accompanied by the proliferation and transmission of antibiotic resistance genes args in microorganisms 5 args are emerging environmental pollution problems 6 which have been identified as one of the most significant challenges to human health by the world health organization who 7 and are more difficult to control than traditional chemical pollutants especially wwtps are regarded as major reservoirs of resistance genes 5 because here urban and agricultural wastewater polluted by potentially large amounts of antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and their args as a result of veterinary and medical use are collected for treatment fig 1 the biological treatment process in wwtps creates a potentially favorable environment for the development and spread of resistance genes as bacteria are constantly exposed to antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations promoting the proliferation of args and resulting in more and novel arb 8 10 as such wwtps can be considered as major sources of the spread of arb and their args that subsequently contaminate a variety of environments 3 the effluent from wwtps that is discharged into the downstream water environment fig 1 still contains args and studies have confirmed that the abundance of effluent args has increased significantly relative to the concentration in the influx water 11 13 resistance genes have even been detected in aerosols above the wwtps 14 16 therefore the investigation of args and arb in wwtps is of great importance a number of important review articles have recently been published that summarize the occurrence characteristics and transmission of args in an aquatic environment and especially in wastewater treatment systems 2 3 17 22 these articles also summarized some mitigation strategies to control the occurrence and transmission of args in wwtps providing important references for the current and future research on args in wwtps the main strategies to limit spread of args attempt to degrade the antibiotics to which they refer resistance or to destroy the bacteria carrying these genes the subject of args in wwtps continuously needs to be updated and summarized as new studies become available especially for publications on efficient removal methods for args moreover more and more industrial wastewater is entering wwtps that contains heavy metals and the presence of heavy metals may aggravate the harm of args to the environment 23 24 copper zinc nickel and cadmium ions can all commonly be detected in wwtps and these can result in an increased abundance of args and affect the spread of args 25 26 although the spread of metal resistance genes mrgs under stress of different contaminants needs to be further studied correlations between mrgs and args can be assumed other emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products disinfectants quorum sensing inhibitors and nanomaterials 25 27 29 may not only pose novel threats to human health even at low concentrations but they may also have effects on args although data on this is still relatively limited this review concentrates on args in wwtps and is divided into five parts 1 the occurrence characteristics and dissemination of args in wwtps 2 arb and multiple drug resistance in wwtps 3 the effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on args 4 the efficiency of physical treatment processes and advanced oxidation processes aops on the removal of args from wastewater and 5 the prospects for args in wwtps this study proposed targeted prospects regarding args in wwtps to provide guidance for reducing the harm of args in the ecological environment 2 scientometric analysis the data used in this paper was collected from the web of science that was searched with terms antibiotic resistance genes and wastewater or activated sludge or wwtps relevant to args and wastewater treatment systems in 2006 pruden and colleagues were the first to describe args as emerging pollutants rather than being a consequence of pollutants that could affect human health 6 therefore the literature review was limited on the progress and emerging trends in this area published between 2006 and 2020 exact date range 2006 01 01 2020 12 31 the collected data were analyzed and visualized using citespace fig s1 the number of publications and the main journals in which these works have been published as well as partnerships between research institutions were identified to gain an in depth understanding of current research hotspots and trends in this field fig 2 an increase in the number of articles published on the subject was observed since 2013 and this increase has been more rapid since 2018 fig 2a indicating that the research related to args in wastewater treatment has gained

research attention is drawn to the research on args in wastewater treatment systems which is of significance to solve the long term potential problems of args to ecological environments and ensure human health 3 occurrence characteristics and transmission routes of args in wwtps 3 1 occurrence characteristics of args some characteristics of antibiotics and args in studies are summarized in

since been phased out had little effect on mges triclosan which is still frequently used could promote the proliferation of specific args in particular tetracycline resistance genes and mexb mfd mdtb mexw pata and mexk 77 78 it can be expected that in the future more emerging pollutants will be recognized that have an impact on args 6 methods for removal of args in wwtps multiple studies have been carried out that aim to remove arb and their args from wastewater using different processes the efficiency of arg removal using physical treatment processes has been studied under different operating conditions membrane filtration was compared for membranes of different pore sizes giving microfiltration a pore size of 0 45 to 0 1 μm ultrafiltration and nanofiltration these removed bla tem from wastewater at different efficiencies with microfiltration removing up to 1 log unit gene copies 100 ml wastewater increasing to 1 7 log units removal at 100 kda 4 7 log units at 10 kda and 5 7 log units at 1 kda 79 granular filtration combined with adsorption on granular activated carbon gac was investigated for reduction of args under different operational conditions different filter media grain sizes and backwash protocols but no obvious gain in removal efficiency of args was observed compared to sand filtration 80 81 a study has found that physical treatment processes adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration did not cause release args from arb and were powerful methods to eradicate arb args especially for low budget communities 82 compared with such physical treatment processes advanced oxidation processes aops are more efficient for removal of args ultraviolet uv disinfection alone could significantly remove genes conferring resistance to tetracycline and sulfonamides from wastewater with reductions of tetw and teto in the effluent of around 1 3 log 83 84 however although uv disinfection can kill bacteria and damage dna its potential for removal of args is limited 85 86 the bactericidal effect of ozone another treatment frequently applied depends on the type of microbial communities being present and while full scale ozone treatment of wastewater could reduce concentrations of arb limited removal of args vana bla vim has been reported during wastewater compared to removal of arb enterococci p aeruginosa 7 87 chlorination is the most widely used disinfection method in wastewater treatment some researchers have reported that chlorination can efficiently remove arb and the optimal chlorination concentration for removal of chloramphenicol resistant bacteria was determined 88 nevertheless other studies have shown that this method is inefficient for the removal of arb 89 nanocomposite materials have been synthesized that assist in removal of pollutants from water researchers have reviewed the studies on args removal efficiency by nanotechnology 90 and nanoparticles synthesized from metal and metal oxide significantly reduced the diversity of args with a decreased abundance by 1 4 3 2 orders of magnitude 29 ezeuko et al have reviewed the potential of silver and silica oxide nanoparticles for removal of arb args pseudomonas aeruginosa methicillin resistant s aureus etc in wastewater considering that incorporating metallic nanoparticles is desirable a way to remove them in wastewater 91 the nanocomposite tio2 ag go was shown to significantly remove tetracycline resistant bacteria e coli hb101 but the horizontal gene transfer was promoted from 1 to 2 folds with the addition of it 28 ceo2 as rare metals can also remove free dna carrying resistance genes from tap water 92 these studies provide a theoretical basis for the synthesis of new nanomaterials to deal with args in wastewater however aops still have some shortcomings the previous study has reported that secondary pollution of args resistomes co selecting and nucleobase responses were main defects of aops indicating that aops should not be regarded as state of the art processing technology 93 in addition although both physical treatment methods and aops can remove args from wastewater it is not possible to determine the total removal amounts 94 overall these removal methods are effective for specific args and the combination of them may improve removal efficiency 7 conclusion and prospects args present in wastewater accumulate and propagate in wwtps their presence depends on the wastewater source and water quality and args can also be detected in aerosols in the direct vicinity of wwtps the removal of args from wastewater depends on the treatment process of the wwtp but frequently args remain present in the effluent the removal efficiency of args by conventional biological water treatment processes is low mges can be present at high abundance in wwtps and these may promote the proliferation and propagation of args likewise arb are frequently found in wastewater treatment systems and the efficiency of their removal is low the presence of heavy metals their resistance genes and other emerging pollutants all have an effect on args in wwtps however the interactions between these in complex wastewater environments has not been clearly explained compared other removal methods aops showed a relatively high removal efficiency for args and arb but these complex processes also have limitations such as high operation costs and unsatisfactory removal efficiency which needs to be improved research directions should continue to investigate args in wwtps to control their spread and provide guidance for future applications fig 3 we put forward the following prospects according to the current situation of args in wwtps 1 it is needed to explore efficient rapid and comprehensive methods for args detection so that these genes can be monitored in water treatment processes in a high throughput manner this will lead to a better understanding of their fate in wastewater treatment and the corresponding aerosol environment and this will provide a basis for quantitative ecological risk evaluation of arb and args 2 the most common arb should be accurately identified and investigated to identify the major transmission routes for args 3 the effects of heavy metals and emerging pollutants on the performance of activated sludge systems should be analyzed and synergistic effects of these and antimicrobial residues in wastewater on the microorganisms their resistances and the proliferation and transmission of args need to be studied 4 the combination of multiple aops should be adopted and developed to allow for synergistic removal of antibiotics and args to improve the removal from effluent and to reduce the costs of treatment 5 clarification of the mechanism of args removal and their relationships with operating parameters in different processes in wwtps is necessary for process optimization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
