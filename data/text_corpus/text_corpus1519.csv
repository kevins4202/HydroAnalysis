7595,addressing systematic biases in regional climate model simulations of extreme rainfall is a necessary first step before assessing changes in future rainfall extremes commonly used bias correction methods are designed to match statistics of the overall simulated rainfall with observations this assumes that change in the mix of different types of extreme rainfall events i e convective and non convective in a warmer climate is of little relevance in the estimation of overall change an assumption that is not supported by empirical or physical evidence this study proposes an alternative approach to account for the potential change of alternate rainfall types characterized here by synoptic weather patterns sps using self organizing maps classification the objective of this study is to evaluate the added influence of sps on the bias correction which is achieved by comparing the corrected distribution of future extreme rainfall with that using conventional quantile mapping a comprehensive synthetic experiment is first defined to investigate the conditions under which the additional information of sps makes a significant difference to the bias correction using over 600 000 synthetic cases statistically significant differences are found to be present in 46 cases this is followed by a case study over the sydney region using a high resolution run of the weather research and forecasting wrf regional climate model which indicates a small change in the proportions of the sps and a statistically significant change in the extreme rainfall over the region although the differences between the changes obtained from the two bias correction methods are not statistically significant keywords bias correction extreme rainfall synoptic patterns climate change self organizing maps classification regional climate models 1 introduction the impact of climate change is one of the major challenges in water supply and flood risk management both observations and model simulations indicate a general increasing trend in the rainfall intensity and variability on a global scale alexander et al 2006 boroumandjazi et al 2012 singleton and toumi 2013 this has significant implications on the estimation of design flood for future climates ishak et al 2013 which is estimated through projections of future rainfall and its distribution in time wasko and sharma 2015 and space li et al 2015 while the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycles over the historical period can be analyzed from observations and climate model simulations the effects of future changes can only be studied using climate model projections global circulation models gcms are often used in climate impact studies however gcms are usually unable to resolve small spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to hydrological processes to refine the outputs from a coarse gcm simulation to the fine scale statistical or dynamical downscaling approaches are employed while statistical downscaling uses selected atmospheric predictor variables to derive the downscaled rainfall dynamical downscaling resolves physical processes at the local scale by using regional climate models rcms nested within gcm outputs or reanalysis datasets as such rcms were found capable of reproducing important mesoscale patterns of observed precipitation and reflect the topographic effects on precipitation frei et al 2006 in addition rcms mostly run at 10 50km horizontal resolution were generally found better in representing daily precipitation extremes than their parent gcms and some studies also show that rcms can better represent subdaily precipitation extremes westra et al 2014 although rcms show promise in their ability to model rainfall extremes there remain some concerns since most rcms are available at a spatial resolution of 10km or coarser a convection parameterization scheme is required to address the convective effect that cannot be resolved on a coarse grid significant uncertainties remain in convective parametrization schemes and hence in the rainfall they simulate modeling at convection permitting resolutions below 4km allows the removal of the convection scheme and its associated uncertainties olsson et al 2014 regardless other model uncertainties lead to biases in the rainfall output which have to be corrected before any climate impact studies a range of bias correction techniques have been developed and most of them deal with the total precipitation on daily or monthly time scales bordoy and burlando 2012 grillakis et al 2013 gutjahr and heinemann 2013 johnson and sharma 2012 lafon et al 2013 piani et al 2010 raneesh and thampi 2013 with only recent work attempting to bias correct convection permitting resolution simulations argüeso et al 2013 a review of the strengths and weaknesses of some commonly used bias correction methods for total precipitation is presented in sachindra et al 2014 these bias correction methods can be essential divided into three groups 1 monthly bias correction mbc 2 nested bias correction nbc and 3 quantile mapping the mbc and nbc approaches only correct the statistics of the climate variables whereas the quantile mapping corrects the entire distribution of the variable nguyen et al 2016 hence the quantile mapping is considered more effective in correcting the daily precipitation time series while most studies target on correcting the total daily or monthly precipitation only a few of them focus on extreme rainfall in the bias correction friederichs 2010 sunyer et al 2015 wong et al 2014 resulting in the bias corrected extremes often systematically under or over representing observed extremes for current climate simulations while the accurate representation of sub grid processes in rcms remains a challenge they are quite robust regarding simulating large scale atmospheric circulations bárdossy and pegram 2011 applied bias correction on daily precipitation corresponding to circulation patterns cps derived from sea level pressure slp fields and compared the results with those obtained from a quantile mapping bias correction on the overall distribution of daily precipitation they found that the circulation based bias correction method produced different results to the universal method the extent of this difference was proportional to the difference of the cp dependent precipitation between model simulations and observations two main questions arise from their study that are worthy of further consideration the first is that bárdossy and pegram 2011 did not incorporate in their methodology the biases and changes in the frequency of occurrence of each cp recent studies have suggested that a warming climate can cause changes in the occurrence of certain circulation patterns for example horton et al 2015 found that the occurrence of anticyclonic circulation patterns was increasing while the occurrence of cyclonic circulation patterns was decreasing in summer over parts of europe by using the daily 500hpa geopotential height anomaly from ncar ncep r1 over the period of 1970 2013 secondly the focus of bárdossy and pegram s 2011 was on daily rainfall totals but as discussed above trends in and future projections for rainfall extremes can differ quite substantially from the behavior of daily rainfall totals in this study we propose an alternative bias correction method for rainfall extremes by focusing on the ability of rcms to represent extremes through specified synoptic patterns sps in formulating the approach systematic biases in the frequency of the sps associated with the extremes are addressed along with the bias in the distribution of rainfall associated with each sp considered the next section summarizes the data used in this study section 3 describes the methodology including a detailed discussion of the method used to identify the synoptic patterns as well as the bias correction method used section 4 presents the results obtained from using the synoptic pattern based method and the quantile mapping approach section 5 discusses the limitation of the proposed method followed by our conclusions in section 6 2 observations and rcm data the rainfall extremes simulated by the rcm was bias corrected based on the assumption that the statistics of bias for the current climate apply to the future climate as potential changes in the synoptic circulation patterns could alter the intensity and frequency of the extreme rainfall the bias correction was conditioned on the identified synoptic circulation patterns as such the rainfall and synoptic pattern data from both observations and model simulations are used in this study 2 1 observed data the observed rainfall data used in this work is from the australian bureau of meteorology daily rainfall data from 204 rainfall gauges black dots on fig 1 a that cover the entire period of 1990 2009 are used to extract the 1 day and 3 day annual maximum rainfall daily rainfall is recorded each day at 9am local time measuring the accumulated rainfall during the previous 24h the observed synoptic weather data are obtained from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis project gudmundsson et al 2012 referred as nnrp in the rest of the paper daily sea level pressure extracted from the 2 5 2 5 equivalent to 210km resolution grids of nnrp is used for the synoptic pattern classifications over southeast australia with each grid cell indicated by the red asterisks on fig 1b as the reanalysis is produced via a data assimilation scheme which injects contemporaneously observed data every 6 12h into the numerical weather prediction model to correct the errors carton and giese 2008 it is considered to be representative of observations as the study region is dominantly affected by the westerly winds the domain of the synoptic patterns mainly focuses on the west of the study region 2 2 rcm data the simulated rainfall extremes are obtained from an rcm running at a 2 km horizontal resolution over the sydney region this 2 km resolution domain is double nested within 10 km and 50 km resolution domains the simulations at these lower resolutions have been evaluated across a range of timescales evans and mccabe 2010 2013 evans and westra 2012 and was found to perform well this 2 km resolution rcm was developed using the weather research and forecasting wrf model system chandra et al 2015 and used the following physics schemes thompson microphysics scheme thompson et al 2004 the rapid radiative transfer model rrtm longwave radiation scheme the dudhia shortwave radiation scheme monin obukhov surface layer similarity theory noah land surface model lsm and the yonsei university planetary boundary layer pbl argüeso et al 2014 this rcm covers the historical period of 1990 2009 and the future period of 2040 2059 there are two different runs for the historical period one with boundary conditions from nnrp and the other having its boundary conditions from csiro mk3 5 outputs for the future period only one run is available and is forced by the outputs of csiro mk3 5 under the sres a2 emission scenario the use of the 2km resolution rcm ensures that precipitation extremes related to convection are produced explicitly within the model and are not dependent on the choice of convection parameterization table 1 shows some of the averaged statistics calculated using the daily rainfall data at the 197 gauged sites the wrf nnrp simulated the daily rainfall close to the observations with the mean and standard deviation only slightly higher than the observations the pdf overlapping coefficient which was estimated as the common area under the two probability density function pdf curves clemons and bradley 2000 representing the daily rainfall from the observations and rcm simulation for wrf nnrp is 0 82 this suggests that the wrf nnrp captured the daily rainfall distribution reasonably well compared with wrf nnrp wrf mk3 5 moderately overestimated the mean of daily rainfall and the daily rainfall distribution shares less common area with the observations the simulated synoptic weather data are from the 50 km rcm that covers a large area of southeast australia which encompasses the 2 km rcm domain as shown in fig 1b eight grids along the boundaries of the original domain of the 2 km and 50 km rcms are excluded in this study to avoid the boundary transition effect fig 1 shows the domain used from each rcm for the analysis the reason for choosing a larger domain for synoptic data is to capture the synoptic scale 1000km weather patterns that are responsible for the extreme rainfall it should be noted that the 50km domain is off center to the 2km domain as the study region is dominated by westerly winds it should also be noted that both rcms 50 km and 2 km resolution use similar boundary conditions and physical schemes hence the circulation patterns simulated by the 50 km resolution rcm are directly linked to the extreme rainfall simulated by the 2 km resolution rcm 3 methodology existing bias correction methods usually correct the future projections without considering the possible change of the composition of the types of rainfall extremes fig 2 a illustrates one of the commonly used bias correction approaches quantile mapping which implicitly assumes the biases for all types of rainfall extremes are the same however it is possible that the biases vary with the types of extreme rainfall in addition the proportion of each extreme rainfall type may change as a result of climate change as for the number of extreme rainfall types defined by the number of sps rcm simulations may also differ from observations a systematic change in the mix of extreme rainfall event types is also supported by the increase in observed convection driven rainfall extremes around the world berg et al 2013 in this study we propose a new approach to correct biases of rainfall extremes simulated by the rcm for the future climate using the relationship between the large scale synoptic weather patterns and the rainfall extremes defined as annual maxima the days with rainfall extremes are first divided into n distinctive clusters based on the classification of synoptic weather patterns fig 2b gives an illustration of this method here only 2 clusters are used for simplicity of presentation as shown in the left panels of fig 2b the bias behavior varies with different clusters represented by the different colors and therefore the correction for different clusters will be different once the distribution of each type of the rainfall extremes is corrected the proportion of each type is also corrected as illustrated by the color bars at the bottom of fig 2b finally the weighted combination of the different types is estimated to form a distribution representing overall rainfall extremes the proposed method does add a certain complexity to the conventional quantile mapping approach to decide whether it is worth implementing the sp based method the add on value of using sps will be evaluated by comparing the corrected distribution for future extreme rainfall using the synoptic pattern based bias correction spbc approach with that using the quantile mapping method the kolmogorov smirnov ks test is employed to test the significance of this add on value if the test returns a non significant decision then it is not necessary to apply the proposed method as it will produce statistically indistinguishable results as the simple quantile mapping method 3 1 identifying extreme events the 1 day extreme events were identified using 1 day annual maximum rainfall from observations since the synoptic scale weather systems usually have diameters greater than 200km kuo et al 2015 it is unlikely that the rainfall extremes induced by synoptic scale weather systems would occur at only a few individual stations to avoid using synoptic classifications on days with only small local convective storms occurring any days with at least one but less than five stations having concurrent annual maximum rainfall were pre classified as small scale event days for days when at least five stations have concurrent annual maximum rainfall we defined them as synoptic scale event days on which the synoptic classification was implemented based on these definitions we found 313 small scale events and 155 synoptic scale events within the 20 year observational time period when considering the model domain it is necessary to think about how to translate the above methodology to a gridded dataset rather than the relatively sparse gauge locations as the station scale differs from the grid scale a five grid threshold would lead to many more events than 155 to find the appropriate size for the grid threshold to give the same number of extreme events as the station based analysis we used the rcm simulation driven by nnrp boundary conditions and varied the minimum number of grids with concurrent annual maxima as the grid threshold increases the number of large scale extreme events in the domain decreases we found that a 419 grid threshold led to exactly the same number of the synoptic scale events as the observations the 419 grid was also used as an upper threshold for identifying the lower threshold for the small scale events i e those occurring concurrently at one to four stations the lower threshold for small scale events was found to be 57 grid points leading to 313 events in the rcm simulation driven by nnrp these thresholds were also adopted to identify the extreme events from the rcm simulations driven by the csiro mk3 5 gcm under both the current and future climates based on the identified grid thresholds the number of synoptic scale and small scale extreme events and the days when these events occur were established for the gcm driven rcm simulations under current and future climates table 2 shows the number of 1 day extreme events at the synoptic and small scales obtained from observations and model simulations in general the gcm driven rcm simulated fewer synoptic scale events and more small scale events than observations under current climate conditions this indicates that the gcm driven rcm tends to overestimate the occurrence of the localized extreme events but misses some of the large spatial scale events for the future climate the number of extreme events simulated by the gcm driven rcm at both synoptic and small scales increased from current climate simulations which is consistent with other studies allan and soden 2008 o gorman 2015 wuebbles et al 2013 3 2 synoptic climatological classification the intensity and frequency of rainfall extremes are likely to vary with different synoptic weather patterns in this study a certain number of synoptic patterns were identified for the extreme event days using the self organizing maps som classification the som algorithm kohonen 2001 provides an effective tool for visualizing the complex distribution of synoptic patterns by projecting the high dimensional data onto a two dimensional grid map in atmospheric science soms are commonly used to identify synoptic patterns argüeso et al 2015 hewitson and crane 2002 schuenemann and cassano 2010 the first step of the som classification is to define a random matrix of nodes within the input data sample space composed of the 155 synoptic maps identified in section 3 1 each node is a vector of the same length as each input data sample which is 42 i e 6 7 grid points for the nnrp synoptic field and 925 i e 25 37 grid points for the rcm nnrp synoptic filed the second step is to assign each input data sample i e 155 synoptic maps to its closest node according to the euclidean distance the third step is to select a node and identified one of all the assigned data samples over the neighborhood of the selected node such that the identified data sample has the smallest sum of distances from all the other data samples over this neighborhood this identified data sample is called the generalized median and is used to replace the selected node step 4 is to repeat step 3 for all other nodes the above process from step 2 to step 4 is iterated until convergence that is the generalized median coincides with the selected node finally all the days in each node are averaged and the resultant mean represents one cluster therefore the number of nodes is equal to the number of clusters too many clusters will lead to the centroids of the neighboring clusters being indistinguishable whereas too few clusters can cause loss of important details due to over generalization of information yip et al 2013 the optimal number of clusters is determined by the calinski harabasz index chi which is defined as the ratio of between cluster variance varb to within cluster variance varw burn 2014 1 chi var b var w n k k 1 2 var b k 1 k n k z k z 2 3 var w k 1 k i 1 n k x i z k 2 here n is the number of observations k is the number of clusters zk is the centroid of cluster k z is the centroid of the entire data set nk is the number of observations xi that belong to cluster k in this study chi was calculated for k varying from 2 to 10 and the value of k for which chi is maximized is considered to be the optimal number of clusters here a provisional 10 clusters were used as the maximum number of clusters however the estimated chi in section 4 2 shows a clear trend that chi decreases with the number of clusters the synoptic patterns identified from the nnrp dataset were first compared with those obtained from the rcm nnrp simulations regarding the number of clusters the proportion of each cluster and the spatial presentation of each pattern as the synoptic patterns identified from the rcm nnrp simulations rather than the nnrp dataset were used as the base maps to extract the similar patterns from the rcm mk3 5 under both current and future climates an assumption made here is that the synoptic patterns simulated by rcm nnrp are representative of observed ones therefore it is desirable that the synoptic patterns of the rcm nnrp be similar to those found for observations i e nnrp as the synoptic patterns are generally considered to be simulated well by rcms this assumption is sensible and was verified by comparing the synoptic patterns obtained from the two datasets i e rcm nnrp and nnrp in section 4 2 in finding the synoptic patterns for the rcm mk3 5 the euclidean distance between the base maps and the synoptic status on each of the days with synoptic scale events simulated by the rcm mk3 5 was estimated and the days with the synoptic status closest to one of the cluster base maps was assigned to that cluster 3 3 synoptic patterns based bias corrections as the biases of the extreme rainfall vary with the different synoptic patterns we adopted a synoptic pattern based bias correction method which corrects not only the biases in the extreme rainfall corresponding to each synoptic type but also the proportion of each type fig 2b illustrates the process of the sp based bias correction method to keep the presentation clear we assume only two clusters are found in section 3 2 bias correction is applied to each individual cluster by means of quantile mapping in which we first calculated the correction factors as the ratio of the observed rainfall extreme value to the model simulated value for the current climate for each percentile x for cluster k the future model projection p mod fut is then corrected for each cluster at the percentile x by multiplying with the appropriate correction factor according to eq 4 the assumption made here is that biases in each type of extreme rainfall are constant over time this assumption is different from the constant bias assumption often made in studies using gcm or rcm simulations gutjahr and heinemann 2013 piani et al 2010 räty et al 2014 which can be violated under a warmer climate as suggested by a few recent studies sunyer et al 2014 in this study the overall bias in the extreme rainfall distribution is not constant as we allow the proportion of each type of extreme rainfall event to change as well as the more standard assumption that the bias may be different for different parts of the rainfall distribution 4 p cor fut k x p obs k x p mod cur k x p mod fut k x the weights simulated by the rcm are corrected for individual clusters following eq 5 the corrected future rainfall extremes for all the clusters are calculated as the weighted sum of the corrected rainfall extremes of all the individual clusters the results are expected to be different from those obtained by applying quantile mapping bias correction to the entire dataset without classification as illustrated in fig 2a 5 w cor fut k w obs k w mod cur k w mod fut k 6 p cor fut x k 1 k w cor fut k p cor fut k x 3 4 synthetic experiment design as there is only one high resolution 2km rcm currently available over the study region the concern is that any findings based on a single model may lack generality to explore the possible conditions under which the proposed method will lead to significantly different outcomes a synthetic experiment was designed in the experiment instead of using the annual maximum series ams simulated by a single rcm synthetic datasets that cover a wide range of possible ams values were used each synthetic dataset was extracted from a generalized extreme value gev distribution the gev distribution was found to be the best fit for the ams in australia green et al 2012 the gev parameters used to build the synthetic ams to represent the rcm simulations for both current and future climates were extracted from a sequence of gev parameter sets which were created by perturbing the observation gev parameters to 50 above or below their actual values to reduce the computation time two ams clusters corresponding to two different sps were adopted in this experiment the proportion of each cluster was selected from a sequence of the proportions that are within 50 above or below the observed proportion for that type repeating this data generating process for 2 million times and excluding the cases when the mean of the ams is 50 above or below the observational mean and the proportion of each cluster is less than 2 or more than 98 we ended up with 680 391 valid cases we then applied the two bias correction methods to those valid cases and carried out a kolmogorov smirnov ks test at 5 significance level on the results based on the ks test results the synthetic cases were split into two groups one group shows the proposed method generates significantly different results to the quantile mapping method the other group shows the results produced by the two methods are statistically indistinguishable to investigate the possible conditions that can be used to predict the membership of these two groups the classification tree method was used the concept of the classification tree is to recursively split the data space of the predictors into two subsets until each subset contains the data with the response mainly belonging to a given class friedman et al 2001 in this case the two classes of the response were defined as the ks test decision i e 0 for accepting the null hypothesis and 1 for rejecting the null hypothesis on whether the proposed method produces significantly different results to the conventional method the following five factors considered to be able to potentially separate the significantly different cases from the insignificant ones were used as predictors of the classification tree the absolute change in the proportion of each cluster w f 1 w c 1 which can be any value between 0 and 1 here wc 1 and wf 1 represent the proportion of cluster 1 under the current and future climates respectively one important feature of the proposed method is that it considers the change in the proportion of each cluster which is ignored by the quantile mapping approach if there is no change in the proportion then the proposed method will collapse to the quantile mapping method if the change in the proportion is 1 which means one type of extreme events completely changes to another type then the two methods will again produce the same results because there is essentially only one type of extreme rainfall events the absolute difference of the correction factors between two clusters p 0 1 cf 1 cf 2 dp where p is the probability and cf is the correction factor the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the cluster 1 and cluster 2 if the correction factors for the two clusters are the same i e cf 1 cf 2 then the correction factor for the entire distribution will also be the same in this case it is not necessary to apply bias correction to individual clusters separately as it will not generate any results that are different from correcting the entire distribution at once on the other hand if this factor is large it means that the correction applied to each type is more different and thus larger differences are likely to show between the two methods the absolute change in quantiles of the corrected ams for each cluster p 0 1 x f 1 cor x c 1 cor dp and p 0 1 x f 2 cor x c 2 cor dp where p is the probability and x cor represents the quantile the subscripts f and c indicate the current and future climates respectively the numbers 1 and 2 in the subscripts represent cluster 1 and cluster 2 if there is no change in ams from current to future then the corrected distribution of ams for the future climate will be the same as for the current climate which has to match observations in this case unless there is a dramatic change in the proportion of each cluster the results obtained from the proposed method will be of no difference to those produced by using the quantile mapping method the ks test decision i e 0 for accepting the null hypothesis and 1 for rejecting the null hypothesis on whether the corrected distributions of the two clusters for the future climate are significantly different from each other h x f 1 cor x f 2 cor here x f 1 cor and x f 2 cor represent the quantiles of the corrected future ams distributions for cluster 1 and cluster 2 respectively the null hypothesis is that the two distributions are the same a reject of the null hypothesis means that the corrected distributions of the two clusters for the future climate are different at 5 significance level in which case the difference between the two methods are likely to show 4 results as the synthetic experiment explores a wide range of possible extreme rainfall data spectrum the results of it will be more general than the case study based on a single rcm it is intuitive to report the general results first and then go to the specific case therefore this section will first inspect the outcomes from applying the two bias correction methods to the synthetic data followed by a real case study based on rcm simulations the results of the real case will be present in two subsections first the synoptic patterns identified using the som classification will be explained and then the bias corrected future extreme rainfall distributions using the two methods will be compared 4 1 bias correction of synthetic data the two bias correction methods were applied to the 680 391 synthetic cases and the ks test was used to test the difference between the outcomes of the two methods the result reveals that about 46 of the cases show the two bias corrected distributions under the future climate are significantly different from each other this result provides insights into the likelihood of the two methods showing significant difference if multiple rcms were available and used in this study which is possible in the future due to the increasingly improved computer power to investigate the possible conditions under which the proposed method will significantly differ from the quantile mapping method the classification tree approach was employed to separate the synthetic cases into the two distinctive groups as explained in the previous section the classification tree will recursively split the data into two subsets until each subset contains the data with the response mainly from the same class it is necessary to know when to stop growing the tree this is because an undergrown tree may cause some important structural information about the sample space missing whereas an overgrown tree can result in over fitting of the training data the optimal size of the tree is determined based on the minimum cross validation error it was found that cross validation error decreases rapidly with the minimum leaf size which is the minimum data points on any end node of the tree and then slowly increases the minimum leaf size found in this case is 359 with the cross validation error of 0 2038 the optimal tree was grown based on this minimum leaf size although the optimal tree has the lowest cross validation error the size is too big i e 81 levels to have any practical meaning as it is unrealistic to apply 81 rules to get a decision on whether the two methods give different results in fact to get good separation of the significant cases from the insignificant ones it is unnecessary to apply all the 81 rules only applying the rule at the first level from the root node is able to get 71 significant cases and 81 insignificant cases correctly classified as shown in fig 3 the averaged distributions for the future climate using the two methods were plotted for the cases that fall into the two branches of the tree at the first level it is clear that cases on the left branch show the high similarity between the two methods while those on the right branch allow the proposed method to distinguish from the conventional method the factor used in the classification at this level of the tree is the absolute difference of the correction factors between two clusters when this factor is larger than 0 46 the two methods are most likely to generate significantly different results this rule can be used as an initial checkpoint to see whether a different result is expected when bias correction is required for a new dataset it is noted from fig 3 that as the tree grows down the misclassification rate does not necessarily drop which suggests that the best segregation line draws at the first level of the tree this means that the absolute difference of the correction factors between two clusters is the dominant factor that contributes to the difference between the two methods 4 2 synoptic patterns of observations and model simulations despite the factor that nearly half of the synthetic cases proved that applying bias correction to partitioned extreme rainfall data does generate significantly different results compared to when the types of rainfall extremes are ignored it is still worthwhile to test the findings through a case study using actual rcm simulations the sea level pressure from nnrp dataset during the extreme events were classified into various numbers of clusters starting from 2 to 10 according to the calinski harabasz index two clusters are favored for 1 day extreme events taking the small scale extreme events as a third cluster a total of three clusters can be used to represent all the extreme rainfall events identified table 2 by taking the average of the synoptic maps that belong to their corresponding classes the representative synoptic patterns sps were obtained fig 4 a c shows the representative sps for the three clusters all of which have a high over the tasman sea and a low over the continent the moisture transported from the sea to the land by the pressure gradient brought heavy rainfall to the sydney region it is noted that sp3 has the sparsest contours which is expected since this cluster is identified for days with only 1 4 stations having concurrent annual maximum rainfall sp2 has the densest contours indicating the cluster represents the extreme events with strongest winds as the pressure field from the rcm used in this study is on a finer grid resolution than that from the nnrp dataset the synoptic patterns identified from the nnrp dataset cannot be used as base maps to establish the synoptic clusters for the rcm runs instead the synoptic patterns found from the rcm nnrp simulations by applying the som classification was used as the base maps which are shown in fig 4d f the legitimacy of using rcm nnrp simulated synoptic patterns as observation is confirmed by the fact that the synoptic patterns simulated by the rcm nnrp are similar to those found from observations i e nnrp despite the different resolutions of the pressure field from these two data sources the synoptic maps on each of the extreme event days defined by the rcm mk3 5 simulations for the current climate were assigned to the closest base map according to the euclidean distance fig 4g i is the three representative synoptic patterns after taking the average of all the synoptic maps that belong to each cluster although these three synoptic clusters are similar to those found from the rcm nnrp simulations the proportion of each cluster differs from that of the rcm nnrp run the rcm mk3 5 tends to undersimulate the occurrence of the synoptic scale events i e sp1 and sp2 while overproduces the number of the small scale events i e sp3 this proportional discrepancy is considered as one type of bias i e bias in the proportion and needs to be corrected again based on the euclidean distance the three clusters were identified for the rcm mk3 5 for the future climate as shown in fig 4j l these three patterns are also similar to those simulated by the rcm nnrp here a clear decreasing trend is seen in the proportion of the synoptic scale events i e sp1 and sp2 whereas an increasing trend is found in the proportion of the small scale events i e sp3 although the proportion of the synoptic scale events is decreasing the occurrence or the number of this type of events is still increasing but not as fast as the small scale events as indicated in table 2 4 3 bias correction of the rcm simulations based on the classification results the annual maximum rainfall time series belonging to the same cluster were grouped together the distribution of each cluster was bias corrected using eq 4 the proportion of each cluster was also corrected and then multiplied to the corrected distribution of that cluster finally the weighted distributions of the three clusters were added up to form the whole distribution which was compared with the distribution obtained using the quantile mapping bias correction method it is clear that extreme rainfall intensity tends to increase for events with exceedance probability smaller than 1 in 5years i e less frequent events as indicated by comparing the 1 day ams between observations and the future simulation after bias correction fig 5 e this increasing trend was also found in the individual type of precipitation extremes corresponding to sp1 and sp3 as indicated by the blue and green curves in fig 5a and b with sp1 related precipitation extremes increasing the most the intensity of the precipitation extremes belonging to sp2 was to change little in the future for this particular rcm the empirical cdf obtained from the proposed method differs from that estimated from the conventional quantile mapping method by 10 to 8 as shown in fig 5f although the ks test does not indicate this difference is statistically significant at the 5 level the between cluster difference in the correction factor estimated for this rcm simulation is 0 18 which falls into the first left branch of the classification tree this confirms the non significant results from the ks test 5 discussions when designing the synthetic experiment we used only two clusters for the simplicity of demonstration the classification tree can give us a sense of when we can expect different results from the two methods although the situation may become much more complicated with an increasing number of clusters we can still expect a higher likelihood of finding differences between the two methods if large differences are identified in correction factors between different extreme rainfall types alternatively we can also draw a classification tree to find the rules to distinguish significant cases from insignificant ones but this time the tree is based on more factors for example when only two clusters are used the absolute difference in the correction factor is just between cluster 1 and 2 when a third cluster is added the difference between cluster 1 and 3 as well as between cluster 2 and 3 should also be included the rcm used in this study adopted cmip3 gcm csiro mk3 5 outputs as its boundary conditions for the future run because the cmip5 project was in its early stage when the rcm project narclim was initiated in 2011 the future rcm projection used the sres a2 emission scenario which has the same greenhouse emission as representative concentration pathway rcp 6 0 and rcp 4 5 in 2050 as suggested by woldemeskel et al 2016 the uncertainty in temperature simulated by cmip5 gcms is of the same order as that simulated by cmip3 ccms while a slight reduction in precipitation uncertainty is found due to the improvement of model structure and realization in cmip5 therefore using a cmip3 gcm for boundary conditions is unlikely to change the conclusion in this study compared to using a cmip5 gcm the results presented here for the case study are only for 1 day ams we have also applied the som classification to the 3 day mean sea level pressure and then carried out the sp based bias correction method on 3 day ams the results were compared with those based on the quantile mapping similar to 1 day case a non significant difference was found between the corrected future extreme rainfall distributions obtained from the two methods for the 3 day case the between cluster difference in the correction factor was found to be 0 19 also falling into the first left branch of the classification tree this again confirms the finding that the difference between the two methods is not significant for this particular rcm run unlike most other bias correction approaches which are based on a crucial assumption that the bias is stationary the proposed method allows a non stationary bias in the overall distribution of extreme rainfall by incorporating the possible changes in the mix of different types of extreme rainfall however the proposed method assumes that there is no change in the bias of each type of extreme rainfall event this assumption is difficult to verify because the historical period simulated by the rcm used in this study is not long enough to show any non stationary trend in bias we note that recent studies that question the stationarity assumption only refer to bias of the overall distribution of the climate variables there is no research to our knowledge that examines the non stationarity in the bias of different types of events this study applied the sp based bias correction method only to daily and 3 day ams in the sydney region although we did find significantly different results obtained from the sp based method and the conventional method in nearly half 47 of the synthetic cases the single rcm simulation cannot distinguish these two methods the reason for that is the difference in the correction factors between different types of rainfall extremes is not large enough to make the results statistically distinguishable in addition to using sea level pressure only to represent the synoptic patterns that are responsible for the extreme rainfall event multiple variables including the precipitable water vertical velocity at 850hpa and relative vorticity at 500hpa were also used to partition the extreme rainfall events into various types the selection of these variables was based on a previous study by friederichs and hense 2007 which used these variables to statistically downscale extreme rainfall over europe however using multivariables to define sps caused only a small change in the results the conclusion is still the same that the influence of the additional information of sps on the bias correction is not significant for this particular rcm now the question remains whether a different conclusion can be reached if the same process was applied to subdaily ams and to other parts of the world unlike daily or multiday rainfall extremes subdaily extremes are more related to convective storms than stratiform systems the response of convective rainfall to temperature increases is different to that of stratiform rainfall in general convective events are more sensitive to temperature changes than stratiform storms and changes in the intensity of extreme events may be related to a change in the proportion of convective versus stratiform events berg and haerter 2013 westra et al 2014 did a thorough review on future changes of subdaily extreme rainfall and pointed out the limitation in the current state of knowledge on this issue however it is clear that the trend of subdaily extreme rainfall varies with temperature regions and storm durations etc therefore it is possible to see significantly different bias correction results from these two methods when they are applied to a different region and different time scale to our case study here 6 conclusions potential changes in synoptic circulation patterns under global warming are expected to alter the intensities and frequencies of rainfall extremes in this study we evaluated the influence of including synoptic patterns to the bias correction first through a synthetic experiment and then a real case based on rcm simulations we found 46 of the synthetic cases turned out to be significantly different when using the two bias correction methods for the results to be significantly different the between cluster difference in the correction factor needs to be large enough which however is not the case for the rcm simulations used in this study to identify the different extreme rainfall clusters the self organizing maps classification was used the three sps identified for the nnrp reanalysis dataset closely resemble those simulated by wrf nnrp which confirms the initial assumption that the circulation patterns are generally simulated well by the rcms using the identified sps from the wrf nnrp simulation as base maps the synoptic maps on the extreme rainfall days simulated by wrf mk3 5 for both the current and future climates were allocated to the closest base map according to the euclidean distance it was found that the total number of extreme events tends to increase under a warming climate and that the number of small scale extreme events increases faster than that of large scale extreme events this finding is consistent with the previous study that localized convective storms are more sensitive to higher temperature berg et al 2013 acknowledgements regional climate data have been provided by the new south wales and australian capital territory

7595,addressing systematic biases in regional climate model simulations of extreme rainfall is a necessary first step before assessing changes in future rainfall extremes commonly used bias correction methods are designed to match statistics of the overall simulated rainfall with observations this assumes that change in the mix of different types of extreme rainfall events i e convective and non convective in a warmer climate is of little relevance in the estimation of overall change an assumption that is not supported by empirical or physical evidence this study proposes an alternative approach to account for the potential change of alternate rainfall types characterized here by synoptic weather patterns sps using self organizing maps classification the objective of this study is to evaluate the added influence of sps on the bias correction which is achieved by comparing the corrected distribution of future extreme rainfall with that using conventional quantile mapping a comprehensive synthetic experiment is first defined to investigate the conditions under which the additional information of sps makes a significant difference to the bias correction using over 600 000 synthetic cases statistically significant differences are found to be present in 46 cases this is followed by a case study over the sydney region using a high resolution run of the weather research and forecasting wrf regional climate model which indicates a small change in the proportions of the sps and a statistically significant change in the extreme rainfall over the region although the differences between the changes obtained from the two bias correction methods are not statistically significant keywords bias correction extreme rainfall synoptic patterns climate change self organizing maps classification regional climate models 1 introduction the impact of climate change is one of the major challenges in water supply and flood risk management both observations and model simulations indicate a general increasing trend in the rainfall intensity and variability on a global scale alexander et al 2006 boroumandjazi et al 2012 singleton and toumi 2013 this has significant implications on the estimation of design flood for future climates ishak et al 2013 which is estimated through projections of future rainfall and its distribution in time wasko and sharma 2015 and space li et al 2015 while the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycles over the historical period can be analyzed from observations and climate model simulations the effects of future changes can only be studied using climate model projections global circulation models gcms are often used in climate impact studies however gcms are usually unable to resolve small spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to hydrological processes to refine the outputs from a coarse gcm simulation to the fine scale statistical or dynamical downscaling approaches are employed while statistical downscaling uses selected atmospheric predictor variables to derive the downscaled rainfall dynamical downscaling resolves physical processes at the local scale by using regional climate models rcms nested within gcm outputs or reanalysis datasets as such rcms were found capable of reproducing important mesoscale patterns of observed precipitation and reflect the topographic effects on precipitation frei et al 2006 in addition rcms mostly run at 10 50km horizontal resolution were generally found better in representing daily precipitation extremes than their parent gcms and some studies also show that rcms can better represent subdaily precipitation extremes westra et al 2014 although rcms show promise in their ability to model rainfall extremes there remain some concerns since most rcms are available at a spatial resolution of 10km or coarser a convection parameterization scheme is required to address the convective effect that cannot be resolved on a coarse grid significant uncertainties remain in convective parametrization schemes and hence in the rainfall they simulate modeling at convection permitting resolutions below 4km allows the removal of the convection scheme and its associated uncertainties olsson et al 2014 regardless other model uncertainties lead to biases in the rainfall output which have to be corrected before any climate impact studies a range of bias correction techniques have been developed and most of them deal with the total precipitation on daily or monthly time scales bordoy and burlando 2012 grillakis et al 2013 gutjahr and heinemann 2013 johnson and sharma 2012 lafon et al 2013 piani et al 2010 raneesh and thampi 2013 with only recent work attempting to bias correct convection permitting resolution simulations argüeso et al 2013 a review of the strengths and weaknesses of some commonly used bias correction methods for total precipitation is presented in sachindra et al 2014 these bias correction methods can be essential divided into three groups 1 monthly bias correction mbc 2 nested bias correction nbc and 3 quantile mapping the mbc and nbc approaches only correct the statistics of the climate variables whereas the quantile mapping corrects the entire distribution of the variable nguyen et al 2016 hence the quantile mapping is considered more effective in correcting the daily precipitation time series while most studies target on correcting the total daily or monthly precipitation only a few of them focus on extreme rainfall in the bias correction friederichs 2010 sunyer et al 2015 wong et al 2014 resulting in the bias corrected extremes often systematically under or over representing observed extremes for current climate simulations while the accurate representation of sub grid processes in rcms remains a challenge they are quite robust regarding simulating large scale atmospheric circulations bárdossy and pegram 2011 applied bias correction on daily precipitation corresponding to circulation patterns cps derived from sea level pressure slp fields and compared the results with those obtained from a quantile mapping bias correction on the overall distribution of daily precipitation they found that the circulation based bias correction method produced different results to the universal method the extent of this difference was proportional to the difference of the cp dependent precipitation between model simulations and observations two main questions arise from their study that are worthy of further consideration the first is that bárdossy and pegram 2011 did not incorporate in their methodology the biases and changes in the frequency of occurrence of each cp recent studies have suggested that a warming climate can cause changes in the occurrence of certain circulation patterns for example horton et al 2015 found that the occurrence of anticyclonic circulation patterns was increasing while the occurrence of cyclonic circulation patterns was decreasing in summer over parts of europe by using the daily 500hpa geopotential height anomaly from ncar ncep r1 over the period of 1970 2013 secondly the focus of bárdossy and pegram s 2011 was on daily rainfall totals but as discussed above trends in and future projections for rainfall extremes can differ quite substantially from the behavior of daily rainfall totals in this study we propose an alternative bias correction method for rainfall extremes by focusing on the ability of rcms to represent extremes through specified synoptic patterns sps in formulating the approach systematic biases in the frequency of the sps associated with the extremes are addressed along with the bias in the distribution of rainfall associated with each sp considered the next section summarizes the data used in this study section 3 describes the methodology including a detailed discussion of the method used to identify the synoptic patterns as well as the bias correction method used section 4 presents the results obtained from using the synoptic pattern based method and the quantile mapping approach section 5 discusses the limitation of the proposed method followed by our conclusions in section 6 2 observations and rcm data the rainfall extremes simulated by the rcm was bias corrected based on the assumption that the statistics of bias for the current climate apply to the future climate as potential changes in the synoptic circulation patterns could alter the intensity and frequency of the extreme rainfall the bias correction was conditioned on the identified synoptic circulation patterns as such the rainfall and synoptic pattern data from both observations and model simulations are used in this study 2 1 observed data the observed rainfall data used in this work is from the australian bureau of meteorology daily rainfall data from 204 rainfall gauges black dots on fig 1 a that cover the entire period of 1990 2009 are used to extract the 1 day and 3 day annual maximum rainfall daily rainfall is recorded each day at 9am local time measuring the accumulated rainfall during the previous 24h the observed synoptic weather data are obtained from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis project gudmundsson et al 2012 referred as nnrp in the rest of the paper daily sea level pressure extracted from the 2 5 2 5 equivalent to 210km resolution grids of nnrp is used for the synoptic pattern classifications over southeast australia with each grid cell indicated by the red asterisks on fig 1b as the reanalysis is produced via a data assimilation scheme which injects contemporaneously observed data every 6 12h into the numerical weather prediction model to correct the errors carton and giese 2008 it is considered to be representative of observations as the study region is dominantly affected by the westerly winds the domain of the synoptic patterns mainly focuses on the west of the study region 2 2 rcm data the simulated rainfall extremes are obtained from an rcm running at a 2 km horizontal resolution over the sydney region this 2 km resolution domain is double nested within 10 km and 50 km resolution domains the simulations at these lower resolutions have been evaluated across a range of timescales evans and mccabe 2010 2013 evans and westra 2012 and was found to perform well this 2 km resolution rcm was developed using the weather research and forecasting wrf model system chandra et al 2015 and used the following physics schemes thompson microphysics scheme thompson et al 2004 the rapid radiative transfer model rrtm longwave radiation scheme the dudhia shortwave radiation scheme monin obukhov surface layer similarity theory noah land surface model lsm and the yonsei university planetary boundary layer pbl argüeso et al 2014 this rcm covers the historical period of 1990 2009 and the future period of 2040 2059 there are two different runs for the historical period one with boundary conditions from nnrp and the other having its boundary conditions from csiro mk3 5 outputs for the future period only one run is available and is forced by the outputs of csiro mk3 5 under the sres a2 emission scenario the use of the 2km resolution rcm ensures that precipitation extremes related to convection are produced explicitly within the model and are not dependent on the choice of convection parameterization table 1 shows some of the averaged statistics calculated using the daily rainfall data at the 197 gauged sites the wrf nnrp simulated the daily rainfall close to the observations with the mean and standard deviation only slightly higher than the observations the pdf overlapping coefficient which was estimated as the common area under the two probability density function pdf curves clemons and bradley 2000 representing the daily rainfall from the observations and rcm simulation for wrf nnrp is 0 82 this suggests that the wrf nnrp captured the daily rainfall distribution reasonably well compared with wrf nnrp wrf mk3 5 moderately overestimated the mean of daily rainfall and the daily rainfall distribution shares less common area with the observations the simulated synoptic weather data are from the 50 km rcm that covers a large area of southeast australia which encompasses the 2 km rcm domain as shown in fig 1b eight grids along the boundaries of the original domain of the 2 km and 50 km rcms are excluded in this study to avoid the boundary transition effect fig 1 shows the domain used from each rcm for the analysis the reason for choosing a larger domain for synoptic data is to capture the synoptic scale 1000km weather patterns that are responsible for the extreme rainfall it should be noted that the 50km domain is off center to the 2km domain as the study region is dominated by westerly winds it should also be noted that both rcms 50 km and 2 km resolution use similar boundary conditions and physical schemes hence the circulation patterns simulated by the 50 km resolution rcm are directly linked to the extreme rainfall simulated by the 2 km resolution rcm 3 methodology existing bias correction methods usually correct the future projections without considering the possible change of the composition of the types of rainfall extremes fig 2 a illustrates one of the commonly used bias correction approaches quantile mapping which implicitly assumes the biases for all types of rainfall extremes are the same however it is possible that the biases vary with the types of extreme rainfall in addition the proportion of each extreme rainfall type may change as a result of climate change as for the number of extreme rainfall types defined by the number of sps rcm simulations may also differ from observations a systematic change in the mix of extreme rainfall event types is also supported by the increase in observed convection driven rainfall extremes around the world berg et al 2013 in this study we propose a new approach to correct biases of rainfall extremes simulated by the rcm for the future climate using the relationship between the large scale synoptic weather patterns and the rainfall extremes defined as annual maxima the days with rainfall extremes are first divided into n distinctive clusters based on the classification of synoptic weather patterns fig 2b gives an illustration of this method here only 2 clusters are used for simplicity of presentation as shown in the left panels of fig 2b the bias behavior varies with different clusters represented by the different colors and therefore the correction for different clusters will be different once the distribution of each type of the rainfall extremes is corrected the proportion of each type is also corrected as illustrated by the color bars at the bottom of fig 2b finally the weighted combination of the different types is estimated to form a distribution representing overall rainfall extremes the proposed method does add a certain complexity to the conventional quantile mapping approach to decide whether it is worth implementing the sp based method the add on value of using sps will be evaluated by comparing the corrected distribution for future extreme rainfall using the synoptic pattern based bias correction spbc approach with that using the quantile mapping method the kolmogorov smirnov ks test is employed to test the significance of this add on value if the test returns a non significant decision then it is not necessary to apply the proposed method as it will produce statistically indistinguishable results as the simple quantile mapping method 3 1 identifying extreme events the 1 day extreme events were identified using 1 day annual maximum rainfall from observations since the synoptic scale weather systems usually have diameters greater than 200km kuo et al 2015 it is unlikely that the rainfall extremes induced by synoptic scale weather systems would occur at only a few individual stations to avoid using synoptic classifications on days with only small local convective storms occurring any days with at least one but less than five stations having concurrent annual maximum rainfall were pre classified as small scale event days for days when at least five stations have concurrent annual maximum rainfall we defined them as synoptic scale event days on which the synoptic classification was implemented based on these definitions we found 313 small scale events and 155 synoptic scale events within the 20 year observational time period when considering the model domain it is necessary to think about how to translate the above methodology to a gridded dataset rather than the relatively sparse gauge locations as the station scale differs from the grid scale a five grid threshold would lead to many more events than 155 to find the appropriate size for the grid threshold to give the same number of extreme events as the station based analysis we used the rcm simulation driven by nnrp boundary conditions and varied the minimum number of grids with concurrent annual maxima as the grid threshold increases the number of large scale extreme events in the domain decreases we found that a 419 grid threshold led to exactly the same number of the synoptic scale events as the observations the 419 grid was also used as an upper threshold for identifying the lower threshold for the small scale events i e those occurring concurrently at one to four stations the lower threshold for small scale events was found to be 57 grid points leading to 313 events in the rcm simulation driven by nnrp these thresholds were also adopted to identify the extreme events from the rcm simulations driven by the csiro mk3 5 gcm under both the current and future climates based on the identified grid thresholds the number of synoptic scale and small scale extreme events and the days when these events occur were established for the gcm driven rcm simulations under current and future climates table 2 shows the number of 1 day extreme events at the synoptic and small scales obtained from observations and model simulations in general the gcm driven rcm simulated fewer synoptic scale events and more small scale events than observations under current climate conditions this indicates that the gcm driven rcm tends to overestimate the occurrence of the localized extreme events but misses some of the large spatial scale events for the future climate the number of extreme events simulated by the gcm driven rcm at both synoptic and small scales increased from current climate simulations which is consistent with other studies allan and soden 2008 o gorman 2015 wuebbles et al 2013 3 2 synoptic climatological classification the intensity and frequency of rainfall extremes are likely to vary with different synoptic weather patterns in this study a certain number of synoptic patterns were identified for the extreme event days using the self organizing maps som classification the som algorithm kohonen 2001 provides an effective tool for visualizing the complex distribution of synoptic patterns by projecting the high dimensional data onto a two dimensional grid map in atmospheric science soms are commonly used to identify synoptic patterns argüeso et al 2015 hewitson and crane 2002 schuenemann and cassano 2010 the first step of the som classification is to define a random matrix of nodes within the input data sample space composed of the 155 synoptic maps identified in section 3 1 each node is a vector of the same length as each input data sample which is 42 i e 6 7 grid points for the nnrp synoptic field and 925 i e 25 37 grid points for the rcm nnrp synoptic filed the second step is to assign each input data sample i e 155 synoptic maps to its closest node according to the euclidean distance the third step is to select a node and identified one of all the assigned data samples over the neighborhood of the selected node such that the identified data sample has the smallest sum of distances from all the other data samples over this neighborhood this identified data sample is called the generalized median and is used to replace the selected node step 4 is to repeat step 3 for all other nodes the above process from step 2 to step 4 is iterated until convergence that is the generalized median coincides with the selected node finally all the days in each node are averaged and the resultant mean represents one cluster therefore the number of nodes is equal to the number of clusters too many clusters will lead to the centroids of the neighboring clusters being indistinguishable whereas too few clusters can cause loss of important details due to over generalization of information yip et al 2013 the optimal number of clusters is determined by the calinski harabasz index chi which is defined as the ratio of between cluster variance varb to within cluster variance varw burn 2014 1 chi var b var w n k k 1 2 var b k 1 k n k z k z 2 3 var w k 1 k i 1 n k x i z k 2 here n is the number of observations k is the number of clusters zk is the centroid of cluster k z is the centroid of the entire data set nk is the number of observations xi that belong to cluster k in this study chi was calculated for k varying from 2 to 10 and the value of k for which chi is maximized is considered to be the optimal number of clusters here a provisional 10 clusters were used as the maximum number of clusters however the estimated chi in section 4 2 shows a clear trend that chi decreases with the number of clusters the synoptic patterns identified from the nnrp dataset were first compared with those obtained from the rcm nnrp simulations regarding the number of clusters the proportion of each cluster and the spatial presentation of each pattern as the synoptic patterns identified from the rcm nnrp simulations rather than the nnrp dataset were used as the base maps to extract the similar patterns from the rcm mk3 5 under both current and future climates an assumption made here is that the synoptic patterns simulated by rcm nnrp are representative of observed ones therefore it is desirable that the synoptic patterns of the rcm nnrp be similar to those found for observations i e nnrp as the synoptic patterns are generally considered to be simulated well by rcms this assumption is sensible and was verified by comparing the synoptic patterns obtained from the two datasets i e rcm nnrp and nnrp in section 4 2 in finding the synoptic patterns for the rcm mk3 5 the euclidean distance between the base maps and the synoptic status on each of the days with synoptic scale events simulated by the rcm mk3 5 was estimated and the days with the synoptic status closest to one of the cluster base maps was assigned to that cluster 3 3 synoptic patterns based bias corrections as the biases of the extreme rainfall vary with the different synoptic patterns we adopted a synoptic pattern based bias correction method which corrects not only the biases in the extreme rainfall corresponding to each synoptic type but also the proportion of each type fig 2b illustrates the process of the sp based bias correction method to keep the presentation clear we assume only two clusters are found in section 3 2 bias correction is applied to each individual cluster by means of quantile mapping in which we first calculated the correction factors as the ratio of the observed rainfall extreme value to the model simulated value for the current climate for each percentile x for cluster k the future model projection p mod fut is then corrected for each cluster at the percentile x by multiplying with the appropriate correction factor according to eq 4 the assumption made here is that biases in each type of extreme rainfall are constant over time this assumption is different from the constant bias assumption often made in studies using gcm or rcm simulations gutjahr and heinemann 2013 piani et al 2010 räty et al 2014 which can be violated under a warmer climate as suggested by a few recent studies sunyer et al 2014 in this study the overall bias in the extreme rainfall distribution is not constant as we allow the proportion of each type of extreme rainfall event to change as well as the more standard assumption that the bias may be different for different parts of the rainfall distribution 4 p cor fut k x p obs k x p mod cur k x p mod fut k x the weights simulated by the rcm are corrected for individual clusters following eq 5 the corrected future rainfall extremes for all the clusters are calculated as the weighted sum of the corrected rainfall extremes of all the individual clusters the results are expected to be different from those obtained by applying quantile mapping bias correction to the entire dataset without classification as illustrated in fig 2a 5 w cor fut k w obs k w mod cur k w mod fut k 6 p cor fut x k 1 k w cor fut k p cor fut k x 3 4 synthetic experiment design as there is only one high resolution 2km rcm currently available over the study region the concern is that any findings based on a single model may lack generality to explore the possible conditions under which the proposed method will lead to significantly different outcomes a synthetic experiment was designed in the experiment instead of using the annual maximum series ams simulated by a single rcm synthetic datasets that cover a wide range of possible ams values were used each synthetic dataset was extracted from a generalized extreme value gev distribution the gev distribution was found to be the best fit for the ams in australia green et al 2012 the gev parameters used to build the synthetic ams to represent the rcm simulations for both current and future climates were extracted from a sequence of gev parameter sets which were created by perturbing the observation gev parameters to 50 above or below their actual values to reduce the computation time two ams clusters corresponding to two different sps were adopted in this experiment the proportion of each cluster was selected from a sequence of the proportions that are within 50 above or below the observed proportion for that type repeating this data generating process for 2 million times and excluding the cases when the mean of the ams is 50 above or below the observational mean and the proportion of each cluster is less than 2 or more than 98 we ended up with 680 391 valid cases we then applied the two bias correction methods to those valid cases and carried out a kolmogorov smirnov ks test at 5 significance level on the results based on the ks test results the synthetic cases were split into two groups one group shows the proposed method generates significantly different results to the quantile mapping method the other group shows the results produced by the two methods are statistically indistinguishable to investigate the possible conditions that can be used to predict the membership of these two groups the classification tree method was used the concept of the classification tree is to recursively split the data space of the predictors into two subsets until each subset contains the data with the response mainly belonging to a given class friedman et al 2001 in this case the two classes of the response were defined as the ks test decision i e 0 for accepting the null hypothesis and 1 for rejecting the null hypothesis on whether the proposed method produces significantly different results to the conventional method the following five factors considered to be able to potentially separate the significantly different cases from the insignificant ones were used as predictors of the classification tree the absolute change in the proportion of each cluster w f 1 w c 1 which can be any value between 0 and 1 here wc 1 and wf 1 represent the proportion of cluster 1 under the current and future climates respectively one important feature of the proposed method is that it considers the change in the proportion of each cluster which is ignored by the quantile mapping approach if there is no change in the proportion then the proposed method will collapse to the quantile mapping method if the change in the proportion is 1 which means one type of extreme events completely changes to another type then the two methods will again produce the same results because there is essentially only one type of extreme rainfall events the absolute difference of the correction factors between two clusters p 0 1 cf 1 cf 2 dp where p is the probability and cf is the correction factor the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the cluster 1 and cluster 2 if the correction factors for the two clusters are the same i e cf 1 cf 2 then the correction factor for the entire distribution will also be the same in this case it is not necessary to apply bias correction to individual clusters separately as it will not generate any results that are different from correcting the entire distribution at once on the other hand if this factor is large it means that the correction applied to each type is more different and thus larger differences are likely to show between the two methods the absolute change in quantiles of the corrected ams for each cluster p 0 1 x f 1 cor x c 1 cor dp and p 0 1 x f 2 cor x c 2 cor dp where p is the probability and x cor represents the quantile the subscripts f and c indicate the current and future climates respectively the numbers 1 and 2 in the subscripts represent cluster 1 and cluster 2 if there is no change in ams from current to future then the corrected distribution of ams for the future climate will be the same as for the current climate which has to match observations in this case unless there is a dramatic change in the proportion of each cluster the results obtained from the proposed method will be of no difference to those produced by using the quantile mapping method the ks test decision i e 0 for accepting the null hypothesis and 1 for rejecting the null hypothesis on whether the corrected distributions of the two clusters for the future climate are significantly different from each other h x f 1 cor x f 2 cor here x f 1 cor and x f 2 cor represent the quantiles of the corrected future ams distributions for cluster 1 and cluster 2 respectively the null hypothesis is that the two distributions are the same a reject of the null hypothesis means that the corrected distributions of the two clusters for the future climate are different at 5 significance level in which case the difference between the two methods are likely to show 4 results as the synthetic experiment explores a wide range of possible extreme rainfall data spectrum the results of it will be more general than the case study based on a single rcm it is intuitive to report the general results first and then go to the specific case therefore this section will first inspect the outcomes from applying the two bias correction methods to the synthetic data followed by a real case study based on rcm simulations the results of the real case will be present in two subsections first the synoptic patterns identified using the som classification will be explained and then the bias corrected future extreme rainfall distributions using the two methods will be compared 4 1 bias correction of synthetic data the two bias correction methods were applied to the 680 391 synthetic cases and the ks test was used to test the difference between the outcomes of the two methods the result reveals that about 46 of the cases show the two bias corrected distributions under the future climate are significantly different from each other this result provides insights into the likelihood of the two methods showing significant difference if multiple rcms were available and used in this study which is possible in the future due to the increasingly improved computer power to investigate the possible conditions under which the proposed method will significantly differ from the quantile mapping method the classification tree approach was employed to separate the synthetic cases into the two distinctive groups as explained in the previous section the classification tree will recursively split the data into two subsets until each subset contains the data with the response mainly from the same class it is necessary to know when to stop growing the tree this is because an undergrown tree may cause some important structural information about the sample space missing whereas an overgrown tree can result in over fitting of the training data the optimal size of the tree is determined based on the minimum cross validation error it was found that cross validation error decreases rapidly with the minimum leaf size which is the minimum data points on any end node of the tree and then slowly increases the minimum leaf size found in this case is 359 with the cross validation error of 0 2038 the optimal tree was grown based on this minimum leaf size although the optimal tree has the lowest cross validation error the size is too big i e 81 levels to have any practical meaning as it is unrealistic to apply 81 rules to get a decision on whether the two methods give different results in fact to get good separation of the significant cases from the insignificant ones it is unnecessary to apply all the 81 rules only applying the rule at the first level from the root node is able to get 71 significant cases and 81 insignificant cases correctly classified as shown in fig 3 the averaged distributions for the future climate using the two methods were plotted for the cases that fall into the two branches of the tree at the first level it is clear that cases on the left branch show the high similarity between the two methods while those on the right branch allow the proposed method to distinguish from the conventional method the factor used in the classification at this level of the tree is the absolute difference of the correction factors between two clusters when this factor is larger than 0 46 the two methods are most likely to generate significantly different results this rule can be used as an initial checkpoint to see whether a different result is expected when bias correction is required for a new dataset it is noted from fig 3 that as the tree grows down the misclassification rate does not necessarily drop which suggests that the best segregation line draws at the first level of the tree this means that the absolute difference of the correction factors between two clusters is the dominant factor that contributes to the difference between the two methods 4 2 synoptic patterns of observations and model simulations despite the factor that nearly half of the synthetic cases proved that applying bias correction to partitioned extreme rainfall data does generate significantly different results compared to when the types of rainfall extremes are ignored it is still worthwhile to test the findings through a case study using actual rcm simulations the sea level pressure from nnrp dataset during the extreme events were classified into various numbers of clusters starting from 2 to 10 according to the calinski harabasz index two clusters are favored for 1 day extreme events taking the small scale extreme events as a third cluster a total of three clusters can be used to represent all the extreme rainfall events identified table 2 by taking the average of the synoptic maps that belong to their corresponding classes the representative synoptic patterns sps were obtained fig 4 a c shows the representative sps for the three clusters all of which have a high over the tasman sea and a low over the continent the moisture transported from the sea to the land by the pressure gradient brought heavy rainfall to the sydney region it is noted that sp3 has the sparsest contours which is expected since this cluster is identified for days with only 1 4 stations having concurrent annual maximum rainfall sp2 has the densest contours indicating the cluster represents the extreme events with strongest winds as the pressure field from the rcm used in this study is on a finer grid resolution than that from the nnrp dataset the synoptic patterns identified from the nnrp dataset cannot be used as base maps to establish the synoptic clusters for the rcm runs instead the synoptic patterns found from the rcm nnrp simulations by applying the som classification was used as the base maps which are shown in fig 4d f the legitimacy of using rcm nnrp simulated synoptic patterns as observation is confirmed by the fact that the synoptic patterns simulated by the rcm nnrp are similar to those found from observations i e nnrp despite the different resolutions of the pressure field from these two data sources the synoptic maps on each of the extreme event days defined by the rcm mk3 5 simulations for the current climate were assigned to the closest base map according to the euclidean distance fig 4g i is the three representative synoptic patterns after taking the average of all the synoptic maps that belong to each cluster although these three synoptic clusters are similar to those found from the rcm nnrp simulations the proportion of each cluster differs from that of the rcm nnrp run the rcm mk3 5 tends to undersimulate the occurrence of the synoptic scale events i e sp1 and sp2 while overproduces the number of the small scale events i e sp3 this proportional discrepancy is considered as one type of bias i e bias in the proportion and needs to be corrected again based on the euclidean distance the three clusters were identified for the rcm mk3 5 for the future climate as shown in fig 4j l these three patterns are also similar to those simulated by the rcm nnrp here a clear decreasing trend is seen in the proportion of the synoptic scale events i e sp1 and sp2 whereas an increasing trend is found in the proportion of the small scale events i e sp3 although the proportion of the synoptic scale events is decreasing the occurrence or the number of this type of events is still increasing but not as fast as the small scale events as indicated in table 2 4 3 bias correction of the rcm simulations based on the classification results the annual maximum rainfall time series belonging to the same cluster were grouped together the distribution of each cluster was bias corrected using eq 4 the proportion of each cluster was also corrected and then multiplied to the corrected distribution of that cluster finally the weighted distributions of the three clusters were added up to form the whole distribution which was compared with the distribution obtained using the quantile mapping bias correction method it is clear that extreme rainfall intensity tends to increase for events with exceedance probability smaller than 1 in 5years i e less frequent events as indicated by comparing the 1 day ams between observations and the future simulation after bias correction fig 5 e this increasing trend was also found in the individual type of precipitation extremes corresponding to sp1 and sp3 as indicated by the blue and green curves in fig 5a and b with sp1 related precipitation extremes increasing the most the intensity of the precipitation extremes belonging to sp2 was to change little in the future for this particular rcm the empirical cdf obtained from the proposed method differs from that estimated from the conventional quantile mapping method by 10 to 8 as shown in fig 5f although the ks test does not indicate this difference is statistically significant at the 5 level the between cluster difference in the correction factor estimated for this rcm simulation is 0 18 which falls into the first left branch of the classification tree this confirms the non significant results from the ks test 5 discussions when designing the synthetic experiment we used only two clusters for the simplicity of demonstration the classification tree can give us a sense of when we can expect different results from the two methods although the situation may become much more complicated with an increasing number of clusters we can still expect a higher likelihood of finding differences between the two methods if large differences are identified in correction factors between different extreme rainfall types alternatively we can also draw a classification tree to find the rules to distinguish significant cases from insignificant ones but this time the tree is based on more factors for example when only two clusters are used the absolute difference in the correction factor is just between cluster 1 and 2 when a third cluster is added the difference between cluster 1 and 3 as well as between cluster 2 and 3 should also be included the rcm used in this study adopted cmip3 gcm csiro mk3 5 outputs as its boundary conditions for the future run because the cmip5 project was in its early stage when the rcm project narclim was initiated in 2011 the future rcm projection used the sres a2 emission scenario which has the same greenhouse emission as representative concentration pathway rcp 6 0 and rcp 4 5 in 2050 as suggested by woldemeskel et al 2016 the uncertainty in temperature simulated by cmip5 gcms is of the same order as that simulated by cmip3 ccms while a slight reduction in precipitation uncertainty is found due to the improvement of model structure and realization in cmip5 therefore using a cmip3 gcm for boundary conditions is unlikely to change the conclusion in this study compared to using a cmip5 gcm the results presented here for the case study are only for 1 day ams we have also applied the som classification to the 3 day mean sea level pressure and then carried out the sp based bias correction method on 3 day ams the results were compared with those based on the quantile mapping similar to 1 day case a non significant difference was found between the corrected future extreme rainfall distributions obtained from the two methods for the 3 day case the between cluster difference in the correction factor was found to be 0 19 also falling into the first left branch of the classification tree this again confirms the finding that the difference between the two methods is not significant for this particular rcm run unlike most other bias correction approaches which are based on a crucial assumption that the bias is stationary the proposed method allows a non stationary bias in the overall distribution of extreme rainfall by incorporating the possible changes in the mix of different types of extreme rainfall however the proposed method assumes that there is no change in the bias of each type of extreme rainfall event this assumption is difficult to verify because the historical period simulated by the rcm used in this study is not long enough to show any non stationary trend in bias we note that recent studies that question the stationarity assumption only refer to bias of the overall distribution of the climate variables there is no research to our knowledge that examines the non stationarity in the bias of different types of events this study applied the sp based bias correction method only to daily and 3 day ams in the sydney region although we did find significantly different results obtained from the sp based method and the conventional method in nearly half 47 of the synthetic cases the single rcm simulation cannot distinguish these two methods the reason for that is the difference in the correction factors between different types of rainfall extremes is not large enough to make the results statistically distinguishable in addition to using sea level pressure only to represent the synoptic patterns that are responsible for the extreme rainfall event multiple variables including the precipitable water vertical velocity at 850hpa and relative vorticity at 500hpa were also used to partition the extreme rainfall events into various types the selection of these variables was based on a previous study by friederichs and hense 2007 which used these variables to statistically downscale extreme rainfall over europe however using multivariables to define sps caused only a small change in the results the conclusion is still the same that the influence of the additional information of sps on the bias correction is not significant for this particular rcm now the question remains whether a different conclusion can be reached if the same process was applied to subdaily ams and to other parts of the world unlike daily or multiday rainfall extremes subdaily extremes are more related to convective storms than stratiform systems the response of convective rainfall to temperature increases is different to that of stratiform rainfall in general convective events are more sensitive to temperature changes than stratiform storms and changes in the intensity of extreme events may be related to a change in the proportion of convective versus stratiform events berg and haerter 2013 westra et al 2014 did a thorough review on future changes of subdaily extreme rainfall and pointed out the limitation in the current state of knowledge on this issue however it is clear that the trend of subdaily extreme rainfall varies with temperature regions and storm durations etc therefore it is possible to see significantly different bias correction results from these two methods when they are applied to a different region and different time scale to our case study here 6 conclusions potential changes in synoptic circulation patterns under global warming are expected to alter the intensities and frequencies of rainfall extremes in this study we evaluated the influence of including synoptic patterns to the bias correction first through a synthetic experiment and then a real case based on rcm simulations we found 46 of the synthetic cases turned out to be significantly different when using the two bias correction methods for the results to be significantly different the between cluster difference in the correction factor needs to be large enough which however is not the case for the rcm simulations used in this study to identify the different extreme rainfall clusters the self organizing maps classification was used the three sps identified for the nnrp reanalysis dataset closely resemble those simulated by wrf nnrp which confirms the initial assumption that the circulation patterns are generally simulated well by the rcms using the identified sps from the wrf nnrp simulation as base maps the synoptic maps on the extreme rainfall days simulated by wrf mk3 5 for both the current and future climates were allocated to the closest base map according to the euclidean distance it was found that the total number of extreme events tends to increase under a warming climate and that the number of small scale extreme events increases faster than that of large scale extreme events this finding is consistent with the previous study that localized convective storms are more sensitive to higher temperature berg et al 2013 acknowledgements regional climate data have been provided by the new south wales and australian capital territory

7596,this contribution presents a method for correcting the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation fields in a mountainous environment the approach is applied within a flood forecasting model in the upper enns catchment in the central austrian alps precipitation exhibits a large spatio temporal variability in alpine areas additionally the density of the monitoring network is low and measurements are subjected to major errors this can lead to significant deficits in water balance estimation and stream flow simulations e g for flood forecasting models therefore precipitation correction factors are frequently applied for the presented study a multiplicative stepwise linear correction model is implemented in the rainfall runoff model cosero to adjust the precipitation pattern as a function of elevation to account for the local meteorological conditions the correction model is derived for two elevation zones 1 valley floors to 2000m a s l and 2 above 2000m a s l to mountain peaks measurement errors also depend on the precipitation type with higher magnitudes in winter months during snow fall therefore additionally separate correction factors for winter and summer months are estimated significant improvements in the runoff simulations could be achieved not only in the long term water balance simulation and the overall model performance but also in the simulation of flood peaks keywords precipitation variability precipitation correction high alpine area conceptual rainfall runoff model 1 introduction the application of spatially distributed hydrological models depends on spatially distributed precipitation input data these inputs are however subjected to several uncertainties point observations of precipitation which build the basis for the calculation of distributed precipitation values are error inflicted seibert and morén 1999 sevruk and nespor 1998 sevruk 1981 the adjustment or correction of precipitation time series e g as a function of wind speed or the form of precipitation liquid solid can therefore be applied sevruk 1986 sevruk et al 2009 the correction of precipitation time series however does not allow to overcome the fact that the high temporal and spatial variability of the precipitation process is frequently insufficiently monitored pomeroy et al 2015 wood et al 2000 single station time series are possibly also not representative for a larger area due to small scale meteorological conditions at the measurement site bica et al 2011 in the estimation procedure of catchment scale rainfall systematic and stochastic errors of the regionalisation methods can be identified as an additional information source quantitative areal rainfall estimates from radar products may be used but are still afflicted with significant uncertainties krajewski and smith 2002 krajewski et al 2010 these challenges are relevant in the application of distributed hydrological models especially in alpine areas with complex topography the combination of a high spatio temporal variability of the precipitation process and a low density of the monitoring network can lead to significant deficits in stream flow simulations e g for flood forecasting models nachtnebel et al 2013 especially in the practical application of rainfall runoff models in the context of flood warning systems it is crucial that the model simulations are able to reflect observed runoff conditions in case of alpine catchments with high precipitation sums the runoff is mainly driven by this input therefore precipitation correction factors given that the deficits mostly show a systematic nature are frequently applied these correction factors not only help to overcome possible measurement errors in the station time series but also compensate for errors in the regionalisation method or for regional unrepresentative station time series used in the regionalisation normally the correction factors are however applied for whole subbasins or catchments in a lumped manor neglecting that the magnitude of precipitation errors may possibly be spatially distributed additionally lumped correction factors may generate unrealistic discontinuities in the precipitation fields between catchment boundaries this contribution presents a stepwise linear correction model which enables a distribution of precipitation correction factors as a function of elevation the precipitation correction is thereby implemented in a rainfall runoff model in which the gridded precipitation data used as input is adjusted with distributed multiplicative factors the method is applied to a real time flood forecasting system of the upper enns river in the north central austrian alps run by the hydrographical service of the province of salzburg nachtnebel et al 2013 to account for local meteorological conditions and based on studies performed in the area nagl 1973 1974 the correction model is derived for two elevation zones valley floors up to 2000m a s l and 2000m a s l up to mountain peaks since errors in winter and summer precipitation differ especially due to the difficulty of measuring snow fall season dependent correction factors are also considered the parameters for the correction model are estimated for every subbasin on the basis of independent station observations mainly situated on valley floors and the comparison of observed and simulated runoff the data base and study area are presented in the next section in the methodology section the applied rainfall runoff model and the precipitation correction method is presented results are presented in section 4 followed by the discussion in section 5 this contribution finally ends with a summary and conclusions 2 data base 2 1 study area the case study is performed in the upper enns basin in the north central austrian alps with the enns river being a right tributary to the danube the overall modelled area totals 651km2 divided into 12 subbasins ranging from 5 9 to 62 9km2 and a mean size of 54km2 fig 1 table 1 the gauge at the catchment outlet is located in the small town of schladming the spatial division of the subbasins is based on the location of the runoff gauges 6 in total but also on the demands of the real time flood forecasting system for example subbasin 1 and 3 were introduced since flood retention basins are located at the outlet of these basins information from the warning system is intended to be used for managing these flood protection structures the basin shows alpine characteristics 50 of the catchment lies above 1500ma s l with a range between 716 and 2950ma s l in the area of the dachstein massif 48 of the catchment is dominated by coniferous forest and 33 by grassland and meadows fifteen per cent of the catchment lies above 2000ma s l which can approximately be assumed as the timberline in total 11 of the basin is classified as bare rock with little or no vegetation seven per cent of the basin is covered by mixed forest and a negligible fraction of 1 is covered by settlements herrnegger et al 2012 the hydrological regime is dominated by high altitudes characterised by low winter temperatures and in further consequence to snow accumulation and melt processes dominating runoff characteristics on a long term basis the highest discharge rates can be expected in may during snow melt and the lowest values in winter according to the hydrological atlas of austria bmlfuw 2007 the long term mean annual precipitation of the basin is 1508mm with a runoff of 1077mm resulting in an actual catchment evapotranspiration rate of 431mm table 1 2 2 meteorological data gridded precipitation and air temperature data from the inca integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis system haiden et al 2011 is used as input inca is the meteorological analysis and operational nowcasting application developed and run by the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics of austria zamg providing meteorological parameters at a high temporal 15 60min and spatial 1km2 resolution it is used for several flood forecasting systems in austria for the presented study only analysis fields but not nowcasting fields of precipitation and air temperature are used precipitation is thereby determined by combining rain gauge and radar data the method consists of a nonlinear spatial interpolation of rain gauge values in which the radar field is used as a spatial structure function the interpolation reproduces observed rain gauge values at station locations in addition topographic effects are accounted for in inca since an elevation correction is applied haiden and pistotnik 2009 for the inca precipitation data used in this study time series data from stations operated by zamg and marked as triangles in fig 1 are used the measurements are quality controlled but not corrected e g to account for wind induced undercatch from fig 1 it is evident that the station density is particularly low in the higher elevation areas this is especially the case along the main alpine ridge which builds the southern border of the study area only one single zamg station obertauern 1772ma s l is located in this area the nearest station from the zamg network to the west grossarltal is located on the valley floor on 882m a s l outside of the study area to the east in the direction of the main alpine ridge the nearest stations from the zamg network are rottenmann 707ma s l and kalwang 744ma s l the distance of these stations is approximately 70 and 90km from obertauern it is additionally known that the precipitation measurements in obertauern are significantly biased due to wind induced undercatch personal communication i kreutzwirth hydrological service of the province of salzburg it can be concluded that the information available on actual precipitation rates in the mountainous regions are rather limited the high elevation areas in the south of the study area where high precipitation amounts can be expected and which contribute significantly to runoff are however particularly relevant nagl 1974 for example shows for these parts of the catchment that the areas above 2000m a s l 38 of the total area contribute to over 54 of total precipitation station data from the station network operated by the hydrological services of austria is also available for the study area circles in fig 1 data from this network is only being used since recently for the inca analysis and is therefore not incorporated in the gridded data used in this study stations from this network are also mostly situated in lower lying valley floors apart from the inca air temperature data the high resolution 1km2 mean monthly temperatures from the ecsn hrt gar project hiebl et al 2009 are used as inputs for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall runoff model the simulations are performed with the conceptual rainfall runoff model cosero continuous semidistributed runoff model eder et al 2005 herrnegger et al 2012 2015 kling and nachtnebel 2009 kling et al 2015 among others which in its structure is similar to the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model bergström 1995 for this study the spatial discretization of the model is performed on a 1 1km2 grid with a total of 12 subbasins fig 1 as driving forces spatially distributed datasets of temperature and precipitation are used multiplicative monthly precipitation correction factors parameter pcor can be applied within the model for every modelling zone and allow the adjustment of this input term for the presented application potential evapotranspiration input is calculated according to the thornthwaite method thornthwaite and mather 1957 the hydrological model consists of different modules for calculating the processes of snow accumulation and melt frey and holzmann 2015 interception storage evolution of soil moisture actual evapotranspiration surface runoff interflow base flow and zone routing a detailed description of the model equations can be found in kling et al 2015 3 2 precipitation correction model nagl 1974 1973 extensively studied the hydrology including precipitation patterns of the study area from these studies it can be concluded that due to local meteorological conditions elevation dependency of precipitation differs for the elevation zones from i valley floors up to about 2000ma s l and ii 2000ma s l up to mountain peaks nagl 1974 fig 2 for the first lower elevation zone a less pronounced increase in precipitation with elevation was found in contrast above 2000ma s l a strong elevation dependency was observed in august 1969 a detailed precipitation measurement campaign was performed for the elevation zone 1500 2000 and above 2000ma s l precipitation sums of 244mm and 488mm were calculated highlighting the different meteorological conditions it can be expected that precipitation measurement errors and in consequence the gridded input data will show a different bias depending on winter october to march and summer april to september season with higher errors in winter due to the difficulties in measuring snow fall to account for the different precipitation gradients in the elevation zones as described in nagl 1974 and which are not evident in the inca data and the seasonal nature of errors the following stepwise linear correction model was implemented 1 pcor x s c 0 s c 1 s c 0 s δ elev 1 elev x for elev x 2000 m a s l 2 pcor x s c 1 s c 2 s c 1 s δ elev 2 elev x for elev x 2000 m a s l pcor x s multiplicative precipitation

time the period 01 09 2009 31 08 2012 3 hydrological years is used for validation of the model performance hydrological years are defined from september to august although station data are available for longer periods the simulation period is limited by the availability of the inca data longer time series would however help to support and underpin the findings the rainfall runoff model is run with hourly time steps runoff data are available for the overall period with the exception of subbasin 11 where data is missing for 8months in the year 2012 or about 7 percent in comparison to the overall simulation period a combination of numerical optimisation using the rosenbrock method rosenbrock 1960 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 as objective criteria and manual parameter calibration was used the combined approach was applied with the knowledge that the final model performance would probably not reach the level of an automatic calibration the calibrated rainfall runoff model is used in a flood forecasting system the inclusion of the manual calibration however allows the expert hydrologist performing the calibration to place special focus on periods or parts of the hydrograph which are crucial for flood forecasting systems e g flood peaks generally the calibration was performed for the individual subbasins with runoff observations allowing the consideration of local features in the subbasins the parameters of the precipitation correction model were manually estimated for the single catchments on the basis of i independent station observations mainly on valley floors not used in inca and ii a comparison of long term simulated and observed runoff values i e the long term water balance in total six values were estimated for every subbasin three pcor values are needed for the winter and summer season to define the linear correction model a pcor value is thereby estimated for i the lowest elevation i e c 0 s in eq 1 ii 2000ma s l i e c 1 s in eqs 1 and 2 and iii the highest elevation within a subbasin i e c 2 s in eq 2 in between these values the pcor values for every zone are calculated via the linear model depending on the elevation of the single zones the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias mean absolute and normalised peak error and mean peak timing error are used as objective criteria to

example the pcor values have a range of 0 95 1 5 for summer and 1 03 2 25 in winter at 2000m a s l where the discontinuity is visible pcor values of 1 1 and 1 4 were estimated for summer and winter the generally higher pcor values for the winter season are found due to larger measurement errors in winter precipitation the pcor values at the lowest elevation 2000ma s l and the highest elevation correspond to c 0 s c 1 s c 2 s in eqs 1 and 2 for the other subbasins similar correction models were set up the resulting distributed pcor values for the study area are shown in fig 3 with in general higher correction values in winter with an overall mean value of 1 18 compared to summer with a mean of 1 04 on an annual basis a mean pcor of 1 11 is calculated for the study area if precipitation in winter and summer season were the same the mean precipitation would therefore be increased by 11 in the lower lying valleys and parts of the study area pcor values of below 0 95 with a minimum value of 0 87 on the annual basis are found these correction factors c 0 s in eq 1 are where available based on the comparison of the independent station data and the inca grid values at the station locations here the station data mostly showed lower precipitation values compared to the inca data explaining the pcor values lower than 1 for the north south oriented tributary subbasins a gradual increase of pcor values with elevation is mostly visible the highest pcor value of 4 05 is found for winter in the highest model zones of subbasin 7 this is also the subbasin in which the station obertauern is located and which as described before shows severe deficits in the observed precipitation time series this explains the high pcor values since the deficits in the gridded data needed to be corrected mean pcor values of 1 54 winter 1 39 summer and 1 47 annual can be calculated for subbasin 7 fig 4 shows the mean annual precipitation sums for the calibration and validation period with left pcor 1 and without right pcor 1 the implemented pcor values for the case with pcor 1 the highest precipitation values are found in the northern part of subbasin 8 below the dachstein massif although precipitation increases with elevation also in the other subbasins the increase is not very pronounced especially in subbasin 7 the precipitation sums do not show a pronounced spatial variability since the area is strongly biased by the station obertauern similar results are found if calibration and validation period are analysed separately in contrast the corrected precipitation fields pcor 1 show a distinct elevation dependency with the highest precipitation values in the high elevation zones in consequence also the precipitation sums increase in the southern tributary basins for example a mean precipitation in subbasin 11 of about 1450mm is calculated with the original inca data this value increases to nearly 1840mm when pcor is applied in subbasin 7 the mean catchment precipitation increases from 1370 to 1990mm a precipitation in the study area is mostly determined by currents from the north west the tennengebirge 2430ma s l and the dachstein 2950ma s l however having some sheltering effects fig 1 the gap between these two massifs nevertheless allows moist air to reach parts of the study area unaffected also explaining the high precipitation amounts in subbasin 7 nagl 1974 4 2 rainfall runoff simulations the simulation performance of the rainfall runoff model mostly increases significantly when the precipitation correction factors pcor are applied this is the case when evaluating longer periods table 2 fig 5 but also for the simulation of flood peaks table 3 fig 6 this also applies for the independent validation period in subbasin 11 a period of 8months of the year 2012 was not evaluated due to missing runoff data the length of the data gap corresponds to about 7 percent of the overall simulation period the findings are although not completely comparable to the other subbasins nonetheless valid for this subbasin due to the relative short data gap table 2 summarizes for the single subbasins the model performance for calibration validation and overall period measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias with the exception of subbasin 12 in the calibration and overall period the nse values are higher for the case pcor 1 improvements are found for the southern tributary catchments which are significant for subbasin 7 10 and 11 in subbasin 7 for example in the validation period the nse with pcor 1 increases from 0 009 to over 0 72 with pcor 1 but also in the calibration and overall period the nse increases by 150 from 0 31 to 0 75 and 244 from 0 22 to 0 74 in this subbasin in subbasin 11 the nse improves by 19 44 and 22 depending on the evaluated calibration validation and overall period the percent bias with pcor 1 mostly shows an underestimation of observed runoff the largest underestimations are thereby found for subbasin 7 10 and 11 ranging from 39 to 9 depending on the evaluated period although underestimations are still calculated with pcor 1 in single subbasins and periods significant improvements are evident for the overall period for example in subbasin 7 the underestimation of 33 with pcor 1 changes into a nearly perfect balance between simulated and observed runoff with pcor 1 fig 5 shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias for the two cases with pcor 1 and pcor 1 for single hydrological years and all subbasins from the scatterplot in fig 5 left it is evident that also in the single hydrological years the nse is mostly higher for pcor 1 similar to results in table 2 some significant improvements are visible note that two points from subbasin 7 are not displayed in the plot since they showed negative nse values with pcor 1 but improved to nse values of 0 69 and 0 71 with pcor 1 the points showing the strongest deterioration of model performance due to pcor 1 originate from the hydrological year 2006 07 this period was comparatively dry also exhibiting less snow in winter and snow melt in spring the runoff simulations with pcor 1 already overestimated observed runoff in this period this deficit was amplified with pcor 1 explaining the results with exception of subbasin 4 and single periods a systematic underestimation of observed runoff pbias 0 is evident when uncorrected precipitation input is used fig 5 right although a large spread in the pbias values is also visible for the pcor 1 case the results show an improvement in the simulation of the observed runoff balance generally no systematic differences between calibration and validation are visible fig 6 shows a comparison of the 25 largest peak discharge events and associated peak simulations with pcor 1 orange and without pcor 1 black correction exemplarily for the subbasins 7 and 11 the systematic underestimation of peak discharges which is especially evident for subbasin 7 fig 6 left is significantly improved when the distributed precipitation correction is applied table 3 summarizes the performance of peak discharge simulations for the calibration and validation periods in the different subbasins and for both cases from the analysis of the 25 largest observed events it is evident that on average the simulations underestimate the peak discharge values especially for the pcor 1 case and subbasins 7 10 and 11 large deviations are found the precipitation correction leads to a noteworthy improvement of the mean peak error within these basins the precipitation correction does not significantly influence the mean peak timing error with the exception of subbasin 10 in the calibration period the positive values here indicate that the model on the average simulates peaks too late 5 discussion the presented method for correcting precipitation within the rainfall runoff model is based on the assumption that the long term water balance between precipitation actual evapotranspiration eta and runoff is simulated correctly it can be assumed that the observed runoff has the lowest measurement uncertainties in comparison to the other water balance components herrnegger et al 2015 the plausibility of the eta term of the water balance for which unfortunately no measurements exist in the area must therefore be examined the mean annual eta in the calibration period for the whole catchment is 422mm a for pcor 1 and 427mm a for pcor 1 a negligible difference of slightly over 1 in bmlfuw 2007 although for a different period 1960 1990 a similar eta value of 431mm a is published the difference in the mean annual precipitation sums between pcor 1 and pcor 1 for the catchment is about 90mm a in the calibration period to close the water balance with the uncorrected inca data the eta term would therefore have to be reduced by about 22 or to 330mm a this seems unrealistic also when considering that there are indications that the eta is larger in alpine areas when different potential evapotranspiration models are used as input herrnegger et al 2012 in this case the precipitation correction factors would even have to be higher compared to the values presented here although the results presented show significant improvements in the simulation performance the correction of precipitation within a hydrological model should be avoided if possible if deficits in the precipitation inputs are evident solutions e g adaption of the regionalisation process e g haiden and pistotnik 2009 or the blacklisting of single stations should be sought for beforehand using precipitation inputs of good quality not only facilitates the calibration of hydrological models but also gives more confidence in the results the close collaboration between meteorologist and hydrologist during the setup of different flood forecasting systems in austria stanzel et al 2008 must be mentioned as a good example the iterative process of adapting precipitation inputs is time consuming and expensive this being the reason why it was not applied in the context of the presented work additionally and probably the most important limiting factor is that the possibility to influence the generation of gridded precipitation input is frequently not there this is for example the case when using e obs data haylock et al 2008 continental to global precipitation data e g dee et al 2011 huffman et al 2007 maidment et al 2014 schamm et al 2014 or data from climate models as input into a hydrological model the bias correction of the gridded data teutschbein and seibert 2012 or precipitation correction within the rainfall runoff model therefore remain inevitable e g with the application of the presented method the pcor values and in consequence the precipitation sums partly show discontinuities between catchments boundaries although small scale variability could explain the results e g due to windward or leeward effects at mountain ridges the discontinuities are probably the results of the precipitation correction if lumped correction factors are used e g on the subbasin level the discontinuities would however be larger the correction is based on the assumption that the bias in the precipitation fields is systematic and stationary if the spatial structure of the bias of the precipitation fields change e g due to changing climatic conditions the step wise linear correction formulated in eqs 1 and 2 or the parameters including the threshold value of 2000m a s l found in the study may not be applicable additionally changes in the observation network may result in different errors due to the internal correction this has to be considered in the practical online application of the rainfall runoff model 6 summary and conclusions precipitation exhibits a large spatio temporal variability in alpine areas additionally the density of the monitoring network is low and measurements are subjected to major errors which may also differ depending on the precipitation form this can lead to significant deficits in stream flow simulations in the presented study a rainfall runoff model for a real time flood forecasting system was set up for the upper enns catchment in the north central austrian alps utilizing gridded 1 1km2 precipitation and temperature in a temporal resolution of 60 min as inputs to compensate for the spatially distributed errors in the precipitation input a multiplicative correction model was established the approach is thereby based on a piecewise linear model in which precipitation correction factors are calculated as a function of elevation due to local meteorological conditions the correction model is derived for two elevation zones additionally a seasonal dependency of the correction model was implemented since different errors are expected depending on whether we are dealing with a winter and summer season with higher errors in winter due to the difficulties in measuring snow fall the parameters of the precipitation correction model were manually adjusted for the single subbasins on the basis of i independent station observations not used in the gridded data and ii a comparison of long term simulated and observed runoff values i e the long term water balance additional complementary information from a study on the hydrology including precipitation patterns of the study area was utilized on an annual basis a mean precipitation correction factor pcor of 1 11 is calculated for the study area in the lower lying valleys and parts of the study area pcor values of below 0 95 with a minimum value of 0 87 on the annual basis are found the highest pcor values of 4 05 are found for winter in the highest model zones of a single subbasin the highest mean subbasin pcor values of 1 54 winter 1 39 summer and 1 47 annual are also calculated for this subbasin these high correction factors are explained by the necessity to compensate for deficits in the precipitation gauging network the station obertauern is located in this subbasin and shows severe deficits in the observed precipitation time series as a consequence of the presented findings the hydrological service of salzburg is assessing the benefit of the establishment of a new meteorological station on the main alpine ridge of the study area significant improvements in the runoff simulations could be achieved when comparing the simulations with corrected and uncorrected precipitation input not only in the long term water balance simulation and the overall model performance but also in the simulation of flood peaks for example the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the simulation of the overall period could be increased by a factor of 3 36 from 0 22 to 0 74 in an exemplary subbasin the improvements also manifested themselves in the independent validation period for example the largest mean normalised peak error of a subbasin in the validation period could be reduced from 39 8 to 3 no effects are found on the peak timing error it can be concluded that the presented correction model is a feasible approach to compensate errors of given gridded precipitation fields in which systematic errors e g the underestimation of elevation dependency exist in cases where the errors are a continuous function of elevation a simple linear regression model can be applied for areas where snow can be ignored the distinction between seasonal corrections may also not be necessary under consideration of these two cases the estimation of the linear model parameters is then based on two parameters namely the correction value at the lowest and highest elevation zones within a catchment acknowledgments this study was conducted in the framework of the project flood forecasting system upper enns and upper mur funded by the hydrographical service of the province of salzburg 
7596,this contribution presents a method for correcting the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation fields in a mountainous environment the approach is applied within a flood forecasting model in the upper enns catchment in the central austrian alps precipitation exhibits a large spatio temporal variability in alpine areas additionally the density of the monitoring network is low and measurements are subjected to major errors this can lead to significant deficits in water balance estimation and stream flow simulations e g for flood forecasting models therefore precipitation correction factors are frequently applied for the presented study a multiplicative stepwise linear correction model is implemented in the rainfall runoff model cosero to adjust the precipitation pattern as a function of elevation to account for the local meteorological conditions the correction model is derived for two elevation zones 1 valley floors to 2000m a s l and 2 above 2000m a s l to mountain peaks measurement errors also depend on the precipitation type with higher magnitudes in winter months during snow fall therefore additionally separate correction factors for winter and summer months are estimated significant improvements in the runoff simulations could be achieved not only in the long term water balance simulation and the overall model performance but also in the simulation of flood peaks keywords precipitation variability precipitation correction high alpine area conceptual rainfall runoff model 1 introduction the application of spatially distributed hydrological models depends on spatially distributed precipitation input data these inputs are however subjected to several uncertainties point observations of precipitation which build the basis for the calculation of distributed precipitation values are error inflicted seibert and morén 1999 sevruk and nespor 1998 sevruk 1981 the adjustment or correction of precipitation time series e g as a function of wind speed or the form of precipitation liquid solid can therefore be applied sevruk 1986 sevruk et al 2009 the correction of precipitation time series however does not allow to overcome the fact that the high temporal and spatial variability of the precipitation process is frequently insufficiently monitored pomeroy et al 2015 wood et al 2000 single station time series are possibly also not representative for a larger area due to small scale meteorological conditions at the measurement site bica et al 2011 in the estimation procedure of catchment scale rainfall systematic and stochastic errors of the regionalisation methods can be identified as an additional information source quantitative areal rainfall estimates from radar products may be used but are still afflicted with significant uncertainties krajewski and smith 2002 krajewski et al 2010 these challenges are relevant in the application of distributed hydrological models especially in alpine areas with complex topography the combination of a high spatio temporal variability of the precipitation process and a low density of the monitoring network can lead to significant deficits in stream flow simulations e g for flood forecasting models nachtnebel et al 2013 especially in the practical application of rainfall runoff models in the context of flood warning systems it is crucial that the model simulations are able to reflect observed runoff conditions in case of alpine catchments with high precipitation sums the runoff is mainly driven by this input therefore precipitation correction factors given that the deficits mostly show a systematic nature are frequently applied these correction factors not only help to overcome possible measurement errors in the station time series but also compensate for errors in the regionalisation method or for regional unrepresentative station time series used in the regionalisation normally the correction factors are however applied for whole subbasins or catchments in a lumped manor neglecting that the magnitude of precipitation errors may possibly be spatially distributed additionally lumped correction factors may generate unrealistic discontinuities in the precipitation fields between catchment boundaries this contribution presents a stepwise linear correction model which enables a distribution of precipitation correction factors as a function of elevation the precipitation correction is thereby implemented in a rainfall runoff model in which the gridded precipitation data used as input is adjusted with distributed multiplicative factors the method is applied to a real time flood forecasting system of the upper enns river in the north central austrian alps run by the hydrographical service of the province of salzburg nachtnebel et al 2013 to account for local meteorological conditions and based on studies performed in the area nagl 1973 1974 the correction model is derived for two elevation zones valley floors up to 2000m a s l and 2000m a s l up to mountain peaks since errors in winter and summer precipitation differ especially due to the difficulty of measuring snow fall season dependent correction factors are also considered the parameters for the correction model are estimated for every subbasin on the basis of independent station observations mainly situated on valley floors and the comparison of observed and simulated runoff the data base and study area are presented in the next section in the methodology section the applied rainfall runoff model and the precipitation correction method is presented results are presented in section 4 followed by the discussion in section 5 this contribution finally ends with a summary and conclusions 2 data base 2 1 study area the case study is performed in the upper enns basin in the north central austrian alps with the enns river being a right tributary to the danube the overall modelled area totals 651km2 divided into 12 subbasins ranging from 5 9 to 62 9km2 and a mean size of 54km2 fig 1 table 1 the gauge at the catchment outlet is located in the small town of schladming the spatial division of the subbasins is based on the location of the runoff gauges 6 in total but also on the demands of the real time flood forecasting system for example subbasin 1 and 3 were introduced since flood retention basins are located at the outlet of these basins information from the warning system is intended to be used for managing these flood protection structures the basin shows alpine characteristics 50 of the catchment lies above 1500ma s l with a range between 716 and 2950ma s l in the area of the dachstein massif 48 of the catchment is dominated by coniferous forest and 33 by grassland and meadows fifteen per cent of the catchment lies above 2000ma s l which can approximately be assumed as the timberline in total 11 of the basin is classified as bare rock with little or no vegetation seven per cent of the basin is covered by mixed forest and a negligible fraction of 1 is covered by settlements herrnegger et al 2012 the hydrological regime is dominated by high altitudes characterised by low winter temperatures and in further consequence to snow accumulation and melt processes dominating runoff characteristics on a long term basis the highest discharge rates can be expected in may during snow melt and the lowest values in winter according to the hydrological atlas of austria bmlfuw 2007 the long term mean annual precipitation of the basin is 1508mm with a runoff of 1077mm resulting in an actual catchment evapotranspiration rate of 431mm table 1 2 2 meteorological data gridded precipitation and air temperature data from the inca integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis system haiden et al 2011 is used as input inca is the meteorological analysis and operational nowcasting application developed and run by the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics of austria zamg providing meteorological parameters at a high temporal 15 60min and spatial 1km2 resolution it is used for several flood forecasting systems in austria for the presented study only analysis fields but not nowcasting fields of precipitation and air temperature are used precipitation is thereby determined by combining rain gauge and radar data the method consists of a nonlinear spatial interpolation of rain gauge values in which the radar field is used as a spatial structure function the interpolation reproduces observed rain gauge values at station locations in addition topographic effects are accounted for in inca since an elevation correction is applied haiden and pistotnik 2009 for the inca precipitation data used in this study time series data from stations operated by zamg and marked as triangles in fig 1 are used the measurements are quality controlled but not corrected e g to account for wind induced undercatch from fig 1 it is evident that the station density is particularly low in the higher elevation areas this is especially the case along the main alpine ridge which builds the southern border of the study area only one single zamg station obertauern 1772ma s l is located in this area the nearest station from the zamg network to the west grossarltal is located on the valley floor on 882m a s l outside of the study area to the east in the direction of the main alpine ridge the nearest stations from the zamg network are rottenmann 707ma s l and kalwang 744ma s l the distance of these stations is approximately 70 and 90km from obertauern it is additionally known that the precipitation measurements in obertauern are significantly biased due to wind induced undercatch personal communication i kreutzwirth hydrological service of the province of salzburg it can be concluded that the information available on actual precipitation rates in the mountainous regions are rather limited the high elevation areas in the south of the study area where high precipitation amounts can be expected and which contribute significantly to runoff are however particularly relevant nagl 1974 for example shows for these parts of the catchment that the areas above 2000m a s l 38 of the total area contribute to over 54 of total precipitation station data from the station network operated by the hydrological services of austria is also available for the study area circles in fig 1 data from this network is only being used since recently for the inca analysis and is therefore not incorporated in the gridded data used in this study stations from this network are also mostly situated in lower lying valley floors apart from the inca air temperature data the high resolution 1km2 mean monthly temperatures from the ecsn hrt gar project hiebl et al 2009 are used as inputs for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall runoff model the simulations are performed with the conceptual rainfall runoff model cosero continuous semidistributed runoff model eder et al 2005 herrnegger et al 2012 2015 kling and nachtnebel 2009 kling et al 2015 among others which in its structure is similar to the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model bergström 1995 for this study the spatial discretization of the model is performed on a 1 1km2 grid with a total of 12 subbasins fig 1 as driving forces spatially distributed datasets of temperature and precipitation are used multiplicative monthly precipitation correction factors parameter pcor can be applied within the model for every modelling zone and allow the adjustment of this input term for the presented application potential evapotranspiration input is calculated according to the thornthwaite method thornthwaite and mather 1957 the hydrological model consists of different modules for calculating the processes of snow accumulation and melt frey and holzmann 2015 interception storage evolution of soil moisture actual evapotranspiration surface runoff interflow base flow and zone routing a detailed description of the model equations can be found in kling et al 2015 3 2 precipitation correction model nagl 1974 1973 extensively studied the hydrology including precipitation patterns of the study area from these studies it can be concluded that due to local meteorological conditions elevation dependency of precipitation differs for the elevation zones from i valley floors up to about 2000ma s l and ii 2000ma s l up to mountain peaks nagl 1974 fig 2 for the first lower elevation zone a less pronounced increase in precipitation with elevation was found in contrast above 2000ma s l a strong elevation dependency was observed in august 1969 a detailed precipitation measurement campaign was performed for the elevation zone 1500 2000 and above 2000ma s l precipitation sums of 244mm and 488mm were calculated highlighting the different meteorological conditions it can be expected that precipitation measurement errors and in consequence the gridded input data will show a different bias depending on winter october to march and summer april to september season with higher errors in winter due to the difficulties in measuring snow fall to account for the different precipitation gradients in the elevation zones as described in nagl 1974 and which are not evident in the inca data and the seasonal nature of errors the following stepwise linear correction model was implemented 1 pcor x s c 0 s c 1 s c 0 s δ elev 1 elev x for elev x 2000 m a s l 2 pcor x s c 1 s c 2 s c 1 s δ elev 2 elev x for elev x 2000 m a s l pcor x s multiplicative precipitation

time the period 01 09 2009 31 08 2012 3 hydrological years is used for validation of the model performance hydrological years are defined from september to august although station data are available for longer periods the simulation period is limited by the availability of the inca data longer time series would however help to support and underpin the findings the rainfall runoff model is run with hourly time steps runoff data are available for the overall period with the exception of subbasin 11 where data is missing for 8months in the year 2012 or about 7 percent in comparison to the overall simulation period a combination of numerical optimisation using the rosenbrock method rosenbrock 1960 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 as objective criteria and manual parameter calibration was used the combined approach was applied with the knowledge that the final model performance would probably not reach the level of an automatic calibration the calibrated rainfall runoff model is used in a flood forecasting system the inclusion of the manual calibration however allows the expert hydrologist performing the calibration to place special focus on periods or parts of the hydrograph which are crucial for flood forecasting systems e g flood peaks generally the calibration was performed for the individual subbasins with runoff observations allowing the consideration of local features in the subbasins the parameters of the precipitation correction model were manually estimated for the single catchments on the basis of i independent station observations mainly on valley floors not used in inca and ii a comparison of long term simulated and observed runoff values i e the long term water balance in total six values were estimated for every subbasin three pcor values are needed for the winter and summer season to define the linear correction model a pcor value is thereby estimated for i the lowest elevation i e c 0 s in eq 1 ii 2000ma s l i e c 1 s in eqs 1 and 2 and iii the highest elevation within a subbasin i e c 2 s in eq 2 in between these values the pcor values for every zone are calculated via the linear model depending on the elevation of the single zones the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias mean absolute and normalised peak error and mean peak timing error are used as objective criteria to

example the pcor values have a range of 0 95 1 5 for summer and 1 03 2 25 in winter at 2000m a s l where the discontinuity is visible pcor values of 1 1 and 1 4 were estimated for summer and winter the generally higher pcor values for the winter season are found due to larger measurement errors in winter precipitation the pcor values at the lowest elevation 2000ma s l and the highest elevation correspond to c 0 s c 1 s c 2 s in eqs 1 and 2 for the other subbasins similar correction models were set up the resulting distributed pcor values for the study area are shown in fig 3 with in general higher correction values in winter with an overall mean value of 1 18 compared to summer with a mean of 1 04 on an annual basis a mean pcor of 1 11 is calculated for the study area if precipitation in winter and summer season were the same the mean precipitation would therefore be increased by 11 in the lower lying valleys and parts of the study area pcor values of below 0 95 with a minimum value of 0 87 on the annual basis are found these correction factors c 0 s in eq 1 are where available based on the comparison of the independent station data and the inca grid values at the station locations here the station data mostly showed lower precipitation values compared to the inca data explaining the pcor values lower than 1 for the north south oriented tributary subbasins a gradual increase of pcor values with elevation is mostly visible the highest pcor value of 4 05 is found for winter in the highest model zones of subbasin 7 this is also the subbasin in which the station obertauern is located and which as described before shows severe deficits in the observed precipitation time series this explains the high pcor values since the deficits in the gridded data needed to be corrected mean pcor values of 1 54 winter 1 39 summer and 1 47 annual can be calculated for subbasin 7 fig 4 shows the mean annual precipitation sums for the calibration and validation period with left pcor 1 and without right pcor 1 the implemented pcor values for the case with pcor 1 the highest precipitation values are found in the northern part of subbasin 8 below the dachstein massif although precipitation increases with elevation also in the other subbasins the increase is not very pronounced especially in subbasin 7 the precipitation sums do not show a pronounced spatial variability since the area is strongly biased by the station obertauern similar results are found if calibration and validation period are analysed separately in contrast the corrected precipitation fields pcor 1 show a distinct elevation dependency with the highest precipitation values in the high elevation zones in consequence also the precipitation sums increase in the southern tributary basins for example a mean precipitation in subbasin 11 of about 1450mm is calculated with the original inca data this value increases to nearly 1840mm when pcor is applied in subbasin 7 the mean catchment precipitation increases from 1370 to 1990mm a precipitation in the study area is mostly determined by currents from the north west the tennengebirge 2430ma s l and the dachstein 2950ma s l however having some sheltering effects fig 1 the gap between these two massifs nevertheless allows moist air to reach parts of the study area unaffected also explaining the high precipitation amounts in subbasin 7 nagl 1974 4 2 rainfall runoff simulations the simulation performance of the rainfall runoff model mostly increases significantly when the precipitation correction factors pcor are applied this is the case when evaluating longer periods table 2 fig 5 but also for the simulation of flood peaks table 3 fig 6 this also applies for the independent validation period in subbasin 11 a period of 8months of the year 2012 was not evaluated due to missing runoff data the length of the data gap corresponds to about 7 percent of the overall simulation period the findings are although not completely comparable to the other subbasins nonetheless valid for this subbasin due to the relative short data gap table 2 summarizes for the single subbasins the model performance for calibration validation and overall period measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias with the exception of subbasin 12 in the calibration and overall period the nse values are higher for the case pcor 1 improvements are found for the southern tributary catchments which are significant for subbasin 7 10 and 11 in subbasin 7 for example in the validation period the nse with pcor 1 increases from 0 009 to over 0 72 with pcor 1 but also in the calibration and overall period the nse increases by 150 from 0 31 to 0 75 and 244 from 0 22 to 0 74 in this subbasin in subbasin 11 the nse improves by 19 44 and 22 depending on the evaluated calibration validation and overall period the percent bias with pcor 1 mostly shows an underestimation of observed runoff the largest underestimations are thereby found for subbasin 7 10 and 11 ranging from 39 to 9 depending on the evaluated period although underestimations are still calculated with pcor 1 in single subbasins and periods significant improvements are evident for the overall period for example in subbasin 7 the underestimation of 33 with pcor 1 changes into a nearly perfect balance between simulated and observed runoff with pcor 1 fig 5 shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias for the two cases with pcor 1 and pcor 1 for single hydrological years and all subbasins from the scatterplot in fig 5 left it is evident that also in the single hydrological years the nse is mostly higher for pcor 1 similar to results in table 2 some significant improvements are visible note that two points from subbasin 7 are not displayed in the plot since they showed negative nse values with pcor 1 but improved to nse values of 0 69 and 0 71 with pcor 1 the points showing the strongest deterioration of model performance due to pcor 1 originate from the hydrological year 2006 07 this period was comparatively dry also exhibiting less snow in winter and snow melt in spring the runoff simulations with pcor 1 already overestimated observed runoff in this period this deficit was amplified with pcor 1 explaining the results with exception of subbasin 4 and single periods a systematic underestimation of observed runoff pbias 0 is evident when uncorrected precipitation input is used fig 5 right although a large spread in the pbias values is also visible for the pcor 1 case the results show an improvement in the simulation of the observed runoff balance generally no systematic differences between calibration and validation are visible fig 6 shows a comparison of the 25 largest peak discharge events and associated peak simulations with pcor 1 orange and without pcor 1 black correction exemplarily for the subbasins 7 and 11 the systematic underestimation of peak discharges which is especially evident for subbasin 7 fig 6 left is significantly improved when the distributed precipitation correction is applied table 3 summarizes the performance of peak discharge simulations for the calibration and validation periods in the different subbasins and for both cases from the analysis of the 25 largest observed events it is evident that on average the simulations underestimate the peak discharge values especially for the pcor 1 case and subbasins 7 10 and 11 large deviations are found the precipitation correction leads to a noteworthy improvement of the mean peak error within these basins the precipitation correction does not significantly influence the mean peak timing error with the exception of subbasin 10 in the calibration period the positive values here indicate that the model on the average simulates peaks too late 5 discussion the presented method for correcting precipitation within the rainfall runoff model is based on the assumption that the long term water balance between precipitation actual evapotranspiration eta and runoff is simulated correctly it can be assumed that the observed runoff has the lowest measurement uncertainties in comparison to the other water balance components herrnegger et al 2015 the plausibility of the eta term of the water balance for which unfortunately no measurements exist in the area must therefore be examined the mean annual eta in the calibration period for the whole catchment is 422mm a for pcor 1 and 427mm a for pcor 1 a negligible difference of slightly over 1 in bmlfuw 2007 although for a different period 1960 1990 a similar eta value of 431mm a is published the difference in the mean annual precipitation sums between pcor 1 and pcor 1 for the catchment is about 90mm a in the calibration period to close the water balance with the uncorrected inca data the eta term would therefore have to be reduced by about 22 or to 330mm a this seems unrealistic also when considering that there are indications that the eta is larger in alpine areas when different potential evapotranspiration models are used as input herrnegger et al 2012 in this case the precipitation correction factors would even have to be higher compared to the values presented here although the results presented show significant improvements in the simulation performance the correction of precipitation within a hydrological model should be avoided if possible if deficits in the precipitation inputs are evident solutions e g adaption of the regionalisation process e g haiden and pistotnik 2009 or the blacklisting of single stations should be sought for beforehand using precipitation inputs of good quality not only facilitates the calibration of hydrological models but also gives more confidence in the results the close collaboration between meteorologist and hydrologist during the setup of different flood forecasting systems in austria stanzel et al 2008 must be mentioned as a good example the iterative process of adapting precipitation inputs is time consuming and expensive this being the reason why it was not applied in the context of the presented work additionally and probably the most important limiting factor is that the possibility to influence the generation of gridded precipitation input is frequently not there this is for example the case when using e obs data haylock et al 2008 continental to global precipitation data e g dee et al 2011 huffman et al 2007 maidment et al 2014 schamm et al 2014 or data from climate models as input into a hydrological model the bias correction of the gridded data teutschbein and seibert 2012 or precipitation correction within the rainfall runoff model therefore remain inevitable e g with the application of the presented method the pcor values and in consequence the precipitation sums partly show discontinuities between catchments boundaries although small scale variability could explain the results e g due to windward or leeward effects at mountain ridges the discontinuities are probably the results of the precipitation correction if lumped correction factors are used e g on the subbasin level the discontinuities would however be larger the correction is based on the assumption that the bias in the precipitation fields is systematic and stationary if the spatial structure of the bias of the precipitation fields change e g due to changing climatic conditions the step wise linear correction formulated in eqs 1 and 2 or the parameters including the threshold value of 2000m a s l found in the study may not be applicable additionally changes in the observation network may result in different errors due to the internal correction this has to be considered in the practical online application of the rainfall runoff model 6 summary and conclusions precipitation exhibits a large spatio temporal variability in alpine areas additionally the density of the monitoring network is low and measurements are subjected to major errors which may also differ depending on the precipitation form this can lead to significant deficits in stream flow simulations in the presented study a rainfall runoff model for a real time flood forecasting system was set up for the upper enns catchment in the north central austrian alps utilizing gridded 1 1km2 precipitation and temperature in a temporal resolution of 60 min as inputs to compensate for the spatially distributed errors in the precipitation input a multiplicative correction model was established the approach is thereby based on a piecewise linear model in which precipitation correction factors are calculated as a function of elevation due to local meteorological conditions the correction model is derived for two elevation zones additionally a seasonal dependency of the correction model was implemented since different errors are expected depending on whether we are dealing with a winter and summer season with higher errors in winter due to the difficulties in measuring snow fall the parameters of the precipitation correction model were manually adjusted for the single subbasins on the basis of i independent station observations not used in the gridded data and ii a comparison of long term simulated and observed runoff values i e the long term water balance additional complementary information from a study on the hydrology including precipitation patterns of the study area was utilized on an annual basis a mean precipitation correction factor pcor of 1 11 is calculated for the study area in the lower lying valleys and parts of the study area pcor values of below 0 95 with a minimum value of 0 87 on the annual basis are found the highest pcor values of 4 05 are found for winter in the highest model zones of a single subbasin the highest mean subbasin pcor values of 1 54 winter 1 39 summer and 1 47 annual are also calculated for this subbasin these high correction factors are explained by the necessity to compensate for deficits in the precipitation gauging network the station obertauern is located in this subbasin and shows severe deficits in the observed precipitation time series as a consequence of the presented findings the hydrological service of salzburg is assessing the benefit of the establishment of a new meteorological station on the main alpine ridge of the study area significant improvements in the runoff simulations could be achieved when comparing the simulations with corrected and uncorrected precipitation input not only in the long term water balance simulation and the overall model performance but also in the simulation of flood peaks for example the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the simulation of the overall period could be increased by a factor of 3 36 from 0 22 to 0 74 in an exemplary subbasin the improvements also manifested themselves in the independent validation period for example the largest mean normalised peak error of a subbasin in the validation period could be reduced from 39 8 to 3 no effects are found on the peak timing error it can be concluded that the presented correction model is a feasible approach to compensate errors of given gridded precipitation fields in which systematic errors e g the underestimation of elevation dependency exist in cases where the errors are a continuous function of elevation a simple linear regression model can be applied for areas where snow can be ignored the distinction between seasonal corrections may also not be necessary under consideration of these two cases the estimation of the linear model parameters is then based on two parameters namely the correction value at the lowest and highest elevation zones within a catchment acknowledgments this study was conducted in the framework of the project flood forecasting system upper enns and upper mur funded by the hydrographical service of the province of salzburg 
7597,in order to resolve contradictions in addressing a soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism over west africa and to clarify the impact of antecedent soil moisture on subsequent rainfall evolution we first validated various data sets smos satellite soil moisture observations noah land surface model trmm rainfall cmorph rainfall and hadgem climate models with the analyses multidisciplinaires de la mousson africaine amma field campaign data based on this analysis it was suggested that biases of data sets might cause contradictions in studying mechanisms thus by taking into account uncertainties in data it was found that the approach of consecutive dry days i e a relative comparison of time series showed consistency across various data sets while the direct comparison approach for soil moisture state and rainfall did not thus it was discussed that it may be difficult to directly relate rain with soil moisture as the absolute value however it may be reasonable to compare a temporal progress of the variables based upon the results consistently showing a positive relationship between the consecutive dry days and rainfall this study supports a negative feedback often neglected by climate model structure this approach is less sensitive to interpretation errors arising from systematic errors in data sets as this measures a temporal gradient of soil moisture state keywords soil moisture precipitation coupling consecutive dry days gldas smos soil moisture west africa amma field campaign 1 introduction the land surface plays an important role in the modulation of the macroscale monsoons koster et al 2004 xue et al 2004 a study on the understanding of land surface atmosphere feedbacks and the role of land surface in atmospheric predictability is in line with the global land atmosphere system study glass research program under global energy and water cycle experiment gewex which aims at improving the understanding of physical interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere along with east asia west africa is the very region that a large scale soil moisture distribution governs the monsoon circulation douville et al 2007 klüpfel et al 2011 taylor 2008 land surface precipitation interaction mechanisms are generally organized into three perspectives findell eltahir 2003 guillod et al 2015 i positive feedback wet soils are more likely to induce precipitation steiner et al 2009 stated that the west african monsoon wam system belongs to a positive feedback mechanism often called hot spot based upon their land climate model in this mechanism wet soils add more moisture to the near surface boundary layers increasing the moist entropy flux and the amount of convective available potential energy cape in a shallower planetary boundary layer pbl the latent heat enhanced by wet soils further develops rainfall through a meridional gradient of moist static energy mse and a local evaporation douville et al 2007 eltahir 1998 lee et al 2012 ii negative feedback dry soils are more likely to trigger precipitation taylor et al 2012 suggested that there is a negative spatial correlation in west africa between antecedent soil moisture and subsequent afternoon rainfall based upon satellite retrieved soil moisture and rainfall data koster et al 2003 they also argued that such a negative feedback was neglected by several climate models including hadgem and there is no obervational support for a positive feedback in that analytical frame it is considered that dry soils increases the sensible heat flux in the deeper planetary boundary layer further making air mass buoyant and increasing convection and the intensity and occurrence of rain events giorgi et al 1996 kohler et al 2010 suppiah and hennessy 1998 taylor 2008 xue et al 2004 iii transitional feedback precipitation is spatially located in drier soils although precipitation activity has temporally a positive correlation with soil moisture this perspective suggests that most of the hot spots lie in transition zones including west africa where evaporation is suitably high but still sensitive to soil moisture and the boundary layer moisture induces moist convection koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2006 indeed there are several arguments about the soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanisms e g which one of positive negative or transitional feedbacks is dominant over west africa this is unsettled mainly due to the disagreements between the satellite observation and climate model and uncertainty in data sets themselves in climate models the analysis is adversely influenced by the over simplification of convection parameterization scheme guillod et al 2015 taylor et al 2012 in addition the contribution of soil moisture to monsoons or vertical inhomogeneity is mostly neglected by models koster et al 2004 lee 2014 taylor 2008 on the other hand there are also the satellite retrieval errors associated with soil moisture and precipitation products koster et al 2003 lee 2016 jackson et al 2010 concluded that all the standard soil moisture products from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa land parameter retrieval model lprm and japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa retrieval algorithms contain large errors and biases none of them provides reliable soil moisture estimates satisfying all the conditions west africa is not an exception gruhier et al 2010 and dente et al 2012 also reported on high errors in soil moisture products especially over dry conditions such as west africa with respect to precipitation satellite errors huffman et al 2007 previously informed that tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 retrieval algorithm may produce substantial systematic errors due to a weak physical relationship between infrared brightness temperature and precipitation under certain conditions chen et al 2013a 2013b junzhi et al 2012 müller and thompson 2013 due to data vulnerability to systematic errors the fragmented opinions on the land surface precipitation coupling mechanisms are unavoidable in order to resolve such a contradiction about a feedback mechanism over west africa we employed the global land data assimilation system gldas data reconciling the model estimates with the observations zhang et al 2008 in addition the new observational dataset from the smos satellite designed for retrieving soil moisture for the first time ever in history was used kerr et al 2012 this data set is known to be relatively reliable over west africa owing to the improvement of retrieval algorithms over dry and sandy soils lee et al 2015 additionally we also validated various data sets before employing them for the assessment of soil moisture and rainfall interactions the analyses multidisciplinaires de la mousson africaine amma couplage de l atmosphère tropicale et du cycle hydrologique catch field campaign data was employed for this purpose amma catch has been previously established for global telecommunication system since 2006 this is a long term observation system installed at west african regions where operational networks were failing cappelaere et al 2009 lebel et al 2011 several instruments were deployed to monitor ocean hydrology aerosols and vegetation as well as atmosphere dynamics in specific the up scaled data from the rain gauge network and soil moisture measurements was used in this study the objective of this study is to assess various data sets for the soil moisture and rainfall estimates to clarify the influence of soil moisture on subsequent evolution of rainfall in west africa and to resolve the contradictions that exist in addressing that feedback the finding of this study is useful for improving the predictability of precipitation for identifying the process currently neglected by climate models as well as for establishing the climate indicator in the intergovernmental panel on climate change

saharan area between 6 5 14 5 n and 8 5 w 9 e usually there is a meridional moisture gradient between the dry sahel and vegetated guinea coast region there is a latitudinal gradient in terms of vegetation as well as soil texture the amma field campaign system is well established in this region for validating the model simulations and satellite observations these include rain gauge and soil

smos mission was launched in november 2009 it carries a microwave radiometry at l band 1 4ghz 21cm with a higher sensitivity to soil moisture than other higher frequency radiometers optical sensors

retrieval algorithm is based upon a cost minimization that diminishes a mismatch between brightness temperature measurement and simulation a detailed theoretical description of radiative transfer model and retrieval algorithm was provided by kerr et al 2013 a new feature of this version is that a mironov s formulation was employed for the calculation of dielectric constant in dry and sandy soils suggesting a better performance for west africa lee et al 2015 lee and im 2015 a mironov s formulation suggests a soil dielectric model specific to the frequency of 1 4ghz as functions of temperature and soil texture while it was known that the previous model formulated as a hyperbolic function of soil moisture does not represent dry and sandy soils very well mironov et al 2013

in situ measurements dorigo et al 2012 the observation based precipitation and downward radiation products and the atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed to force the models chen et al 2013a 2013b all the data above are disaggregated to 0 11 2 5 consecutive dry days a spatial correlation between antecedent soil moisture and subsequent precipitation was used to assess the impact of soil moisture on rainfall two experimental set ups were compared to each other one scheme defines the event as the rain at any time when the magnitude exceeds 10mm per 3h at the event time but does not exceed 3mm per 3h at the antecedent time of the event in the rain events consecutive dry days are tracked backwards and counted based upon the sign of ds ds soil moisture at time t 1 soil moisture at time t where t is the rain event time if ds is greater than zero then dry day gets started it is continued to count the number of days until the sign of ds become negative the theoretical rationale for this approach is that the sensible heat under dry conditions is gradually developed to trigger rainfall giorgi et al 1996 xue et al 2004 after the summation of several incidences of consecutive dry days the total number of consecutive dry days accumulated on a given pixel during the experiment period is spatially correlated with time averaged rain event to illustrate each variable used for the calculation of a spatial correlation antecedent soil moisture is indicated by s and consecutive dry days are indicated by a solid line in fig 2 it is also observed that several precipitation events occurred in the morning time e g on 125 5day 127 3day 132 3day and are preceded by low soil moisture contents the other scheme repeats the same analysis only for afternoon rainfall rationale of this approach is that convection sensitivity to land surface is maximized during the afternoon time taylor et al 2012 to be more specific the antecedent soil moisture data was provided at 6z while the rain accumulation between 12 and 21z is referred to as afternoon rain where z is zulu time 3 results 3 1 validation of surface soil moisture with amma field campaign data different surface soil moisture estimates from various sources were compared with amma field campaign data table 1 shows the time average error statistics of soil moisture data sets each data set is divided into two groups before and after the wam onset to show the effects of rain on systematic errors the wam onset was the 24th of june refer to flaounas et al 2011 accordingly the data indicated by pre onset in table 1 averages the data from the 1st of april to the wam onset while the data indicated by post onset integrates the data from the next day of wam onset till the end of september in 2010 sahel site indicates the location at 13 6 n and 2 6 e in the niger while guinea site is at 9 70 n and 1 68 w in the benin the rmses in table 1 show that gldas data set is the best estimate for guinea moderately wet and vegetated site with precipitation while the smos data set was better for sahel dry and sandy soils with no vegetation this is considered because the smos data sets has recently improved the retrieval algorithm over dry and sandy soils kerr et al 2013 mironov et al 2013 wigneron et al 2011 this tendency became clearer when it comes to correlation index the correlation of smos data set was the best in all conditions with an exception of guinea during pre onset in which the gldas was the best in sahel fig 3 a the smos data set was the best matched with the field measurements while there were significant overestimations by gldas and hadgem model in guinea fig 3 b the gldas data set was the best matched with the field measurements while there were significant overestimations by smos observation and hadgem model from this result it was shown that in the case of soil moisture estimation there is no single best data set to rely on as the model and satellite observation datasets all exhibit various errors in specific the smos data set showed the best correlation in all conditions except rainfall and vegetation conditions the gldas data set showed the best rmse in all conditions but except dry and sandy soil conditions at sahel the poor performance in specific soil condition is likely due to uncertainty associated with soil texture soil organic matter vegetation effect and vertical inhomogeneity in soil properties which are oversimplified by the noah land surface model chen et al 2013a 2013b lee 2014 lee et al 2014 3 2 validation of rainfall with amma field campaign data table 2 demonstrates the error statistics of rainfall satellite observations such as cmorph and trmm as well as the model estimates such as hadgem climate model and gldas noah land surface model it was evident that the gldas data set is the best estimate in both sites dillon et al 2016 the rmses of table 2 shows that the gldas data has the lowest rmses in all conditions with an exception of the post onset at sahel for which the trmm observations have the lowest rmse this might be because the noah model poorly performs in dry and sandy soil conditions lee et al 2014 it is also recognized that the correlation of gldas data shows the highest values in all conditions regardless of rainfall and vegetation as well as soil texture on the other hand as shown in fig 4 other data sets suggested large errors the trmm observations significantly overestimated the rain at sahel in dry and sandy soils no vegetation no rain during pre onset while there were another overestimations in the cmorph observations and hadgem model thus it was suggested that the gldas data is the most appropriate data set for investigating a feedback mechanism in west africa and it is fair to dismiss the hadgem model as it is severely biased showing high rmses and low correlations in table 2 3 3 spatial correlation between antecedent soil moisture and subsequent rainfall before looking at a spatial correlation it was attempted to validate the mechanisms at a local scale based upon soil moisture measurements in the field the occurence of consecutive dry days is demonstrated in fig 5 for sahel in dry soils and benin in wet soils respectively it was shown that the occurrence and the number of consecutive dry days in guinea was higher than those of sahel as the total rain accumulation during the experimental period in guinea was higher at 1384mm than that in sahel at 365mm it was well found that 89 189 of rain events at guinea occurred under consecutive dry day conditions ds 0 while 77 777 of rain events was so at sahel to examine the impact of antecedent soil moisture on subsequent rainfall two different approaches for indicating antecedent soil moisture were illustrated in figs 6 8 where antecendent soil moisture as a single state is the time average of the single soil moisture product right before the rain event as shown by s in fig 2 and consecutive dry days indicates the accumulation and tendency of consecutively decreasing soil moisture through several data right before the rain event as shown by ds in section 2 5 from those it was found that the correlations by antecedent soil moisture state were divergent by a selection of the data sets to be more specific a spatial distribution of smos antecedent soil moisture in fig 6 a showed wet soils while the gldas antecedent soil moisture in fig 7 a was mainly concentrated on the sahel region on the north and generally drier e g the lowest mean value of 0 1936m3 m3 in table 3 in other regions than the smos antecedent soil moisture furthermore the hadgem antecedent soil moisture in fig 8 a are mainly concentrated on guinea on the south contrary to the gldas and smos antecedent soil moisture in short due to uncertainties in each data set three data sets smos gldas and hadgem models were all contradictory to each other giving conflicting indications of correlations with rainfall unlike the single state of antecedent soil moisture the consecutive dry days showed a consistent spatial distribution with rainfall occurence in detail the consecutive dry days were all commonly high in sahel regions on the north 12 n to 13 5 n bands across the data sets see b of figs 6 8 these match the spatial patterns of rainfall occurrence as shown in c of figs 6 8 the intensity of rainfall was high in sahel region on the northern parts commonly in both gldas and hadgem modelled rainfall this is considered because the inter tropical convergence zone itcz moved northwards during wam when the most rain was produced additionally there was the other development of rainfall commonly around at 7 n in b of figs 6 8 this is attributed to the development of convection along the guinean coast area during pre onset period of monsoon an accumulation of consecutive dry days was well matched with those rain spots more detailed description of precipitation developments over this region is previously described by flaounas et al 2011 to better relate antecedent soil moisture with subsequent rainfall a pixel to pixel correlation was provided by d of figs 6 8 it is shown in fig 6 d that the gldas rainfall has no spatial correlation with smos antecedent soil moisture quantitatively 0 02 as shown in table 3 but have a positive spatial correlation with smos consecutive dry days quantitatively 0 52 as shown in table 3 it is also shown in fig 7 d that the correlation of gldas antecedent soil moisture quantitatively 0 49 as shown in table 3 showed a contradiction with that of the smos antecedent soil moisture data but the gldas consecutive dry days showed the same positive spatial correlation quantitatively 0 55 as shown in table 3 the hadgem antecedent soil moisture in fig 8 d showed no clear relationship with hadgem rainfall quantitatively a value of 0 2 in table 3 suggests no clear correlation considering the model errors at tables 1 and 2 this is consistent with taylor et al 2012 who discussed that hadgem model does not simulate soil moisture very well on the contrary to the antecedent soil moisture as a single state table 3 more clearly demonstrates that a spatial correlation between rain events and consecutive dry days was commonly positive at above 0 5 across the data sets thus it was suggested that several disagreements on a relationship between soil moisture and rainfall may largely arise from uncertainty in data as the single state and a negative feedback can be found if considering the temporal evolution of soil moisture data within the same data set rather than directly comparing the data set with other variables as an absolute value the convection triggering the negative soil moisture precipitation feedback found by this study can be supported by previous studies who illustrated that an increase in sensible heat or a decrease in latent heat under dry conditions increases the buoyancy forces during the night time or in the morning and pbl thickness during the day time resulting in the development of convective precipitation giorgi et al 2009 ma et al 2009 katul et al 2012 kohler et al 2010 in addition with respect to the approach of consecutive dry days it was previously discussed why it is more reasonable to read the relative trends of soil moisture products rather than a single state as an absolute value wagner 1998 stated that a quantitative comparison between the satellite retrieved soil moisture observations and rainfall is unlikely to be feasible as the satellite retrieval algorithm accounts for the heterogeneity of land cover and seasonal vegetation dynamics as well as roughness this allows only a qualitative comparison with other variables this is well applicable to this study regardless of whether the sensor is active or passive microwave smos soil moisture or trmm rainfall observations also need a re scaling or pre processing for their errors shown in tables 1 and 2 for example correlations of smos soil moisture were very good at table 1 rather than rmses that is because the retrievals use the complicated and non linear relationship between brightness temperature or thermal infrared data and the state to be estimated in addition to satellite observations models also contain errors in parameterization or moisture scheme in this context insufficient evidence exists to conclude a negative or positive relationship solely by direct comparison quantitatively with other variables owing to the uncertainties shown in tables 1 and 2 to further characterize the feedback mechanism the same comparison has been carried out over the afternoon rain only based upon the assumption that the interaction between land surface and atmosphere is maximized during the day time guillod et al 2015 however it was failed to reach the common conclusions across the data sets in that way that is considered because this afternoon rainfall scheme may underestimate the contribution from buoyancy forces dominant in the late morning around noon and overestimate a change in temperature or heat flux during the day time katul et al 2012 in fact this factor of buoyancy forces also significantly alters the pressure gradient induced atmospheric circulation thus when limiting the rain events to afternoon only a correlation of consecutive dry days was not very clear in all the data sets ranging from 0 02 to 0 24 in table s1 in addition a correlation of the antecedent soil moisture as a single state also showed a large disgreement ranging from 0 38 hadgem to 0 38 gldas this is considered because the convective precipitation processed by models is constructed to be over sensitive to the day time increase of heat fluxes or because model errors arise from the simplified convective parameterization schemes taylor et al 2012 4 conclusions we shed light on the unresolved issues for the land surface atmosphere interactions over west africa in order to settle contradictions that exist about that feedback mechanism we assessed various data sets with amma field campaign data validation showed that there is no single best data set to rely on for soil moisture although the gldas noah land surface model appears the best data set for rainfall across the land surface conditions with respect to soil moisture data sets the gldas noah data set was the best for vegetated and moderately wet soils in guinea while the smos soil moisture was appropriate for monitoring dry and sandy soils in sahel based upon these data sets selected results showed that the consecutive dry days commonly showed the same positive correlation with rainfall across the data sets it is considered because the concept of consecutive dry days estimated by a temporal gradient of soil moisture state is capable of indicating that the sensible heat is sufficiently developed to increase not only the pbl thickness in day time but also buoyancy forces in night time therefore this study supports a negative feedback which is known as being neglected by current model frame this approach is less vulnerable to systematic errors in data sets as this only considers a soil moisture gradient relative to the antecedent estimates in contrast a direct comparison between antecedent soil moisture state and subsequent rainfall evolution appears infeasible exhibiting conflicting relationships due to systematic errors and

interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere along with east asia west africa is the very region that a large scale soil moisture distribution governs the monsoon circulation douville et al 2007 klüpfel et al 2011 taylor 2008 land surface precipitation interaction mechanisms are generally organized into three perspectives findell eltahir 2003 guillod et al 2015 i positive feedback wet soils are more likely to induce precipitation steiner et al 2009 stated that the west african monsoon wam system belongs to a positive feedback mechanism often called hot spot based upon their land climate model in this mechanism wet soils add more moisture to the near surface boundary layers increasing the moist entropy flux and the amount of convective available potential energy cape in a shallower planetary boundary layer pbl the latent heat enhanced by wet soils further develops rainfall through a meridional gradient of moist static energy mse and a local evaporation douville et al 2007 eltahir 1998 lee et al 2012 ii negative feedback dry soils are more likely to trigger precipitation taylor et al 2012 suggested that there is a negative spatial correlation in west africa between antecedent soil moisture and subsequent afternoon rainfall based upon satellite retrieved soil moisture and rainfall data koster et al 2003 they also argued that such a negative feedback was neglected by several climate models including hadgem and there is no obervational support for a positive feedback in that analytical frame it is considered that dry soils increases the sensible heat flux in the deeper planetary boundary layer further making air mass buoyant and increasing convection and the intensity and occurrence of rain events giorgi et al 1996 kohler et al 2010 suppiah and hennessy 1998 taylor 2008 xue et al 2004 iii transitional feedback precipitation is spatially located in drier soils although precipitation activity has temporally a positive correlation with soil moisture this perspective suggests that most of the hot spots lie in transition zones including west africa where evaporation is suitably high but still sensitive to soil moisture and the boundary layer moisture induces moist convection koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2006 indeed there are several arguments about the soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanisms e g which one of positive negative or transitional feedbacks is dominant over west africa this is unsettled mainly due to the disagreements between the satellite observation and climate model and uncertainty in data sets themselves in climate models the analysis is adversely influenced by the over simplification of convection parameterization scheme guillod et al 2015 taylor et al 2012 in addition the contribution of soil moisture to monsoons or vertical inhomogeneity is mostly neglected by models koster et al 2004 lee 2014 taylor 2008 on the other hand there are also the satellite retrieval errors associated with soil moisture and precipitation products koster et al 2003 lee 2016 jackson et al 2010 concluded that all the standard soil moisture products from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa land parameter retrieval model lprm and japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa retrieval algorithms contain large errors and biases none of them provides reliable soil moisture estimates satisfying all the conditions west africa is not an exception gruhier et al 2010 and dente et al 2012 also reported on high errors in soil moisture products especially over dry conditions such as west africa with respect to precipitation satellite errors huffman et al 2007 previously informed that tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 retrieval algorithm may produce substantial systematic errors due to a weak physical relationship between infrared brightness temperature and precipitation under certain conditions chen et al 2013a 2013b junzhi et al 2012 müller and thompson 2013 due to data vulnerability to systematic errors the fragmented opinions on the land surface precipitation coupling mechanisms are unavoidable in order to resolve such a contradiction about a feedback mechanism over west africa we employed the global land data assimilation system gldas data reconciling the model estimates with the observations zhang et al 2008 in addition the new observational dataset from the smos satellite designed for retrieving soil moisture for the first time ever in history was used kerr et al 2012 this data set is known to be relatively reliable over west africa owing to the improvement of retrieval algorithms over dry and sandy soils lee et al 2015 additionally we also validated various data sets before employing them for the assessment of soil moisture and rainfall interactions the analyses multidisciplinaires de la mousson africaine amma couplage de l atmosphère tropicale et du cycle hydrologique catch field campaign data was employed for this purpose amma catch has been previously established for global telecommunication system since 2006 this is a long term observation system installed at west african regions where operational networks were failing cappelaere et al 2009 lebel et al 2011 several instruments were deployed to monitor ocean hydrology aerosols and vegetation as well as atmosphere dynamics in specific the up scaled data from the rain gauge network and soil moisture measurements was used in this study the objective of this study is to assess various data sets for the soil moisture and rainfall estimates to clarify the influence of soil moisture on subsequent evolution of rainfall in west africa and to resolve the contradictions that exist in addressing that feedback the finding of this study is useful for improving the predictability of precipitation for identifying the process currently neglected by climate models as well as for establishing the climate indicator in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar4 model ensemble research frich et al 2002 tebaldi et al 2006 for projecting the extreme conditions this paper is organized as follows in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the soil moisture estimates from smos gldas and climate model and the rainfall estimates from trmm climate prediction center morphing method cmorph gldas and climate model are validated with field measurements respectively in section 3 3 a spatial correlation with total rainfall is assessed with respect to antecedent soil moisture and consecutive dry days in section 3 3 the same experiment is repeated for afternoon rain only 2 method 2 1 study domain and amma field campaign the study area is illustrated in fig 1 the red line delineates the boundary conditions and blue line denotes the actual study domain that covers the sub saharan area between 6 5 14 5 n and 8 5 w 9 e usually there is a meridional moisture gradient between the dry sahel and vegetated guinea coast region there is a latitudinal gradient in terms of vegetation as well as soil texture the amma field campaign system is well established in this region for validating the model simulations and satellite observations these include rain gauge and soil moisture measurements in niger 50km east of niamey and benin djougou region these two local point sites are indicated in red 1 for interpretation of color in fig 1 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 in fig 1 6 and 8 soil moisture probes are deployed at a depth of 0 05m for the top layer and 1m for the root zone layer in niger and benin sites respectively these measurements are spatially averaged in order to make them representative of satellite data on the 0 25 0 25 pixel for the detailed soil moisture measurement distributions of each super site please see www amma catch org detailed descriptions of the amma field network is found in cappelaere et al 2009 for niger and séguis et al 2011 for benin niger is in sandy and dry bare soils while benin is in moderately wet and sparsely vegetated site with less sand but higher clay factions soil property varies with soil texture conditions as previously discussed by lee et al 2014 2 2 satellite observations for the rainfall observations the trmm 3b42 data 3 hourly 0 25 ver 7 achieved from nasa disc sci gsfc nasa gov trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis were used thierry et al 2013 huffman et al 2007 the other rainfall data set was the cmorph version 1 0 3 hourly 0 25 this product that combines the passive microwave data with thermal infrared data uses the motion vectors derived from half hourly interval geostationary satellite ir imagery to complement the precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data joyce et al 2004 it is also morphed between microwave sensor scanning time by a linear interpolation taylor et al 2012 for the soil moisture observations one day ascending smos surface soil moisture data was directly achieved from catds http www catds fr the smos mission was launched in november 2009 it carries a microwave radiometry at l band 1 4ghz 21cm with a higher sensitivity to soil moisture than other higher frequency radiometers optical sensors and ascat or amrs e microwave remote sensors at c band not penetrating dense vegetation kerr et al 2012 the smos l3 product ver 2 72 1day 25km is a global composite of a swath product the fundamental retrieval algorithm is based upon a cost minimization that diminishes a mismatch between brightness temperature measurement and simulation a detailed theoretical description of radiative transfer model and retrieval algorithm was provided by kerr et al 2013 a new feature of this version is that a mironov s formulation was employed for the calculation of dielectric constant in dry and sandy soils suggesting a better performance for west africa lee et al 2015 lee and im 2015 a mironov s formulation suggests a soil dielectric model specific to the frequency of 1 4ghz as functions of temperature and soil texture while it was known that the previous model formulated as a hyperbolic function of soil moisture does not represent dry and sandy soils very well mironov et al 2013 wigneron et al 2011 2 3 climate model in this study we employed the hadgem3 ra a limited area model of the third global atmosphere ga3 configuration of the met office unified model metum a merged weather and climate prediction system moufouma okia and jones 2014 walters et al 2011 it is a regional climate model rcm with a fully elastic and non hydrostatic dynamical core employing a semi

environment simulator jules best et al 2011 which has 4 soil layers 0 1 0 25 0 65 2m the hadgem3 model was integrated continuously from 1 december 2008 to september 2010 with a horizontal grid resolution of 0 11 0 11 the 6 hourly atmospheric conditions from the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf reanalysis dataset era interim dee et al 2011 were used to drive the

assimilation system gldas 3 hourly time step 0 25 degree resolution rodell et al 2004 were also used to assess the land atmosphere coupling in west africa the gldas noah data set is the product based upon the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noah land surface model the top surface layer of gldas noah soil moisture data is provided at 0 1m and is known to be in good agreement with in situ measurements dorigo et al 2012 the observation based precipitation and downward radiation products and the atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed to force the models chen et al 2013a 2013b all the data above are disaggregated to 0 11 2 5 consecutive dry days a spatial correlation between antecedent soil moisture and subsequent precipitation was used to assess the impact of soil moisture on rainfall two experimental set ups were compared to each other one scheme defines the event as the rain at any time when the magnitude exceeds 10mm per 3h at the event time but does not exceed 3mm per 3h at the antecedent time of the event in the rain events consecutive dry days are tracked backwards and counted based upon the sign of ds ds soil moisture at time t 1 soil moisture at time t where t is the rain event time if ds is greater than zero then dry day gets started it is continued to count the number of days until the sign of ds become negative the theoretical rationale for this approach is that the sensible heat under dry conditions is gradually developed to trigger rainfall giorgi et al 1996 xue et al 2004 after the summation of several incidences of consecutive dry days the total number of consecutive dry days accumulated on a given pixel during the experiment period is spatially correlated with time averaged rain event to illustrate each variable used for the calculation of a spatial correlation antecedent soil moisture is indicated by s and consecutive dry days are indicated by a solid line in fig 2 it is also observed that several precipitation events occurred in the morning time e g on 125 5day 127 3day 132 3day and are preceded by low soil moisture contents the other scheme repeats the same analysis only for afternoon rainfall rationale of this approach is that convection sensitivity to land surface is maximized during the afternoon time taylor et al 2012 to be more specific the antecedent soil moisture data was provided at 6z while the rain accumulation between 12 and 21z is referred to as afternoon rain where z is zulu time 3 results 3 1 validation of surface soil moisture with amma field campaign data different surface soil moisture estimates from various sources were compared with amma field campaign data table 1 shows the time average error statistics of soil moisture data sets each data set is divided into two groups before and after the wam onset to show the effects of rain on systematic errors the wam onset was the 24th of june refer to flaounas et al 2011 accordingly the data indicated by pre onset in table 1 averages the data from the 1st of april to the wam onset while the data indicated by post onset integrates the data from the next day of wam onset till the end of september in 2010 sahel site indicates the location at 13 6 n and 2 6 e in the niger while guinea site is at 9 70 n and 1 68 w in the benin the rmses in table 1 show that gldas data set is the best estimate for guinea moderately wet and vegetated site with precipitation while the smos data set was better for sahel dry and sandy soils with no vegetation this is considered because the smos data sets has recently improved the retrieval algorithm over dry and sandy soils kerr et al 2013 mironov et al 2013 wigneron et al 2011 this tendency became clearer when it comes to correlation index the correlation of smos data set was the best in all conditions with an exception of guinea during pre onset in which the gldas was the best in sahel fig 3 a the smos data set was the best matched with the field measurements while there were significant overestimations by gldas and hadgem model in guinea fig 3 b the gldas data set was the best matched with the field measurements while there were significant overestimations by smos observation and hadgem model from this result it was shown that in the case of soil moisture estimation there is no single best data set to rely on as the model and satellite observation datasets all exhibit various errors in specific the smos data set showed the best correlation in all conditions except rainfall and vegetation conditions the gldas data set showed the best rmse in all conditions but except dry and sandy soil conditions at sahel the poor performance in specific soil condition is likely due to uncertainty associated with soil texture soil organic matter vegetation effect and vertical inhomogeneity in soil properties which are oversimplified by the noah land surface model chen et al 2013a 2013b lee 2014 lee et al 2014 3 2 validation of rainfall with amma field campaign data table 2 demonstrates the error statistics of rainfall satellite observations such as cmorph and trmm as well as the model estimates such as hadgem climate model and gldas noah land surface model it was evident that the gldas data set is the best estimate in both sites dillon et al 2016 the rmses of table 2 shows that the gldas data has the lowest rmses in all conditions with an exception of the post onset at sahel for which the trmm observations have the lowest rmse this might be because the noah model poorly performs in dry and sandy soil conditions lee et al 2014 it is also recognized that the correlation of gldas data shows the highest values in all conditions regardless of rainfall and vegetation as well as soil texture on the other hand as shown in fig 4 other data sets suggested large errors the trmm observations significantly overestimated the rain at sahel in dry and sandy soils no vegetation no rain during pre onset while there were another overestimations in the cmorph observations and hadgem model thus it was suggested that the gldas data is the most appropriate data set for investigating a feedback mechanism in west africa and it is fair to dismiss the hadgem model as it is severely biased showing high rmses and low correlations in table 2 3 3 spatial correlation between antecedent soil moisture and subsequent rainfall before looking at a spatial correlation it was attempted to validate the mechanisms at a local scale based upon soil moisture measurements in the field the occurence of consecutive dry days is demonstrated in fig 5 for sahel in dry soils and benin in wet soils respectively it was shown that the occurrence and the number of consecutive dry days in guinea was higher than those of sahel as the total rain accumulation during the experimental period in guinea was higher at 1384mm than that in sahel at 365mm it was well found that 89 189 of rain events at guinea occurred under consecutive dry day conditions ds 0 while 77 777 of rain events was so at sahel to examine the impact of antecedent soil moisture on subsequent rainfall two different approaches for indicating antecedent soil moisture were illustrated in figs 6 8 where antecendent soil moisture as a single state is the time average of the single soil moisture product right before the rain event as shown by s in fig 2 and consecutive dry days indicates the accumulation and tendency of consecutively decreasing soil moisture through several data right before the rain event as shown by ds in section 2 5 from those it was found that the correlations by antecedent soil moisture state were divergent by a selection of the data sets to be more specific a spatial distribution of smos antecedent soil moisture in fig 6 a showed wet soils while the gldas antecedent soil moisture in fig 7 a was mainly concentrated on the sahel region on the north and generally drier e g the lowest mean value of 0 1936m3 m3 in table 3 in other regions than the smos antecedent soil moisture furthermore the hadgem antecedent soil moisture in fig 8 a are mainly concentrated on guinea on the south contrary to the gldas and smos antecedent soil moisture in short due to uncertainties in each data set three data sets smos gldas and hadgem models were all contradictory to each other giving conflicting indications of correlations with rainfall unlike the single state of antecedent soil moisture the consecutive dry days showed a consistent spatial distribution with rainfall occurence in detail the consecutive dry days were all commonly high in sahel regions on the north 12 n to 13 5 n bands across the data sets see b of figs 6 8 these match the spatial patterns of rainfall occurrence as shown in c of figs 6 8 the intensity of rainfall was high in sahel region on the northern parts commonly in both gldas and hadgem modelled rainfall this is considered because the inter tropical convergence zone itcz moved northwards during wam when the most rain was produced additionally there was the other development of rainfall commonly around at 7 n in b of figs 6 8 this is attributed to the development of convection along the guinean coast area during pre onset period of monsoon an accumulation of consecutive dry days was well matched with those rain spots more detailed description of precipitation developments over this region is previously described by flaounas et al 2011 to better relate antecedent soil moisture with subsequent rainfall a pixel to pixel correlation was provided by d of figs 6 8 it is shown in fig 6 d that the gldas rainfall has no spatial correlation with smos antecedent soil moisture quantitatively 0 02 as shown in table 3 but have a positive spatial correlation with smos consecutive dry days quantitatively 0 52 as shown in table 3 it is also shown in fig 7 d that the correlation of gldas antecedent soil moisture quantitatively 0 49 as shown in table 3 showed a contradiction with that of the smos antecedent soil moisture data but the gldas consecutive dry days showed the same positive spatial correlation quantitatively 0 55 as shown in table 3 the hadgem antecedent soil moisture in fig 8 d showed no clear relationship with hadgem rainfall quantitatively a value of 0 2 in table 3 suggests no clear correlation considering the model errors at tables 1 and 2 this is consistent with taylor et al 2012 who discussed that hadgem model does not simulate soil moisture very well on the contrary to the antecedent soil moisture as a single state table 3 more clearly demonstrates that a spatial correlation between rain events and consecutive dry days was commonly positive at above 0 5 across the data sets thus it was suggested that several disagreements on a relationship between soil moisture and rainfall may largely arise from uncertainty in data as the single state and a negative feedback can be found if considering the temporal evolution of soil moisture data within the same data set rather than directly comparing the data set with other variables as an absolute value the convection triggering the negative soil moisture precipitation feedback found by this study can be supported by previous studies who illustrated that an increase in sensible heat or a decrease in latent heat under dry conditions increases the buoyancy forces during the night time or in the morning and pbl thickness during the day time resulting in the development of convective precipitation giorgi et al 2009 ma et al 2009 katul et al 2012 kohler et al 2010 in addition with respect to the approach of consecutive dry days it was previously discussed why it is more reasonable to read the relative trends of soil moisture products rather than a single state as an absolute value wagner 1998 stated that a quantitative comparison between the satellite retrieved soil moisture observations and rainfall is unlikely to be feasible as the satellite retrieval algorithm accounts for the heterogeneity of land cover and seasonal vegetation dynamics as well as roughness this allows only a qualitative comparison with other variables this is well applicable to this study regardless of whether the sensor is active or passive microwave smos soil moisture or trmm rainfall observations also need a re scaling or pre processing for their errors shown in tables 1 and 2 for example correlations of smos soil moisture were very good at table 1 rather than rmses that is because the retrievals use the complicated and non linear relationship between brightness temperature or thermal infrared data and the state to be estimated in addition to satellite observations models also contain errors in parameterization or moisture scheme in this context insufficient evidence exists to conclude a negative or positive relationship solely by direct comparison quantitatively with other variables owing to the uncertainties shown in tables 1 and 2 to further characterize the feedback mechanism the same comparison has been carried out over the afternoon rain only based upon the assumption that the interaction between land surface and atmosphere is maximized during the day time guillod et al 2015 however it was failed to reach the common conclusions across the data sets in that way that is considered because this afternoon rainfall scheme may underestimate the contribution from buoyancy forces dominant in the late morning around noon and overestimate a change in temperature or heat flux during the day time katul et al 2012 in fact this factor of buoyancy forces also significantly alters the pressure gradient induced atmospheric circulation thus when limiting the rain events to afternoon only a correlation of consecutive dry days was not very clear in all the data sets ranging from 0 02 to 0 24 in table s1 in addition a correlation of the antecedent soil moisture as a single state also showed a large disgreement ranging from 0 38 hadgem to 0 38 gldas this is considered because the convective precipitation processed by models is constructed to be over sensitive to the day time increase of heat fluxes or because model errors arise from the simplified convective parameterization schemes taylor et al 2012 4 conclusions we shed light on the unresolved issues for the land surface atmosphere interactions over west africa in order to settle contradictions that exist about that feedback mechanism we assessed various data sets with amma field campaign data validation showed that there is no single best data set to rely on for soil moisture although the gldas noah land surface model appears the best data set for rainfall across the land surface conditions with respect to soil moisture data sets the gldas noah data set was the best for vegetated and moderately wet soils in guinea while the smos soil moisture was appropriate for monitoring dry and sandy soils in sahel based upon these data sets selected results showed that the consecutive dry days commonly showed the same positive correlation with rainfall across the data sets it is considered because the concept of consecutive dry days estimated by a temporal gradient of soil moisture state is capable of indicating that the sensible heat is sufficiently developed to increase not only the pbl thickness in day time but also buoyancy forces in night time therefore this study supports a negative feedback which is known as being neglected by current model frame this approach is less vulnerable to systematic errors in data sets as this only considers a soil moisture gradient relative to the antecedent estimates in contrast a direct comparison between antecedent soil moisture state and subsequent rainfall evolution appears infeasible exhibiting conflicting relationships due to systematic errors and

7598,we present an approach for evaluating catchment scale hydro meteorological impacts of projected climate change based on the atmospheric circulation patterns acps of a region our approach is motivated by the conjecture that gcms are especially good at simulating the atmospheric circulation patterns that control moisture transport and which can be expected to change in response to global warming in support of this we show for the late 20th century that gcms provide much better simulations of acps than those of precipitation amount for the upper guadiana basin in central spain for the same period four of the twenty gcms participating in the most recent 5th ipcc assessment provide quite accurate representations of the spatial patterns of mean sea level pressure the frequency distribution of acp type the number of rainy days per month and the daily probability of rain they also reproduce the trend of wet day amount though not the actual magnitudes a consequent analysis of projected trends and changes in hydro climatic acpology between the late 20th and 21st centuries indicates that 1 actual changes appear to be occurring faster than predicted by the models and 2 for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the expected decline in precipitation volume is associated mainly with a few specific acps primarily directional flows from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea and with decreasing probability of rain linked to increasing temperatures rather than wet day amount our approach is a potentially more insightful alternative for catchment scale climate impacts assessments than the common approach of statistical downscaling and bias correction keywords climate impact assessment hydro climatology acpology atmospheric circulation patterns number of rainy days probability of rain wet day amount temperature spain 1 introduction 1 1 goals of this paper at mediterranean latitudes 21st century simulations by general circulation models gcms project increases in temperature and reductions in rainfall and this process may have already begun lionello et al 2014 these changes can be expected to severely impact water resources management requiring the development of hydrological models for planning ideally gcm projections of hydrometeorological fields would be the primary source of information for local and regional scale hydrological studies however such models typically provide poor simulations of the magnitude of daily precipitation the primary hydrometeorological field required for hydrological analysis it is common therefore to apply bias corrections often along with statistical or dynamical downscaling to the gcms outputs wood et al 2002 2004 maurer 2007 fowler et al 2007 piani et al 2010 johnson and sharma 2012 wi et al 2012 such corrections implicitly assume that the spatial and temporal patterns of hydroclimatic variables notably temperature and precipitation will remain invariant in this paper we take the view that it is reasonable to assume that gcms are especially good at simulating atmospheric circulation which is the underlying control on moisture transport and thereby rainfall therefore it is also natural to presume that gcms can be expected to remain equally good at simulating the changes in atmospheric circulation that can be expected to occur in response to global warming this capability is especially relevant for mediterranean latitudes where changes in rainfall are driven largely by changes in atmospheric circulation xoplaki et al 2012 therefore the focus of this paper is an approach to investigating local and regional scale hydrologic impacts that is based on the ability of gcms to simulate the atmospheric circulation patterns acps for the region of interest randall et al 2007 sheridan and lee 2010 lee and sheridan 2011 while our goal is a general and relatively simple methodology for assessment of projected climate change i e one that is simple enough to be easily applied for water resources assessment we develop and illustrate our approach for the 16 000km2 upper guadiana basin in central spain in doing so we evaluate how local climate variables can be expected to change due to projected shifts in climate during the 21st century the climate variables of interest include the daily minimum average and maximum temperatures tmin tavg and tmax and the occurrence or not and amount of daily precipitation pvol averaged over the basin all of which are important for water resources assessments piao et al 2010 sivakumar 2011 to ensure some degree of generality to our findings and because the quality of climate simulations at a specific location varies from model to model brekke et al 2008 pierce et al 2009 dominguez et al 2010 we examine and assess the climate change projections provided by a suite of 20 general circulation models gcms participating in the most recent 5th assessment conducted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the projections are available from the website of phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 taylor et al 2011 specifically we seek to answer the following questions q1 which of the hydro meteorological variables precipitation and temperature needed for catchment scale assessments are simulated well enough by gcms that they can be used to assess the impacts of climate variability change q2 which of the available gcms provide better simulations of the historical patterns of atmospheric circulation precipitation and temperature over the region of interest q3 what inferences can be made from available gcm simulations about potential future trends in the hydro meteorological variables of interest q4 what inferences can be made from available gcm simulations about potential future changes in annual climatology pattern of mean monthly values and acpology pattern of mean values per acp regarding potential future changes in climate this study will examine two emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 see section 4 considered under the most recent ipcc climate change assessment ipcc 2013 1 2 background and motivation the hydroclimatic information provided by acps has found a wide range of application in many fields e g precipitation climate change pollutant episode mortality etc bardossy and plate 1992 esteban et al 2005 stahl et al 2006 huth et al 2008 demuzere et al 2009 lee and sheridan 2011 recent studies bárdossy and pegram 2011 sapriza azuri et al 2013 haberlandt et al 2014 have illustrated the usefulness of incorporating acps in downscaling and bias correction methodologies in particular sapriza azuri et al 2013 demonstrated that several aspects of the spatio temporal non stationarity of catchment scale spatially distributed rainfall fields can be reproduced by decomposing the rainfall generating process into several time stationary stochastic rainfall generating processes srgps in this manner changes in the frequencies of different types of precipitation generating mechanisms frontal and convective and interactions between the mesoscale atmospheric patterns and local topography orographic effects can be accounted for in other words their approach is based on the reasonable assumption that differences in spatial patterns and intensities of precipitation can at least in part be explained by differences in the directions and intensities of the winds patterns of atmospheric pressure time of year coded through temperature and source locations of moisture associated with different acps therefore instead of downscaling precipitation based on statistical bias correction or dynamical modeling the sapriza azuri et al 2013 method uses local precipitation gauge data and information regarding topographic elevation to develop several time stationary srgps one for each of several acp types discussed later and time of year coded in terms of season each srgp can then be used to generate multiple stochastic realizations of daily rainfall fields at arbitrarily high spatial resolution that preserve the observed spatial covariance and the drift in intensity associated with topography to apply the srgp method to catchment scale hydrological modeling and water resources evaluation one need only specify only the time history of evolution daily sequence of acps throughout the year and indicate whether it rains or not anywhere within the basin on a specific day for hind casting these data can be provided by an analysis of historical data and or simulations provided by regional weather forecast models for future projections they can in principle be obtained from information provided by gcms 1 3 an alternative approach to evaluating potential impacts of climate change combined with gcm projections the srgp method therefore provides an intriguing alternative approach for evaluating the potential impacts of climate change on a basin since projected changes variations in global climate can be expected to result in changes to global regional and local patterns of atmospheric circulation thereby resulting in changes to local intensities and spatial patterns of precipitation the future projections provided by gcms for various co2 emission scenarios can be used to obtain information regarding the anticipated time evolution of a the relative frequency of different kinds of atmospheric circulation patterns b the corresponding probability of rain c the mean areal temperature and d the relative change from current period in mean areal wet day precipitation amount for each acp type in each season this information can then be used to drive a hydrological model of the basin in the case of catchment scale lumped hydrological modeling the information can be used directly whereas for spatially distributed hydrological modeling the information can be used to generate high resolution precipitation fields via srgp method mentioned above of course application of this method requires us to make a number of important assumptions including the following as1 current gcms are capable of providing sufficiently accurate simulations of atmospheric circulation patterns probabilities of rain and temperature under current conditions and can predict their evolution under future potential emission scenarios as2 the gcms can provide sufficiently accurate estimates of the evolution of relative changes in mean areal wet day precipitation amount changes from current day values under future potential emission scenarios as3 apart from the mean wet day precipitation amounts the mechanics of local spatial rainfall generation properties of the spatial probability distributions and interactions with elevation are not significantly altered it is possible to examine the validity of assumption as1 for historical conditions by evaluating the performance of gcms against available data bronstert et al 2007 johnson and sharma 2009 2011 anagnostopoulos et al 2010 haberlandt et al 2014 if the assumption is found to be defensible under current conditions at least in a statistical way we could in principle rely upon the gcms to provide plausible information regarding their potential future evolution unfortunately it is not practically possible to properly evaluate the validity of assumption as2 since existing historical data records are insufficiently long to conduct a confident comparison of temporal trends although some studies have at least analyzed the uncertainty of future gcms projections déqué et al 2007 woldemeskel et al 2012 we do know however that gcms do not provide sufficiently accurate estimates of the actual values of precipitation the estimates tend to be severely biased although they do a fairly good job with respect to temperature johnson and sharma 2009 see also section 2 finally it is impossible to establish the validity of assumption as3 for reasons similar to as2 and also because gcms do not provide information at the scales necessary for local hydro meteorological and water resources assessments 2 hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin the upper guadiana basin ugb occupies a portion of the central spanish plateau fig 1 and is characterized by relatively smooth changes in elevation ranging from 550metersabovesealevel masl at the basin outlet to more than 1000masl at the northern and southern boundaries in the sierra altomira and campos de montiel respectively combined with lack of a well defined drainage network and an abundance of large karstic formations the smooth topography leads to high degree of connection between the surface and subsurface water around 250km2 of wetlands flourish in the basin due to regional groundwater discharge including the natural wetlands of la mancha húmeda that has been declared a unesco biosphere reserve the basin experiences a mixed continental semi arid mediterranean climate with considerable spatio temporal variability of precipitation due to both orographic effects lapse rate of 7 5mm km and the climatic influences of the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea precipitation is measured daily at 49gauge locations distributed evenly throughout the basin fig 1 and records are available for the period january 1959 to december 2007 these values were aggregated to obtain mean areal values for the basin similarly minimum average and maximum daily temperature measurements are provided by the spanish state meteorological agency aemet and are available for the period january 1959 to december 2001 these data will be represented using climatology and acpology plots the climatology plots display the annual pattern of monthly averages over the period 1960 1999 and are a conventional way of summarizing climate data for a region in a similar manner we propose the use of acpology plots to group together the days associated with a particular atmospheric circulation pattern acp type therefore acpology plots describe the climate in terms of the frequency of each acp type and the mean weather associated with those atmospheric conditions the first step is to determine the acp type for each day for this study we used an automated version of the lamb weather type classification scheme jenkinson and collison 1977 jones et al 1993 based on the direction of surface wind and its vorticity in geostrophic units gridded values of mean sea level pressure mslp were obtained at 16 points distributed as indicated in fig 1c obtained from the gridded ncep ncar re analysis kalnay et al 1996 following previous applications of the automated version of the lamb weather type classification scheme over the iberian peninsula goodess and palutikof 1998 goodess and jones 2002 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2006 sapriza azuri 2013 lambán et al 2015 sapriza azuri et al 2015 we obtain the 8 acp types listed in table 1 types a1 a2 and a3 are directional patterns a5 a6 and a7 are cyclonic low pressure systems and a4 a8 are anti cyclonic high pressure systems fig 2 shows the mslp maps for the 8 acp types obtained by averaging across the entire time period using the reanalysis data to derive the acps from the gcms historical and future cases we use the same discretization of grid cells and use bilinear interpolation to match up with the same grid as the re analysis data climatology plots of rainfall and temperature data are shown as red lines in the left column of fig 3 for the period 1960 to 1999 here a day is considered to be rainy if precipitation is recorded in at least one gauge in the basin and the mean areal wet day amount wdam for each month is computed by summing the total basin average precipitation volume pvol for the month and dividing by the number of rainy days nord the plots indicate that the precipitation annual average 475mm year is characterized by strong seasonal variability varying from 55mm month in the winter when the average temperature tavg 6 c to less than 10mm month during the hot summer months july and august when tavg can exceed 25 c the low volume of summer precipitation is reflected in a low nord and wdam the right column of fig 3 contains the corresponding acpology plots for the region of the 8 acp types a1 a4 a5 and a6 are particularly worth noting the most frequent is a4 130days year which has the lowest probability of rain por 0 5 and lowest average wet day amount 0 39mm day therefore generating very little rain only 25mm year being a high pressure system it is responsible for the characteristic sunny days that spain is famous for the second most frequent is a1 65days year a directional pattern n nw w sw that brings moisture from the atlantic ocean and the cantabric sea has a high por 0 85 and moderate wdam and therefore generates a very large amount of rain 152mm year finally a5 and a6 are the wettest systems being cyclonic low pressure together accounting for 52days year and having very high por 0 95 and 0 9 respectively together they generate 198mm year 112 86 of precipitation the other four types directional a2 and a3 and light flow a7 and a8 occur during the remaining one third of the year 118days but generate only about 21 99mm year of the rain note also that relatively cold temperatures generally accompany the wetter a1 a5 and a6 systems while the drier ones a4 a2 a3 a7 and a8 are generally warmer further details regarding the hydro climatology of the various circulation patterns are shown in fig 4 the rows indicate different acp types whereas each column illustrates a different hydroclimatic variable the first column shows that a4 anti cyclonic and a1 directional n nw w sw display a clear seasonality in frequency of occurrence through the year ndays with marked declines in the summer while a5 a6 and a3 are relatively flat a2 a8 and a7 are more frequent in summer the second column shows that in all cases the probability of rain declines during the summer note also that the pors for a1 a5 and a6 are very close to 1 0 during the winter the third column shows that the average wet day amount can be quite variable throughout the year overall it is clear that the local precipitation generation mechanism varies quite markedly with acp type and time of year and that higher temperatures summer months tend to be associated with lower probabilities of rain and smaller wet day amounts this is particularly true for the rainmaking circulation types a1 a5 and a6 3 evaluation of global circulation model simulations 3 1 qualitative evaluation gcm simulations for the historical period january 1959 to december 2005 are available from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 taylor et al 2011 data are available for the 20 models listed in table 2 each of these models is represented in figs 3 and 4 by a gray line the gcm ensemble model estimated as the median is plotted as a black line spatial patterns of mslp by acp of reanalysis based first column in both figures and gcms based are shown in figs 5a and 5b the left column of fig 3 shows that all of the gcms tend to do a very good job of reproducing the climatological level and pattern of temperature although with a slight negative bias the only notable outlier is model inmcm4 gcm 11 which has a very severe cold bias for daily minimum temperature tmin similarly 13 of 20 of the gcms track the pattern and level of the number of rainy days nord reasonably well although with a slight tendency to underestimation 2days month on average meanwhile as is reported by others dai 2006 kundzewicz et al 2008 anagnostopoulos et al 2010 most of the gcms provide poor prediction of the climatological level and pattern of wet day amount wdam and hence precipitation volume pvol note that many of the gcms do not even reproduce the summer decline in wet day amount and some of them actually overestimate the wdam level by as much as 300 in contrast the right column of fig 3 shows that all of the models tend to reproduce the acpology patterns quite well in fact the frequency distribution of acps number of acp days per years is reproduced very closely similarly the number of rainy days per acp and hence the por is also reproduced very well with some disagreement for the fine weather a4 anti cyclonic system further the acpology of temperature is well represented although again gcm 11 shows a cold bias for tmin meanwhile although the magnitude level of wdam and hence pvol for all acps tends to show a strong positive bias the pattern relative values across the acps is quite well reproduced to analyze the evolution of acps frequency during the historical period we compare in fig 6 the annual frequency of acps over three 15 year windows 1961 1975 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 results are similar for the three periods and to those of the entire historical period fig 3 top plot of the right column this finding is relevant because it supports our first assumption as1 in the introduction that gcms are quite accurate in reproducing acp frequencies in fact given the significant reduction in rainfall over the guadiana basin during the historical period studied sapriza azuri 2013 this finding suggests that it is possible that acp frequencies may also be reproduced skillfully by gcms under conditions of changing climate the gcm simulations of mlsp spatial patterns figs 5a and 5b all tend to represent the a1 directional n nw w sw and a4 anti cyclonic acps well but provide poorer representations for the a3 directional e ne a5 cyclonic and a6 hybrid cyclonic acps overall only three of the gcms gcm 2 gcm 14 and gcm 15 reproduce the spatial patterns of all the acps reasonably well and although gcm 18 is able to reproduce the spatial pattern it displays a clear negative bias in the magnitude of simulated mslp overall these plots indicate that while gcms differ widely in terms of how well they reproduce the generation of rainfall amount they actually tend to provide quite good simulations in terms of climatology and acpology for temperature frequency distribution spatial pattern of acps and probability of rain in terms of the stated goals of this study this is good news as it suggests the possibility of being able to rely upon future projections of atmospheric circulation patterns and their corresponding probabilities of rain for water resources assessments however it is clear that we cannot rely upon the gcms to accurately simulate the magnitudes and climatological patterns of wet day amounts it would be useful therefore to evaluate quantitatively whether any of the 20 models is actually better than the others in terms of its simulation of the hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin 3 2 quantitative evaluation to perform a more quantitative evaluation of gcm performance we compute two measures of climatological similarity for each variable rl relative level and sc shape correlation the measure rl simply reports the mean value of the gcm climatology divided by the mean value of the observed climatology for a given variable and so varies on 0 its value equals 1 0 if the overall level i e monthly mean is perfectly matched and is larger than 1 0 if the gcm overestimates observations similarly the measure sc reports the corresponding simple linear correlation between the gcm climatology values and the observed values and so varies on 1 0 1 0 its value equals 1 0 if the shape of the monthly climatology is perfectly reproduced if both rl 1 and sc 1 then the gcm reproduction of climatology fig 3 left column can be considered perfect in an annual average sense similarly rl and sc can be computed for the acpologies fig 3 right column and the acp climatologies of each variable fig 4 these results are plotted in figs 7 and 8 it should be understood that our findings are not meant to indicate that any particular gcm is good or bad in any overall sense our methodology here simply helps to identify which gcms do a good job for any particular region in our case the upper guadiana basin the first and third subplot of fig 7 show model performances in terms of rl and sc of climatology as mentioned earlier all of the models perform well on temperature with shape correlations close to 1 0 and relative levels in the range 0 5 1 5 however reproduction of tmax and tavg is much better than for tmin where the model spread is much larger further 11 out of 20 models show good performance on number of rainy days nord shape correlations are within the range 0 5 1 0 and within 0 75 1 0 for relative level the second and fourth subplot of fig 7 shows model performance in terms of rl and sc of acpology here we find that all of the shape correlations are generally high with the exception of tmin for models 4 and 11 hadcm3 and inmcm4 and in general the relative levels are within the 0 5 1 5 range for the temperatures and por if we reject the following 14 models for the reasons listed below we are left with only the six gcms indicated by the light blue markers a model 11 for its cold tmin bias in both climatology and acpology rl 0 5 b models 2 5 12 13 14 16 and 17 for nord climatology sc 0 5 c model 6 for nord climatology rl 0 5 d models 7 8 9 and 10 for wdam climatology sc 0 e model 4 for its cold tmin bias in acpology rl 0 5 the remaining models correspond to 1 canesm2 3 csiromk36 15 hadgem2 es 18 ec earth 19 mpi esm lr and 20 mpi esm mr with the exception of rainfall amounts wdam and pvol these models can be said to provide excellent performance in terms of nord tmax and tavg climatology and por tmax and tavg acpology and relatively good performance in terms of tmin further although the wdam values and hence pvol tend to be high and therefore in need of bias correction the climatology shape correlations are all positive and the acpology shape correlations are all above 0 7 further details about the climatological performance of each model for individual acps can be seen in fig 8 each column corresponds to one of the eight acps and the six subplots correspond to number of acp days per month nday por and wdam rl and sc respectively the selected good models do a remarkable job of reproducing the climatological sc s of nday and por for a1 directional n nw w sw that brings moisture from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea but with a tendency to have too many days of this type and with a marked 50 dry bias in contrast the reproduction of climatological sc s for the cyclonic a5 and a6 types is weaker although rl values are relatively close to 1 0 and with a substantial wet bias interestingly only 2 of the good models 15 hadgem2 es and 18 ec earth do a decent job for the anti cyclonic a4 high pressure system and all models have a very severe dry bias the acp type for which the models disagree the most is the a3 directional s se system and the performance on the remaining types a2 a7 and a8 is moderately good though somewhat varied to evaluate the abilities of the gcms to reproduce the spatial pattern of mslp by acp we compute two statistics the root mean square error rmse at the grid points of mslp averaged over all days belonging to each acp in every model using the reanalysis data as true and the pattern correlation pc computed as the correlation coefficient of the same data fig 9 displays the results in matrix form in general 4 of the 6 gcms selected above as good models perform well here with a low rmse 20pa and greater than 0 5 pc gcm 18 ec earth reproduces the reanalysis patterns mean pc for the 8 acp is 0 87 but scores the worst of all gcms in terms of rmse due mainly to the fact see fig 5b that mslp is severely underestimated gcm 1 canesm2 fails to reproduce the spatial pattern of a3 pc 0 42 a5 0 10 and a6 0 23 the gcms that best reproduce the spatial patterns mean rmse over all acps 10pa and pc 0 9 are gcm 14 hadgem2 cc gcm 15 hadgem2 es gcm 17 access and gcm 2 cnrmcm5 3 3 summary of gcm evaluation in conclusion our quantitative evaluation of gcm performance indicates that four of the 20 gcms participating in the ipcc assessment can be considered to provide reasonably good simulations of the hydro climatology acp hydro climatologies and the acp spatial patterns rmse and pc of the upper guadiana basin with the exception of wet day amounts associated with each atmospheric circulation pattern therefore to carry out an assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on this basin we focus on the four selected models and use them to provide time series of daily acp type occurrence or not of rain and temperature for this region further to generate simulations of precipitation amount we apply appropriate bias corrections to the climatological patterns of wet day amount associated with each acp type see fig 4 the thresholds selected to retain a gcm for future climate projections over our study region are sc 0 5 and 1 5 rl 0 5 as for the spatial pattern we have used rmse 20pa and pc 0 5 however it seems plausible that actual thresholds may need to be site dependent reflecting the facts of model uncertainty and variability among models 4 climate change projections for the upper guadiana basin in this section we examine the climate change projections provided by the four good models identified in section 3 with a view to understanding how the hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin might be expected to change over the next 100years rather than use the a1 a2 b1 b2 emission scenarios presented in the special report on emissions scenarios sres ipcc 2000 which were the basis for the 3rd and 4th ipcc assessment reports 2001 2007 we follow the new representative concentration pathways rcp approach developed for the 5th ipcc assessment report http www wmo int pages themes climate emission scenarios php note that we have not applied any kind of correction for the future mslps need to calculate the future acps 4 1 selection of climate change scenarios for this analysis we selected rcp 4 5 which represents a medium low representative concentration pathway and rcp 8 5 which represents a more severe rising radiative forcing pathway moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 therefore these two scenarios represent jointly a plausible range of potential emission scenarios for the future whereas the impacts determined under rcp 8 5 might be considered to represent a sort of upper limit the projections provided by the 20 participating gcms for the period 2006 2100 see table 2 can be downloaded from cmip5 project http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 note that while complete data were not available at the time of this analysis for gcm 4 hadcm3 and gcm 16 gisse2r these two gcms do not belong to the set of models selected as providing good simulations for the upper guadiana basin 4 2 analysis of future trends figs 10 12 present an analysis of future trends projected by the four selected gcms for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios to construct these plots the 135 year period from 1961 to 2095 was subdivided into nine periods each being 15years in length thereby constituting three historical periods 1961 1975 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 and six future periods 2006 2020 2021 2035 2036 2050 2051 2065 2066 2080 and 2081 2095 in general our analysis of the results shows that the bias in gcm simulations of precipitation can be corrected using a multiplicative factor this finding is consistent with the fact that the pdf for precipitation tends to follow a log normal or gamma distribution by adjusting the mean by a multiplicative factor we correct both the mean and the variance in contrast with an additive correction that would simply move the mean of the pdf without affecting other moments of the distribution so for each variable we first compute the period mean observation and gcm and then perform the following adjustment to remove the bias adjusted gcm value gcm value observed value for 1961 1975 gcm value for 1961 1975 we then plot the difference between the adjusted value for any period and the corresponding value for the first period 1961 1975 as indicated earlier this adjustment can be fairly large for wdam and pvol note that given the nature of the adjustment these plots can be viewed as projected changes from the 1961 1975 baseline value in each figure the four light gray lines represent the projections provided by each of the four selected gcms for the rcp 8 5 scenario to avoid confusion the rcp 4 5 lines for the individual models are not included the heavy gray line shows the median of these rcp 8 5 projections and the black line shows the median of the rcp 4 5 projections the x axis labels 2 1 0 represent the three historical periods and the labels 1 thru 6 represent the future periods since we are showing changes differences from the first period the plots also indicate the corresponding baseline values as yo the results in fig 10 show the expected progressive rise in temperatures note that the two scenarios only begin to diverge around 2036 2050 when the changes tend to accelerate for rcp 8 5 and decelerate for rcp 4 5 overall the plots indicate that daily mean temperatures tavg can be expected to increase by 3 3 5 8 c by the end of the 21st century with maximum daily temperatures rising somewhat more quickly note however that the model projections do not rise as quickly as the observations during the historical period hinting at the fact that the gcms may actually be underestimating temperature rises the number of rainy days is projected to decline on average by 34 63days per year and the wet day amount by 0 13 0 25mm day 3 0 7 5mm month 7 13 the consequent reduction in precipitation volume is projected at 100 160mm year which corresponds to a 20 30 decrease in mean annual precipitation however note again that observed historical pvol declined faster than the model projections hinting that the gcm projections of precipitation decline may also be underestimates clearly the amount of model ensemble spread for wdam less so for nord and the lack of agreement between the ensemble mean and historical observations indicates considerable uncertainty in the future magnitude of precipitation for example one of the models mpi esm mr actually projects a potential increase in wet day amount the results in figs 11 and 12 show the details broken out by each of the 8 acp types fig 11 shows that the temperature increases and also the differences between responses to the two warming scenarios are larger for some acps than for others for example the scenario differences are relatively small for a3 directional s se which brings winds from over the mediterranean sea and africa in contrast the scenario differences for a5 and a6 cyclonic low pressure are much larger and the projected increase in tmax is as high as 9 c above a baseline of 15 7 c note that the warmest acp is a7 low flow with tmax reaching 34 c fig 12 shows the corresponding changes in number of acp days nday first column row number of rainy days nord second column wet day amount wdam third column and mean annual precipitation volume pvol last column the most striking result shown here is that the models indicate that projected increases in radiative forcing and hence temperature will only impact some of the properties of some of the acps in a considerable way for example the projections indicate that the relative frequencies of the acps are only moderately affected with a1 directional n nw w sw showing the strongest decline 10days per year from an initial 64 and with little difference between the rcp scenarios a5 a6 and a3 showing practically no change and a2 a8 and a7 showing increases the most marked change is for a2 directional n ne that brings the cold and dry tramuntana winds with an increase of 16days per year from an initial 48days perhaps more important from the point of view of a water resources assessment are the projected changes in number of rainy days nord and wet day amount wdam here we see marked declines in nord for the fine weather system a4 22days from an initial 70 the wet directional a1 system out of the north and west 17days from an initial 57 and the wet cyclonic a5 and a6 systems together 14days from an initial 48 however the model ensemble projections of wdam are quite variable with the median projections indicating either none or only moderate reductions over the period except perhaps for the projected declines for the cyclonic a5 and a6 that seem somewhat more definitive overall the projections suggest that the projected reductions in mean annual precipitation volume 130mm year reported above will occur mainly for a1 45 a5 30 and a6 25 4 3 projected changes in climatology and acpology finally we evaluate gcms projections for potential changes in the average hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin and regarding changes to the frequency distribution and properties of the atmospheric circulation patterns for this we compute the climatology and acpology for the historical 40 year period 1960 1999 and for the future 40 year period 2060 2099 and compute the differences the results are reported in figs 13 and 14 the left column of fig 13 indicates that temperatures will increase more during the summer 4 7 c than during the winter 2 3 c the number of rainy days will decrease on average by about 2 3days per month with larger declines in april and may 4 7days month and wet day amounts will decline mainly in april and in the summer these however are the result of changes in the frequencies and hydro climatological properties of the circulation patterns the right column of fig 13 shows that substantial declines can be seen in the frequency of a4 anti cyclonic high pressure and a1 directional n nw w sw indicating fewer fine weather a4days 4 8days year and a1 systems bringing moisture from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea 11 19days year at the same time we can expect marked increases in dry a2days 8 12days year and moderate increases in the other systems in general the results suggest small or moderate declines in wet day amounts across the systems so that the main causes of declines in precipitation volume are changes in the number of acp days and declines in the corresponding probabilities of rain 5 15 the latter can be seen to be generally larger for systems experiencing greater warming details of projected climatological changes to each acp are presented in fig 14 for the number of acp days per month ndays strong effects are projected for the fine weather a4 system anti cyclonic significant declines in summer frequency and slight increases in winter frequency and for the directional a2 system e ne notable increases in summer frequency the a1 directional n nw w sw system shows declines in spring and fall while the a5 and a6 cyclonic systems show moderate summer increases and the remaining show little change however probability of rain por shows substantial declines across all systems with larger declines during the warmer summer months and wet day amount wdam shows only moderate climatological effects 5 conclusions and discussion the paper reports an approach to assessing local catchment scale hydro meteorological impacts of projected climate change based on the fact that gcms do a better job at simulating the properties of atmospheric circulation patterns acps than they do for precipitation amount to illustrate the approach we present results for the 16 000km2 upper guadiana basin in central spain we show that while the twenty gcms participating in the most recent 5th ipcc assessment are generally very poor at simulating the magnitudes and climatological patterns of wet day amount and hence precipitation volume most of them actually display remarkably good performance with respect to the acpology that is the frequency distribution of acp types and their climatological properties such as number of rainy days and probability of rain figs 2 and 5 further only four of the twenty gcms provide reasonably satisfactory agreement with historical observations of temperature and rainfall variables as measured by the mean level and shape correlation in terms of climatology and acpology for the upper guadiana basin figs 7 and 8 based on this we examined the hydro climatic trends projected by the selected ensemble of four gcms for the upper guadiana basin for two of the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 representing moderate and strong increases in radiation pathways recommended by the 5th ipcc assessment report results for the adjusted climate variables indicate that temperature max avg and min increases regardless of the rcp scenario meanwhile the number of rainy days and the precipitation volume decrease for acps 1 and 4 these changes are more marked for the observation data than for gcms outputs note that acp1 corresponds to the typical cyclonic circulation pattern that brings moisture from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea and which is characterized by stratiform frontal rain with large spatial continuity and duration in contrast acp4 corresponds to an anti cyclonic circulation pattern that is typically accompanied by fine weather and which is characterized by small convective rain cells of short duration and small precipitation volume given the high frequency of occurrence of acp4 a reduction in associated precipitation volume could prove serious to the shrubs and other small plants that survive the otherwise arid summers in this area further we analyzed the projected changes in climatology and acpology between the latter 40years of the 20th century and the 21st century results show a clear reduction in frequency of low pressure fronts coming from the atlantic ocean and the cantabric sea as a result there is a reduction in both the number of rainy days and the precipitation volume but not in the wet day amount more importantly the observed trend of change is faster than simulated by gcms which is consistent with observations around the mediterranean region e g norrant romand and douguédroit 2014 in general our results suggest a relatively simple alternative to the commonly applied strategy of precipitation bias correction by statistical downscaling and bias correction and rely upon the ability of gcms to provide relatively good simulations of the time evolution of atmospheric circulation patterns and their associated probabilities of rain observed data e g precipitation and temperature measurements at several gauges with sufficiently long records can then be used to compute simple correction factors for mean wet day amounts associated with various acps thereby accounting for differing interactions between atmospheric flows and local topography effects the only real additional complexity involved in this method is the classification of acps jones et al 2013 further our approach is consistent with the method developed by sapriza azuri et al 2013 for stochastic generation of spatio temporally non stationary rainfall fields this requires the time history daily sequence of acps whether it rains or not anywhere within the basin and the basin scale mean wet day precipitation amounts for hindcasting these data can be provided by an analysis of historical data and or simulations provided by regional weather forecasting models for future projections they can be obtained from information provided by gcms with adjustments bias correction such as discussed in this paper in the case of catchment scale lumped hydrological modeling the forcing data daily acp type rain no rain indicator and wet day amount can be used directly whereas for spatially distributed hydrological modeling the information can be used to drive the set of srgps described above as mentioned earlier any assessment of future climate impacts must make several important assumptions we have verified here that the current suite of gcms is capable of providing sufficiently accurate simulations of atmospheric circulation patterns probabilities of rain and temperature under current conditions as1 while being poor at simulating wet day amount the results of a climate impact assessment depend therefore on the currently untestable assumptions that a gcms can provide sufficiently accurate estimates of the evolution of hydro climatological variable under future potential emission scenarios as2 and b other properties of the local rainfall generation mechanism spatial probability distributions and interactions with elevation are not substantially altered as3 of course while we have focused here mainly on mean wet day amount one would also generally be interested in the shape of the daily probability distribution of wet day amount which will altered by changes in the probability of extreme intensity precipitation the upper tails of the distribution in future work we will extend our investigation to explore such effects another aspect of interest is the long term multi year periodic cycles associated with droughts and also wet spells since these are necessarily associated with changes in global and hence regional atmospheric circulation and associated precipitation mechanisms the approach presented here has the potential to provide further insight into how future cycles of wet and dry periods might be impacted at the local scale by increasing greenhouse concentrations thereby providing enhanced information for use by water resources managers and planners while we have focused in this paper primarily on climatological long term behaviors and trends an analysis of patterns of temporal evolution and cycles

7598,we present an approach for evaluating catchment scale hydro meteorological impacts of projected climate change based on the atmospheric circulation patterns acps of a region our approach is motivated by the conjecture that gcms are especially good at simulating the atmospheric circulation patterns that control moisture transport and which can be expected to change in response to global warming in support of this we show for the late 20th century that gcms provide much better simulations of acps than those of precipitation amount for the upper guadiana basin in central spain for the same period four of the twenty gcms participating in the most recent 5th ipcc assessment provide quite accurate representations of the spatial patterns of mean sea level pressure the frequency distribution of acp type the number of rainy days per month and the daily probability of rain they also reproduce the trend of wet day amount though not the actual magnitudes a consequent analysis of projected trends and changes in hydro climatic acpology between the late 20th and 21st centuries indicates that 1 actual changes appear to be occurring faster than predicted by the models and 2 for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the expected decline in precipitation volume is associated mainly with a few specific acps primarily directional flows from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea and with decreasing probability of rain linked to increasing temperatures rather than wet day amount our approach is a potentially more insightful alternative for catchment scale climate impacts assessments than the common approach of statistical downscaling and bias correction keywords climate impact assessment hydro climatology acpology atmospheric circulation patterns number of rainy days probability of rain wet day amount temperature spain 1 introduction 1 1 goals of this paper at mediterranean latitudes 21st century simulations by general circulation models gcms project increases in temperature and reductions in rainfall and this process may have already begun lionello et al 2014 these changes can be expected to severely impact water resources management requiring the development of hydrological models for planning ideally gcm projections of hydrometeorological fields would be the primary source of information for local and regional scale hydrological studies however such models typically provide poor simulations of the magnitude of daily precipitation the primary hydrometeorological field required for hydrological analysis it is common therefore to apply bias corrections often along with statistical or dynamical downscaling to the gcms outputs wood et al 2002 2004 maurer 2007 fowler et al 2007 piani et al 2010 johnson and sharma 2012 wi et al 2012 such corrections implicitly assume that the spatial and temporal patterns of hydroclimatic variables notably temperature and precipitation will remain invariant in this paper we take the view that it is reasonable to assume that gcms are especially good at simulating atmospheric circulation which is the underlying control on moisture transport and thereby rainfall therefore it is also natural to presume that gcms can be expected to remain equally good at simulating the changes in atmospheric circulation that can be expected to occur in response to global warming this capability is especially relevant for mediterranean latitudes where changes in rainfall are driven largely by changes in atmospheric circulation xoplaki et al 2012 therefore the focus of this paper is an approach to investigating local and regional scale hydrologic impacts that is based on the ability of gcms to simulate the atmospheric circulation patterns acps for the region of interest randall et al 2007 sheridan and lee 2010 lee and sheridan 2011 while our goal is a general and relatively simple methodology for assessment of projected climate change i e one that is simple enough to be easily applied for water resources assessment we develop and illustrate our approach for the 16 000km2 upper guadiana basin in central spain in doing so we evaluate how local climate variables can be expected to change due to projected shifts in climate during the 21st century the climate variables of interest include the daily minimum average and maximum temperatures tmin tavg and tmax and the occurrence or not and amount of daily precipitation pvol averaged over the basin all of which are important for water resources assessments piao et al 2010 sivakumar 2011 to ensure some degree of generality to our findings and because the quality of climate simulations at a specific location varies from model to model brekke et al 2008 pierce et al 2009 dominguez et al 2010 we examine and assess the climate change projections provided by a suite of 20 general circulation models gcms participating in the most recent 5th assessment conducted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the projections are available from the website of phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 taylor et al 2011 specifically we seek to answer the following questions q1 which of the hydro meteorological variables precipitation and temperature needed for catchment scale assessments are simulated well enough by gcms that they can be used to assess the impacts of climate variability change q2 which of the available gcms provide better simulations of the historical patterns of atmospheric circulation precipitation and temperature over the region of interest q3 what inferences can be made from available gcm simulations about potential future trends in the hydro meteorological variables of interest q4 what inferences can be made from available gcm simulations about potential future changes in annual climatology pattern of mean monthly values and acpology pattern of mean values per acp regarding potential future changes in climate this study will examine two emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 see section 4 considered under the most recent ipcc climate change assessment ipcc 2013 1 2 background and motivation the hydroclimatic information provided by acps has found a wide range of application in many fields e g precipitation climate change pollutant episode mortality etc bardossy and plate 1992 esteban et al 2005 stahl et al 2006 huth et al 2008 demuzere et al 2009 lee and sheridan 2011 recent studies bárdossy and pegram 2011 sapriza azuri et al 2013 haberlandt et al 2014 have illustrated the usefulness of incorporating acps in downscaling and bias correction methodologies in particular sapriza azuri et al 2013 demonstrated that several aspects of the spatio temporal non stationarity of catchment scale spatially distributed rainfall fields can be reproduced by decomposing the rainfall generating process into several time stationary stochastic rainfall generating processes srgps in this manner changes in the frequencies of different types of precipitation generating mechanisms frontal and convective and interactions between the mesoscale atmospheric patterns and local topography orographic effects can be accounted for in other words their approach is based on the reasonable assumption that differences in spatial patterns and intensities of precipitation can at least in part be explained by differences in the directions and intensities of the winds patterns of atmospheric pressure time of year coded through temperature and source locations of moisture associated with different acps therefore instead of downscaling precipitation based on statistical bias correction or dynamical modeling the sapriza azuri et al 2013 method uses local precipitation gauge data and information regarding topographic elevation to develop several time stationary srgps one for each of several acp types discussed later and time of year coded in terms of season each srgp can then be used to generate multiple stochastic realizations of daily rainfall fields at arbitrarily high spatial resolution that preserve the observed spatial covariance and the drift in intensity associated with topography to apply the srgp method to catchment scale hydrological modeling and water resources evaluation one need only specify only the time history of evolution daily sequence of acps throughout the year and indicate whether it rains or not anywhere within the basin on a specific day for hind casting these data can be provided by an analysis of historical data and or simulations provided by regional weather forecast models for future projections they can in principle be obtained from information provided by gcms 1 3 an alternative approach to evaluating potential impacts of climate change combined with gcm projections the srgp method therefore provides an intriguing alternative approach for evaluating the potential impacts of climate change on a basin since projected changes variations in global climate can be expected to result in changes to global regional and local patterns of atmospheric circulation thereby resulting in changes to local intensities and spatial patterns of precipitation the future projections provided by gcms for various co2 emission scenarios can be used to obtain information regarding the anticipated time evolution of a the relative frequency of different kinds of atmospheric circulation patterns b the corresponding probability of rain c the mean areal temperature and d the relative change from current period in mean areal wet day precipitation amount for each acp type in each season this information can then be used to drive a hydrological model of the basin in the case of catchment scale lumped hydrological modeling the information can be used directly whereas for spatially distributed hydrological modeling the information can be used to generate high resolution precipitation fields via srgp method mentioned above of course application of this method requires us to make a number of important assumptions including the following as1 current gcms are capable of providing sufficiently accurate simulations of atmospheric circulation patterns probabilities of rain and temperature under current conditions and can predict their evolution under future potential emission scenarios as2 the gcms can provide sufficiently accurate estimates of the evolution of relative changes in mean areal wet day precipitation amount changes from current day values under future potential emission scenarios as3 apart from the mean wet day precipitation amounts the mechanics of local spatial rainfall generation properties of the spatial probability distributions and interactions with elevation are not significantly altered it is possible to examine the validity of assumption as1 for historical conditions by evaluating the performance of gcms against available data bronstert et al 2007 johnson and sharma 2009 2011 anagnostopoulos et al 2010 haberlandt et al 2014 if the assumption is found to be defensible under current conditions at least in a statistical way we could in principle rely upon the gcms to provide plausible information regarding their potential future evolution unfortunately it is not practically possible to properly evaluate the validity of assumption as2 since existing historical data records are insufficiently long to conduct a confident comparison of temporal trends although some studies have at least analyzed the uncertainty of future gcms projections déqué et al 2007 woldemeskel et al 2012 we do know however that gcms do not provide sufficiently accurate estimates of the actual values of precipitation the estimates tend to be severely biased although they do a fairly good job with respect to temperature johnson and sharma 2009 see also section 2 finally it is impossible to establish the validity of assumption as3 for reasons similar to as2 and also because gcms do not provide information at the scales necessary for local hydro meteorological and water resources assessments 2 hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin the upper guadiana basin ugb occupies a portion of the central spanish plateau fig 1 and is characterized by relatively smooth changes in elevation ranging from 550metersabovesealevel masl at the basin outlet to more than 1000masl at the northern and southern boundaries in the sierra altomira and campos de montiel respectively combined with lack of a well defined drainage network and an abundance of large karstic formations the smooth topography leads to high degree of connection between the surface and subsurface water around 250km2 of wetlands flourish in the basin due to regional groundwater discharge including the natural wetlands of la mancha húmeda that has been declared a unesco biosphere reserve the basin experiences a mixed continental semi arid mediterranean climate with considerable spatio temporal variability of precipitation due to both orographic effects lapse rate of 7 5mm km and the climatic influences of the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea precipitation is measured daily at 49gauge locations distributed evenly throughout the basin fig 1 and records are available for the period january 1959 to december 2007 these values were aggregated to obtain mean areal values for the basin similarly minimum average and maximum daily temperature measurements are provided by the spanish state meteorological agency aemet and are available for the period january 1959 to december 2001 these data will be represented using climatology and acpology plots the climatology plots display the annual pattern of monthly averages over the period 1960 1999 and are a conventional way of summarizing climate data for a region in a similar manner we propose the use of acpology plots to group together the days associated with a particular atmospheric circulation pattern acp type therefore acpology plots describe the climate in terms of the frequency of each acp type and the mean weather associated with those atmospheric conditions the first step is to determine the acp type for each day for this study we used an automated version of the lamb weather type classification scheme jenkinson and collison 1977 jones et al 1993 based on the direction of surface wind and its vorticity in geostrophic units gridded values of mean sea level pressure mslp were obtained at 16 points distributed as indicated in fig 1c obtained from the gridded ncep ncar re analysis kalnay et al 1996 following previous applications of the automated version of the lamb weather type classification scheme over the iberian peninsula goodess and palutikof 1998 goodess and jones 2002 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2006 sapriza azuri 2013 lambán et al 2015 sapriza azuri et al 2015 we obtain the 8 acp types listed in table 1 types a1 a2 and a3 are directional patterns a5 a6 and a7 are cyclonic low pressure systems and a4 a8 are anti cyclonic high pressure systems fig 2 shows the mslp maps for the 8 acp types obtained by averaging across the entire time period using the reanalysis data to derive the acps from the gcms historical and future cases we use the same discretization of grid cells and use bilinear interpolation to match up with the same grid as the re analysis data climatology plots of rainfall and temperature data are shown as red lines in the left column of fig 3 for the period 1960 to 1999 here a day is considered to be rainy if precipitation is recorded in at least one gauge in the basin and the mean areal wet day amount wdam for each month is computed by summing the total basin average precipitation volume pvol for the month and dividing by the number of rainy days nord the plots indicate that the precipitation annual average 475mm year is characterized by strong seasonal variability varying from 55mm month in the winter when the average temperature tavg 6 c to less than 10mm month during the hot summer months july and august when tavg can exceed 25 c the low volume of summer precipitation is reflected in a low nord and wdam the right column of fig 3 contains the corresponding acpology plots for the region of the 8 acp types a1 a4 a5 and a6 are particularly worth noting the most frequent is a4 130days year which has the lowest probability of rain por 0 5 and lowest average wet day amount 0 39mm day therefore generating very little rain only 25mm year being a high pressure system it is responsible for the characteristic sunny days that spain is famous for the second most frequent is a1 65days year a directional pattern n nw w sw that brings moisture from the atlantic ocean and the cantabric sea has a high por 0 85 and moderate wdam and therefore generates a very large amount of rain 152mm year finally a5 and a6 are the wettest systems being cyclonic low pressure together accounting for 52days year and having very high por 0 95 and 0 9 respectively together they generate 198mm year 112 86 of precipitation the other four types directional a2 and a3 and light flow a7 and a8 occur during the remaining one third of the year 118days but generate only about 21 99mm year of the rain note also that relatively cold temperatures generally accompany the wetter a1 a5 and a6 systems while the drier ones a4 a2 a3 a7 and a8 are generally warmer further details regarding the hydro climatology of the various circulation patterns are shown in fig 4 the rows indicate different acp types whereas each column illustrates a different hydroclimatic variable the first column shows that a4 anti cyclonic and a1 directional n nw w sw display a clear seasonality in frequency of occurrence through the year ndays with marked declines in the summer while a5 a6 and a3 are relatively flat a2 a8 and a7 are more frequent in summer the second column shows that in all cases the probability of rain declines during the summer note also that the pors for a1 a5 and a6 are very close to 1 0 during the winter the third column shows that the average wet day amount can be quite variable throughout the year overall it is clear that the local precipitation generation mechanism varies quite markedly with acp type and time of year and that higher temperatures summer months tend to be associated with lower probabilities of rain and smaller wet day amounts this is particularly true for the rainmaking circulation types a1 a5 and a6 3 evaluation of global circulation model simulations 3 1 qualitative evaluation gcm simulations for the historical period january 1959 to december 2005 are available from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 taylor et al 2011 data are available for the 20 models listed in table 2 each of these models is represented in figs 3 and 4 by a gray line the gcm ensemble model estimated as the median is plotted as a black line spatial patterns of mslp by acp of reanalysis based first column in both figures and gcms based are shown in figs 5a and 5b the left column of fig 3 shows that all of the gcms tend to do a very good job of reproducing the climatological level and pattern of temperature although with a slight negative bias the only notable outlier is model inmcm4 gcm 11 which has a very severe cold bias for daily minimum temperature tmin similarly 13 of 20 of the gcms track the pattern and level of the number of rainy days nord reasonably well although with a slight tendency to underestimation 2days month on average meanwhile as is reported by others dai 2006 kundzewicz et al 2008 anagnostopoulos et al 2010 most of the gcms provide poor prediction of the climatological level and pattern of wet day amount wdam and hence precipitation volume pvol note that many of the gcms do not even reproduce the summer decline in wet day amount and some of them actually overestimate the wdam level by as much as 300 in contrast the right column of fig 3 shows that all of the models tend to reproduce the acpology patterns quite well in fact the frequency distribution of acps number of acp days per years is reproduced very closely similarly the number of rainy days per acp and hence the por is also reproduced very well with some disagreement for the fine weather a4 anti cyclonic system further the acpology of temperature is well represented although again gcm 11 shows a cold bias for tmin meanwhile although the magnitude level of wdam and hence pvol for all acps tends to show a strong positive bias the pattern relative values across the acps is quite well reproduced to analyze the evolution of acps frequency during the historical period we compare in fig 6 the annual frequency of acps over three 15 year windows 1961 1975 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 results are similar for the three periods and to those of the entire historical period fig 3 top plot of the right column this finding is relevant because it supports our first assumption as1 in the introduction that gcms are quite accurate in reproducing acp frequencies in fact given the significant reduction in rainfall over the guadiana basin during the historical period studied sapriza azuri 2013 this finding suggests that it is possible that acp frequencies may also be reproduced skillfully by gcms under conditions of changing climate the gcm simulations of mlsp spatial patterns figs 5a and 5b all tend to represent the a1 directional n nw w sw and a4 anti cyclonic acps well but provide poorer representations for the a3 directional e ne a5 cyclonic and a6 hybrid cyclonic acps overall only three of the gcms gcm 2 gcm 14 and gcm 15 reproduce the spatial patterns of all the acps reasonably well and although gcm 18 is able to reproduce the spatial pattern it displays a clear negative bias in the magnitude of simulated mslp overall these plots indicate that while gcms differ widely in terms of how well they reproduce the generation of rainfall amount they actually tend to provide quite good simulations in terms of climatology and acpology for temperature frequency distribution spatial pattern of acps and probability of rain in terms of the stated goals of this study this is good news as it suggests the possibility of being able to rely upon future projections of atmospheric circulation patterns and their corresponding probabilities of rain for water resources assessments however it is clear that we cannot rely upon the gcms to accurately simulate the magnitudes and climatological patterns of wet day amounts it would be useful therefore to evaluate quantitatively whether any of the 20 models is actually better than the others in terms of its simulation of the hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin 3 2 quantitative evaluation to perform a more quantitative evaluation of gcm performance we compute two measures of climatological similarity for each variable rl relative level and sc shape correlation the measure rl simply reports the mean value of the gcm climatology divided by the mean value of the observed climatology for a given variable and so varies on 0 its value equals 1 0 if the overall level i e monthly mean is perfectly matched and is larger than 1 0 if the gcm overestimates observations similarly the measure sc reports the corresponding simple linear correlation between the gcm climatology values and the observed values and so varies on 1 0 1 0 its value equals 1 0 if the shape of the monthly climatology is perfectly reproduced if both rl 1 and sc 1 then the gcm reproduction of climatology fig 3 left column can be considered perfect in an annual average sense similarly rl and sc can be computed for the acpologies fig 3 right column and the acp climatologies of each variable fig 4 these results are plotted in figs 7 and 8 it should be understood that our findings are not meant to indicate that any particular gcm is good or bad in any overall sense our methodology here simply helps to identify which gcms do a good job for any particular region in our case the upper guadiana basin the first and third subplot of fig 7 show model performances in terms of rl and sc of climatology as mentioned earlier all of the models perform well on temperature with shape correlations close to 1 0 and relative levels in the range 0 5 1 5 however reproduction of tmax and tavg is much better than for tmin where the model spread is much larger further 11 out of 20 models show good performance on number of rainy days nord shape correlations are within the range 0 5 1 0 and within 0 75 1 0 for relative level the second and fourth subplot of fig 7 shows model performance in terms of rl and sc of acpology here we find that all of the shape correlations are generally high with the exception of tmin for models 4 and 11 hadcm3 and inmcm4 and in general the relative levels are within the 0 5 1 5 range for the temperatures and por if we reject the following 14 models for the reasons listed below we are left with only the six gcms indicated by the light blue markers a model 11 for its cold tmin bias in both climatology and acpology rl 0 5 b models 2 5 12 13 14 16 and 17 for nord climatology sc 0 5 c model 6 for nord climatology rl 0 5 d models 7 8 9 and 10 for wdam climatology sc 0 e model 4 for its cold tmin bias in acpology rl 0 5 the remaining models correspond to 1 canesm2 3 csiromk36 15 hadgem2 es 18 ec earth 19 mpi esm lr and 20 mpi esm mr with the exception of rainfall amounts wdam and pvol these models can be said to provide excellent performance in terms of nord tmax and tavg climatology and por tmax and tavg acpology and relatively good performance in terms of tmin further although the wdam values and hence pvol tend to be high and therefore in need of bias correction the climatology shape correlations are all positive and the acpology shape correlations are all above 0 7 further details about the climatological performance of each model for individual acps can be seen in fig 8 each column corresponds to one of the eight acps and the six subplots correspond to number of acp days per month nday por and wdam rl and sc respectively the selected good models do a remarkable job of reproducing the climatological sc s of nday and por for a1 directional n nw w sw that brings moisture from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea but with a tendency to have too many days of this type and with a marked 50 dry bias in contrast the reproduction of climatological sc s for the cyclonic a5 and a6 types is weaker although rl values are relatively close to 1 0 and with a substantial wet bias interestingly only 2 of the good models 15 hadgem2 es and 18 ec earth do a decent job for the anti cyclonic a4 high pressure system and all models have a very severe dry bias the acp type for which the models disagree the most is the a3 directional s se system and the performance on the remaining types a2 a7 and a8 is moderately good though somewhat varied to evaluate the abilities of the gcms to reproduce the spatial pattern of mslp by acp we compute two statistics the root mean square error rmse at the grid points of mslp averaged over all days belonging to each acp in every model using the reanalysis data as true and the pattern correlation pc computed as the correlation coefficient of the same data fig 9 displays the results in matrix form in general 4 of the 6 gcms selected above as good models perform well here with a low rmse 20pa and greater than 0 5 pc gcm 18 ec earth reproduces the reanalysis patterns mean pc for the 8 acp is 0 87 but scores the worst of all gcms in terms of rmse due mainly to the fact see fig 5b that mslp is severely underestimated gcm 1 canesm2 fails to reproduce the spatial pattern of a3 pc 0 42 a5 0 10 and a6 0 23 the gcms that best reproduce the spatial patterns mean rmse over all acps 10pa and pc 0 9 are gcm 14 hadgem2 cc gcm 15 hadgem2 es gcm 17 access and gcm 2 cnrmcm5 3 3 summary of gcm evaluation in conclusion our quantitative evaluation of gcm performance indicates that four of the 20 gcms participating in the ipcc assessment can be considered to provide reasonably good simulations of the hydro climatology acp hydro climatologies and the acp spatial patterns rmse and pc of the upper guadiana basin with the exception of wet day amounts associated with each atmospheric circulation pattern therefore to carry out an assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on this basin we focus on the four selected models and use them to provide time series of daily acp type occurrence or not of rain and temperature for this region further to generate simulations of precipitation amount we apply appropriate bias corrections to the climatological patterns of wet day amount associated with each acp type see fig 4 the thresholds selected to retain a gcm for future climate projections over our study region are sc 0 5 and 1 5 rl 0 5 as for the spatial pattern we have used rmse 20pa and pc 0 5 however it seems plausible that actual thresholds may need to be site dependent reflecting the facts of model uncertainty and variability among models 4 climate change projections for the upper guadiana basin in this section we examine the climate change projections provided by the four good models identified in section 3 with a view to understanding how the hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin might be expected to change over the next 100years rather than use the a1 a2 b1 b2 emission scenarios presented in the special report on emissions scenarios sres ipcc 2000 which were the basis for the 3rd and 4th ipcc assessment reports 2001 2007 we follow the new representative concentration pathways rcp approach developed for the 5th ipcc assessment report http www wmo int pages themes climate emission scenarios php note that we have not applied any kind of correction for the future mslps need to calculate the future acps 4 1 selection of climate change scenarios for this analysis we selected rcp 4 5 which represents a medium low representative concentration pathway and rcp 8 5 which represents a more severe rising radiative forcing pathway moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 therefore these two scenarios represent jointly a plausible range of potential emission scenarios for the future whereas the impacts determined under rcp 8 5 might be considered to represent a sort of upper limit the projections provided by the 20 participating gcms for the period 2006 2100 see table 2 can be downloaded from cmip5 project http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 note that while complete data were not available at the time of this analysis for gcm 4 hadcm3 and gcm 16 gisse2r these two gcms do not belong to the set of models selected as providing good simulations for the upper guadiana basin 4 2 analysis of future trends figs 10 12 present an analysis of future trends projected by the four selected gcms for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios to construct these plots the 135 year period from 1961 to 2095 was subdivided into nine periods each being 15years in length thereby constituting three historical periods 1961 1975 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 and six future periods 2006 2020 2021 2035 2036 2050 2051 2065 2066 2080 and 2081 2095 in general our analysis of the results shows that the bias in gcm simulations of precipitation can be corrected using a multiplicative factor this finding is consistent with the fact that the pdf for precipitation tends to follow a log normal or gamma distribution by adjusting the mean by a multiplicative factor we correct both the mean and the variance in contrast with an additive correction that would simply move the mean of the pdf without affecting other moments of the distribution so for each variable we first compute the period mean observation and gcm and then perform the following adjustment to remove the bias adjusted gcm value gcm value observed value for 1961 1975 gcm value for 1961 1975 we then plot the difference between the adjusted value for any period and the corresponding value for the first period 1961 1975 as indicated earlier this adjustment can be fairly large for wdam and pvol note that given the nature of the adjustment these plots can be viewed as projected changes from the 1961 1975 baseline value in each figure the four light gray lines represent the projections provided by each of the four selected gcms for the rcp 8 5 scenario to avoid confusion the rcp 4 5 lines for the individual models are not included the heavy gray line shows the median of these rcp 8 5 projections and the black line shows the median of the rcp 4 5 projections the x axis labels 2 1 0 represent the three historical periods and the labels 1 thru 6 represent the future periods since we are showing changes differences from the first period the plots also indicate the corresponding baseline values as yo the results in fig 10 show the expected progressive rise in temperatures note that the two scenarios only begin to diverge around 2036 2050 when the changes tend to accelerate for rcp 8 5 and decelerate for rcp 4 5 overall the plots indicate that daily mean temperatures tavg can be expected to increase by 3 3 5 8 c by the end of the 21st century with maximum daily temperatures rising somewhat more quickly note however that the model projections do not rise as quickly as the observations during the historical period hinting at the fact that the gcms may actually be underestimating temperature rises the number of rainy days is projected to decline on average by 34 63days per year and the wet day amount by 0 13 0 25mm day 3 0 7 5mm month 7 13 the consequent reduction in precipitation volume is projected at 100 160mm year which corresponds to a 20 30 decrease in mean annual precipitation however note again that observed historical pvol declined faster than the model projections hinting that the gcm projections of precipitation decline may also be underestimates clearly the amount of model ensemble spread for wdam less so for nord and the lack of agreement between the ensemble mean and historical observations indicates considerable uncertainty in the future magnitude of precipitation for example one of the models mpi esm mr actually projects a potential increase in wet day amount the results in figs 11 and 12 show the details broken out by each of the 8 acp types fig 11 shows that the temperature increases and also the differences between responses to the two warming scenarios are larger for some acps than for others for example the scenario differences are relatively small for a3 directional s se which brings winds from over the mediterranean sea and africa in contrast the scenario differences for a5 and a6 cyclonic low pressure are much larger and the projected increase in tmax is as high as 9 c above a baseline of 15 7 c note that the warmest acp is a7 low flow with tmax reaching 34 c fig 12 shows the corresponding changes in number of acp days nday first column row number of rainy days nord second column wet day amount wdam third column and mean annual precipitation volume pvol last column the most striking result shown here is that the models indicate that projected increases in radiative forcing and hence temperature will only impact some of the properties of some of the acps in a considerable way for example the projections indicate that the relative frequencies of the acps are only moderately affected with a1 directional n nw w sw showing the strongest decline 10days per year from an initial 64 and with little difference between the rcp scenarios a5 a6 and a3 showing practically no change and a2 a8 and a7 showing increases the most marked change is for a2 directional n ne that brings the cold and dry tramuntana winds with an increase of 16days per year from an initial 48days perhaps more important from the point of view of a water resources assessment are the projected changes in number of rainy days nord and wet day amount wdam here we see marked declines in nord for the fine weather system a4 22days from an initial 70 the wet directional a1 system out of the north and west 17days from an initial 57 and the wet cyclonic a5 and a6 systems together 14days from an initial 48 however the model ensemble projections of wdam are quite variable with the median projections indicating either none or only moderate reductions over the period except perhaps for the projected declines for the cyclonic a5 and a6 that seem somewhat more definitive overall the projections suggest that the projected reductions in mean annual precipitation volume 130mm year reported above will occur mainly for a1 45 a5 30 and a6 25 4 3 projected changes in climatology and acpology finally we evaluate gcms projections for potential changes in the average hydro climatology of the upper guadiana basin and regarding changes to the frequency distribution and properties of the atmospheric circulation patterns for this we compute the climatology and acpology for the historical 40 year period 1960 1999 and for the future 40 year period 2060 2099 and compute the differences the results are reported in figs 13 and 14 the left column of fig 13 indicates that temperatures will increase more during the summer 4 7 c than during the winter 2 3 c the number of rainy days will decrease on average by about 2 3days per month with larger declines in april and may 4 7days month and wet day amounts will decline mainly in april and in the summer these however are the result of changes in the frequencies and hydro climatological properties of the circulation patterns the right column of fig 13 shows that substantial declines can be seen in the frequency of a4 anti cyclonic high pressure and a1 directional n nw w sw indicating fewer fine weather a4days 4 8days year and a1 systems bringing moisture from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea 11 19days year at the same time we can expect marked increases in dry a2days 8 12days year and moderate increases in the other systems in general the results suggest small or moderate declines in wet day amounts across the systems so that the main causes of declines in precipitation volume are changes in the number of acp days and declines in the corresponding probabilities of rain 5 15 the latter can be seen to be generally larger for systems experiencing greater warming details of projected climatological changes to each acp are presented in fig 14 for the number of acp days per month ndays strong effects are projected for the fine weather a4 system anti cyclonic significant declines in summer frequency and slight increases in winter frequency and for the directional a2 system e ne notable increases in summer frequency the a1 directional n nw w sw system shows declines in spring and fall while the a5 and a6 cyclonic systems show moderate summer increases and the remaining show little change however probability of rain por shows substantial declines across all systems with larger declines during the warmer summer months and wet day amount wdam shows only moderate climatological effects 5 conclusions and discussion the paper reports an approach to assessing local catchment scale hydro meteorological impacts of projected climate change based on the fact that gcms do a better job at simulating the properties of atmospheric circulation patterns acps than they do for precipitation amount to illustrate the approach we present results for the 16 000km2 upper guadiana basin in central spain we show that while the twenty gcms participating in the most recent 5th ipcc assessment are generally very poor at simulating the magnitudes and climatological patterns of wet day amount and hence precipitation volume most of them actually display remarkably good performance with respect to the acpology that is the frequency distribution of acp types and their climatological properties such as number of rainy days and probability of rain figs 2 and 5 further only four of the twenty gcms provide reasonably satisfactory agreement with historical observations of temperature and rainfall variables as measured by the mean level and shape correlation in terms of climatology and acpology for the upper guadiana basin figs 7 and 8 based on this we examined the hydro climatic trends projected by the selected ensemble of four gcms for the upper guadiana basin for two of the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 representing moderate and strong increases in radiation pathways recommended by the 5th ipcc assessment report results for the adjusted climate variables indicate that temperature max avg and min increases regardless of the rcp scenario meanwhile the number of rainy days and the precipitation volume decrease for acps 1 and 4 these changes are more marked for the observation data than for gcms outputs note that acp1 corresponds to the typical cyclonic circulation pattern that brings moisture from the atlantic ocean and cantabric sea and which is characterized by stratiform frontal rain with large spatial continuity and duration in contrast acp4 corresponds to an anti cyclonic circulation pattern that is typically accompanied by fine weather and which is characterized by small convective rain cells of short duration and small precipitation volume given the high frequency of occurrence of acp4 a reduction in associated precipitation volume could prove serious to the shrubs and other small plants that survive the otherwise arid summers in this area further we analyzed the projected changes in climatology and acpology between the latter 40years of the 20th century and the 21st century results show a clear reduction in frequency of low pressure fronts coming from the atlantic ocean and the cantabric sea as a result there is a reduction in both the number of rainy days and the precipitation volume but not in the wet day amount more importantly the observed trend of change is faster than simulated by gcms which is consistent with observations around the mediterranean region e g norrant romand and douguédroit 2014 in general our results suggest a relatively simple alternative to the commonly applied strategy of precipitation bias correction by statistical downscaling and bias correction and rely upon the ability of gcms to provide relatively good simulations of the time evolution of atmospheric circulation patterns and their associated probabilities of rain observed data e g precipitation and temperature measurements at several gauges with sufficiently long records can then be used to compute simple correction factors for mean wet day amounts associated with various acps thereby accounting for differing interactions between atmospheric flows and local topography effects the only real additional complexity involved in this method is the classification of acps jones et al 2013 further our approach is consistent with the method developed by sapriza azuri et al 2013 for stochastic generation of spatio temporally non stationary rainfall fields this requires the time history daily sequence of acps whether it rains or not anywhere within the basin and the basin scale mean wet day precipitation amounts for hindcasting these data can be provided by an analysis of historical data and or simulations provided by regional weather forecasting models for future projections they can be obtained from information provided by gcms with adjustments bias correction such as discussed in this paper in the case of catchment scale lumped hydrological modeling the forcing data daily acp type rain no rain indicator and wet day amount can be used directly whereas for spatially distributed hydrological modeling the information can be used to drive the set of srgps described above as mentioned earlier any assessment of future climate impacts must make several important assumptions we have verified here that the current suite of gcms is capable of providing sufficiently accurate simulations of atmospheric circulation patterns probabilities of rain and temperature under current conditions as1 while being poor at simulating wet day amount the results of a climate impact assessment depend therefore on the currently untestable assumptions that a gcms can provide sufficiently accurate estimates of the evolution of hydro climatological variable under future potential emission scenarios as2 and b other properties of the local rainfall generation mechanism spatial probability distributions and interactions with elevation are not substantially altered as3 of course while we have focused here mainly on mean wet day amount one would also generally be interested in the shape of the daily probability distribution of wet day amount which will altered by changes in the probability of extreme intensity precipitation the upper tails of the distribution in future work we will extend our investigation to explore such effects another aspect of interest is the long term multi year periodic cycles associated with droughts and also wet spells since these are necessarily associated with changes in global and hence regional atmospheric circulation and associated precipitation mechanisms the approach presented here has the potential to provide further insight into how future cycles of wet and dry periods might be impacted at the local scale by increasing greenhouse concentrations thereby providing enhanced information for use by water resources managers and planners while we have focused in this paper primarily on climatological long term behaviors and trends an analysis of patterns of temporal evolution and cycles

7599,flooding induced by heavy precipitation is one of the most severe natural hazards in alpine catchments to accurately predict such events accurate and representative precipitation data are required estimating catchment precipitation is however difficult due to its high spatial and in the mountains elevation dependent variability these inaccuracies together with runoff model limitations translate into uncertainty in runoff estimates thus in this study we investigate the value of three precipitation datasets commonly used in hydrological studies i e station network precipitation snp interpolated grid precipitation igp and radar based precipitation rbp for flood predictions in an alpine catchment to quantify their effects on runoff simulations we perform a bayesian uncertainty analysis with an improved description of model systematic errors by using periods of different lengths for model calibration we explore the information content of these three datasets for runoff predictions our results from an alpine catchment showed that using snp resulted in the largest predictive uncertainty and the lowest model performance evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency this performance improved from 0 674 to 0 774 with igp and to 0 829 with rbp the latter two datasets were also much more informative than snp as half as many calibration data points were required to obtain a good model performance thus our results show that the various types of precipitation data differ in their value for flood predictions in an alpine catchment and indicate rbp as the most useful dataset keywords precipitation uncertainty station network precipitation interpolated grid precipitation radar based precipitation flood prediction bayesian approach 1 introduction flooding induced by heavy precipitation is one of the most severe natural hazards in switzerland hilker et al 2009 massacand et al 1998 hohenegger et al 2008 stucki et al 2012 and is likely to increase due to more frequent heavy precipitation events foreseen in the alps beniston et al 2011 to accurately predict this type of flood event an accurate estimation of the causative precipitation is crucial masih et al 2011 strauch et al 2012 voisin et al 2008 yet while runoff represents an aggregated response to the catchment s precipitation and as such can be measured at its outlet only vaze et al 2011 precipitation is a spatially heterogeneous phenomenon and thus measuring its representative values at a catchment scale is not trivial aghakouchak et al 2011 krajewski et al 2003 mcmillan et al 2012 villarini et al 2008 observations from point gauges i e station network precipitation snp remain the most common method for measuring catchment precipitation aghakouchak et al 2010 berne et al 2005 lorenz et al 2014 volkmann et al 2010 the main reasons for this are a relatively high accuracy of precipitation rates at their respective locations brown et al 2001 brussolo et al 2008 the extended recording period suitable for analyzing long term precipitation runoff patterns xie et al 2007 and relatively low costs of a gauge purchase and maintenance sikorska et al 2012 when used as input for runoff models such point precipitation measurements must be aggregated to a catchment wide areal precipitation ly et al 2013 rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 and for ungauged regions a simple interpolation between point estimates is usually made girons lopez et al 2015 inaccuracies in estimating a catchment s precipitation when introduced into the runoff model will translate into large uncertainty in model simulations kavetski et al 2006 mul et al 2009 oudin et al 2006 thus snp data may sometimes be insufficient to model a catchment s response bárdossy and das 2008 mcmillan et al 2011 segond et al 2007 and in some catchments might not result in a satisfying model performance kuczera et al 2010 this is especially true for poorly gauged regions sikorska et al 2012 and for mountainous catchments where due to a complex terrain additional errors in estimating catchment precipitation need to be considered joss and lee 1995 these errors include wind and shading effects from slopes frei et al 2006 biased locations of stations mostly limited to valleys while precipitation rates increase with elevation viviroli et al 2011 xie et al 2007 and locally placed events with or without orographic influence induced by the natural mountainous barrier to capture such spatial and elevation dependent precipitation fields a finer spatial measuring resolution and covering different elevation zones would be required ly et al 2013 hence it has been proposed to smooth the precipitation rates across the terrain by using a number of point measurements from an extended area frei et al 2006 vaze et al 2011 these point measurements are interpolated and next aggregated into gridded cells of homogeneous precipitation rates giving interpolated grid precipitation igp yet the problem with a limited representation at high elevations remains as an alternative to point gauges meteorological weather radars can immediately provide information on spatial precipitation at a large scale and also at high elevations andrieu et al 1997 berne and krajewski 2013 borga 2002 kidd et al 2012 krajewski and smith 2002 thus some research has been devoted to assessing the usefulness of such radar based precipitation rbp for hydrological purposes e g abon et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2010 borga 2002 collier 1986 hazenberg et al 2011 hossain et al 2004 yet due to the need to transform radar attenuation measurements into ground precipitation rates disturbances in the beam attenuation and in mountains also beam shielding collier 1989 hossain et al 2004 joss and lee 1995 viviroli et al 2011 limited spatial resolution germann et al 2006 wilson and brandes 1979 and high costs of data purchase their practical value for hydrological purposes in small and medium size catchments has been questioned lanza et al 2001 tetzlaff and uhlenbrook 2005 given the above issues it remains unclear which dataset among the three mentioned is the most informative for understanding hydrological response and predicting flood events in a mountainous catchment given a limited number of observations for model calibration while several studies have focused on designing the most optimal station network for hydrological needs chen et al 2008 jung et al 2014 villarini et al 2008 volkmann et al 2010 wood et al 2000 a comparison of radar and point gauge estimates at a catchment scale has gained continual attention since the 1980s e g andrieu et al 1997 biggs and atkinson 2011 borga et al 2000 collier 1986 hossain et al 2004 piman and babel 2013 more recently effects of precipitation uncertainty on runoff predictions have been studied within different uncertainty frameworks for lowland and urbanized catchments andreassian et al 2001 bárdossy and das 2008 biemans et al 2009 mcmillan et al 2011 younger et al 2009 yet similar analysis of mountainous catchments are much more restricted masih et al 2011 and limited to assessing the parameter uncertainty usually using a glue approach generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation e g collier 2009 hossain et al 2004 however uncertainty in precipitation data together with structural limitations of a runoff model result in systematic errors in runoff predictions and thus cannot be explained by the parametric uncertainty alone kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015a for climate related studies these precipitation errors are dealt with by applying a bias correction to precipitation estimates addor and seibert 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2012 for uncertainty analysis of runoff predictions these errors must be described explicitly or implicitly adequately with respect to their properties brynjarsdóttir and o hagan 2014 kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015b the objectives of this study are therefore to investigate the value of the three different precipitation datasets commonly used in hydrological studies i e snp igp and rbp for flood prediction in an alpine catchment within a bayesian framework rather than focusing on designing the most optimal station network for hydrological implications we use available precipitation products as input to a runoff model and assess their usefulness for the purpose of understanding and predicting the hydrological process the novelty of our work lies first in describing the systematic model errors with an improved error model that represents both the precipitation uncertainty and the structural uncertainty of a runoff model with an additive bias term we demonstrate that such an error model improves the identification of the hydrological process since it provides reliable runoff predictions with all three datasets next by performing a bayesian comparative analysis we explore the information content of each precipitation dataset and its impact on runoff predictive uncertainty finally by using different period lengths for model calibration we quantitatively evaluate how much data of each source is needed to provide a sufficient model performance for ungauged regions 2 material 2 1 study site the plessur river located in the swiss alps canton graubünden is a 33km long tributary of the rhine river fig 1 and represents a typical alpine catchment the catchment area is about 263km2 and the altitude varies from 573m a s l outlet station in chur to 2867m a s l the annual mean temperature is 2 1 c and the average precipitation in this region is 1096mmyr 1 whereof approximately 30 occurs as snowfall the months with the most precipitation are june to august and it is estimated from long term analysis that approximately 30 of the annual precipitation is lost to evaporation consequently precipitation and snowmelt processes account for the majority of the flooding in this catchment sikorska et al 2015c with only four point precipitation gauges situated close enough to be used 1 5 stations per 100km2 the plessur catchment has an average station density for swiss catchments which is 1 47 stations per 100km2 viviroli et al 2011 out of these gauges two are situated in valleys and two on slopes 2 2 precipitation datasets to explore the value of precipitation data for the runoff prediction we generated three different precipitation time series for the first dataset snp an areal precipitation over the entire catchment was estimated in a classical way as a weighted sum of the precipitation rates measured at each of the four stations hellmann type gauges selected from the meteoswiss network as being located within the catchment precipitation range areal daily precipitation rates were estimated using the thiessen polygon method and related to the mean catchment elevation using a linear interpolation the second dataset igp was generated using not just these four point stations localized within the catchment but the entire network of ground stations in switzerland operated by meteoswiss with a total of between 430 and 460 precipitation gauges mostly hellmann type gauges the total daily precipitation sums were then computed for the whole of switzerland from all station measurements available for a particular day to ensure maximum possible effective resolution the spatial information on daily precipitation sums was acquired with advanced interpolation methods by means of a local weighted linear regression giving the effective resolution of a grid cell with sides of 4 5km frei et al 2006 wüest et al 2010 the third dataset rbp was extracted for the catchment using information from three c band meteorological weather radars located within switzerland albis la dôle and monte lema adjusted to precipitation rates with ground stations from the meteoswiss network giving the effective resolution of 2 2km2 daily precipitation rates were obtained as averaged from radar information sampled in 5min intervals and after applying a post process correction for bias due to among other issues restricted visibility in complex terrain joss and lee 1995 germann et al 2006 precipitation estimates from both datasets i e igp and rbp were then gridded to the catchment area unlike estimates from snp which were only interpolated over the catchment area all precipitation data were then averaged to catchment mean areal precipitation rates giving the required input into the runoff model 2 3 runoff model hbv runoff at the outlet from the plessur catchment was modeled with the semi distributed hbv model lindström et al 1997 in the version hbv light seibert 1997 seibert and vis 2012 in which averaged areal model inputs were modified for twelve elevation zones using a constant elevation dependent correction factor the model has 15 parameters in four routines i e snow soil moisture groundwater dynamics and runoff routing table 1 the snow accumulation and its melt are computed based on a degree day method using given inputs of precipitation and air temperature the latter also determines if observed precipitation falls as rain or snow the soil water content is computed from actual evaporation while groundwater recharge and drainage is calculated as a function of the actual water storage actual evaporation at each day was computed from long term daily potential evaporation corrected for daily temperature anomalies and soil moisture limitations using the deviations of the temperature at each day from its long term mean lindström and bergström 1992 groundwater flux into the stream is calculated from one soil and two groundwater boxes of which cumulative runoff is next transformed along the stream using a triangular weighting function to give the simulated runoff at the catchment outlet at a daily resolution see seibert and vis 2012 for more details on hbv light and model equations input variables are daily mean areal estimates of air temperature and precipitation and long term daily mean areal estimates of potential evaporation and temperature 3 methods 3 1 introduction to the bayesian framework in a classical deterministic calibration approach a vector with model parameters θ is seen as a constant quantity that is estimated from the observed data x according to the bayesian approach this vector is represented as a random variable θ where the distribution can be estimated from x during the bayesian inference gelman et al 2013 mathematically this leads to the conditional probability of θ given data x p θ x i e posterior distribution expressed as 1 p θ x p θ p x θ p θ p x θ d θ the bold font stands for a vector uppercase for a random variable and lowercase for a constant variable i e considered as such over the experiment to estimate the distribution p θ x prior knowledge on model parameters i e without considering observation data has to be formulated as a probability distribution p θ the transition from p θ to p θ x is only possible through a probability p x θ which is the likelihood function and it measures the likelihood that observation data x could have been generated using the model and the vector θ sampled from the distribution p θ thereby in a similar fashion to classical objective functions it measures the deviation between the observed data and the model simulation computed using this candidate parameter set gupta et al 1998 3 2 predicting runoff within a bayesian framework similarly runoff simulated with the runoff model and the parameter vector θ is represented as a random variable y which has a probability distribution p y this distribution describes the possible values of simulated runoff and their associated probabilities to make a statement about runoff y its marginal distribution p y has to be computed which in bayesian statistics is derived by marginalizing the joint distribution of y and parameters θ 2 p y p y θ p θ d θ in the above equation p y θ is the likelihood p θ represents the prior parameter distribution and p y describes the prior predictive distribution after considering observed data x the prior p θ is updated to the posterior p θ x eq 1 and the probability distribution p y becomes 3 p y x p y θ p θ x d θ p y x now describes the posterior predictive distribution of runoff i e prediction of runoff conditional on calibration data with the mode of p y x being the most probable prediction 3 3 identification of errors in runoff prediction p y x p y x in eq 3 is conditioned on calibration data x which for runoff models usually consist of observed precipitation as an input and observed runoff as an output i e x r o y o both observed quantities may be imprecise due to the presence of observation errors which however have different properties runoff represents an aggregated response to the catchment precipitation and can be measured at the catchment outlet only vaze et al 2011 thus errors in observing runoff y o are relatively well documented in the literature kuczera et al 2010 lorenz et al 2014 they are usually assumed as randomly distributed around zero mean which assumes a good quality measuring device not affected by systematic errors sikorska et al 2013 as opposed to runoff precipitation occurs spatially but is measured with a limited resolution only thus errors of observed precipitation r o are more complex and include random errors of measuring devices but also systematic errors inherent in translating measured quantities into a catchment areal precipitation vaze et al 2011 these errors affect both the accuracy in estimating r o and the calibration process biemans et al 2009 in addition to these two errors model predictions are subject to systematic structural errors of the runoff model caused by the model inability to perfectly reproduce observed variables y o with optimized parameters θ and to the uncertainty in estimated p θ x 3 4 acknowledging errors in runoff prediction stochastic runoff to explicitly take into consideration different errors described in section 3 3 we model them as an addition to the output of the runoff model y reichert and schuwirth 2012 as 4 y r θ ψ y r θ e r ψ in the above equation y r θ represents the output of the deterministic runoff model here hbv forced with a random parameter vector θ and input variable r fig 2 y r θ ψ represents the stochastic output of the runoff model i e resulting from the addition of the error term e r ψ to the deterministic output y r θ ψ describes a vector with parameters of the error model 3 5 additive error model e r ψ modeling the additive error term e r ψ in eq 4 requires that statistical assumptions on error properties are formulated the simplest and the most widely used description is the one following a gaussian process that assumes model errors as serially uncorrelated statistically independent and homoscedastic i i d which means that their variance is constant over time romanowicz et al 2006 although the runoff measurement error if measured directly can usually be assumed as i i d errors of runoff models are strongly autocorrelated and heteroscedastic i e their variance changes over time yang et al 2008 to account for these different error properties we use an improved additive error model reichert and schuwirth 2012 5 e r ψ b r ψ ψ b r ψ stands for the auto correlated error term i e model bias which lumps all model structural and input mostly precipitation uncertainties also due to the transition of water level into runoff although temperature data also used as model input are generally not free of errors we assumed following krzysztofowicz 1999 that errors of precipitation estimates are larger and represent the majority of the input uncertainty ψ represents a random error of measuring runoff modeled as a gaussian process with a zero mean and a standard deviation σ q which is a priori assumed as a typical error in a gauging station i e 10 of measured values kuczera et al 2010 we further represent the autocorrelated error term b r ψ as an ornstein uhlenbeck process uhlenbeck and ornstein 1930 using a gaussian markov error model see supplemental material such a correlated error process has two parameters a standard deviation of the bias σ b and a characteristic correlation length τ because these parameters cannot be precisely known beforehand we assume a prior following our experience from a previous study sikorska et al 2015a table 1 3 6 value of the precipitation data for runoff predictions bayesian analysis to assess the impact of imprecise precipitation information on runoff predictions we performed a comparative bayesian analysis in which the stochastic runoff model eq 4 was calibrated with three different precipitation datasets formally this led to three different parameter posteriors 6 p θ ψ x o j p θ ψ p x o θ ψ x o j where x o j illustrates a j th calibration dataset containing the j th precipitation dataset r o j and the observed runoff y o p x o θ ψ x o j is the likelihood and p θ ψ is the prior parameter distribution the likelihood the prior and y o were all the same in each calibration each j th posterior was next used to simulate the runoff eq 3 with the respective j th precipitation dataset giving three different simulation schemes fig 2 each time we used 2 3 of the available data length for model calibration excluding six months for a warm up period and the remaining 1 3 for its validation by a comparative analysis of the model performance in this independent period validation we judged the value of the three precipitation datasets for runoff predictions 3 7 informativeness of different precipitation datasets bayesian experiment to quantitatively explore the information content of the three precipitation datasets we performed a bayesian experiment with different lengths of calibration periods in which we gradually decreased the calibration period from the initial 2 3 of the available data length to a minimum length of one month of observations in this way we diagnosed how long the calibration period should be to ensure a sufficient model performance with each of the three precipitation datasets the validation period was kept the same as in the initial approach this led to a selection of an additional eight continuous calibration periods for each dataset with the data length varying between one and 48months for short calibration periods of a few months and less we always selected spring summer months to calibrate the model because the flow regime in the catchment is strongly dominated by peaks in this season as for a mountain catchment while only minor peaks are observed in the autumn winter season next the stochastic runoff model was calibrated independently with each of these calibration periods and the inferred posteriors were used for simulating the runoff as in section 3 6 to minimize incidental data effects we repeated the experiment three times for each of the data lengths and for each dataset each time selecting calibration periods from different years of observations given that the calibration length was shorter than the total observation length we also always used a six month warm up period prior to the selected calibration length the information content of the dataset was then assessed by comparing the averaged performance results obtained in the validation period 3 8 measures of the runoff prediction performance comparison of the model performance in the three calibration schemes section 3 6 was based on the uncertainty band reliability and the performance indicators the uncertainty bands were approximated by means of the monte carlo simulations and their reliability was assessed with two factors the uncertainty band width r abw and the data coverage r dc supplementary material the model performance was evaluated with four measures computed for the best model simulation i e nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error r mae and mean square error r mse which are all well accepted indicators in hydrology krause et al 2005 romanowicz et al 2013 the effect of calibration data length on the model performance section 3 7 was assessed with the r ns only which emphasizes the fit for high flows and is the main focus of this paper 3 9 setup of the bayesian inference the prior distribution on model parameters was the same for each calibration table 1 and for the hbv parameters was selected following previous studies seibert 1997 kuczera et al 2010 romanowicz et al 2013 the posterior was sampled randomly in each of the calibration schemes using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm gelman et al 2013 and the likelihood that combines a one parameter box cox output transformation box and cox 1982 using λ 0 35 with the additive error model from section 3 5 see appendix a 4 results 4 1 comparison of three precipitation inputs for the runoff model different methods of acquiring the precipitation inputs for the hbv light model led to differences in mean areal monthly precipitation rates estimated for the catchment fig 3 generally station network precipitation snp resulted in slightly higher estimates of monthly precipitation sums and at the same time the highest variances the lowest monthly precipitation sums and also the smallest variances were estimated with the radar based precipitation rbp the interpolated grid precipitation igp gave the monthly sums in the range between two others the strongest linear correlation was observed between the daily estimates from rbp and those of snp r 2 0 91 while the weakest between the igp and the estimates from snp r 2 0 79 4 2 model parametrization using different precipitation datasets using three different precipitation datasets to calibrate the hbv model resulted in different parameter values fig 4 although the probability density functions pdfs inferred from the observed data overlapped for most of the hbv parameters the posterior median and the density range were shifted depending on the input used for the calibration moreover the information incorporated from snp gave the widest pdfs for most parameters while pdfs for both other datasets i e igp and rbp were much narrower also the stochastic process identified was different for the three calibration schemes right column in fig 4 in particular the posterior median of the characteristic auto correlation time τ differed for the standard deviation of the model bias σ b the highest values were estimated when using precipitation inputs from both i e snp and rbp while the smallest value was inferred from the igp because the bias term here represents both the model structure error and the input uncertainty its interpretation is not straightforward and is discussed in section 5 in contrast to the autocorrelated process the random process was similarly identified in all three schemes with a congruous median of the standard deviation of the runoff error σ q 4 3 model performance in three calibration schemes introducing the model error in addition to the runoff model led to a very good model performance in the calibration in all three schemes assessed by all four performance metrics l1 in table 2 also the 95 uncertainty bands were very sharp but reliable because they covered about 95 of the calibration data points at the same time the best model simulation gave a very good fit to the observed data with the nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns 0 98 in all three calibration schemes as expected the uncertainty bands widened and the model performance decreased over the testing period for all calibration schemes l2 in table 2 and fig 5 for the calibration using snp as an input the 95 uncertainty bands were the widest among all schemes but covered only 85 4 of the validation points r ns estimated for the most probable simulation was also the smallest and equal to 0 674 for the dataset with igp the 95 uncertainty bands were narrower while the data coverage was higher 90 8 but still smaller than the theoretical 95 in this calibration scheme r ns was equal to 0 774 and thus was higher than the threshold 0 75 giving a very good model performance moriasi et al 2007 although the uncertainty bands were slightly wider in the calibration with rbp than in the one using igp they covered 94 4 of validation points and thus were the most reliable with r ns equal to 0 829 the model also performed the best in this scheme 4 4 effects of dataset length on model predictive capacity in three calibration schemes the numerical experiment with different lengths of calibration datasets showed that the data length did not have a significant impact on the model performance in the calibration period because r ns was always above the value of 0 75 yet the effect of the data length became visible in the testing period fig 6 very short periods of observations below 6months were not sufficient to provide a satisfying model performance because r ns 0 a good model performance r ns 0 65 was obtained with only 6months of calibration data for the schemes that used either igp or rbp data to achieve a similarly good model efficiency with snp data two times more observations i e 12months were required with 9months of igp or rbp it was possible to already achieve a very good model performance r ns 0 75 when using snp 24months of observations were needed further lengthening the calibration period did not significantly improve the model performance and r ns remained at a similar value or even slightly decreased 5 discussion our results showed that on average the station network precipitation snp provided higher monthly precipitation sums than the other two data sources moreover during the measured period we observed that snp usually overestimated small precipitation events and underestimated heavy events in comparison to the other two datasets this seems reasonable because events of small intensities are usually spread over a larger area which can overestimate the average areal estimates if all the catchment precipitation gauges detected precipitation but the precipitating cloud did not cover the entire catchment in contrast events of heavier intensities often occur locally and thus can be missed by sparse precipitation gauges especially in the mountains where most of the precipitation falls at higher altitudes these spatial patterns of precipitation are difficult to capture with a limited number of stations but may be better represented with radar based precipitation fields rbp or interpolated grid precipitation igp as our results showed this seems to be also true for mountainous catchments even if the variability of the precipitation fields with elevation is very large yet an absolute assessment of the accuracy of these three datasets is not possible because the real value of the catchment precipitation cannot be known hence only their relative value for the purpose of the hydrological process identification and of flood predictions can be assessed different precipitation datasets resulted in differences in the estimated model parameters which each however gave a congruously good model performance in the calibration period this finding shows that one optimal parameter set may indeed not exist for a given modeling problem given limitations of the model and data e g abebe et al 2010 beven and freer 2001 this further justifies the need to represent parameters as random variables instead of using a single set only and to adequately represent model errors as our study showed the latter is a necessary condition for obtaining reliable predictions in the validation period independently from the dataset used with respect to the parameters of the error model the same random errors were identified in all calibration schemes which is logical as the same runoff data and with the same measurement error were used in each scheme as opposed to the random error the systematic model error i e bias was parametrized differently in three schemes the bias term here represents both the structural error of the runoff model hbv and its input uncertainty i e mainly precipitation uncertainty the decomposition of these two components is not possible moreover the additive form of the model bias may partly compensate for limitations of runoff parameters in describing the hydrological process and vice versa parameters of the runoff model may also partly compensate for the bias parameters these interaction effects cannot be avoided when using the joint inference on all parameters i e runoff model and bias parameters as in this study although a possibility to independently infer runoff and bias parameters gives a post processor strategy i e when inference is undertaken in two or more consecutive stages it impairs reliability and interpretability of obtained estimates and thus is less appropriate in uncertainty analysis than the joint inference evin et al 2014 to minimize such a possible compensation effect between the runoff model and its bias within the joint inference it is recommended to use the informative prior on parameters of the bias as in our case and in this way to give the priority for the model over bias to describe the observations sikorska et al 2015a a precise interpretation of the bias and its inter comparison between different scenarios or studies is usually challenging because it does not have a direct physical meaning and is represented in the transformed space of model residuals yet in our study the same runoff model and the same runoff data were used each time while only precipitation data were varied hence the difference in the estimated biases with different precipitation datasets may be explained due to the different uncertainty of the input used following this explanation the largest bias was identified with snp data which further implies that this input was the most uncertain in our study as our study showed introducing the bias term improved the model performance independently of the precipitation dataset used during calibration the effect of the bias correction was strongly visible during the calibration period and gradually disappeared into the validation period the reason for this is that the bias corrects for errors using the information contained in observed data points as these are no longer available during the validation period the bias must be estimated from its properties identified in the calibration period i e its standard deviation σ b and its characteristic correlation length τ as the time difference elapsed from the last observation point becomes significantly higher than the correlation length eq a 2 in appendix a the effect of the bias correction vanishes which impairs the model fit and widens uncertainty bands see also sikorska et al 2015a consequently it is logical that the largest bias identified for snp was also followed by the largest predictive uncertainty and the worst model performance observed during the independent period even though the model performance obtained in this calibration scheme with the uncertainty band coverage r dc 85 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns 0 674 was still satisfactory this finding suggests that although snp were generally the most uncertain introducing the statistical bias description into the runoff model allowed this uncertainty to be represented in a structural way and thus helped to improve the model performance as our results indicated this performance could be further improved using igp r dc 90 8 and r ns 0 774 and rbp r dc 94 4 and r ns 0 829 these metrics suggest that igp and rbp were more informative in describing the precipitation runoff process in the catchment than the snp data this finding was also supported with the bayesian experiment in which we varied the length of the calibration periods generally both igp and rbp data contained more information to inform model parameters as seen by the result that the length of the calibration period required to obtain an efficient model performance i e r ns 0 65 was two times shorter than in the scheme that used the snp data however on the one hand very short periods of observations below six months were not sufficient to inform model parameters in any of the calibration schemes these observations showed that such short periods may be too short to explore catchment patterns as data are more susceptible to random effects observed during such periods this also explains the drop in the model performance observed for three month calibration periods on the other hand as our results showed the improvement in model performance with a lengthening dataset was noticeable only to a certain point and after this no improvement was found this effect can be explained by the presence of the epistemic and the aleatory uncertainty while the former occurs due the lack of knowledge about the system and can be reduced with more information and more data the latter is inherent in the stochasticity of the hydrological process and thus cannot be reduced with more data kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015b therefore a trade off in the data length and the gain of information should be sought for each modeling problem independently in this context our work provides a practical guideline on how such a trade off can be made by means of the bayesian approach results of our quantitative analysis could be of interest when planning short measuring precipitation runoff campaigns in ungauged catchments by providing indications on how much data and of which source is required for a sufficient model performance this information may also support decision making when different values such as data source data length and costs of their acquisition have to be addressed in a structural way moreover our approach is not limited to the precipitation datasets used in this study and other sources of precipitation data such as more advanced interpolation methods such as geostatistic kriging rakovec et al 2012 or satellite data could also be used finally it is worth noting that our work presents a general framework for assessing the value of the precipitation data and could easily be applied using a different hydrological model different error model as well as other precipitation data although the exact value of the different precipitation datasets is linked to the local catchment conditions we argue that our general results could be transferred to other catchments with similar characteristics i e located in a mountain terrain or having similar precipitation gauge coverage as point gauges are usually located in valleys the value of snp data for a mountainous catchment will likely not increase significantly when more precipitation gauges become available in contrast in a lowland catchment with numerous precipitation gauges snp could potentially have a higher value than the other two datasets moreover even if determined to be the most uncertain precipitation gauges contain valuable information for correcting radar estimates and also remain the only long term source of observing precipitation patterns thus rather than neglecting precipitation gauges it is important to recognize that the other two data sets are based on station data thus our results rather show the value of more advanced methods to derive areal precipitation for flood prediction purposes than decline the usefulness of station data which due to aforementioned reasons cannot be abandoned 6 conclusions in this work we investigated the value of the three commonly used precipitation datasets i e station network precipitation snp interpolated grid precipitation igp and radar based precipitation rbp for flood predictions in a mountainous catchment to quantify their value we performed a bayesian analysis while using an improved error model to represent systematic errors in runoff predictions our results showed that first introducing an additive error model generally improved the runoff predictions because in all three calibration schemes we obtained reliable uncertainty bands and a good model performance in the validation with the nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns higher than 0 65 second among all three precipitation datasets snp was the most uncertain which resulted in the largest uncertainty in model predictions and the poorest model performance but still good while rbp provided the most reliable uncertainty bands and the best model performance third we found that igp and rbp were much more informative than snp data as seen by the result that half as many calibration data points were required to obtain a good model performance our quantitative results can support planning short measurement campaigns in ungauged regions when different values such as type of precipitation data length of measuring campaign and costs of measuring or acquiring

7599,flooding induced by heavy precipitation is one of the most severe natural hazards in alpine catchments to accurately predict such events accurate and representative precipitation data are required estimating catchment precipitation is however difficult due to its high spatial and in the mountains elevation dependent variability these inaccuracies together with runoff model limitations translate into uncertainty in runoff estimates thus in this study we investigate the value of three precipitation datasets commonly used in hydrological studies i e station network precipitation snp interpolated grid precipitation igp and radar based precipitation rbp for flood predictions in an alpine catchment to quantify their effects on runoff simulations we perform a bayesian uncertainty analysis with an improved description of model systematic errors by using periods of different lengths for model calibration we explore the information content of these three datasets for runoff predictions our results from an alpine catchment showed that using snp resulted in the largest predictive uncertainty and the lowest model performance evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency this performance improved from 0 674 to 0 774 with igp and to 0 829 with rbp the latter two datasets were also much more informative than snp as half as many calibration data points were required to obtain a good model performance thus our results show that the various types of precipitation data differ in their value for flood predictions in an alpine catchment and indicate rbp as the most useful dataset keywords precipitation uncertainty station network precipitation interpolated grid precipitation radar based precipitation flood prediction bayesian approach 1 introduction flooding induced by heavy precipitation is one of the most severe natural hazards in switzerland hilker et al 2009 massacand et al 1998 hohenegger et al 2008 stucki et al 2012 and is likely to increase due to more frequent heavy precipitation events foreseen in the alps beniston et al 2011 to accurately predict this type of flood event an accurate estimation of the causative precipitation is crucial masih et al 2011 strauch et al 2012 voisin et al 2008 yet while runoff represents an aggregated response to the catchment s precipitation and as such can be measured at its outlet only vaze et al 2011 precipitation is a spatially heterogeneous phenomenon and thus measuring its representative values at a catchment scale is not trivial aghakouchak et al 2011 krajewski et al 2003 mcmillan et al 2012 villarini et al 2008 observations from point gauges i e station network precipitation snp remain the most common method for measuring catchment precipitation aghakouchak et al 2010 berne et al 2005 lorenz et al 2014 volkmann et al 2010 the main reasons for this are a relatively high accuracy of precipitation rates at their respective locations brown et al 2001 brussolo et al 2008 the extended recording period suitable for analyzing long term precipitation runoff patterns xie et al 2007 and relatively low costs of a gauge purchase and maintenance sikorska et al 2012 when used as input for runoff models such point precipitation measurements must be aggregated to a catchment wide areal precipitation ly et al 2013 rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 and for ungauged regions a simple interpolation between point estimates is usually made girons lopez et al 2015 inaccuracies in estimating a catchment s precipitation when introduced into the runoff model will translate into large uncertainty in model simulations kavetski et al 2006 mul et al 2009 oudin et al 2006 thus snp data may sometimes be insufficient to model a catchment s response bárdossy and das 2008 mcmillan et al 2011 segond et al 2007 and in some catchments might not result in a satisfying model performance kuczera et al 2010 this is especially true for poorly gauged regions sikorska et al 2012 and for mountainous catchments where due to a complex terrain additional errors in estimating catchment precipitation need to be considered joss and lee 1995 these errors include wind and shading effects from slopes frei et al 2006 biased locations of stations mostly limited to valleys while precipitation rates increase with elevation viviroli et al 2011 xie et al 2007 and locally placed events with or without orographic influence induced by the natural mountainous barrier to capture such spatial and elevation dependent precipitation fields a finer spatial measuring resolution and covering different elevation zones would be required ly et al 2013 hence it has been proposed to smooth the precipitation rates across the terrain by using a number of point measurements from an extended area frei et al 2006 vaze et al 2011 these point measurements are interpolated and next aggregated into gridded cells of homogeneous precipitation rates giving interpolated grid precipitation igp yet the problem with a limited representation at high elevations remains as an alternative to point gauges meteorological weather radars can immediately provide information on spatial precipitation at a large scale and also at high elevations andrieu et al 1997 berne and krajewski 2013 borga 2002 kidd et al 2012 krajewski and smith 2002 thus some research has been devoted to assessing the usefulness of such radar based precipitation rbp for hydrological purposes e g abon et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2010 borga 2002 collier 1986 hazenberg et al 2011 hossain et al 2004 yet due to the need to transform radar attenuation measurements into ground precipitation rates disturbances in the beam attenuation and in mountains also beam shielding collier 1989 hossain et al 2004 joss and lee 1995 viviroli et al 2011 limited spatial resolution germann et al 2006 wilson and brandes 1979 and high costs of data purchase their practical value for hydrological purposes in small and medium size catchments has been questioned lanza et al 2001 tetzlaff and uhlenbrook 2005 given the above issues it remains unclear which dataset among the three mentioned is the most informative for understanding hydrological response and predicting flood events in a mountainous catchment given a limited number of observations for model calibration while several studies have focused on designing the most optimal station network for hydrological needs chen et al 2008 jung et al 2014 villarini et al 2008 volkmann et al 2010 wood et al 2000 a comparison of radar and point gauge estimates at a catchment scale has gained continual attention since the 1980s e g andrieu et al 1997 biggs and atkinson 2011 borga et al 2000 collier 1986 hossain et al 2004 piman and babel 2013 more recently effects of precipitation uncertainty on runoff predictions have been studied within different uncertainty frameworks for lowland and urbanized catchments andreassian et al 2001 bárdossy and das 2008 biemans et al 2009 mcmillan et al 2011 younger et al 2009 yet similar analysis of mountainous catchments are much more restricted masih et al 2011 and limited to assessing the parameter uncertainty usually using a glue approach generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation e g collier 2009 hossain et al 2004 however uncertainty in precipitation data together with structural limitations of a runoff model result in systematic errors in runoff predictions and thus cannot be explained by the parametric uncertainty alone kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015a for climate related studies these precipitation errors are dealt with by applying a bias correction to precipitation estimates addor and seibert 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2012 for uncertainty analysis of runoff predictions these errors must be described explicitly or implicitly adequately with respect to their properties brynjarsdóttir and o hagan 2014 kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015b the objectives of this study are therefore to investigate the value of the three different precipitation datasets commonly used in hydrological studies i e snp igp and rbp for flood prediction in an alpine catchment within a bayesian framework rather than focusing on designing the most optimal station network for hydrological implications we use available precipitation products as input to a runoff model and assess their usefulness for the purpose of understanding and predicting the hydrological process the novelty of our work lies first in describing the systematic model errors with an improved error model that represents both the precipitation uncertainty and the structural uncertainty of a runoff model with an additive bias term we demonstrate that such an error model improves the identification of the hydrological process since it provides reliable runoff predictions with all three datasets next by performing a bayesian comparative analysis we explore the information content of each precipitation dataset and its impact on runoff predictive uncertainty finally by using different period lengths for model calibration we quantitatively evaluate how much data of each source is needed to provide a sufficient model performance for ungauged regions 2 material 2 1 study site the plessur river located in the swiss alps canton graubünden is a 33km long tributary of the rhine river fig 1 and represents a typical alpine catchment the catchment area is about 263km2 and the altitude varies from 573m a s l outlet station in chur to 2867m a s l the annual mean temperature is 2 1 c and the average precipitation in this region is 1096mmyr 1 whereof approximately 30 occurs as snowfall the months with the most precipitation are june to august and it is estimated from long term analysis that approximately 30 of the annual precipitation is lost to evaporation consequently precipitation and snowmelt processes account for the majority of the flooding in this catchment sikorska et al 2015c with only four point precipitation gauges situated close enough to be used 1 5 stations per 100km2 the plessur catchment has an average station density for swiss catchments which is 1 47 stations per 100km2 viviroli et al 2011 out of these gauges two are situated in valleys and two on slopes 2 2 precipitation datasets to explore the value of precipitation data for the runoff prediction we generated three different precipitation time series for the first dataset snp an areal precipitation over the entire catchment was estimated in a classical way as a weighted sum of the precipitation rates measured at each of the four stations hellmann type gauges selected from the meteoswiss network as being located within the catchment precipitation range areal daily precipitation rates were estimated using the thiessen polygon method and related to the mean catchment elevation using a linear interpolation the second dataset igp was generated using not just these four point stations localized within the catchment but the entire network of ground stations in switzerland operated by meteoswiss with a total of between 430 and 460 precipitation gauges mostly hellmann type gauges the total daily precipitation sums were then computed for the whole of switzerland from all station measurements available for a particular day to ensure maximum possible effective resolution the spatial information on daily precipitation sums was acquired with advanced interpolation methods by means of a local weighted linear regression giving the effective resolution of a grid cell with sides of 4 5km frei et al 2006 wüest et al 2010 the third dataset rbp was extracted for the catchment using information from three c band meteorological weather radars located within switzerland albis la dôle and monte lema adjusted to precipitation rates with ground stations from the meteoswiss network giving the effective resolution of 2 2km2 daily precipitation rates were obtained as averaged from radar information sampled in 5min intervals and after applying a post process correction for bias due to among other issues restricted visibility in complex terrain joss and lee 1995 germann et al 2006 precipitation estimates from both datasets i e igp and rbp were then gridded to the catchment area unlike estimates from snp which were only interpolated over the catchment area all precipitation data were then averaged to catchment mean areal precipitation rates giving the required input into the runoff model 2 3 runoff model hbv runoff at the outlet from the plessur catchment was modeled with the semi distributed hbv model lindström et al 1997 in the version hbv light seibert 1997 seibert and vis 2012 in which averaged areal model inputs were modified for twelve elevation zones using a constant elevation dependent correction factor the model has 15 parameters in four routines i e snow soil moisture groundwater dynamics and runoff routing table 1 the snow accumulation and its melt are computed based on a degree day method using given inputs of precipitation and air temperature the latter also determines if observed precipitation falls as rain or snow the soil water content is computed from actual evaporation while groundwater recharge and drainage is calculated as a function of the actual water storage actual evaporation at each day was computed from long term daily potential evaporation corrected for daily temperature anomalies and soil moisture limitations using the deviations of the temperature at each day from its long term mean lindström and bergström 1992 groundwater flux into the stream is calculated from one soil and two groundwater boxes of which cumulative runoff is next transformed along the stream using a triangular weighting function to give the simulated runoff at the catchment outlet at a daily resolution see seibert and vis 2012 for more details on hbv light and model equations input variables are daily mean areal estimates of air temperature and precipitation and long term daily mean areal estimates of potential evaporation and temperature 3 methods 3 1 introduction to the bayesian framework in a classical deterministic calibration approach a vector with model parameters θ is seen as a constant quantity that is estimated from the observed data x according to the bayesian approach this vector is represented as a random variable θ where the distribution can be estimated from x during the bayesian inference gelman et al 2013 mathematically this leads to the conditional probability of θ given data x p θ x i e posterior distribution expressed as 1 p θ x p θ p x θ p θ p x θ d θ the bold font stands for a vector uppercase for a random variable and lowercase for a constant variable i e considered as such over the experiment to estimate the distribution p θ x prior knowledge on model parameters i e without considering observation data has to be formulated as a probability distribution p θ the transition from p θ to p θ x is only possible through a probability p x θ which is the likelihood function and it measures the likelihood that observation data x could have been generated using the model and the vector θ sampled from the distribution p θ thereby in a similar fashion to classical objective functions it measures the deviation between the observed data and the model simulation computed using this candidate parameter set gupta et al 1998 3 2 predicting runoff within a bayesian framework similarly runoff simulated with the runoff model and the parameter vector θ is represented as a random variable y which has a probability distribution p y this distribution describes the possible values of simulated runoff and their associated probabilities to make a statement about runoff y its marginal distribution p y has to be computed which in bayesian statistics is derived by marginalizing the joint distribution of y and parameters θ 2 p y p y θ p θ d θ in the above equation p y θ is the likelihood p θ represents the prior parameter distribution and p y describes the prior predictive distribution after considering observed data x the prior p θ is updated to the posterior p θ x eq 1 and the probability distribution p y becomes 3 p y x p y θ p θ x d θ p y x now describes the posterior predictive distribution of runoff i e prediction of runoff conditional on calibration data with the mode of p y x being the most probable prediction 3 3 identification of errors in runoff prediction p y x p y x in eq 3 is conditioned on calibration data x which for runoff models usually consist of observed precipitation as an input and observed runoff as an output i e x r o y o both observed quantities may be imprecise due to the presence of observation errors which however have different properties runoff represents an aggregated response to the catchment precipitation and can be measured at the catchment outlet only vaze et al 2011 thus errors in observing runoff y o are relatively well documented in the literature kuczera et al 2010 lorenz et al 2014 they are usually assumed as randomly distributed around zero mean which assumes a good quality measuring device not affected by systematic errors sikorska et al 2013 as opposed to runoff precipitation occurs spatially but is measured with a limited resolution only thus errors of observed precipitation r o are more complex and include random errors of measuring devices but also systematic errors inherent in translating measured quantities into a catchment areal precipitation vaze et al 2011 these errors affect both the accuracy in estimating r o and the calibration process biemans et al 2009 in addition to these two errors model predictions are subject to systematic structural errors of the runoff model caused by the model inability to perfectly reproduce observed variables y o with optimized parameters θ and to the uncertainty in estimated p θ x 3 4 acknowledging errors in runoff prediction stochastic runoff to explicitly take into consideration different errors described in section 3 3 we model them as an addition to the output of the runoff model y reichert and schuwirth 2012 as 4 y r θ ψ y r θ e r ψ in the above equation y r θ represents the output of the deterministic runoff model here hbv forced with a random parameter vector θ and input variable r fig 2 y r θ ψ represents the stochastic output of the runoff model i e resulting from the addition of the error term e r ψ to the deterministic output y r θ ψ describes a vector with parameters of the error model 3 5 additive error model e r ψ modeling the additive error term e r ψ in eq 4 requires that statistical assumptions on error properties are formulated the simplest and the most widely used description is the one following a gaussian process that assumes model errors as serially uncorrelated statistically independent and homoscedastic i i d which means that their variance is constant over time romanowicz et al 2006 although the runoff measurement error if measured directly can usually be assumed as i i d errors of runoff models are strongly autocorrelated and heteroscedastic i e their variance changes over time yang et al 2008 to account for these different error properties we use an improved additive error model reichert and schuwirth 2012 5 e r ψ b r ψ ψ b r ψ stands for the auto correlated error term i e model bias which lumps all model structural and input mostly precipitation uncertainties also due to the transition of water level into runoff although temperature data also used as model input are generally not free of errors we assumed following krzysztofowicz 1999 that errors of precipitation estimates are larger and represent the majority of the input uncertainty ψ represents a random error of measuring runoff modeled as a gaussian process with a zero mean and a standard deviation σ q which is a priori assumed as a typical error in a gauging station i e 10 of measured values kuczera et al 2010 we further represent the autocorrelated error term b r ψ as an ornstein uhlenbeck process uhlenbeck and ornstein 1930 using a gaussian markov error model see supplemental material such a correlated error process has two parameters a standard deviation of the bias σ b and a characteristic correlation length τ because these parameters cannot be precisely known beforehand we assume a prior following our experience from a previous study sikorska et al 2015a table 1 3 6 value of the precipitation data for runoff predictions bayesian analysis to assess the impact of imprecise precipitation information on runoff predictions we performed a comparative bayesian analysis in which the stochastic runoff model eq 4 was calibrated with three different precipitation datasets formally this led to three different parameter posteriors 6 p θ ψ x o j p θ ψ p x o θ ψ x o j where x o j illustrates a j th calibration dataset containing the j th precipitation dataset r o j and the observed runoff y o p x o θ ψ x o j is the likelihood and p θ ψ is the prior parameter distribution the likelihood the prior and y o were all the same in each calibration each j th posterior was next used to simulate the runoff eq 3 with the respective j th precipitation dataset giving three different simulation schemes fig 2 each time we used 2 3 of the available data length for model calibration excluding six months for a warm up period and the remaining 1 3 for its validation by a comparative analysis of the model performance in this independent period validation we judged the value of the three precipitation datasets for runoff predictions 3 7 informativeness of different precipitation datasets bayesian experiment to quantitatively explore the information content of the three precipitation datasets we performed a bayesian experiment with different lengths of calibration periods in which we gradually decreased the calibration period from the initial 2 3 of the available data length to a minimum length of one month of observations in this way we diagnosed how long the calibration period should be to ensure a sufficient model performance with each of the three precipitation datasets the validation period was kept the same as in the initial approach this led to a selection of an additional eight continuous calibration periods for each dataset with the data length varying between one and 48months for short calibration periods of a few months and less we always selected spring summer months to calibrate the model because the flow regime in the catchment is strongly dominated by peaks in this season as for a mountain catchment while only minor peaks are observed in the autumn winter season next the stochastic runoff model was calibrated independently with each of these calibration periods and the inferred posteriors were used for simulating the runoff as in section 3 6 to minimize incidental data effects we repeated the experiment three times for each of the data lengths and for each dataset each time selecting calibration periods from different years of observations given that the calibration length was shorter than the total observation length we also always used a six month warm up period prior to the selected calibration length the information content of the dataset was then assessed by comparing the averaged performance results obtained in the validation period 3 8 measures of the runoff prediction performance comparison of the model performance in the three calibration schemes section 3 6 was based on the uncertainty band reliability and the performance indicators the uncertainty bands were approximated by means of the monte carlo simulations and their reliability was assessed with two factors the uncertainty band width r abw and the data coverage r dc supplementary material the model performance was evaluated with four measures computed for the best model simulation i e nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error r mae and mean square error r mse which are all well accepted indicators in hydrology krause et al 2005 romanowicz et al 2013 the effect of calibration data length on the model performance section 3 7 was assessed with the r ns only which emphasizes the fit for high flows and is the main focus of this paper 3 9 setup of the bayesian inference the prior distribution on model parameters was the same for each calibration table 1 and for the hbv parameters was selected following previous studies seibert 1997 kuczera et al 2010 romanowicz et al 2013 the posterior was sampled randomly in each of the calibration schemes using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm gelman et al 2013 and the likelihood that combines a one parameter box cox output transformation box and cox 1982 using λ 0 35 with the additive error model from section 3 5 see appendix a 4 results 4 1 comparison of three precipitation inputs for the runoff model different methods of acquiring the precipitation inputs for the hbv light model led to differences in mean areal monthly precipitation rates estimated for the catchment fig 3 generally station network precipitation snp resulted in slightly higher estimates of monthly precipitation sums and at the same time the highest variances the lowest monthly precipitation sums and also the smallest variances were estimated with the radar based precipitation rbp the interpolated grid precipitation igp gave the monthly sums in the range between two others the strongest linear correlation was observed between the daily estimates from rbp and those of snp r 2 0 91 while the weakest between the igp and the estimates from snp r 2 0 79 4 2 model parametrization using different precipitation datasets using three different precipitation datasets to calibrate the hbv model resulted in different parameter values fig 4 although the probability density functions pdfs inferred from the observed data overlapped for most of the hbv parameters the posterior median and the density range were shifted depending on the input used for the calibration moreover the information incorporated from snp gave the widest pdfs for most parameters while pdfs for both other datasets i e igp and rbp were much narrower also the stochastic process identified was different for the three calibration schemes right column in fig 4 in particular the posterior median of the characteristic auto correlation time τ differed for the standard deviation of the model bias σ b the highest values were estimated when using precipitation inputs from both i e snp and rbp while the smallest value was inferred from the igp because the bias term here represents both the model structure error and the input uncertainty its interpretation is not straightforward and is discussed in section 5 in contrast to the autocorrelated process the random process was similarly identified in all three schemes with a congruous median of the standard deviation of the runoff error σ q 4 3 model performance in three calibration schemes introducing the model error in addition to the runoff model led to a very good model performance in the calibration in all three schemes assessed by all four performance metrics l1 in table 2 also the 95 uncertainty bands were very sharp but reliable because they covered about 95 of the calibration data points at the same time the best model simulation gave a very good fit to the observed data with the nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns 0 98 in all three calibration schemes as expected the uncertainty bands widened and the model performance decreased over the testing period for all calibration schemes l2 in table 2 and fig 5 for the calibration using snp as an input the 95 uncertainty bands were the widest among all schemes but covered only 85 4 of the validation points r ns estimated for the most probable simulation was also the smallest and equal to 0 674 for the dataset with igp the 95 uncertainty bands were narrower while the data coverage was higher 90 8 but still smaller than the theoretical 95 in this calibration scheme r ns was equal to 0 774 and thus was higher than the threshold 0 75 giving a very good model performance moriasi et al 2007 although the uncertainty bands were slightly wider in the calibration with rbp than in the one using igp they covered 94 4 of validation points and thus were the most reliable with r ns equal to 0 829 the model also performed the best in this scheme 4 4 effects of dataset length on model predictive capacity in three calibration schemes the numerical experiment with different lengths of calibration datasets showed that the data length did not have a significant impact on the model performance in the calibration period because r ns was always above the value of 0 75 yet the effect of the data length became visible in the testing period fig 6 very short periods of observations below 6months were not sufficient to provide a satisfying model performance because r ns 0 a good model performance r ns 0 65 was obtained with only 6months of calibration data for the schemes that used either igp or rbp data to achieve a similarly good model efficiency with snp data two times more observations i e 12months were required with 9months of igp or rbp it was possible to already achieve a very good model performance r ns 0 75 when using snp 24months of observations were needed further lengthening the calibration period did not significantly improve the model performance and r ns remained at a similar value or even slightly decreased 5 discussion our results showed that on average the station network precipitation snp provided higher monthly precipitation sums than the other two data sources moreover during the measured period we observed that snp usually overestimated small precipitation events and underestimated heavy events in comparison to the other two datasets this seems reasonable because events of small intensities are usually spread over a larger area which can overestimate the average areal estimates if all the catchment precipitation gauges detected precipitation but the precipitating cloud did not cover the entire catchment in contrast events of heavier intensities often occur locally and thus can be missed by sparse precipitation gauges especially in the mountains where most of the precipitation falls at higher altitudes these spatial patterns of precipitation are difficult to capture with a limited number of stations but may be better represented with radar based precipitation fields rbp or interpolated grid precipitation igp as our results showed this seems to be also true for mountainous catchments even if the variability of the precipitation fields with elevation is very large yet an absolute assessment of the accuracy of these three datasets is not possible because the real value of the catchment precipitation cannot be known hence only their relative value for the purpose of the hydrological process identification and of flood predictions can be assessed different precipitation datasets resulted in differences in the estimated model parameters which each however gave a congruously good model performance in the calibration period this finding shows that one optimal parameter set may indeed not exist for a given modeling problem given limitations of the model and data e g abebe et al 2010 beven and freer 2001 this further justifies the need to represent parameters as random variables instead of using a single set only and to adequately represent model errors as our study showed the latter is a necessary condition for obtaining reliable predictions in the validation period independently from the dataset used with respect to the parameters of the error model the same random errors were identified in all calibration schemes which is logical as the same runoff data and with the same measurement error were used in each scheme as opposed to the random error the systematic model error i e bias was parametrized differently in three schemes the bias term here represents both the structural error of the runoff model hbv and its input uncertainty i e mainly precipitation uncertainty the decomposition of these two components is not possible moreover the additive form of the model bias may partly compensate for limitations of runoff parameters in describing the hydrological process and vice versa parameters of the runoff model may also partly compensate for the bias parameters these interaction effects cannot be avoided when using the joint inference on all parameters i e runoff model and bias parameters as in this study although a possibility to independently infer runoff and bias parameters gives a post processor strategy i e when inference is undertaken in two or more consecutive stages it impairs reliability and interpretability of obtained estimates and thus is less appropriate in uncertainty analysis than the joint inference evin et al 2014 to minimize such a possible compensation effect between the runoff model and its bias within the joint inference it is recommended to use the informative prior on parameters of the bias as in our case and in this way to give the priority for the model over bias to describe the observations sikorska et al 2015a a precise interpretation of the bias and its inter comparison between different scenarios or studies is usually challenging because it does not have a direct physical meaning and is represented in the transformed space of model residuals yet in our study the same runoff model and the same runoff data were used each time while only precipitation data were varied hence the difference in the estimated biases with different precipitation datasets may be explained due to the different uncertainty of the input used following this explanation the largest bias was identified with snp data which further implies that this input was the most uncertain in our study as our study showed introducing the bias term improved the model performance independently of the precipitation dataset used during calibration the effect of the bias correction was strongly visible during the calibration period and gradually disappeared into the validation period the reason for this is that the bias corrects for errors using the information contained in observed data points as these are no longer available during the validation period the bias must be estimated from its properties identified in the calibration period i e its standard deviation σ b and its characteristic correlation length τ as the time difference elapsed from the last observation point becomes significantly higher than the correlation length eq a 2 in appendix a the effect of the bias correction vanishes which impairs the model fit and widens uncertainty bands see also sikorska et al 2015a consequently it is logical that the largest bias identified for snp was also followed by the largest predictive uncertainty and the worst model performance observed during the independent period even though the model performance obtained in this calibration scheme with the uncertainty band coverage r dc 85 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns 0 674 was still satisfactory this finding suggests that although snp were generally the most uncertain introducing the statistical bias description into the runoff model allowed this uncertainty to be represented in a structural way and thus helped to improve the model performance as our results indicated this performance could be further improved using igp r dc 90 8 and r ns 0 774 and rbp r dc 94 4 and r ns 0 829 these metrics suggest that igp and rbp were more informative in describing the precipitation runoff process in the catchment than the snp data this finding was also supported with the bayesian experiment in which we varied the length of the calibration periods generally both igp and rbp data contained more information to inform model parameters as seen by the result that the length of the calibration period required to obtain an efficient model performance i e r ns 0 65 was two times shorter than in the scheme that used the snp data however on the one hand very short periods of observations below six months were not sufficient to inform model parameters in any of the calibration schemes these observations showed that such short periods may be too short to explore catchment patterns as data are more susceptible to random effects observed during such periods this also explains the drop in the model performance observed for three month calibration periods on the other hand as our results showed the improvement in model performance with a lengthening dataset was noticeable only to a certain point and after this no improvement was found this effect can be explained by the presence of the epistemic and the aleatory uncertainty while the former occurs due the lack of knowledge about the system and can be reduced with more information and more data the latter is inherent in the stochasticity of the hydrological process and thus cannot be reduced with more data kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015b therefore a trade off in the data length and the gain of information should be sought for each modeling problem independently in this context our work provides a practical guideline on how such a trade off can be made by means of the bayesian approach results of our quantitative analysis could be of interest when planning short measuring precipitation runoff campaigns in ungauged catchments by providing indications on how much data and of which source is required for a sufficient model performance this information may also support decision making when different values such as data source data length and costs of their acquisition have to be addressed in a structural way moreover our approach is not limited to the precipitation datasets used in this study and other sources of precipitation data such as more advanced interpolation methods such as geostatistic kriging rakovec et al 2012 or satellite data could also be used finally it is worth noting that our work presents a general framework for assessing the value of the precipitation data and could easily be applied using a different hydrological model different error model as well as other precipitation data although the exact value of the different precipitation datasets is linked to the local catchment conditions we argue that our general results could be transferred to other catchments with similar characteristics i e located in a mountain terrain or having similar precipitation gauge coverage as point gauges are usually located in valleys the value of snp data for a mountainous catchment will likely not increase significantly when more precipitation gauges become available in contrast in a lowland catchment with numerous precipitation gauges snp could potentially have a higher value than the other two datasets moreover even if determined to be the most uncertain precipitation gauges contain valuable information for correcting radar estimates and also remain the only long term source of observing precipitation patterns thus rather than neglecting precipitation gauges it is important to recognize that the other two data sets are based on station data thus our results rather show the value of more advanced methods to derive areal precipitation for flood prediction purposes than decline the usefulness of station data which due to aforementioned reasons cannot be abandoned 6 conclusions in this work we investigated the value of the three commonly used precipitation datasets i e station network precipitation snp interpolated grid precipitation igp and radar based precipitation rbp for flood predictions in a mountainous catchment to quantify their value we performed a bayesian analysis while using an improved error model to represent systematic errors in runoff predictions our results showed that first introducing an additive error model generally improved the runoff predictions because in all three calibration schemes we obtained reliable uncertainty bands and a good model performance in the validation with the nash sutcliffe efficiency r ns higher than 0 65 second among all three precipitation datasets snp was the most uncertain which resulted in the largest uncertainty in model predictions and the poorest model performance but still good while rbp provided the most reliable uncertainty bands and the best model performance third we found that igp and rbp were much more informative than snp data as seen by the result that half as many calibration data points were required to obtain a good model performance our quantitative results can support planning short measurement campaigns in ungauged regions when different values such as type of precipitation data length of measuring campaign and costs of measuring or acquiring
