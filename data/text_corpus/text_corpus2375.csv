11875,groundwater gw plays a vital role in the socio economic growth of kabul river basin krb in afghanistan since the gw resources in the basin have not been properly managed there is a need for sound strategies by first identifying the potential gw zones this study assesses the potential groundwater zones for the krb using the geographic information systems gis and the analytic hierarchy process ahp in this direction seven different thematic maps of rainfall lithology land use land cover slope soil drainage density and lineament density are first prepared using the gis the ahp is then employed to assess the weights of different themes finally the weighted overlay option in the gis is used to generate the map of the groundwater potential zones gwpz the very good zones are mostly located in the downstream and central parts of the krb covering around 1543 km2 area the good and the poor zones are found to be randomly distributed covering about 39 444 km2 and 27 658 km2 respectively the very poor zones are located in the west southwest and in some central parts of the basin covering about 2272 km2 it is found that only 18 of the total average annual precipitated water of 6 88 109 m3 year infiltrates into the subsurface and ultimately contributes to recharging of the groundwater keywords groundwater potential zones kabul river basin gis analytic hierarchy process recharge 1 introduction afghanistan located in the aridity region has water resources mainly from the high mountain series about 80 of the water emanates from hindu kush mountains at an altitude of 2000 m qureshi 2002 these mountains possess inherent storage of water in the form of snow during the winter season and snowmelt during the summer season promoting the perpetual flow of water in all rivers in all seasons the country s climatic conditions range from arid to semi arid receiving irregular rainfall over the years the rainfall ranges from 75 mm farah to 1170 mm south slang with heavy rainfalls during the winter months favre and kamal 2004 of the total amount of runoff just 15 of afghanistan s overall precipitation contributes to the country s groundwater recharge aini 2007 traditional underground systems such as the karezes qanats the springs and the shallow wells locally called as arhads have been widely used in the country for the purposes of irrigation and domestic uses around 15 of afghanistan s irrigated land receives water from these underground systems it is estimated that all the traditional groundwater irrigation schemes have been reduced or dried up entirely with approximately 60 70 of the karezes being unused and 85 shallow wells being dry qureshi 2002 people who rely on these systems have been terribly suffering from the failures or reduced discharges of these systems the key causes of the low discharge are the low rainfall and as a result low groundwater recharge in addition the boring of deep wells near the karezes and the shallow wells have adversely impacted the production of these conventional irrigation systems the shallow wells are used in the most metropolitan regions to provide water for the drinking and other domestic uses the water levels drop by around 0 5 3 m every month depending on the region qureshi 2002 many of these wells are now dry and individuals often women and children are forced to walk miles to meet their everyday water needs renewable water resources per capita of afghanistan fell gradually from 5573 m3 year in 1972 to 1839 m3 year in 2017 in 1992 around 10 million people did not have access to the safe drinking water while this number increased to 15 million by 2015 https www worldometers info water afghanistan water water resources accordingly this situation highlights the need for the major water supply and demand studies to be conducted to promote overall water management throughout the country based on the food and agriculture organization fao data the country generates 65 3 km3 of renewable water resources per year of the total renewable water resources 10 65 km3 is from the groundwater and 55 5 km3 is from the surface water the surface water supplied from kabul river basin krb is approximately 11 5 km3 while total amount of groundwater provided by the basin is about 1 92 km3 fao 2016 kabul river basin includes 13 provinces and the capital city of kabul the krb regularly faces groundwater shortages and most people in the area suffer from a variety of disasters caused by the unsafe drinking water water scarcity in the krb is caused by numerous factors such as the undesirable topographical conditions fast population growth and urbanization inadequate awareness and lack of proper planning and management of water resources in most parts of the krb especially in kabul people are digging deep wells to meet their daily needs without following the strategies offered by the government as a result without adequate guidance drilling and construction of new bore wells have led to unaffordable utilization of water resources therefore to enhance the availability of fresh water and reduce water shortages in the watershed it is important to assess the appropriate areas for the groundwater extraction in several hydrogeological studies notably those concerned with the groundwater exploration defining the zones of different recharge potential is the initial step followed by the assessment of the subsurface flow direction and the trapping conditions the evaluation of recharge potential often plays a role in variety of environmental and agricultural concerns this property is very significant since it reflects the rate of water flows from the surface to the deeper aquifers groundwater potential zones have been depicted using different conventional approaches such as the geological hydrogeological geophysical and photogeological techniques pinto et al 2015 however with the increase of computer power the digital technology is being used to integrate different conventional methods with the satellite imagery remote sensing rs and the geographic information system gis technologies many researchers in the field of water resources engineering have applied several methods for the determination of groundwater potential zones around the world dinesh kumar et al 2007 swetha et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2020 among many different thematic layers such as the land use land cover soil lithology slope geology geomorphology elevation etc have been applied in different studies to investigate the groundwater potential zone of a region patra et al 2018 stated that choosing the required number of thematic layers and justifiable weights distribution are crucial to the advantage of the application of the rs and the gis in evaluating the potential zones of groundwater resources the systematic use of the analytic hierarchy process ahp via gis has developed accessible and effective methodologies for the spatial data management and multi criteria decision making evaluation the analyses of different thematic datasets have been proven effective in delineating groundwater potential zones shekhar and pandey 2014 andualem and demeke 2019 employed several thematic layers to delineate the potential groundwater zone of guna tana landscape upper blue nile basin ethiopia using the gis with the multi criteria decision analysis mcda methodology and suggested that water resource planners could apply this methodology to identify potential regions for the development and to increase the supplement productivity of irrigation and domestic use rahmati et al 2014 applied the ahp and the gis to investigate the potential zone of groundwater in kurdistan plain of iran and recommended that this methodology can be applied to create a potential groundwater zone map for the future planning especially in the data scarce areas many studies adiat et al 2012 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 machiwal et al 2010 proposed that the accuracy of the groundwater potential prediction zones is highly dependent on the exhaustiveness of the set of criteria used and the decision options to the knowledge of authors there is no study yet to analyze the groundwater potential zones in afghanistan including the krb therefore the present study is the first to determine the groundwater potential zones of the krb using seven different thematic layers rainfall soil land cover lineament density drainage density lithology and slope in the gis environment under the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique the main purpose of this study is to delineate the groundwater potential zones of the study area and to create a future groundwater exploration guide map to ensure that this essential resource is optimally and sustainably controlled and operated 2 study area the krb located in the northeast quarter of afghanistan lies between latitudes 33 ßn and 37 ß n and longitudes 67 ße and 74 ße see fig 1 with average elevations ranging from 382 m to 6206 m above mean sea level see fig 1 the total catchment area of the krb is approximately 72 000 km2 that covers 12 of total afghanistan s area and the storage capacity of the basin is estimated to be around 22 billion m3 qureshi 2002 the northern part of the basin contains high mountains that provide most of the flow of kabul river the eastern part of the krb is mainly covered with forests accounting for about 93 of the country s forest area world bank 2010 of 1 56 million ha of irrigated area in afghanistan 20 of irrigated region is located in the krb the climate of this basin is considered as the semi arid and continental with hot summers and cold winters generally the basin receives high precipitation from november to february and the amount of precipitation falls near to zero during the hot summers the annual average precipitation from 2009 to 2018 is recorded to be around 530 mm year the annual minimum and maximum temperatures in the upstream part of the basin are recorded as 6 4 c and 20 c respectively wherein at the downstream part of the basin the temperature reaches to 17 c and 28 c respectively 3 materials and methods various researchers in the field of water resources engineering have used several thematic layers to depict the groundwater potential zones of a region shaban et al 2005 dinesh kumar et al 2007 yeh et al 2008 ganapuram et al 2009 mogaji et al 2014 rahmati et al 2014 selvam et al 2014 pinto et al 2015 jhariya et al 2016 swetha et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2020 in general the choice of these thematic maps depends on the local expert or sufficient knowledge about the properties of the study area in the present study seven different types of thematic maps rainfall lineament density drainage density slope land use land cover soil and lithology are used to derive the groundwater potential zone map of the krb annual measured rainfall data at 18 stations from 2009 to 2018 are obtained from the ministry of energy and water of afghanistan the aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer digital elevation model dem with 30 m by 30 m spatial resolution see fig 1 is downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov referring to fig 1 a careful examination of dems reveals that the slope and the drainage network are towards the southeastern direction while the groundwater flow is from the north and west to the northeast direction the lineament density the drainage density and the slope maps of the krb are generated based on the dem using the arcgis spatial analyst tools the soil map is acquired from the soil survey data collected by the united states department of agriculture usda https www nrcs usda gov wps portal nrcs detail soils use worldsoils cid nrcs142p2 054000 the land cover data of the keb are downloaded from the earth explorer nasa lpdaa collections of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and finally the lithology map of the study area is downloaded from the u s department of the interior https catalog data gov dataset geologic age and lithology of afghanistan glgafg shp fig 2 shows the detailed flowchart of the methodology employed in this study 3 1 lineament and lineament density the lineaments represent the surface topography of the underlying structural features and illustrate the fault and fracture regions these factors are of great hydrogeological importance as they offer a route for the groundwater flows into the subsurface since the presence of lineaments typically implies a permeable region the groundwater potential can be indirectly revealed by the lineament density in an area areas with high lineament density are ideal for good groundwater potential zones chepchumba 2019 four different combinations of the hillshade maps with azimuth and altitude of 315 45 200 50 100 60 and 50 90 respectively are generated based on the dem and analyzed by using the gis to digitize the lineament map of the study area krb the lineaments are extracted manually from each hillshade map by using gis spatial analyst tool to create the lineament density map the lineaments generated from the hillshade maps are analyzed in the arcmap10 3 and the lineament density map of the study area is created for the further analysis the major lineaments exist in the ne to sw and the nw se are presented in fig 3 most of the lineaments are located in the north northeastern and southeastern parts of the study area in the present study the lineament length density ld is used to create the lineament map of the krb the ld is defined as the total length of lineaments in a unit area selvam et al 2014 and it is expressed as 1 ld i 1 i n l i a where i 1 n l i indicates the total lengths of lineaments and a represents the area of the watershed as mentioned before the lineaments are extracted for the whole krb see fig 3 and the arcmap is utilized to create the lineaments density map fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the low 0 08 0 161 km km2 and the very low 0 08 km km2 lineament densities are located in the west southwestern and mostly in the center parts of the region where the medium 0 161 0 242 km km2 and the high lineament 0 242 0 323 km km2 densities are located in the northeastern northwestern and southwestern parts of the basin respectively the very high lineament 0 403 km km2 densities are located in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the basin as seen in fig 4 the cumulative length and the frequency of the lineaments located in the northeastern part of the basin are very dense compared to the other regions of the basin the northeastern region of the basin has very high groundwater potential as the number of lineaments are predominantly dominant in this area 3 2 drainage density the drainage patterns represent the evolutionary history of the earth s crust it can provide information about the surface and subsurface formation such as the dendritic drainage showing predominantly homogeneous rocks rectangular and parallel drainage patterns show structural and lithological control roy et al 2020 the drainage network is an important indicator of the water permeability as it is basically determined by the underlying lithology shaban et al 2005 the drainage density and the presence of lineaments faults crevices large and small joints can have a significant impact on the recharge and movement of groundwater and they can also provide highly groundwater movement paths which are of great hydraulic importance deepa et al 2016 the drainage density reflects the proximity of channel spacing and surface properties the information related to runoff infiltration relief and permeability can be obtained by evaluating the drainage density and the drainage type the drainage system in an area depends on the nature and structure of the bedrock the type of vegetation and the ability of the soil to absorb rainfall infiltration and slope in areas with low drainage densities there is more infiltration and less surface runoff it implies that the areas with low drainage density are ideal for the development of groundwater rahmati et al 2014 in the present study the gis is employed to extract the drainage pattern directly from the dem see fig 1 the surface drainage density dd which is defined as the ratio of the total length of the streams to the size of the area of the grid under consideration is calculated as follows 2 d d i 1 i n di a where d i represents the length of all streams in the mesh i km and a indicates the area of the grid km2 in the present study the drainage map as shown in fig 5 is used to generate the drainage density map of the krb and it is reclassified into five groups as very low low medium high and very high see fig 6 as it can be observed in fig 6 the high 0 54 0 88 km km2 and the very high 0 21 0 54 km km2 drainage densities are located in the southwestern and at the center parts of the basin covering areas of 8292 km2 and 5208 km2 respectively the medium drainage density 0 88 1 21 km km2 is mostly located in the northeastern southwestern and western parts of the basin occupying around 27 697 km2 area the low 1 21 1 55 km km2 and the very low 1 55 1 88 km km2 drainage densities are generally located around the boundary of the basin that covers 22 486 km2 and 8967 km2 area of the basin respectively areas with the low drainage density have better groundwater potential zones than those with the high drainage density 3 3 lithology the lithology of an area has a strong impact on the generated quality and quantity of the groundwater ghorbani nejad et al 2016 in this study the lithology map obtained from the u s department of the interior is digitalized for the entire study area as shown in fig 7 the krb contains 20 different types of geologic lithology among gneiss sand conglomerate and sandstone clay and shale granite lava limestone and dolomite and fan alluvium and colluvium are found to be the most extensive classes that cover the majority of the region among the 20 different lithological classes the fan alluvium and colluvium the conglomerate and sandstone the limestone and dolomite and the sand are considered to be most favorable for the groundwater potential therefore high weight values are assigned to these classes see table 1 the basalt the volcanic and sedimentary rocks the basaltic and andesite and the rhyolite to andesite are also favorable zones for the groundwater recharge potential zones the remaining classes of the lithology are considered as the unfavorable zones for the generation of groundwater potential due to low permeability that favors less infiltration resulting in a low potential for the groundwater storage 3 4 precipitation a major component of the water cycle and a major cause of groundwater recharge is the precipitation the hydrological conditions of a region are primarily affected by the amount and spatio temporal distribution of a precipitation patra et al 2018 the intensity of precipitation combined with other favorable factors helps to classify the groundwater potential zones high rainfall is likely to increase the groundwater table 2 and fig 8 show the locations of meteorological stations and the drainage areas of the stations at the study area the maximum precipitation is observed at bagh i lala station with 233 mm while the minimum is observed at keraman khawak omarz and qala i malek with 0 001 mm the variation in the precipitation is significant at stations bagh i omomi and tang i gulbahar while there is less variation at station pul i kama as seen in table 2 dakah has larger drainage area of 67 370 km2 while qala i malek has smaller drainage area of 69 km2 table 3 presents the summary of precipitation statistics in order to identify the groundwater potential zones it is necessary to determine the effects of the precipitation the spatial distribution of the average annual rainfall map see fig 8 is generated by the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method using the arcgis and it is reclassified into five classes as very low low medium high and very high as shown in fig 8 the north northeastern and some central parts of the study area have the high precipitation in the range of 278 2 315 19 mm year where the very high rainfall of 315 6 352 99 mm year covers some small portions of the basin located in the north northeastern and central parts the medium precipitation of 240 81 278 19 mm year largely covers the western and southeastern parts of the region the low 203 4 240 8 mm year and the very low 166 203 4 mm year precipitation covers the same regions located in the west and east of the study area respectively 3 5 slope the topographical slopes in any region have certain importance in affecting the surface runoff recharging and water movement the gradient of the slope directly affects the runoff and infiltration larger slopes create a smaller recharge since during rainfall water flows quickly off the surface of a steep slope not having sufficient time to infiltrate into the sub surface and recharge the saturated region yeh et al 2008 in terms of the groundwater recharge the areas with flat land are classified as the very good with significantly higher infiltration while the areas with gentle slopes have runoff with somewhat undulating terrain therefore it is considered as the good for the groundwater storage in terms of possible groundwater zones the regions with steeper slopes are classified as the poor because of the occurrence of high runoff and low infiltration the slopes of the study area are calculated in degrees based on the dem model using the arcgis 10 3 and it is classified into five groups as low very low medium high and very high as shown in fig 9 the very low slopes 0 8 92 cover largely the western southwestern and partial eastern parts of the region and they are more favorable for the groundwater potential zones the very high slopes 39 39 78 48 cover parts of the northern northeastern eastern and southwestern regions indicating high runoff and no groundwater infiltration 3 6 land use land cover lulc the land use and land cover primarily indicate the nature and extent of the land by providing detailed information from a hydrological point of view the land cover has a strong impact on the groundwater and it affects the rate of recharge runoff and evapotranspiration for instance water bodies and snowy areas are favorable for the groundwater potential zones whereas the wastelands and build up lands are being considered to be unsuitable for the groundwater generation the land use and land cover changes are one of the major anthropogenic activities that change the production and development of the groundwater resources they are important indicators of the extent of groundwater requirements and groundwater utilization jhariya et al 2016 presently the remote sensing rs and the gis technologies have been widely used to obtain the accurate land use land cover mapping information the land use land cover is included in this study as an important factor influencing the groundwater recharge process as shown in fig 10 the krb contains 13 different land cover classes namely barren or sparsely vegetated close shrublands croplands evergreen needle leaf forest grasslands mixed forests open shrublands permanent wetlands savannas snow and ice urban and build up water bodies and woody savannas of 13 land cover classes the grasslands and the barren or sparsely vegetated ones are the most extensive classes that cover 35 396 km2 49 and 21 924 km2 30 2 of the total basin area respectively 3 7 soil in the assessment of the groundwater recharge and quality soil type plays a vital role mogaji et al 2014 stated the water retaining capacity infiltration and permeability are all depend on the soil type hence the soil type thematic layer is created from the soil survey data collected by the united states department of agriculture usda as shown in fig 11 the krb has 11 different soil types each of which has its own influence on the regional groundwater system among these the xerochrepts with xerorthents rocky land with lithic haplocryids and rocky land with lithic cryorthents soils are found to be the extensive classes that cover 16 583 km2 12 919 km2 and 12 581 km2 areas respectively the xerochrepts with xerorthents soils have strong sloping and thus lose water through the runoff indicating an inadequate groundwater potential zones among the 11 soil classes the torripsamments type soils support more vegetation than other soils with an aridic moisture regime presumably because they lose less water as the runoff and represent favorable groundwater potential zones usda 1999 4 normalized weights for thematic maps based on the analytic hierarchy process a pairwise comparison matrix is used under the analytic hierarchy process ahp method to compare the significance of the two layer maps to demonstrate that one has a greater impact on the groundwater generation than the others the ahp uses the saaty s scales 1 9 to create a judgment matrix assigns weights to the elements of each rank and calculates their relative importance the value of 1 represents equally important and 9 represents extremely important saaty 1980 more details of the other relative importance values are shown in table 4 the weights are assigned to various thematic layers based on the existing literature review and field experience the applied weights of different thematic layers are normalized by the eigenvector and the ahp technique the normalization process reduces the subjectivity associated with the assigned weights of the thematic maps and their features machiwal et al 2010 the consistency ratio cr is applied to check the consistency of the normalized weights of the thematic layers the cr is computed by performing the following steps step 1 create the judgment matrices by the pairwise comparison see table 5 3 a p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 23 p 2 n p 1 n p 2 n p n n where pij being the judgment matrix element step 2 calculate the normalized weights see table 6 as follows 4 w n g m n n 1 n f g m n where the geometric mean of the ith row of the judgment matrix is calculated as follows 5 g m n p 1 n p 2 n p n n f n f step 3 calculate the consistency ratio cr see table 7 6 c r c i r c i where ci is the consistency index and rci is the random consistency index that can be obtained from the standard table given in saaty 1980 in this study for n 7 the value of rci is 1 45 see table 4 step 4 calculate the consistency index ci as follows see table 7 7 c i λmax n f n f 1 where n f shows the number of criteria or factors and λmax is the principal eigenvalue which can be computed as follows see table 7 8 λmax n 1 n f a w n n f w n where w is defined as the weight vector for consistent weights the value of consistency ratio cr should be less than 10 if not the related weights should be re evaluated to prevent the inconsistency refereeing to table 7 it can be seen that the value of cr 4 is less than 10 indicating that there is a reasonable level of consistency in the pairwise comparison and hence the weights of 0 31 0 28 0 12 0 10 0 05 0 06 and 0 07 i e 31 28 12 10 5 6 and 7 respectively can be assigned to rainfall lithology lineament density drainage density slope soil and land use land cover respectively the thematic layers for each factor are categorized based on the groundwater storage potentiality the groundwater storage potentiality of each factor is reclassified to a uniform rank of 1 5 the value of 1 indicates very low and 5 shows very high groundwater storage potential the thematic layers with the influence weightage and the corresponding rank of each parameter are shown in table 1 finally the weighted overlay option in the arcgis is used and the influence weighted values are added for each thematic layer in order to generate the groundwater potential zones of the study area as presented in fig 12 in the next section the crisp values are used to assign the weightages in ahp method and this makes it more applicable to create a potential groundwater zone map especially in the data scarce areas rahmati et al 2014 however note that there are other methods that do not assign crisp values rather employ the multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods using the machine learning algorithms swetha et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 jesiya and gopinath 2020 5 results and discussion all the seven thematic layers of rainfall lithology lineament density drainage density soil slope and land use land cover are integrated into the arcgis software and a single groundwater potential map is generated by assigning the different influence weight values to each thematic layer and to their corresponding classes under the gis weighted overlay option see table 1 the groundwater potential map of the study area is classified into 4 groups as poor very poor good and very good based on the input thematic layers see fig 12 the poor and the good areas of the groundwater potential zones are found to be randomly distributed over the study area krb that occupy about 56 and 39 of the total basin area respectively the very poor area of the groundwater potential zones that cover around 3 2 of the total basin area are mostly located in the west southwest and in some central parts of the basin the very good groundwater potential regions located in the south southeast north northeast and in some parts of the southwest constitute about 2 2 of the total study area in general the downstream part of the study area is considered to be the most favorable for the groundwater potential due to the distribution of gravelly stratum and agricultural land with a high infiltration ability and less runoff additionally the location of high drainage density in the downstream parts of the area has a strong effect on the groundwater and helps the streamflow to recharge the groundwater system the upstream part of the study area has low groundwater potential which could be due to the gentle slopes of the regions or the location of some lithological factors that decrease the infiltration of water and increase the surface runoff the recharge potential zones found in this study are used to estimate the amount of water recharged to subsurface medium table 8 as mentioned before the average annual rainfall of the krb is estimated to be around 530 mm year and the total surface area of the basin is 72 000 km2 and therefore the total volume of the precipitated water of the krb is computed as about 3 82 1010 m3 year the following equation is used to estimate the total recharged water w of the four potential zones 9 w p r a where p indicates the volume of the precipitated water r represents the recharge ratio from table 8 and a shows percentage of the area thus w 3 82 10 10 0 475 0 022 0 325 0 39 0 075 0 56 0 025 0 032 6 876 10 9 m 3 y e a r this indicates that from the total precipitated water only 18 contributes to the groundwater recharge and the remaining 82 is lost by either through evapotranspiration or by the surface runoff 6 summary and conclusions the groundwater potential zones in kabul river basin in afghanistan are determined using the state of the art technology by the gis the maps of rainfall lithology land use land cover slope soil drainage density and lineament density are first prepared then the ahp is employed to assess the weights of different themes the generated groundwater potential zone gwpz map of the study area is classified into four as the very good good poor and very poor covering areas of 2 2 39 56 and 3 2 of the basin respectively the very good zones are found to be located in the downstream and central parts of the basin while the good and the poor zones are randomly distributed occupying the larger portions of the basin and the very poor zones are located in the west southwest and in some central parts of the basin the contribution to the recharge from the precipitation is found about 18 the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the rainwater is quite important for the groundwater regeneration 2 from the total precipitated water only 18 contributes to the groundwater 3 the good gwpz clearly shows that the krb has sufficient groundwater potential 4 the good and the very good zones would have a key role in the future expansion of the drinking water and irrigation development 5 the creation of reservoirs or digging of pits especially in snowy areas would be useful to recharge the groundwater 6 the gentle to mild steep slopes regions are deemed to be fair areas for the groundwater recharge processes these regions could be used for the development of water management structures such as the check dam water absorption trench and farm ponds to store rainwater and to avoid excess surface runoff 7 the recognition and selection of the appropriate number of thematic layers and the legitimate allocation of the weights are the key factors in the gis applications for the determination of the potential groundwater resource zones 8 the gis based ahp method for the groundwater potential mapping could be successfully implemented population growth climate change improper digging of deep wells violations of government mandated laws and long standing droughts are all factors contributing to the depletion of groundwater in the region therefore it is imperative that the government should take some necessary steps to prevent the groundwater shortages in the area hence some sort of sustainability measures such as the creation of reservoirs or digging of pits especially in snowy areas would be useful to recharge the groundwater sufficient groundwater level data well data are required to validate the generated map unfortunately in a country like afghanistan which has been in a war since 1979 there is substantial lack of data that makes the validation impossible however by using the art of the technology and the actual available data on the precipitation soil land use land cover slope etc this study was able to generate the groundwater potential zone map for the basin this map can be beneficial for the authorities to develop water resources management

11875,groundwater gw plays a vital role in the socio economic growth of kabul river basin krb in afghanistan since the gw resources in the basin have not been properly managed there is a need for sound strategies by first identifying the potential gw zones this study assesses the potential groundwater zones for the krb using the geographic information systems gis and the analytic hierarchy

process recharge 1 introduction afghanistan located in the aridity region has water resources mainly from the high mountain series about 80 of the water emanates from hindu kush mountains at an altitude of 2000 m qureshi 2002 these mountains possess inherent storage of water in the form of snow during the winter season and snowmelt during the summer season promoting the perpetual flow of

discharges of these systems the key causes of the low discharge are the low rainfall and as a result low groundwater recharge in addition the boring of deep wells near the karezes and the shallow wells have adversely impacted the production of these conventional irrigation systems the shallow wells are used in the most metropolitan regions to provide water for the drinking and other domestic uses the water levels drop by around 0 5 3 m every month depending on the region qureshi 2002 many of these wells are now dry and individuals often women and children are forced to walk miles to meet their everyday water needs renewable water resources per capita of afghanistan fell gradually from 5573 m3 year in 1972 to 1839 m3 year in 2017 in 1992 around 10 million people did not have access to the safe drinking water while this number increased to 15 million by 2015 https www worldometers info water afghanistan water water resources accordingly this situation highlights the need for the major water supply and demand studies to be conducted to promote overall water management throughout the country based on the food and agriculture organization fao data the country generates 65 3 km3 of renewable water resources per year of the total renewable water resources 10 65 km3 is from the groundwater and 55 5 km3 is from the surface water the surface water supplied from kabul river basin krb is approximately 11 5 km3 while total amount of groundwater provided by the basin is about 1 92 km3 fao 2016 kabul river basin includes 13 provinces and the capital city of kabul the krb regularly faces groundwater shortages and most people in the area suffer from a variety of disasters caused by the unsafe drinking water water scarcity in the krb is caused by numerous factors such as the undesirable topographical conditions fast population growth and urbanization inadequate awareness and lack of proper planning and management of water resources in most parts of the krb especially in kabul people are digging deep wells to meet their daily needs without following the strategies offered by the government as a result without adequate guidance drilling and construction of new bore wells have led to unaffordable utilization of water resources therefore to enhance the availability of fresh water and reduce water shortages in the watershed it is important to assess the appropriate areas for the groundwater extraction in several hydrogeological studies notably those concerned with the groundwater exploration defining the zones of different recharge potential is the initial step followed by the assessment of the subsurface flow direction and the trapping conditions the evaluation of recharge potential often plays a role in variety of environmental and agricultural concerns this property is very significant since it reflects the rate of water flows from the surface to the deeper aquifers groundwater potential zones have been depicted using different conventional approaches such as the geological hydrogeological geophysical and photogeological techniques pinto et al 2015 however with the increase of computer power the digital technology is being used to integrate different conventional methods with the satellite imagery remote sensing rs and the geographic information system gis technologies many researchers in the field of water resources engineering have applied several methods for the determination of groundwater potential zones around the world dinesh kumar et al 2007 swetha et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2020 among many different thematic layers such as the land use land cover soil lithology slope geology geomorphology elevation etc have been applied in different studies to investigate the groundwater potential zone of a region patra et al 2018 stated that choosing the required number of thematic layers and justifiable weights distribution are crucial to the advantage of the application of the rs and the gis in evaluating the potential zones of groundwater resources the systematic use of the analytic hierarchy process ahp via gis has developed accessible and effective methodologies for the spatial data management and multi criteria decision making evaluation the analyses of different thematic datasets have been proven effective in delineating groundwater potential zones shekhar and pandey 2014 andualem and demeke 2019 employed several thematic layers to delineate the potential groundwater zone of guna tana landscape upper blue nile basin ethiopia using the gis with the multi criteria decision analysis mcda methodology and suggested that water resource planners could apply this methodology to identify potential regions for the development and to increase the supplement productivity of irrigation and domestic use rahmati et al 2014 applied the ahp and the gis to investigate the potential zone of groundwater in kurdistan plain of iran and recommended that this methodology can be applied to create a potential groundwater zone map for the future planning especially in the data scarce areas many studies adiat et al 2012 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 machiwal et al 2010 proposed that the accuracy of the groundwater potential prediction zones is highly dependent on the exhaustiveness of the set of criteria used and the decision options to the knowledge of authors there is no study yet to analyze the groundwater potential zones in afghanistan including the krb therefore the present study is the first to determine the groundwater potential zones of the krb using seven different thematic layers rainfall soil land cover lineament density drainage density lithology and slope in the gis environment under the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique the main purpose of this study is to delineate the groundwater potential zones of the study area and to create a future groundwater exploration guide map to ensure that this essential resource is optimally and sustainably controlled and operated 2 study area the krb located in the northeast quarter of afghanistan lies between latitudes 33 ßn and 37 ß n and longitudes 67 ße and 74 ße see fig 1 with average elevations ranging from 382 m to 6206 m above mean sea level see fig 1 the total catchment area of the krb is approximately 72 000 km2 that covers 12 of total afghanistan s area and the storage capacity of the basin is estimated to be around 22 billion m3 qureshi 2002 the northern part of the basin contains high mountains that provide most of the flow of kabul river the eastern part of the krb is mainly covered with forests accounting for about 93 of the country s forest area world bank 2010 of 1 56 million ha of irrigated area in afghanistan 20 of irrigated region is located in the krb the climate of this basin is considered as the semi arid and continental with hot summers and cold winters generally the basin receives high precipitation from november to february and the amount of precipitation falls near to zero during the hot summers the annual average precipitation from 2009 to 2018 is recorded to be around 530 mm year the annual minimum and maximum temperatures in the upstream part of the basin are recorded as 6 4 c and 20 c respectively wherein at the downstream part of the basin the temperature reaches to 17 c and 28 c respectively 3 materials and methods various researchers in the field of water resources engineering have used several thematic layers to depict the groundwater potential zones of a region shaban et al 2005 dinesh kumar et al 2007 yeh et al 2008 ganapuram et al 2009 mogaji et al 2014 rahmati et al 2014 selvam et al 2014 pinto et al 2015 jhariya et al 2016 swetha et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2020 in general the choice of these thematic maps depends on the local expert or sufficient knowledge about the properties of the study area in the present study seven different types of thematic maps rainfall lineament density drainage density slope land use land cover soil and lithology are used to derive the groundwater potential zone map of the krb annual measured rainfall data at 18 stations from 2009 to 2018 are obtained from the ministry of energy and water of afghanistan the aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer digital elevation model dem with 30 m by 30 m spatial resolution see fig 1 is downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov referring to fig 1 a careful examination of dems reveals that the slope and the drainage network are towards the southeastern direction while the groundwater flow is from the north and west to the northeast direction the lineament density the drainage density and the slope maps of the krb are generated based on the dem using the arcgis spatial analyst tools the soil map is acquired from the soil survey data collected by the united states department of agriculture usda https www nrcs usda gov wps portal nrcs detail soils use worldsoils cid nrcs142p2 054000 the land cover data of the keb are downloaded from the earth explorer nasa lpdaa collections of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and finally the lithology map of the study area is downloaded from the u s department of the interior https catalog data gov dataset geologic age and lithology of afghanistan glgafg shp fig 2 shows the detailed flowchart of the methodology employed in this study 3 1 lineament and lineament density the lineaments represent the surface topography of the underlying structural features and illustrate the fault and fracture regions these factors are of great hydrogeological importance as they offer a route for the groundwater flows into the subsurface since the presence of lineaments typically implies a permeable region the groundwater potential can be indirectly revealed by the lineament density in an area areas with high lineament density are ideal for good groundwater potential zones chepchumba 2019 four different combinations of the hillshade maps with azimuth and altitude of 315 45 200 50 100 60 and 50 90 respectively are generated based on the dem and analyzed by using the gis to digitize the lineament map of the study area krb the lineaments are extracted manually from each hillshade map by using gis spatial analyst tool to create the lineament density map the lineaments generated from the hillshade maps are analyzed in the arcmap10 3 and the lineament density map of the study area is created for the further analysis the major lineaments exist in the ne to sw and the nw se are presented in fig 3 most of the lineaments are located in the north northeastern and southeastern parts of the study area in the present study the lineament length density ld is used to create the lineament map of the krb the ld is defined as the total length of lineaments in a unit area selvam et al 2014 and it is expressed as 1 ld i 1 i n l i a where i 1 n l i indicates the total lengths of lineaments and a represents the area of the watershed as mentioned before the lineaments are extracted for the whole krb see fig 3 and the arcmap is utilized to create the lineaments density map fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the low 0 08 0 161 km km2 and the very low 0 08 km km2 lineament densities are located in the west southwestern and mostly in the center parts of the region where the medium 0 161 0 242 km km2 and the high lineament 0 242 0 323 km km2 densities are located in the northeastern northwestern and southwestern parts of the basin respectively the very high lineament 0 403 km km2 densities are located in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the basin as seen in fig 4 the cumulative length and the frequency of the lineaments located in the northeastern part of the basin are very dense compared to the other regions of the basin the northeastern region of the basin has very high groundwater potential as the number of lineaments are predominantly dominant in this area 3 2 drainage density the drainage patterns represent the evolutionary history of the earth s crust it can provide information about the surface and subsurface formation such as the dendritic drainage showing predominantly homogeneous rocks rectangular and parallel drainage patterns show structural and lithological control roy et al 2020 the drainage network is an important indicator of the water permeability as it is basically determined by the underlying lithology shaban et al 2005 the drainage density and the presence of lineaments faults crevices large and small joints can have a significant impact on the recharge and movement of groundwater and they can also provide highly groundwater movement paths which are of great hydraulic importance deepa et al 2016 the drainage density reflects the proximity of channel spacing and surface properties the information related to runoff infiltration relief and permeability can be obtained by evaluating the drainage density and the drainage type the drainage system in an area depends on the nature and structure of the bedrock the type of vegetation and the ability of the soil to absorb rainfall infiltration and slope in areas with low drainage densities there is more infiltration and less surface runoff it implies that the areas with low drainage density are ideal for the development of groundwater rahmati et al 2014 in the present study the gis is employed to extract the drainage pattern directly from the dem see fig 1 the surface drainage density dd which is defined as the ratio of the total length of the streams to the size of the area of the grid under consideration is calculated as follows 2 d d i 1 i n di a where d i represents the length of all streams in the mesh i km and a indicates the area of the grid km2 in the present study the drainage map as shown in fig 5 is used to generate the drainage density map of the krb and it is reclassified into five groups as very low low medium high and very high see fig 6 as it can be observed in fig 6 the high 0 54 0 88 km km2 and the very high 0 21 0 54 km km2 drainage densities are located in the southwestern and at the center parts of the basin covering areas of 8292 km2 and 5208 km2 respectively the medium drainage density 0 88 1 21 km km2 is mostly located in the northeastern southwestern and western parts of the basin occupying around 27 697 km2 area the low 1 21 1 55 km km2 and the very low 1 55 1 88 km km2 drainage densities are generally located around the boundary of the basin that covers 22 486 km2 and 8967 km2 area of the basin respectively areas with the low drainage density have better groundwater potential zones than those with the high drainage density 3 3 lithology the lithology of an area has a strong impact on the generated quality and quantity of the groundwater ghorbani nejad et al 2016 in this study the lithology map obtained from the u s department of the interior is digitalized for the entire study area as shown in fig 7 the krb contains 20 different types of geologic lithology among gneiss sand conglomerate and sandstone clay and shale granite lava limestone and dolomite and fan alluvium and colluvium are found to be the most extensive classes that cover the majority of the region among the 20 different lithological classes the fan alluvium and colluvium the conglomerate and sandstone the limestone and dolomite and the sand are considered to be most favorable for the groundwater potential therefore high weight values are assigned to these classes see table 1 the basalt the volcanic and sedimentary rocks the basaltic and andesite and the rhyolite to andesite are also favorable zones for the groundwater recharge potential zones the remaining classes of the lithology are considered as the unfavorable zones for the generation of groundwater potential due to low permeability that favors less infiltration resulting in a low potential for the groundwater storage 3 4 precipitation a major component of the water cycle and a major cause of groundwater recharge is the precipitation the hydrological conditions of a region are primarily affected by the amount and spatio temporal distribution of a precipitation patra et al 2018 the intensity of precipitation combined with other favorable factors helps to classify the groundwater potential zones high rainfall is likely to increase the groundwater table 2 and fig 8 show the locations of meteorological stations and the drainage areas of the stations at the study area the maximum precipitation is observed at bagh i lala station with 233 mm while the minimum is observed at keraman khawak omarz and qala i malek with 0 001 mm the variation in the precipitation is significant at stations bagh i omomi and tang i gulbahar while there is less variation at station pul i kama as seen in table 2 dakah has larger drainage area of 67 370 km2 while qala i malek has smaller drainage area of 69 km2 table 3 presents the summary of precipitation statistics in order to identify the groundwater potential zones it is necessary to determine the effects of the precipitation the spatial distribution of the average annual rainfall map see fig 8 is generated by the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method using the arcgis and it is reclassified into five classes as very low low medium high and very high as shown in fig 8 the north northeastern and some central parts of the study area have the high precipitation in the range of 278 2 315 19 mm year where the very high rainfall of 315 6 352 99 mm year covers some small portions of the basin located in the north northeastern and central parts the medium precipitation of 240 81 278 19 mm year largely covers the western and southeastern parts of the region the low 203 4 240 8 mm year and the very low 166 203 4 mm year precipitation covers the same regions located in the west and east of the study area respectively 3 5 slope the topographical slopes in any region have certain importance in affecting the surface runoff recharging and water movement the gradient of the slope directly affects the runoff and infiltration larger slopes create a smaller recharge since during rainfall water flows quickly off the surface of a steep slope not having sufficient time to infiltrate into the sub surface and recharge the saturated region yeh et al 2008 in terms of the groundwater recharge the areas with flat land are classified as the very good with significantly higher infiltration while the areas with gentle slopes have runoff with somewhat undulating terrain therefore it is considered as the good for the groundwater storage in terms of possible groundwater zones the regions with steeper slopes are classified as the poor because of the occurrence of high runoff and low infiltration the slopes of the study area are calculated in degrees based on the dem model using the arcgis 10 3 and it is classified into five groups as low very low medium high and very high as shown in fig 9 the very low slopes 0 8 92 cover largely the western southwestern and partial eastern parts of the region and they are more favorable for the groundwater potential zones the very high slopes 39 39 78 48 cover parts of the northern northeastern eastern and southwestern regions indicating high runoff and no groundwater infiltration 3 6 land use land cover lulc the land use and land cover primarily indicate the nature and extent of the land by providing detailed information from a hydrological point of view the land cover has a strong impact on the groundwater and it affects the rate of recharge runoff and evapotranspiration for instance water bodies and snowy areas are favorable for the groundwater potential zones whereas the wastelands and build up lands are being considered to be unsuitable for the groundwater generation the land use and land cover changes are one of the major anthropogenic activities that change the production and development of the groundwater resources they are important indicators of the extent of groundwater requirements and groundwater utilization jhariya et al 2016 presently the remote sensing rs and the gis technologies have been widely used to obtain the accurate land use land cover mapping information the land use land cover is included in this study as an important factor influencing the groundwater recharge process as shown in fig 10 the krb contains 13 different land cover classes namely barren or sparsely vegetated close shrublands croplands evergreen needle leaf forest grasslands mixed forests open shrublands permanent wetlands savannas snow and ice urban and build up water bodies and woody savannas of 13 land cover classes the grasslands and the barren or sparsely vegetated ones are the most extensive classes that cover 35 396 km2 49 and 21 924 km2 30 2 of the total basin area respectively 3 7 soil in the assessment of the groundwater recharge and quality soil type plays a vital role mogaji et al 2014 stated the water retaining capacity infiltration and permeability are all depend on the soil type hence the soil type thematic layer is created from the soil survey data collected by the united states department of agriculture usda as shown in fig 11 the krb has 11 different soil types each of which has its own influence on the regional groundwater system among these the xerochrepts with xerorthents rocky land with lithic haplocryids and rocky land with lithic cryorthents soils are found to be the extensive classes that cover 16 583 km2 12 919 km2 and 12 581 km2 areas respectively the xerochrepts with xerorthents soils have strong sloping and thus lose water through the runoff indicating an inadequate groundwater potential zones among the 11 soil classes the torripsamments type soils support more vegetation than other soils with an aridic moisture regime presumably because they lose less water as the runoff and represent favorable groundwater potential zones usda 1999 4 normalized weights for thematic maps based on the analytic hierarchy process a pairwise comparison matrix is used under the analytic hierarchy process ahp method to compare the significance of the two layer maps to demonstrate that one has a greater impact on the groundwater generation than the others the ahp uses the saaty s scales 1 9 to create a judgment matrix assigns weights to the elements of each rank and calculates their relative importance the value of 1 represents equally important and 9 represents extremely important saaty 1980 more details of the other relative importance values are shown in table 4 the weights are assigned to various thematic layers based on the existing literature review and field experience the applied weights of different thematic layers are normalized by the eigenvector and the ahp technique the normalization process reduces the subjectivity associated with the assigned weights of the thematic maps and their features machiwal et al 2010 the consistency ratio cr is applied to check the consistency of the normalized weights of the thematic layers the cr is computed by performing the following steps step 1 create the judgment matrices by the pairwise comparison see table 5 3 a p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 23 p 2 n p 1 n p 2 n p n n where pij being the judgment matrix element step 2 calculate the normalized weights see table 6 as follows 4 w n g m n n 1 n f g m n where the geometric mean of the ith row of the judgment matrix is calculated as follows 5 g m n p 1 n p 2 n p n n f n f step 3 calculate the consistency ratio cr see table 7 6 c r c i r c i where ci is the consistency index and rci is the random consistency index that can be obtained from the standard table given in saaty 1980 in this study for n 7 the value of rci is 1 45 see table 4 step 4 calculate the consistency index ci as follows see table 7 7 c i λmax n f n f 1 where n f shows the number of criteria or factors and λmax is the principal eigenvalue which can be computed as follows see table 7 8 λmax n 1 n f a w n n f w n where w is defined as the weight vector for consistent weights the value of consistency ratio cr should be less than 10 if not the related weights should be re evaluated to prevent the inconsistency refereeing to table 7 it can be seen that the value of cr 4 is less than 10 indicating that there is a reasonable level of consistency in the pairwise comparison and hence the weights of 0 31 0 28 0 12 0 10 0 05 0 06 and 0 07 i e 31 28 12 10 5 6 and 7 respectively can be assigned to rainfall lithology lineament density drainage density slope soil and land use land cover respectively the thematic layers for each factor are categorized based on the groundwater storage potentiality the groundwater storage potentiality of each factor is reclassified to a uniform rank of 1 5 the value of 1 indicates very low and 5 shows very high groundwater storage potential the thematic layers with the influence weightage and the corresponding rank of each parameter are shown in table 1 finally the weighted overlay option in the arcgis is used and the influence weighted values are added for each thematic layer in order to generate the groundwater potential zones of the study area as presented in fig 12 in the next section the crisp values are used to assign the weightages in ahp method and this makes it more applicable to create a potential groundwater zone map especially in the data scarce areas rahmati et al 2014 however note that there are other methods that do not assign crisp values rather employ the multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods using the machine learning algorithms swetha et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 jesiya and gopinath 2020 5 results and discussion all the seven thematic layers of rainfall lithology lineament density drainage density soil slope and land use land cover are integrated into the arcgis software and a single groundwater potential map is generated by assigning the different influence weight values to each thematic layer and to their corresponding classes under the gis weighted overlay option see table 1 the groundwater potential map of the study area is classified into 4 groups as poor very poor good and very good based on the input thematic layers see fig 12 the poor and the good areas of the groundwater potential zones are found to be randomly distributed over the study area krb that occupy about 56 and 39 of the total basin area respectively the very poor area of the groundwater potential zones that cover around 3 2 of the total basin area are mostly located in the west southwest and in some central parts of the basin the very good groundwater potential regions located in the south southeast north northeast and in some parts of the southwest constitute about 2 2 of the total study area in general the downstream part of the study area is considered to be the most favorable for the groundwater potential due to the distribution of gravelly stratum and agricultural land with a high infiltration ability and less runoff additionally the location of high drainage density in the downstream parts of the area has a strong effect on the groundwater and helps the streamflow to recharge the groundwater system the upstream part of the study area has low groundwater potential which could be due to the gentle slopes of the regions or the location of some lithological factors that decrease the infiltration of water and increase the surface runoff the recharge potential zones found in this study are used to estimate the amount of water recharged to subsurface medium table 8 as mentioned before the average annual rainfall of the krb is estimated to be around 530 mm year and the total surface area of the basin is 72 000 km2 and therefore the total volume of the precipitated water of the krb is computed as about 3 82 1010 m3 year the following equation is used to estimate the total recharged water w of the four potential zones 9 w p r a where p indicates the volume of the precipitated water r represents the recharge ratio from table 8 and a shows percentage of the area thus w 3 82 10 10 0 475 0 022 0 325 0 39 0 075 0 56 0 025 0 032 6 876 10 9 m 3 y e a r this indicates that from the total precipitated water only 18 contributes to the groundwater recharge and the remaining 82 is lost by either through evapotranspiration or by the surface runoff 6 summary and conclusions the groundwater potential zones in kabul river basin in afghanistan are determined using the state of the art technology by the gis the maps of rainfall lithology land use land cover slope soil drainage density and lineament density are first prepared then the ahp is employed to assess the weights of different themes the generated groundwater potential zone gwpz map of the study area is classified into four as the very good good poor and very poor covering areas of 2 2 39 56 and 3 2 of the basin respectively the very good zones are found to be located in the downstream and central parts of the basin while the good and the poor zones are randomly distributed occupying the larger portions of the basin and the very poor zones are located in the west southwest and in some central parts of the basin the contribution to the recharge from the precipitation is found about 18 the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the rainwater is quite important for the groundwater regeneration 2 from the total precipitated water only 18 contributes to the groundwater 3 the good gwpz clearly shows that the krb has sufficient groundwater potential 4 the good and the very good zones would have a key role in the future expansion of the drinking water and irrigation development 5 the creation of reservoirs or digging of pits especially in snowy areas would be useful to recharge the groundwater 6 the gentle to mild steep slopes regions are deemed to be fair areas for the groundwater recharge processes these regions could be used for the development of water management structures such as the check dam water absorption trench and farm ponds to store rainwater and to avoid excess surface runoff 7 the recognition and selection of the appropriate number of thematic layers and the legitimate allocation of the weights are the key factors in the gis applications for the determination of the potential groundwater resource zones 8 the gis based ahp method for the groundwater potential mapping could be successfully implemented population growth climate change improper digging of deep wells violations of government mandated laws and long standing droughts are all factors contributing to the depletion of groundwater in the region therefore it is imperative that the government should take some necessary steps to prevent the groundwater shortages in the area hence some sort of sustainability measures such as the creation of reservoirs or digging of pits especially in snowy areas would be useful to recharge the groundwater sufficient groundwater level data well data are required to validate the generated map unfortunately in a country like afghanistan which has been in a war since 1979 there is substantial lack of data that makes the validation impossible however by using the art of the technology and the actual available data on the precipitation soil land use land cover slope etc this study was able to generate the groundwater potential zone map for the basin this map can be beneficial for the authorities to develop water resources management strategies and projects at the basin the gwpz map could also be applied for the drought risk assessment in the basin funding not applicable availability of data and material the data that support the

11876,surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear is an appropriate method for dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls remediation however due to the high cost of chemicals used choosing the suitable wells pattern and the optimal pumping scenario is necessary in this study the sear method performance for regular convergent and inverted divergent patterns with different wells numbers have been evaluated the performance of 5 categories of patterns including 35 different sub patterns was evaluated in a pce contaminated aquifer the results show that the uniformity and appropriate surfactant distribution in the contaminated area significantly improves remediation performance the distribution of surfactants in regular patterns was better than inverted patterns and regular patterns had lower remediation duration and cost the best patterns that achieved a 95 removal rate at the lowest cost were regular to find the optimal pumping scenario a simulation optimization model based on the gaussian process regressor gpr as a surrogate model has been used to reduce the optimization model s computational burden nine different kernels were applied and evaluated to find the best gpr also the bayesian hyperparameter optimization bho method was used to optimize the surrogate model and its performance was compared with the conventional grid search method the results showed that the use of the chi2 kernel and the bho method are the best choices a bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model has also been developed and its performance has been compared with single kernel gpr surrogate models the bhomk gp model s accuracy was significantly higher than single kernel gpr models the test and cross validation rmse of the bhomk gp model were 0 0385 and 0 0435 respectively finally the optimal remediation scenario has been obtained by substituting the bhomk gp model as a surrogate model instead of the sear simulation model the cost of remediation in the optimal strategy was 77 575 graphical abstract image 1 keywords surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl wells patterns multi kernel gaussian process regression bayesian hyperparameter optimization 1 introduction nowadays dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls are widely found worldwide due to widespread use in industry inappropriate disposal accidental spills and petrochemical leakage kueper and mcwhorter 1991 due to low solubility low mobility and high density dnapls may remain in the aquifers for a long time causing a toxic contaminant source qin et al 2007 by moving dnapl below the ground surface due to the ability of the porous medium to hold some dnapl the amount of leaked liquids decreases but if dnapl exceeds the soil retention capacity it can continue to move to the saturation zone up to bedrock or an impermeable layer as a result the remaining dnapl moves downward and some of the dnapl accumulated on the impermeable layer can act as a long term continuous source of toxic contamination suthersan et al 2016 qin et al 2007 typical soil and groundwater remediation techniques such as conventional pump and treat and vapor extraction have been proven unsuccessful or slightly successful in the remediation of dnapls due to their physical and chemical characteristics delshad et al 1996 in addition the conventional pump and treat method may take a long time sometimes decades to achieve remediation goals mackay and cherry 1989 surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear is an approved approach to remove dnapls from aquifer environments schaerlaekens et al 2005 in this method the solubility and mobility of dnapl are increased by adding a surfactant to the injected water in the conventional pump and treat method delshad et al 1996 as a result the sear method is more efficient but its cost is higher than the conventional method so a suitable design should be selected to minimize its cost and maximize its performance jiang et al 2015 luo et al 2013 capital and operating costs of the sear method are affected by various factors such as composition and amount of dnapl hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity and capillary properties composition and amount of surfactant and chemicals injected as well as the configuration of the system such as pattern and number of injection and extraction wells and their rates krebs yuill et al 1995 sabatini et al 1996 mayer and endres 2007 various studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of some factors on the aquifer remediation efficiency using the sear method but evaluating efficiencies of different wells patterns and their number has not been adequately considered the pattern of wells has a significant influence on the performance and cost of the sear method choosing an inappropriate pattern can significantly increase the remediation costs and even lead to incomplete contamination removal typically a single k spot regular or inverted or line drive regular or inverted pattern with two or three columns of wells is used in the sear method up to 2010 most studies have used a 2 column or 3 column line drive pattern in alameda point formerly navy air supply station an inverted line drive pattern 3 column with two injection wells in the middle four extraction wells and two hydraulic control

extraction wells for statistical analysis of sear huang et al 2003 used an inverted line drive 3 column pattern in which each column contains three wells schaerlaekens et al 2006 used an inverted 3 column line drive pattern with eight injection wells in the middle and seven extraction wells on each side in another study qin et al 2007 used a pattern similar to the line drive pattern with two columns of extraction wells in the contaminated zone and two columns of injection wells on each side of the contaminated zone each column consists of 3 wells lee 2010a used a simple line drive pattern consist of one extraction and one injection well on both sides of the contaminated area lee 2010b also used the same pattern in another study only inverted 3 column patterns were used in the mentioned studies and regular 3 column patterns were not used only inverted 3 column patterns have been used in the mentioned studies and regular 3 column patterns have not been investigated however regular 3 column patterns due to the proper distribution of surfactant in the contaminated area may be among the desirable patterns and therefore it is necessary to evaluate this type of pattern too subsequent studies have mainly used single k spot patterns and almost no line drive patterns have been utilized luo et al 2013 investigated using a surrogate model in developing an optimum remediation strategy of the sear method in this study according to contamination location they used a regular 9 spot pattern luo and lu 2014a compared the performance of surrogate models in aquifer remediation used a regular 5 spot pattern in which the extraction well was located on the center of contamination luo and lu 2014b also used a regular 5 spot pattern to analyze the sensitivity of the dnapl remediation process luo and lu 2014c for optimization of the sear method used a regular k spot pattern chu and lu 2015 used a regular 5 spot pattern to optimize the sear method in the remediation of an aquifer contaminated by dnapl hou et al 2015 used a surrogate model instead of multiphase flow numerical simulation models and the pattern of wells applied was a regular 7 spot pattern hou et al 2016 used a regular 7 spot pattern to analyze the uncertainty and sensitivity of the sear method in another study hou et al 2017 used a regular 7 spot pattern to optimize the sear process ouyang et al 2017a used a regular 9 spot wells pattern for chance constrained multi objective optimization of the remediation of an aquifer contaminated by dnapl they also used this pattern in two other studies ouyang et al 2017b 2017c jiang et al 2017 used a regular 5 spot pattern which was not symmetrically ordered for uncertainty analysis of multiphase flow simulation models luo et al 2018 used an 11 spot peripheral pattern in which wells were not regularized symmetrically to investigate the effect of using latin hypercube sampling on surrogate models to optimize surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation luo et al 2019 compared surrogate models based on different sampling methods in groundwater remediation optimization and used a regular 5 spot pattern shiau et al 2002 most studies have used regular k spot patterns while line drive patterns despite their proper performance have not received sufficient attention usually a presumed pattern is used to study aquifer remediation by the sear method and rarely more than one pattern has been considered and a comprehensive study of wells patterns performance in the sear method has not yet been conducted without a comprehensive evaluation of patterns it is not possible to find the appropriate pattern for example zhang et al 2005 developed a framework for the sear method optimization using a 2 column line drive pattern with three injection and extraction wells in each column then to evaluate the effect of wells patterns they used an inverted 3 column line drive pattern consisting of two extraction wells on both sides and three injection wells in the middle column finally they concluded that the pattern had no significant effect on dnapl remediation by examining only these two patterns this conclusion contradicts the result of the schaerlaekens et al 2005 study schaerlaekens et al 2005 used a multi objective optimization model to remediation dnapls using the sear method they used patterns such as regular 5 spot inverted 5 spot 2 column line drive with two wells in columns and inverted 3 column line drive with three wells in columns they examined the performance of a limited number of patterns and discussed the differences in the performance of the patterns and finally the inverted 3 column line drive and regular 5 spot pattern have been chosen as mentioned in most dnapl contaminated aquifer remediation studies by the sear method especially remediation optimization problems only one pattern has been used and different patterns have not been considered and evaluated to find the best pattern this subject causes the claimed optimal scenario not to be really a global optimal and be practically just a sub optimal pumping scenario for a particular pattern furthermore changes in remediation cost due to changes in wells patterns have not been adequately evaluated as a result a comprehensive study of wells patterns performance in the sear method is necessary in most previous studies the simulation optimization method based on surrogate models was used to find the optimal remediation scenario the numerical simulation model is computationally expensive so repeatedly invoking the numerical model in the simulation optimization model leads to a tremendous computational burden in order to decrease the computational burden embedding a surrogate model in the simulation optimization model instead of the numerical model is a suitable and approved approach jiang et al 2015 luo et al 2013 ouyang et al 2017c finding and constructing an accurate surrogate model for use in the simulation optimization model is an important and challenging issue in surrogate modeling various surrogate models have been used in dnapl contaminated aquifers remediation optimization studies such as radial basis function artificial neural network hou et al 2015 2017 luo et al 2013 luo and lu 2014c ouyang et al 2017c kriging hou et al 2015 2019 jiang et al 2015 luo et al 2013 luo and lu 2014a ouyang et al 2017b and support vector regression hou et al 2015 2017 2019 jiang et al 2015 ouyang et al 2017b 2017c however the gaussian process regressor gpr model has rarely been used as a surrogate model to the sear model the gpr is a powerful kernel based regression model that has a high ability to simulate complex non linear input output relationships of models to construct an accurate kernel based surrogate model the optimal kernel and hyperparameters must be obtained and used however although different kernels significantly impact the gpr model accuracy their performance has not been studied so far in this area the bayesian hyperparameters optimization bho method is a powerful method for finding optimal hyperparameters and thus constructing an optimal surrogate model bho has not been used in similar studies to surrogate model optimization in dnapl contaminated aquifers remediation and usually low efficiency methods such as grid search gs have been used ouyang et al 2017a 2017b 2017c this study contributes towards developing a hybrid surrogate model called bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model was developed for the optimization of dnapl contaminated aquifers remediation to construct the bhomk gp model the utilization of different kernels including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi squared chi2 have been investigated individually and in combination in this study considering the importance of the wells pattern on the remediation efficiency of dnapl contaminated aquifer by the sear method the effect of different patterns and the number of wells in each pattern on remediation performance were investigated then the patterns have been compared in terms of the total cost of the sear process and the best model has been selected to construct the surrogate model finally a simulation optimization model has been used to find the optimal pumping scenario based on the surrogate model for this purpose a bhomk gp surrogate model has been developed and embedded in the simulation optimization model instead of the numerical sear simulation model in brief as an extension of previous ones this paper intends to perform a comprehensive study on the performance of different patterns of wells and wants to provide the bhomk gp model as an accurate surrogate model for function approximation and applying in the optimization of dnapl contaminated aquifer remediation the contribution and novel aspects of this paper include the following 1 a comprehensive study has been carried out on the performance of different wells patterns which has not yet been conducted in the sear method optimization problem 2 the bho method has been used to find optimal kernel and hyperparameters of surrogate models and its performance has been compared with the conventional methods such as gs techniques 3 a bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model has been developed and its performance has been compared with conventional gpr surrogate models 2 methodology 2 1 sear simulation model delshad et al 1996 developed a three dimensional multicomponent multiphase compositional

general model for sear process simulation and has been used in various napls remediation studies zhang et al 2003 schaerlaekens et al 2005 jiang et al 2015 ouyang et al 2017c utchem is a three dimensional multiphase and multicomponent finite difference model in which chemical physical and biological properties as well as porous media heterogeneity non equilibrium sorption decay geochemical reactions and aquifer remediation by the sear method have been considered delshad et al 1996 qin et al 2007 ouyang et al 2017c 2 2 wells pattern usually single k spot regular or inverted and line drive regular or inverted with two or three columns of wells are used in the aquifer remediation design process in the single k spot pattern k wells are used which one well located at the center of the contamination plume and k 1 wells are around it if the extraction well is in the center of contamination and the injection wells are around it it is called the regular k spot fig 1 a and if the reverse pattern is considered it is called the inverted k spot fig 1b line drive patterns that are used in sear typically have 2 or 3 columns in the three column pattern the middle column is located in the middle range of the contaminant in this study the pattern in which the middle column wells were extraction wells and the two lateral wells were injection wells has been named regular 3 column

categories of regular k spot inverted k spot regular 3 column inverted 3 column and inverted 2 column 2 3 bayesian hyperparameter optimization bho machine learning models have multiple hyperparameters which control different aspects of the model s performance consequently finding optimal hyperparameters of models is vital goodfellow et al 2016 gs and random search are common techniques for optimizing hyperparameters gs is an exhaustive search algorithm in which all combinations of different hyperparameters values are evaluated using cross validation albon 2018 therefore its computational cost increases exponentially by increasing the number of hyperparameters goodfellow et al 2016 when hyperparameters dimensionality is high gs methods are relatively incompetent because they are quite uninformed in each iteration from the past evaluations bayesian hyperparameter optimization bho a bayes theorem based global optimization method considers past evaluations and selects hyperparameters set for evaluation at the next stage in an informed manner brochu et al 2010 wu et al 2019 and therefore provides better performance for the surrogate model to achieve the optimal hyperparameters the optimization problem of finding the minimum of a black box objective function as follow should be solved brochu et al 2010 shahriari et al 2016 4 x arg min x x f x here f x is the objective function x is the optimal hyperparameters set and x can be any value in the x domain in bho the inputs of the objective function are the values of the machine learning model hyperparameters and the output is a score such as the cross validation rmse of the machine learning model that should be minimized brochu et al 2010 shahriari et al 2016 wu et al 2019 bho as an iterative method proceeds by generating a probabilistic model of the objective function and employing the acquisition function to choose the most promising hyperparameters for the next iteration in each iteration the probabilistic model is re trained by all objective function observations generated so far then the performance of different candidate hyperparameters is determined by maximizing the acquisition function hutter et al 2019 the acquisition function can automatically trade off exploration and exploitation brochu et al 2010 hutter et al 2019 evaluating the black box objective function is computationally more expensive than the acquisition function the gaussian process model and the expected improvement have been used as the probabilistic model and the acquisition function in this study respectively mockus et al 1978 defined the improvement function as 5 i x max 0 f x f x here f x is the probabilistic surrogate model gaussian process f x is the value of the best point observed so far and x is its location i x is non negative and becomes positive when the prediction in x is higher than in x otherwise it becomes zero selected hyperparameters for the next iteration is obtained by maximizing the expected improvement brochu et al 2010 wu et al 2019 6 x arg max x e max 0 f t 1 x f x d t here d t is the accumulated observations generated so far d t x 1 t f x 1 t f x gp posterior predictive has a normal distribution with the mean μ x and the variance σ x at x accordingly distribution of improvement function i x is gaussian distribution the probability density function of i is computed as wu et al 2019 7 f i 1 2 π σ x exp μ x f x i 2 2 σ 2 x i 0 thereupon the expected improvement can be calculated as brochu et al 2010 8 e i i 0 i i 1 2 π σ x exp μ x f x i 2 2 σ 2 x d i σ x μ x f x σ x φ μ x f x σ x φ μ x f x σ x here φ and φ are cdf and pdf of the standard normal distribution respectively eq 8 can be calculated analytically brochu et al 2010 jones et al

result repeat loop until max iteration or time is reached 2 3 1 gaussian process regression gpr gaussian process regression gpr is a supervised method that uses the bayesian approach for regression and classification problems the gpr is a probability distribution over feasible functions that fit a group of data points and have excellent performance on small datasets rasmussen and williams 2005 the gpr is defined by a mean function representing the mean at any point in the input space m x and a covariance function k x x that sets the covariance between points 10 f x gp m x k x x gpr uses the kernel for defining the covariance of a prior distribution over the target functions and the training data to define the likelihood function posterior distribution over target functions is obtained using the bayes theorem and posterior mean is used for prediction rasmussen and williams 2005 pedregosa et al 2012 predictive equations for gpr is expressed as follows 11 f x y x n f c o v f 12 f e f x y x k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 y 13 c o v f k x x k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 k x x in which x and y are the input and output values of training data respectively also x is the input value of test data f is the output distribution of the target k is the covariance function that uses the kernel function instead σ is the noise variance to adds the noise inherent in the distribution several factors such as different kernels σ term noise level and hyperparameters of kernels were considered to achieve the best gpr the kernels used in this study are linear polynomial rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi2 functions they can be expressed as follows rasmussen and williams 2005 zhang et al 2007 rupp 2015 14 l i n e a r k x y x y 15 p o l y n o m i a l k x y x y l c 0 d 16

scale mixture parameter p is the periodicity of the kernel k υ is modified bessel function γ is the gamma function and υ is an additional parameter that controls the smoothness of the matérn function in aquifer remediation optimization studies usually only one kernel has been used to build the gpr model and such a wide range of kernels has not been considered since the outcome of combining valid kernels with positive weights is still a valid kernel bishop 2006 kernel based surrogate models can be constructed using combined kernels the resulting combined kernel is as follows 23 k i 1 n β i k i where β is a vector of positive weights for each kernel the properties of kernels are different from each other and when a surrogate model constructed with a single kernel may not be accurate enough a combination of kernels can be used to take advantage of their different properties and construct a more accurate model the multi kernel model can approximate the input output relationship of the simulation model more accurately if the weights and kernels hyperparameters are appropriately selected a bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model has been developed in this study the developed bhomk gp model automatically selects the most suitable kernel among stand alone and combined kernels finds the optimal hyperparameters values of the model and kernel using the bho method and trains the optimized surrogate model for this purpose first all stand alone and combined kernels along with the range of possible values for the hyperparameters of the kernels and the gaussian process model are considered after that training samples are scaled using the quantile transformer gilchrist 2000 minmax géron 2019 robust scaler method müller and guido 2016 then the optimal kernel and hyperparameters values are obtained using the bho method and cross validation rmse criterion finally the bhomk gp model is trained using training data the bhomk gp model is used as a surrogate model in the next step and is replaced by a numerical simulation model in the simulation optimization model to find the best remediation strategy 3 case study 3 1 site overview the shallow surficial aquifer in site 88 the location of the dry cleaning building at the marine corps base mcb camp lejeune jacksonville north carolina was selected as the case study aquifer the location of the aquifer and site 88 is shown in fig 2 there are no surface water bodies near the site and the nearest surface water is the new river located about 3000 ft 920 m west of the site duke 1999 two aquifer systems exist in site 88 a low permeability clay aquitard separates the shallow surficial aquifer and the castle hayne aquifer the shallow surficial aquifer has a depth of approximately 20 ft 6 1 m below the ground surface bgs the castle hayne aquifer is further divided into the upper castle hayne 7 5 23 m the middle castle hayne 23 38 m and the lower castle hayne 38 m ch2m hill 2010 duke 1999 duke engineering services has investigated the contaminated zone at site 88 in cooperation with baker environmental during 1997 and the first half of 1998 baker environmental 1998 duke 1999 cone penetration tests and soil borings have been used to collect detailed lithologic data and soil samples a relatively uniform depositional sequence of sediments has been recognized in borings across the site the shallow surficial aquifer consists of fine to very fine grained sands and silt and this combination is the predominant type of sediments up to approximately 18 ft 5 5 m bgs the shallow aquifer is restricted beneath by a clay aquitard at a depth of approximately 20 ft 6 1 m bgs core samples have indicated that sediments at depths of 18 20 ft 5 5 6 1 m bgs become significantly finer e g clayey silt sediment becomes finer with increasing depth from sandy silt to clayey silt the location of a geological cross section and the geological characteristics of that cross section are also presented in fig 2 two samples have been collected at depths of 17 2 and 19 1 ft 5 2 and 5 8 m which had very similar mineralogy both had greater than 80 quartz with some feldspar and pyrite clay minerals had comprised 7 and 9 of the samples respectively with kaolinite illite chlorite and smectite duke 1999 investigations have reported that the clay layer is approximately 14 16 ft 4 3 4 9 m thick beneath building 25 bear 1979 duke 1999 observation wells had also been installed to conduct pumping test the average values of 1 4 ft day 5 10 4 cm s for the hydraulic conductivity and 0 01 for the specific yield have been obtained by conducting the pumping test fig 2 also illustrates the potentiometric surface of the surficial aquifer obtained by the shallow monitoring wells 25 ft 7 6 m the potentiometric surface map shows a highly variable horizontal hydraulic gradient varying from 0 004 to 0 03 m m ch2m hill 2010 however as seen in fig 2 the hydraulic gradient is relatively low about 0 015 m m in the immediate of the contaminated area the water table fluctuates annually from about 7 to 9 ft 2 1 2 7 m bgs or about 16 18 ft 4 9 5 5 m above mean sea level amsl duke 1999 the saturated zone of the shallow aquifer can be roughly divided into three permeability zones the upper zone 18 ft bgs 5 5 m bgs the middle zone 18 19 ft bgs 5 5 5 8 m bgs and the lower zone 19 20 ft bgs 5 8 6 1 m bgs the upper zone is generally composed of fine to very fine sand and silty sand therefore the upper zone is the most permeable zone of the shallow aquifer and its hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be about 1 4 ft day 5 10 4 cm s results from multilevel sampler mls samples confirm that the hydraulic conductivity of the basal clayey sandy silt zone is lower than the upper zone and is estimated to be approximately 0 28 ft day 1 10 4 cm s the lower zone has been composed predominantly of clayey silt with a hydraulic conductivity of approximately 5 10 5 cm s 0 14 ft day hydraulic conductivity of the upper and middle zone has been estimated based on the analysis of tracer test data from mlss and for bottom zone has been estimated based on grain size analyses on 72 soil samples from the bottom 3 feet of the aquifer battelle et al 2001 using site data gained from field investigations as input parameters a geosystem model of the site has been constructed by the university of texas austin applying utchem these input parameters have been updated and calibrated against the field data obtained from the results of the conservative interwell tracer test citt and partitioning interwell tracer test pitt duke 1998a 1998b the study aquifer has been simulated using a three dimensional 25 25 16 mesh consisting of 10 000 grid blocks the horizontal extent of the model is 141 ft 23 m long by 80 ft 24 4 m wide with a 13 ft 4 m saturated thickness the dimensions of cells vary from 3 2 0 5 ft3 0 91 0 61 0 15 m3 in the center of the lowest layer to 24 12 2 ft3 7 31 3 66 0 61 m3 in the margin of the surface layer the pressures at two west east boundaries have been kept constant to establish a local hydraulic gradient of 0 015 representing observed field static water level conditions in the simulated region the other boundaries have been assumed as the no flux boundary the aquifer porosity in the model has a mean of 0 28 and a standard deviation of 0 05 the permeability in vertical is 10 of the permeability in horizontal battelle et al 2002 duke 1999 the distribution of the initial concentration volume fraction of the contaminant in the study area is presented in fig 3 this contamination has been caused by a spill of pce and its penetration into the ground for 300 day regarding the thickness of the clay aquitard at the base of the shallow aquifer the aquitard provides adequate protection against further downward migration of dnapl contamination to the underlying castle hayne aquifer duke 1999 the aquitard grid blocks have been treated as a no flux boundary and were assigned a low porosity of 0 01 and a low permeability of 5 6 10 4 ft day 2 10 7 cm s due to the pce contaminated area different sear scenarios with different wells patterns have been created water flush has been applied for ten days and then 4 alfoterra as a surfactant plus 16 ipa isopropyl alcohol as a cosolvent has been used some other values of physical and chemical parameters used in the sear simulation model are presented in table 1 simulation indicated that the highest dnapl saturations are located within the low permeability sediment layer i e clayey silt just above a clay aquitard at a depth of approximately 18 20 ft 5 5 6 1 m bgs 3 2 wells patterns for sear simulation models in this study five common patterns consisting of regular k spot inverted k spot regular 3 column inverted 3 column and 2 column were used to construct the sear model totally 35 sub patterns with different numbers and locations of wells have been considered regular k spot and inverted k spot consist of seven sub patterns from 2 spot to 8 spot the increase in the number of wells has continued to the extent that adding new wells does not significantly improve remediation performance in a k spot sub patterns the side wells are circular with a 15 ft radius from the contamination center fig 3a shows the location of the wells for the regular 7 spot sub pattern regular 3 column and inverted 3 column patterns have six sub patterns the spacing of the middle column wells is arranged so that all the wells are in the contamination area and the distance of the two side columns to the contamination center is 15 ft the 2 column pattern has nine sub patterns with a different number of wells each column has 1 2 or 3 wells and different combinations have been considered different scenarios are compared in terms of the time required and their cost to reach 95 of the remediation and the maximum simulation time has been considered 300 days in all scenarios the remediation process costs include fixed costs costs related to the number of wells and costs related to extraction and injection rate consisting of surfactant and cosolvent and extraction costs from previous studies water treatment and site equipment costs have been estimated at 20 000 and can be neglected because it is almost the same in all scenarios costs related to each well such as drilling well pump purchase and necessary equipment are estimated at 3000 the surfactant and ipa costs have been considered 2 and 1 per liter respectively and the cost of extraction such as energy and monitoring has been assumed 0 25 per m3 3 3 surrogate models of the sear model the best pattern from the previous step was selected and the sear simulation model was created based on it in this study total remediation duration and wells injection rates have been selected as surrogate model inputs and the contamination removal rate obtained from the sear numerical model has been selected as the model s output for each input sample injection wells rates were in the range of 0 200 ft3 day and the remediation duration was in the range of 10 200 days the latin hypercube sampling lhs method was utilized to generate 220 samples to cover all feasible space appropriately the samples were divided into training 75 and test 25 subsets using stratified random sampling the corresponding output for each input sample has been achieved by running the sear model first nine gpr models have been constructed using nine different kernel functions including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi2 functions the quantile transformer gilchrist 2000 minmax géron 2019 and robust scaler methods müller and guido 2016 were used for feature scaling in the preprocessing step in order to find the optimal hyperparameters values of the gpr model and kernel the bho method was applied in this study the performance of bho and gs methods have been examined and compared two criteria used to estimate the performance of gpr models in cross validation and parameter optimization were root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 the effect of hyperparameter optimization techniques and different kernels on single kernel gpr performance has been evaluated according to the performance criteria then the bhomk gp model was constructed and its performance was compared with single kernel models finally the surrogate model with the best performance was selected for embedding in the simulation optimization model gpr models have been developed by python programming language and the scikit learn pedregosa et al 2012 a comprehensive machine learning module of python 3 4 optimization model a non linear optimization model was developed for minimizing the remediation cost to obtain the optimal pumping scenario remediation duration and rates of injection wells are decision variables and the desired removal rate and range of decision variables are constraints the best trained surrogate model has been replaced with the sear model in the optimization model the optimization model in this study can be expressed as follows

of t 95 time to 95 remediation and r 100d percent of remediation after 100 days were used to compare the sub patterns performance better 4 1 regular inverted k spot patterns fig 4 a shows the pattern of wells in regular 2 spot to regular 8 spot sub patterns and fig 5 a shows the results of pce removal against time in these eight sub patterns as expected with increasing wells in regular k spot sub patterns the remediation performance was improved and uniformity in surfactant distribution was increased however from the regular 6 spot sub pattern increasing the number of wells had no significant effect on improving efficiency the 4 spot sub pattern did not perform better than the 3 spot sub pattern but the t 95 was 132 days in both cases because as shown in fig 3a due to the flow direction right to left the surfactant was not adequately distributed on the right side of the contamination zone and caused a small part of the area remediated with a longer delay the 7 spot and 8 spot sub patterns performed best and their remediation diagrams were almost the same increasing the number of wells from 7 spot to 8 spot did not improve the performance because surfactant distribution has almost been optimized from the 7 spot sub pattern t 95 for regular 7 spot and regular 8 spot sub patterns were 89 and 85 days respectively except for the 2 spot sub pattern all sub patterns have reached 100 remediation in less than 200 days this difference was due to the surfactant s asymmetric distribution because no well was located upstream of the contaminated area and the surfactant cannot reach that area adequately in the 2 spot sub pattern fig 6 shows the surfactant distribution in the 2 spot and 7 spot sub patterns the r 100d value for regular 3 spot to regular 5 spot sub patterns was approximately 90 and for regular 6 spot was 94 fig 4b represents the inverted 2 spot to inverted 8 spot sub patterns and fig 5b shows the removal rate results against time for seven sub patterns from inverted 2 spot to inverted 8 spot in the inverted k spot sub patterns as the number of wells increased the remediation performance improved up to the 7 spot sub pattern and the uniformity of the surfactant distribution was increased by the 300th day none of the sub patterns achieved a 90 removal rate the inverted 2 spot sub pattern performed worse than the others due to the unbalanced distribution of surfactants the inverted 3 spot 4 spot and 5 spot sub patterns performed similarly the remediation performance did not differ significantly with the increase in the number of wells more than the inverted 7 spot sub pattern therefore the inverted 7 spot and inverted 8 spot sub patterns performance were almost similar in the first ten days of water flushing the removal rate was lower than regular k spot patterns because no well was located in the contaminated area the average removal rate of pce in the regular k spot pattern was higher than the inverted k spot because the extraction well was located in the center of contamination which causes increasing the concentration of surfactant around the extraction well i e in the center of the contaminated area which has the highest concentration of contaminant thus all regular k spot sub patterns performed significantly better than the inverted k spot sub patterns the curve slope of the removal percent against the time was higher in the regular k spot pattern than in the inverted k spot pattern 4 2 line drive patterns regular inverted 3 column 2 column fig 7 a shows the regular 3 column sub patterns and fig 8 a shows the results of the remediation percent for these six sub patterns with an increasing number of wells in regular 3 column sub patterns the remediation performance was improved due to increasing surfactant distribution uniformity all sub patterns have reached 100 remediation in less than 170 days 3 column in6 ex2 and 3 column in6 ex3 sub patterns achieved complete removal in 90 days with the same t 95 value and performance in general due to the inappropriate distribution of surfactants in the contaminated area the 3 column in4 ex2 sub pattern had the weakest performance in this sub pattern the surfactant was not distributed appropriately in the middle of the contaminated zone and between two extraction wells so this sub pattern was weaker than the others overall sub patterns with six injection wells performed better and were relatively similar fig 7b shows the inverted 3 column sub patterns and fig 8b shows the results of the remediation percent for these sub patterns the remediation performance in inverted 3 column sub patterns also improved with increasing the number of injection wells however none of the sub patterns have achieved 100 remediation until the 300th day with an increasing number of extraction wells in inverted 3 column sub patterns the remediation performance was improved due to increasing surfactant distribution uniformity in the contaminated area in sub patterns with less than four extraction wells such as inverted 3 column in1 ex2 the surfactant did not suitably penetrate the whole contaminated area so these areas were not appropriately remediated only 3 column in3 ex6 and 3 column in2 ex6 sub patterns had a removal rate of more than 90 at the end of the 300 days of remediation the 3 column in1 ex2 eventually reached a 75 removal rate fig 9 a shows the 2 column sub patterns and fig 9b shows the results of the remediation percent for these nine sub patterns the 2 column sub patterns including 2 column in1 ex1 and 2 column in3 ex1 sub patterns which had one extraction well were the best and sub patterns with two extraction wells were the worst sub patterns with two extraction wells had unsatisfactory performance because the surfactant was not suitably distributed in the middle of the two extraction wells these sub patterns have not achieved a 100 removal rate in 300 days although the number of 2 column in1 ex1 sub pattern wells was less than the 2 column in3 ex1 sub pattern wells they both had similar performance because their surfactant distribution was approximately similar these sub patterns reached 100 remediation in 175 days and t 95 and r 100d for these sub patterns were 171 days and 42 respectively all sub patterns of the 2 column pattern have not eliminated any contaminants before 30 days because both the extraction and the injection wells are out of the contaminated area and are farther from each other than other patterns generally by comparing the remediation performance of line drive patterns it was found that the removal rate of pce in the regular 3 column pattern was higher than other line drive patterns the removal speed of contaminants in the inverted 3 column sub patterns was higher than the 2 column sub patterns before reaching the 90 removal rate r 100d approximately 80 but the ability of 2 column sub patterns to complete removal of pce have been higher the pce removal curve for the best sub pattern of each base pattern has been shown in fig 10 overall regular sub patterns had the best performance and highest contamination removal rates among all sub patterns in the shortest time in regular or convergent patterns that flow direction was towards the center of the contamination compared with the inverted or divergent patterns the centralization of the surfactant and chemicals injected were higher in the contamination area and the surfactants were less present in the non contaminated area as a result these patterns delivered better performance under the same conditions by choosing the appropriate number of injection and extraction wells in the form of a regular pattern it can be expected that the resulting pattern is appropriate 4 3 cost analysis in the previous section the effect of the number and location of wells in different patterns was presented the remediation cost of different patterns is as important as their performance thus the costs of the different sub patterns have been compared in this section for this purpose only sub patterns with more than 95 pce removal have been considered the pce removal rate in 19 of 35 examined sub patterns was more than 95 and fig 11 shows the cost of that 19 sub patterns since the major cost of remediation is related to surfactants and chemicals the lower the remediation time the less the remediation cost regular 8 spot and regular 3 column in6 ex2 sub patterns have reached a 95 pce removal threshold in 85 days given that both have eight injection and extraction wells both have the lowest cost following these two sub patterns was the regular 7 spot sub pattern with seven wells and reached a 95 removal in 89 days regular 3 column in6 ex3 sub pattern reached a 95 removal threshold in 86 days but it was finally more expensive than the regular 7 spot sub pattern due to owning nine wells none of the inverted sub patterns were among selected sub patterns and they have not reached the 95 remediation level 2 column sub patterns also did not have a proper remediation time and were more expensive due to a long remediation time the results showed that as regards the injection rate was constant the cost has practically been a function of time the amount of surfactant injected and other costs are negligible compared to chemicals cost details of the five least cost scenarios are presented in table 2 according to the cost and duration of remediation the regular 8 spot pattern was selected as the superior arrangement then a simulation optimization model was developed to minimize the remediation cost however due to the high computational load of the sear numerical simulation model a surrogate model was replaced in the simulation optimization model 4 4 analysis of gpr model performance nine gpr models were constructed using nine different kernel functions including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi2 functions and the effect of different kernels on the performance of the gpr model was investigated also to find the optimal hyperparameters the bho method was used and compared with the gs method 5 fold cross validation cv was used to prevent overfitting and the performance criteria in cross validation were rmse and r2 the test rmse values of the trained gpr models are shown in fig 12 a bunch of points represents models optimized by the bho method and the other bunch represents models optimized by the gs method all gpr models optimized with the bho method had higher accuracy than models optimized with the gs method the greatest improvement of accuracy was related to models with chi2 and matérn kernels and the lowest improvement was related to models with sigmoid and rbf kernels in addition since the bho method selects the next hyperparameters in each iteration in an informed method the computational load and time of finding the optimal hyperparameters have also been reduced compared to the gs method the results also showed that gpr models are very sensitive to the kernels used the chi2 kernel had the best performance in this study followed by polynomial and rbf kernels the test rmse of the gpr model constructed by the chi2 kernel was 49 less than the average test rmse of the other eight models models constructed with linear and sigmoid kernels were not accurate in order to improve the ability of the gpr model to approximate the input output relationship of the numerical simulation model a bhomk gp model was developed and trained and its performance was compared with single kernel models table 3 presents the performance criteria values of single kernel gpr models and the bhomk gp model in each column the better performance criteria values the greener they are and the worse values the redder they are the results showed that the accuracy of the bhomk gp model was higher than single kernel models so that its test and cv rmse were about 23 and 40 less than the best single kernel model respectively the selected hybrid kernel used to construct the bhomk gp model was a combination of the matérn rbf and chi2 kernels the kernel type and the values of the optimal hyperparameters of models and their kernel have been presented in table 4 4 5 optimization results the non linear optimization model in which the sear simulation model has substituted with the bhomk gp model was developed using the python programming environment the regular 8 spot sub pattern which had the best remediation performance and has the most accurate surrogate model was considered to find the optimal pumping scenario the optimal pumping scenario and the corresponding removal rate calculated by the sear simulation model are summarized in table 5 the sear simulation model s contaminant removal rate is 95 4 which satisfies the remediation target the remediation cost was significantly reduced through optimization compared to the cost of elementary scenarios the lowest remediation cost of elementary scenarios was 126469 while the cost was reduced by optimization to 77575 5 summary and conclusions in this study various wells patterns with different wells numbers were used to construct the surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation model five patterns including regular and inverted k spot regular and inverted 3 column line drive and 2 column line drive were examined the performance of 35 sub patterns was investigated and top sub patterns were recognized based on the lowest remediation time then all sub patterns were compared and evaluated considering the remediation cost and the best sub pattern was selected thereupon 220 random samples were generated using lhs to train the surrogate models kernels have a significant effect on the accuracy of gpr models so nine different kernels were used to construct gpr models and the performance of kernels was examined also the effect of the bayesian hyperparameter optimization method was evaluated and compared with the gs method afterward a bhomk gp model was developed to improve the accuracy of gpr models and its performance was evaluated in comparison with single kernel gpr models eventually the optimal remediation scenario was achieved by minimizing the remediation cost by replacing the bhomk gp model with the sear simulation model in the optimization simulation model the main results of this study have been presented as follows 1 the pattern of the wells has a significant effect on the performance of the sear method only 54 3 of used sub patterns had a contamination removal rate greater than 95 and none of the inverted sub patterns were among them regular or convergent patterns performed best because surfactant distribution in the contaminated area was better in regular patterns 2 the performance of the gpr surrogate model depends on the type of kernel used gpr models constructed with the chi2 kernel had the best accuracy and performance the r2 and rmse values of the test dataset for the gpr model with chi2 kernel were 0 976 and 0 0501 respectively which shows the gpr model s ability to approximate the sear simulation model s input output relationship the test rmse of the gpr model constructed by the chi2 kernel was 49 less than the average test rmse of the other eight models 3 the results showed that using the bho method to optimize the values of hyperparameters has led to the construction of more accurate surrogate models e g the test rmse of the gpr model with the chi2 kernel whose optimal hyperparameters were obtained using the bho method was 34 less than the gpr model which used the gs method 4 the bhomk gp model s accuracy was significantly higher than single kernel gpr models the test and cv rmse of the bhomk gp model were 0 0385 and 0 0435 respectively which were 23 and 40 less than the same criteria values for the best single core model funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from

11876,surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear is an appropriate method for dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls remediation however due to the high cost of chemicals used choosing the suitable wells pattern and the optimal pumping scenario is necessary in this study the sear method performance for regular convergent and inverted divergent patterns with different wells numbers have been evaluated the performance of 5 categories of patterns including 35 different sub patterns was evaluated in a pce contaminated aquifer the results show that the uniformity and appropriate surfactant distribution in the contaminated area significantly improves remediation performance the distribution of surfactants in regular patterns was better than inverted patterns and regular patterns had lower remediation duration and cost the best patterns that achieved a 95 removal rate at the lowest cost were regular to find the optimal pumping scenario a simulation optimization model based on the gaussian process regressor gpr as a surrogate model has been used to reduce the optimization model s computational burden nine different kernels were applied and evaluated to find the best gpr also the bayesian hyperparameter optimization bho method was used to optimize the surrogate model and its performance was compared with the conventional grid search method the results showed that the use of the chi2 kernel and the bho method are the best choices a bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model has also been developed and its performance has been compared with single kernel gpr surrogate models the bhomk gp model s accuracy was significantly higher than single kernel gpr models the test and cross validation rmse of the bhomk gp model were 0 0385 and 0 0435 respectively finally the optimal remediation scenario has been obtained by substituting the bhomk gp model as a surrogate model instead of the sear simulation model the cost of remediation in the optimal strategy was 77 575 graphical abstract image 1 keywords surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl wells patterns multi kernel gaussian process regression bayesian hyperparameter optimization 1 introduction nowadays dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls are widely found worldwide due to widespread use in industry inappropriate disposal accidental spills and petrochemical leakage kueper and mcwhorter 1991 due to low solubility low mobility and high density dnapls may remain in the aquifers for a long time causing a toxic contaminant source qin et al 2007 by moving dnapl below the ground surface due to the ability of the porous medium to hold some dnapl the amount of leaked liquids decreases but if dnapl exceeds the soil retention capacity it can continue to move to the saturation zone up to bedrock or an impermeable layer as a result the remaining dnapl moves downward and some of the dnapl accumulated on the impermeable layer can act as a long term continuous source of toxic contamination suthersan et al 2016 qin et al 2007 typical soil and groundwater remediation techniques such as conventional pump and treat and vapor extraction have been proven unsuccessful or slightly successful in the remediation of dnapls due to their physical and chemical characteristics delshad et al 1996 in addition the conventional pump and treat method may take a long time sometimes decades to achieve remediation goals mackay and cherry 1989 surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear is an approved approach to remove dnapls from aquifer environments schaerlaekens et al 2005 in this method the solubility and mobility of dnapl are increased by adding a surfactant to the injected water in the conventional pump and treat method delshad et al 1996 as a result the sear method is more efficient but its cost is higher than the conventional method so a suitable design should be selected to minimize its cost and maximize its performance jiang et al 2015 luo et al 2013 capital and operating costs of the sear method are affected by various factors such as composition and amount of dnapl hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity and capillary properties composition and amount of surfactant and chemicals injected as well as the configuration of the system such as pattern and number of injection and extraction wells and their rates krebs yuill et al 1995 sabatini et al 1996 mayer and endres 2007 various studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of some factors on the aquifer remediation efficiency using the sear method but evaluating efficiencies of different wells patterns and their number has not been adequately considered the pattern of wells has a significant influence on the performance and cost of the sear method choosing an inappropriate pattern can significantly increase the remediation costs and even lead to incomplete contamination removal typically a single k spot regular or inverted or line drive regular or inverted pattern with two or three columns of wells is used in the sear method up to 2010 most studies have used a 2 column or 3 column line drive pattern in alameda point formerly navy air supply station an inverted line drive pattern 3 column with two injection wells in the middle four extraction wells and two hydraulic control wells have been used shiau et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 used the utchem university of texas chemical compositional simulator software and 2 column line drive pattern with three injection and three extraction wells for statistical analysis of sear huang et al 2003 used an inverted line drive 3 column pattern in which each column contains three wells schaerlaekens et al 2006 used an inverted 3 column line drive pattern with eight injection wells in the middle and seven extraction wells on each side in another study qin et al 2007 used a pattern similar to the line drive pattern with two columns of extraction wells in the contaminated zone and two columns of injection wells on each side of the contaminated zone each column consists of 3 wells lee 2010a used a simple line drive pattern consist of one extraction and one injection well on both sides of the contaminated area lee 2010b also used the same pattern in another study only inverted 3 column patterns were used in the mentioned studies and regular 3 column patterns were not used only inverted 3 column patterns have been used in the mentioned studies and regular 3 column patterns have not been investigated however regular 3 column patterns due to the proper distribution of surfactant in the contaminated area may be among the desirable patterns and therefore it is necessary to evaluate this type of pattern too subsequent studies have mainly used single k spot patterns and almost no line drive patterns have been utilized luo et al 2013 investigated using a surrogate model in developing an optimum remediation strategy of the sear method in this study according to contamination location they used a regular 9 spot pattern luo and lu 2014a compared the performance of surrogate models in aquifer remediation used a regular 5 spot pattern in which the extraction well was located on the center of contamination luo and lu 2014b also used a regular 5 spot pattern to analyze the sensitivity of the dnapl remediation process luo and lu 2014c for optimization of the sear method used a regular k spot pattern chu and lu 2015 used a regular 5 spot pattern to optimize the sear method in the remediation of an aquifer contaminated by dnapl hou et al 2015 used a surrogate model instead of multiphase flow numerical simulation models and the pattern of wells applied was a regular 7 spot pattern hou et al 2016 used a regular 7 spot pattern to analyze the uncertainty and sensitivity of the sear method in another study hou et al 2017 used a regular 7 spot pattern to optimize the sear process ouyang et al 2017a used a regular 9 spot wells pattern for chance constrained multi objective optimization of the remediation of an aquifer contaminated by dnapl they also used this pattern in two other studies ouyang et al 2017b 2017c jiang et al 2017 used a regular 5 spot pattern which was not symmetrically ordered for uncertainty analysis of multiphase flow simulation models luo et al 2018 used an 11 spot peripheral pattern in which wells were not regularized symmetrically to investigate the effect of using latin hypercube sampling on surrogate models to optimize surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation luo et al 2019 compared surrogate models based on different sampling methods in groundwater remediation optimization and used a regular 5 spot pattern shiau et al 2002 most studies have used regular k spot patterns while line drive patterns despite their proper performance have not received sufficient attention usually a presumed pattern is used to study aquifer remediation by the sear method and rarely more than one pattern has been considered and a comprehensive study of wells patterns performance in the sear method has not yet been conducted without a comprehensive evaluation of patterns it is not possible to find the appropriate pattern for example zhang et al 2005 developed a framework for the sear method optimization using a 2 column line drive pattern with three injection and extraction wells in each column then to evaluate the effect of wells patterns they used an inverted 3 column line drive pattern consisting of two extraction wells on both sides and three injection wells in the middle column finally they concluded that the pattern had no significant effect on dnapl remediation by examining only these two patterns this conclusion contradicts the result of the schaerlaekens et al 2005 study schaerlaekens et al 2005 used a multi objective optimization model to remediation dnapls using the sear method they used patterns such as regular 5 spot inverted 5 spot 2 column line drive with two wells in columns and inverted 3 column line drive with three wells in columns they examined the performance of a limited number of patterns and discussed the differences in the performance of the patterns and finally the inverted 3 column line drive and regular 5 spot pattern have been chosen as mentioned in most dnapl contaminated aquifer remediation studies by the sear method especially remediation optimization problems only one pattern has been used and different patterns have not been considered and evaluated to find the best pattern this subject causes the claimed optimal scenario not to be really a global optimal and be practically just a sub optimal pumping scenario for a particular pattern furthermore changes in remediation cost due to changes in wells patterns have not been adequately evaluated as a result a comprehensive study of wells patterns performance in the sear method is necessary in most previous studies the simulation optimization method based on surrogate models was used to find the optimal remediation scenario the numerical simulation model is computationally expensive so repeatedly invoking the numerical model in the simulation optimization model leads to a tremendous computational burden in order to decrease the computational burden embedding a surrogate model in the simulation optimization model instead of the numerical model is a suitable and approved approach jiang et al 2015 luo et al 2013 ouyang et al 2017c finding and constructing an accurate surrogate model for use in the simulation optimization model is an important and challenging issue in surrogate modeling various surrogate models have been used in dnapl contaminated aquifers remediation optimization studies such as radial basis function artificial neural network hou et al 2015 2017 luo et al 2013 luo and lu 2014c ouyang et al 2017c kriging hou et al 2015 2019 jiang et al 2015 luo et al 2013 luo and lu 2014a ouyang et al 2017b and support vector regression hou et al 2015 2017 2019 jiang et al 2015 ouyang et al 2017b 2017c however the gaussian process regressor gpr model has rarely been used as a surrogate model to the sear model the gpr is a powerful kernel based regression model that has a high ability to simulate complex non linear input output relationships of models to construct an accurate kernel based surrogate model the optimal kernel and hyperparameters must be obtained and used however although different kernels significantly impact the gpr model accuracy their performance has not been studied so far in this area the bayesian hyperparameters optimization bho method is a powerful method for finding optimal hyperparameters and thus constructing an optimal surrogate model bho has not been used in similar studies to surrogate model optimization in dnapl contaminated aquifers remediation and usually low efficiency methods such as grid search gs have been used ouyang et al 2017a 2017b 2017c this study contributes towards developing a hybrid surrogate model called bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model was developed for the optimization of dnapl contaminated aquifers remediation to construct the bhomk gp model the utilization of different kernels including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi squared chi2 have been investigated individually and in combination in this study considering the importance of the wells pattern on the remediation efficiency of dnapl contaminated aquifer by the sear method the effect of different patterns and the number of wells in each pattern on remediation performance were investigated then the patterns have been compared in terms of the total cost of the sear process and the best model has been selected to construct the surrogate model finally a simulation optimization model has been used to find the optimal pumping scenario based on the surrogate model for this purpose a bhomk gp surrogate model has been developed and embedded in the simulation optimization model instead of the numerical sear simulation model in brief as an extension of previous ones this paper intends to perform a comprehensive study on the performance of different patterns of wells and wants to provide the bhomk gp model as an accurate surrogate model for function approximation and applying in the optimization of dnapl contaminated aquifer remediation the contribution and novel aspects of this paper include the following 1 a comprehensive study has been carried out on the performance of different wells patterns which has not yet been conducted in the sear method optimization problem 2 the bho method has been used to find optimal kernel and hyperparameters of surrogate models and its performance has been compared with the conventional methods such as gs techniques 3 a bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model has been developed and its performance has been compared with conventional gpr surrogate models 2 methodology 2 1 sear simulation model delshad et al 1996 developed a three dimensional multicomponent multiphase compositional finite difference simulator for the analysis of the sear for napls contaminants the mass conservation equation for each component can be described as follows delshad et al 1996 qin et al 2007 ouyang et al 2017c 1 t ϕ c k ρ k l 1 n p ρ k c k l u l ϕ s l d k l c k l r k in which k is the index of the components including water oil and surfactant also l is the phase index including water oil and

model used in the simulation of the present study was first developed by delshad et al 1996 and was more improved by them under utchem university of texas chemical compositional simulator utchem is a general model for sear process simulation and has been used in various napls remediation studies zhang et al 2003 schaerlaekens et al 2005 jiang et al 2015 ouyang et al 2017c utchem is a three dimensional multiphase and multicomponent finite difference model in which chemical physical and biological properties as well as porous media heterogeneity non equilibrium sorption decay geochemical reactions and aquifer remediation by the sear method have been considered delshad et al 1996 qin et al 2007 ouyang et al 2017c 2 2 wells pattern usually single k spot regular or inverted and line drive regular or inverted with two or three columns of wells are used in the aquifer remediation design process in the single k spot pattern k wells are used which one well located at the center of the contamination plume and k 1 wells are around it if the extraction well is in the center of contamination and the injection wells are around it it is called the regular k spot fig 1 a and if the reverse pattern is considered it is called the inverted k spot fig 1b line drive patterns that are used in sear typically have 2 or 3 columns in the three column pattern the middle column is located in the middle range of the contaminant in this study the pattern in which the middle column wells were extraction wells and the two lateral wells were injection wells has been named regular 3 column in k ex j k is the number of injection wells and j is the number of extraction wells fig 1c and if the wells were reversed they have been named by inverted 3 column in k ex j fig 1d also the 2 column pattern one column extraction wells and the other injection wells have been identified as 2 column in k ex j fig 1e in this study a groundwater remediation simulation model was developed using five categories of regular k spot inverted k spot regular 3 column inverted 3 column and inverted 2 column 2 3 bayesian hyperparameter optimization bho machine learning models have multiple hyperparameters which control different aspects of the model s performance consequently finding optimal hyperparameters of models is vital goodfellow et al 2016 gs and random search are common techniques for optimizing hyperparameters gs is an exhaustive search algorithm in which all combinations of different hyperparameters values are evaluated using cross validation albon 2018 therefore its computational cost increases exponentially by increasing the number of hyperparameters goodfellow et al 2016 when hyperparameters dimensionality is high gs methods are relatively incompetent because they are quite uninformed in each iteration from the past evaluations bayesian hyperparameter optimization bho a bayes theorem based global optimization method considers past evaluations and selects hyperparameters set for evaluation at the next stage in an informed manner brochu et al 2010 wu et al 2019 and therefore provides better performance for the surrogate model to achieve the optimal hyperparameters the optimization problem of finding the minimum of a black box objective function as follow should be solved brochu et al 2010 shahriari et al 2016 4 x arg min x x f x here f x is the objective function x is the optimal hyperparameters set and x can be any value in the x domain in bho the inputs of the objective function are the values of the machine learning model hyperparameters and the output is a score such as the cross validation rmse of the machine learning model that should be minimized brochu et al 2010 shahriari et al 2016 wu et al 2019 bho as an iterative method proceeds by generating a probabilistic model of the objective function and employing the acquisition function to choose the most promising hyperparameters for the next iteration in each iteration the probabilistic model is re trained by all objective function observations generated so far then the performance of different candidate hyperparameters is determined by maximizing the acquisition function hutter et al 2019 the acquisition function can automatically trade off exploration and exploitation brochu et al 2010 hutter et al 2019 evaluating the black box objective function is computationally more expensive than the acquisition function the gaussian process model and the expected improvement have been used as the probabilistic model and the acquisition function in this study respectively mockus et al 1978 defined the improvement function as 5 i x max 0 f x f x here f x is the probabilistic surrogate model gaussian process f x is the value of the best point observed so far and x is its location i x is non negative and becomes positive when the prediction in x is higher than in x otherwise it becomes zero selected hyperparameters for the next iteration is obtained by maximizing the expected improvement brochu et al 2010 wu et al 2019 6 x arg max x e max 0 f t 1 x f x d t here d t is the accumulated observations generated so far d t x 1 t f x 1 t f x gp

and classification problems the gpr is a probability distribution over feasible functions that fit a group of data points and have excellent performance on small datasets rasmussen and williams 2005 the gpr is defined by a mean function representing the mean at any point in the input space m x and a covariance function k x x that sets the covariance between points 10 f x gp m x k x x gpr uses the kernel for defining the covariance of a prior distribution over the target functions and the training data to define the likelihood function posterior distribution over target functions is obtained using the bayes theorem and posterior mean is used for prediction rasmussen and williams 2005 pedregosa et al 2012 predictive equations for gpr is expressed as follows 11 f x y x n f c o v f 12 f e f x y x k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 y 13 c o v f k x x k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 k x x in which x and y are the input and output values of training data respectively also x is the input value of test data f is the output distribution of the target k is the covariance function that uses the kernel function instead σ is the noise variance to adds the noise inherent in the distribution several factors such as different kernels σ term noise level and hyperparameters of kernels were considered to achieve the best gpr the kernels used in this study are linear polynomial rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi2 functions they can be expressed as follows rasmussen and williams 2005 zhang et al 2007 rupp 2015 14 l i n e a r k x y x y 15 p o l y n o m i a l k x y x y l c 0 d 16

in aquifer remediation optimization studies usually only one kernel has been used to build the gpr model and such a wide range of kernels has not been considered since the outcome of combining valid kernels with positive weights is still a valid kernel bishop 2006 kernel based surrogate models can be constructed using combined kernels the resulting combined kernel is as follows 23 k i 1 n β i k i where β is a vector of positive weights for each kernel the properties of kernels are different from each other and when a surrogate model constructed with a single kernel may not be accurate enough a combination of kernels can be used to take advantage of their different properties and construct a more accurate model the multi kernel model can approximate the input output relationship of the simulation model more accurately if the weights and kernels hyperparameters are appropriately selected a bho optimized multi kernel gaussian process bhomk gp model has been developed in this study the developed bhomk gp model automatically selects the most suitable kernel among stand alone and combined kernels finds the optimal hyperparameters values of the model and kernel using the bho method and trains the optimized surrogate model for this purpose first all stand alone and combined kernels along with the range of possible values for the hyperparameters of the kernels and the gaussian process model are considered after that training samples are scaled using the quantile transformer gilchrist 2000 minmax géron 2019 robust scaler method müller and guido 2016 then the optimal kernel and hyperparameters values are obtained using the bho method and cross validation rmse criterion finally the bhomk gp model is trained using training data the bhomk gp model is used as a surrogate model in the next step and is replaced by a numerical simulation model in the simulation optimization model to find the best remediation strategy 3 case study 3 1 site overview the shallow surficial aquifer in site 88 the location of the dry cleaning building at the marine corps base mcb camp lejeune jacksonville north carolina was selected as the case study aquifer the location of the aquifer and site 88 is shown in fig 2 there are no surface water bodies near the site and the nearest surface water is the new river located about 3000 ft 920 m west of the site duke 1999 two aquifer systems exist in site 88 a low permeability clay aquitard separates the shallow surficial aquifer and the castle hayne aquifer the shallow surficial aquifer has a depth of approximately 20 ft 6 1 m below the ground surface bgs the castle hayne aquifer is further divided into the upper castle hayne 7 5 23 m the middle castle hayne 23 38 m and the lower castle hayne 38 m ch2m hill 2010 duke 1999 duke engineering services has investigated the contaminated zone at site 88 in cooperation with baker environmental during 1997 and the first half of 1998 baker environmental 1998 duke 1999 cone penetration tests and soil borings have been used to collect detailed lithologic data and soil samples a relatively uniform depositional sequence of sediments has been recognized in borings across the site the shallow surficial aquifer consists of fine to very fine grained sands and silt and this combination is the predominant type of sediments up to approximately 18 ft 5 5 m bgs the shallow aquifer is restricted beneath by a clay aquitard at a depth of approximately 20 ft 6 1 m bgs core samples have indicated that sediments at depths of 18 20 ft 5 5 6 1 m bgs become significantly finer e g clayey silt sediment becomes finer with increasing depth from sandy silt to clayey silt the location of a geological cross section and the geological characteristics of that cross section are also presented in fig 2 two samples have been collected at depths of 17 2 and 19 1 ft 5 2 and 5 8 m which had very similar mineralogy both had greater than 80 quartz with some feldspar and pyrite clay minerals had comprised 7 and 9 of the samples respectively with kaolinite illite chlorite and smectite duke 1999 investigations have reported that the clay layer is approximately 14 16 ft 4 3 4 9 m thick beneath building 25 bear 1979 duke 1999 observation wells had also been installed to conduct pumping test the average values of 1 4 ft day 5 10 4 cm s for the hydraulic conductivity and 0 01 for the specific yield have been obtained by conducting the pumping test fig 2 also illustrates the potentiometric surface of the surficial aquifer obtained by the shallow monitoring wells 25 ft 7 6 m the potentiometric surface map shows a highly variable horizontal hydraulic gradient varying from 0 004 to 0 03 m m ch2m hill 2010 however as seen in fig 2 the hydraulic gradient is relatively low about 0 015 m m in the immediate of the contaminated area the water table fluctuates annually from about 7 to 9 ft 2 1 2 7 m bgs or about 16 18 ft 4 9 5 5 m above mean sea level amsl duke 1999 the saturated zone of the shallow aquifer can be roughly divided into three permeability zones the upper zone 18 ft bgs 5 5 m bgs the middle zone 18 19 ft bgs 5 5 5 8 m bgs and the lower zone 19 20 ft bgs 5 8 6 1 m bgs the upper zone is generally composed of fine to very fine sand and silty sand therefore the upper zone is the most permeable zone of the shallow aquifer and its hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be about 1 4 ft day 5 10 4 cm s results from multilevel sampler mls samples confirm that the hydraulic conductivity of the basal clayey sandy silt zone is lower than the upper zone and is estimated to be approximately 0 28 ft day 1 10 4 cm s the lower zone has been composed predominantly of clayey silt with a hydraulic conductivity of approximately 5 10 5 cm s 0 14 ft day hydraulic conductivity of the upper and middle zone has been estimated based on the analysis of tracer test data from mlss and for bottom zone has been estimated based on grain size analyses on 72 soil samples from the bottom 3 feet of the aquifer battelle et al 2001 using site data gained from field investigations as input parameters a geosystem model of the site has been constructed by the university of texas austin applying utchem these input parameters have been updated and calibrated against the field data obtained from the results of the conservative interwell tracer test citt and partitioning interwell tracer test pitt duke 1998a 1998b the study aquifer has been simulated using a three dimensional 25 25 16 mesh consisting of 10 000 grid blocks the horizontal extent of the model is 141 ft 23 m long by 80 ft 24 4 m wide with a 13 ft 4 m saturated thickness the dimensions of cells vary from 3 2 0 5 ft3 0 91 0 61 0 15 m3 in the center of the lowest layer to 24 12 2 ft3 7 31 3 66 0 61 m3 in the margin of the surface layer the pressures at two west east boundaries have been kept constant to establish a local hydraulic gradient of 0 015 representing observed field static water level conditions in the simulated region the other boundaries have been assumed as the no flux boundary the aquifer porosity in the model has a mean of 0 28 and a standard deviation of 0 05 the permeability in vertical is 10 of the permeability in horizontal battelle et al 2002 duke 1999 the distribution of the initial concentration volume fraction of the contaminant in the study area is presented in fig 3 this contamination has been caused by a spill of pce and its penetration into the ground for 300 day regarding the thickness of the clay aquitard at the base of the shallow aquifer the aquitard provides adequate protection against further downward migration of dnapl contamination to the underlying castle hayne aquifer duke 1999 the aquitard grid blocks have been treated as a no flux boundary and were assigned a low porosity of 0 01 and a low permeability of 5 6 10 4 ft day 2 10 7 cm s due to the pce contaminated area different sear scenarios with different wells patterns have been created water flush has been applied for ten days and then 4 alfoterra as a surfactant plus 16 ipa isopropyl alcohol as a cosolvent has been used some other values of physical and chemical parameters used in the sear simulation model are presented in table 1 simulation indicated that the highest dnapl saturations are located within the low permeability sediment layer i e clayey silt just above a clay aquitard at a depth of approximately 18 20 ft 5 5 6 1 m bgs 3 2 wells patterns for sear simulation models in this study five common patterns consisting of regular k spot inverted k spot regular 3 column inverted 3 column and 2 column were used to construct the sear model totally 35 sub patterns with different numbers and locations of wells have been considered regular k spot and inverted k spot consist of seven sub patterns from 2 spot to 8 spot the increase in the number of wells has continued to the extent that adding new wells does not significantly improve remediation performance in a k spot sub patterns the side wells are circular with a 15 ft radius from the contamination center fig 3a shows the location of the wells for the regular 7 spot sub pattern regular 3 column and inverted 3 column patterns have six sub patterns the spacing of the middle column wells is arranged so that all the wells are in the contamination area and the distance of the two side columns to the contamination center is 15 ft the 2 column pattern has nine sub patterns with a different number of wells each column has 1 2 or 3 wells and different combinations have been considered different scenarios are compared in terms of the time required and their cost to reach 95 of the remediation and the maximum simulation time has been considered 300 days in all scenarios the remediation process costs include fixed costs costs related to the number of wells and costs related to extraction and injection rate consisting of surfactant and cosolvent and extraction costs from previous studies water treatment and site equipment costs have been estimated at 20 000 and can be neglected because it is almost the same in all scenarios costs related to each well such as drilling well pump purchase and necessary equipment are estimated at 3000 the surfactant and ipa costs have been considered 2 and 1 per liter respectively and the cost of extraction such as energy and monitoring has been assumed 0 25 per m3 3 3 surrogate models of the sear model the best pattern from the previous step was selected and the sear simulation model was created based on it in this study total remediation duration and wells injection rates have been selected as surrogate model inputs and the contamination removal rate obtained from the sear numerical model has been selected as the model s output for each input sample injection wells rates were in the range of 0 200 ft3 day and the remediation duration was in the range of 10 200 days the latin hypercube sampling lhs method was utilized to generate 220 samples to cover all feasible space appropriately the samples were divided into training 75 and test 25 subsets using stratified random sampling the corresponding output for each input sample has been achieved by running the sear model first nine gpr models have been constructed using nine different kernel functions including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi2 functions the quantile transformer gilchrist 2000 minmax géron 2019 and robust scaler methods müller and guido 2016 were used for feature scaling in the preprocessing step in order to find the optimal hyperparameters values of the gpr model and kernel the bho method was applied in this study the performance of bho and gs methods have been examined and compared two criteria used to estimate the performance of gpr models in cross validation and parameter optimization were root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 the effect of hyperparameter optimization techniques and different kernels on single kernel gpr performance has been evaluated according to the performance criteria then the bhomk gp model was constructed and its performance was compared with single kernel models finally the surrogate model with the best performance was selected for embedding in the simulation optimization model gpr models have been developed by python programming language and the scikit learn pedregosa et al 2012 a comprehensive machine learning module of python 3 4 optimization model a non linear optimization model was developed for minimizing the remediation cost to obtain the optimal pumping scenario remediation duration and rates of injection wells are decision variables and the desired removal rate and range of decision variables are constraints the best trained surrogate model has been replaced with the sear model in the optimization model the optimization model in this study can be expressed as follows

and discussion the performance of different sub patterns in the remediation of the dnapl affected area is discussed in this section in addition to the time to complete remediation two other criteria of t 95 time to 95 remediation and r 100d percent of remediation after 100 days were used to compare the sub patterns performance better 4 1 regular inverted k spot patterns fig 4 a shows the pattern of wells in regular 2 spot to regular 8 spot sub patterns and fig 5 a shows the results of pce removal against time in these eight sub patterns as expected with increasing wells in regular k spot sub patterns the remediation performance was improved and uniformity in surfactant distribution was increased however from the regular 6 spot sub pattern increasing the number of wells had no significant effect on improving efficiency the 4 spot sub pattern did not perform better than the 3 spot sub pattern but the t 95 was 132 days in both cases because as shown in fig 3a due to the flow direction right to left the surfactant was not adequately distributed on the right side of the contamination zone and caused a small part of the area remediated with a longer delay the 7 spot and 8 spot sub patterns performed best and their remediation diagrams were almost the same increasing the number of wells from 7 spot to 8 spot did not improve the performance because surfactant distribution has almost been optimized from the 7 spot sub pattern t 95 for regular 7 spot and regular 8 spot sub patterns were 89 and 85 days respectively except for the 2 spot sub pattern all sub patterns have reached 100 remediation in less than 200 days this difference was due to the surfactant s asymmetric distribution because no well was located upstream of the contaminated area and the surfactant cannot reach that area adequately in the 2 spot sub pattern fig 6 shows the surfactant distribution in the 2 spot and 7 spot sub patterns the r 100d value for regular 3 spot to regular 5 spot sub patterns was approximately 90 and for regular 6 spot was 94 fig 4b represents the inverted 2 spot to inverted 8 spot sub patterns and fig 5b shows the removal rate results against time for seven sub patterns from inverted 2 spot to inverted 8 spot in the inverted k spot sub patterns as the number of wells increased the remediation performance improved up to the 7 spot sub pattern and the uniformity of the surfactant distribution was increased by the 300th day none of the sub patterns achieved a 90 removal rate the inverted 2 spot sub pattern performed worse than the others due to the unbalanced distribution of surfactants the inverted 3 spot 4 spot and 5 spot sub patterns performed similarly the remediation performance did not differ significantly with the increase in the number of wells more than the inverted 7 spot sub pattern therefore the inverted 7 spot and inverted 8 spot sub patterns performance were almost similar in the first ten days of water flushing the removal rate was lower than regular k spot patterns because no well was located in the contaminated area the average removal rate of pce in the regular k spot pattern was higher than the inverted k spot because the extraction well was located in the center of contamination which causes increasing the concentration of surfactant around the extraction well i e in the center of the contaminated area which has the highest concentration of contaminant thus all regular k spot sub patterns performed significantly better than the inverted k spot sub patterns the curve slope of the removal percent against the time was higher in the regular k spot pattern than in the inverted k spot pattern 4 2 line drive patterns regular inverted 3 column 2 column fig 7 a shows the regular 3 column sub patterns and fig 8 a shows the results of the remediation percent for these six sub patterns with an increasing number of wells in regular 3 column sub patterns the remediation performance was improved due to increasing surfactant distribution uniformity all sub patterns have reached 100 remediation in less than 170 days 3 column in6 ex2 and 3 column in6 ex3 sub patterns achieved complete removal in 90 days with the same t 95 value and performance in general due to the inappropriate distribution of surfactants in the contaminated area the 3 column in4 ex2 sub pattern had the weakest performance in this sub pattern the surfactant was not distributed appropriately in the middle of the contaminated zone and between two extraction wells so this sub pattern was weaker than the others overall sub patterns with six injection wells performed better and were relatively similar fig 7b shows the inverted 3 column sub patterns and fig 8b shows the results of the remediation percent for these sub patterns the remediation performance in inverted 3 column sub patterns also improved with increasing the number of injection wells however none of the sub patterns have achieved 100 remediation until the 300th day with an increasing number of extraction wells in inverted 3 column sub patterns the remediation performance was improved due to increasing surfactant distribution uniformity in the contaminated area in sub patterns with less than four extraction wells such as inverted 3 column in1 ex2 the surfactant did not suitably penetrate the whole contaminated area so these areas were not appropriately remediated only 3 column in3 ex6 and 3 column in2 ex6 sub patterns had a removal rate of more than 90 at the end of the 300 days of remediation the 3 column in1 ex2 eventually reached a 75 removal rate fig 9 a shows the 2 column sub patterns and fig 9b shows the results of the remediation percent for these nine sub patterns the 2 column sub patterns including 2 column in1 ex1 and 2 column in3 ex1 sub patterns which had one extraction well were the best and sub patterns with two extraction wells were the worst sub patterns with two extraction wells had unsatisfactory performance because the surfactant was not suitably distributed in the middle of the two extraction wells these sub patterns have not achieved a 100 removal rate in 300 days although the number of 2 column in1 ex1 sub pattern wells was less than the 2 column in3 ex1 sub pattern wells they both had similar performance because their surfactant distribution was approximately similar these sub patterns reached 100 remediation in 175 days and t 95 and r 100d for these sub patterns were 171 days and 42 respectively all sub patterns of the 2 column pattern have not eliminated any contaminants before 30 days because both the extraction and the injection wells are out of the contaminated area and are farther from each other than other patterns generally by comparing the remediation performance of line drive patterns it was found that the removal rate of pce in the regular 3 column pattern was higher than other line drive patterns the removal speed of contaminants in the inverted 3 column sub patterns was higher than the 2 column sub patterns before reaching the 90 removal rate r 100d approximately 80 but the ability of 2 column sub patterns to complete removal of pce have been higher the pce removal curve for the best sub pattern of each base pattern has been shown in fig 10 overall regular sub patterns had the best performance and highest contamination removal rates among all sub patterns in the shortest time in regular or convergent patterns that flow direction was towards the center of the contamination compared with the inverted or divergent patterns the centralization of the surfactant and chemicals injected were higher in the contamination area and the surfactants were less present in the non contaminated area as a result these patterns delivered better performance under the same conditions by choosing the appropriate number of injection and extraction wells in the form of a regular pattern it can be expected that the resulting pattern is appropriate 4 3 cost analysis in the previous section the effect of the number and location of wells in different patterns was presented the remediation cost of different patterns is as important as their performance thus the costs of the different sub patterns have been compared in this section for this purpose only sub patterns with more than 95 pce removal have been considered the pce removal rate in 19 of 35 examined sub patterns was more than 95 and fig 11 shows the cost of that 19 sub patterns since the major cost of remediation is related to surfactants and chemicals the lower the remediation time the less the remediation cost regular 8 spot and regular 3 column in6 ex2 sub patterns have reached a 95 pce removal threshold in 85 days given that both have eight injection and extraction wells both have the lowest cost following these two sub patterns was the regular 7 spot sub pattern with seven wells and reached a 95 removal in 89 days regular 3 column in6 ex3 sub pattern reached a 95 removal threshold in 86 days but it was finally more expensive than the regular 7 spot sub pattern due to owning nine wells none of the inverted sub patterns were among selected sub patterns and they have not reached the 95 remediation level 2 column sub patterns also did not have a proper remediation time and were more expensive due to a long remediation time the results showed that as regards the injection rate was constant the cost has practically been a function of time the amount of surfactant injected and other costs are negligible compared to chemicals cost details of the five least cost scenarios are presented in table 2 according to the cost and duration of remediation the regular 8 spot pattern was selected as the superior arrangement then a simulation optimization model was developed to minimize the remediation cost however due to the high computational load of the sear numerical simulation model a surrogate model was replaced in the simulation optimization model 4 4 analysis of gpr model performance nine gpr models were constructed using nine different kernel functions including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf rational quadratic exp sine squared matérn sigmoid laplacian and chi2 functions and the effect of different kernels on the performance of the gpr model was investigated also to find the optimal hyperparameters the bho method was used and compared with the gs method 5 fold cross validation cv was used to prevent overfitting and the performance criteria in cross validation were rmse and r2 the test rmse values of the trained gpr models are shown in fig 12 a bunch of points represents models optimized by the bho method and the other bunch represents models optimized by the gs method all gpr models optimized with the bho method had higher accuracy than models optimized with the gs method the greatest improvement of accuracy was related to models with chi2 and matérn kernels and the lowest improvement was related to models with sigmoid and rbf kernels in addition since the bho method selects the next hyperparameters in each iteration in an informed method the computational load and time of finding the optimal hyperparameters have also been reduced compared to the gs method the results also showed that gpr models are very sensitive to the kernels used the chi2 kernel had the best performance in this study followed by polynomial and rbf kernels the test rmse of the gpr model constructed by the chi2 kernel was 49 less than the average test rmse of the other eight models models constructed with linear and sigmoid kernels were not accurate in order to improve the ability of the gpr model to approximate the input output relationship of the numerical simulation model a bhomk gp model was developed and trained and its performance was compared with single kernel models table 3 presents the performance criteria values of single kernel gpr models and the bhomk gp model in each column the better performance criteria values the greener they are and the worse values the redder they are the results showed that the accuracy of the bhomk gp model was higher than single kernel models so that its test and cv rmse were about 23 and 40 less than the best single kernel model respectively the selected hybrid kernel used to construct the bhomk gp model was a combination of the matérn rbf and chi2 kernels the kernel type and the values of the optimal hyperparameters of models and their kernel have been presented in table 4 4 5 optimization results the non linear optimization model in which the sear simulation model has substituted with the bhomk gp model was developed using the python programming environment the regular 8 spot sub pattern which had the best remediation performance and has the most accurate surrogate model was considered to find the optimal pumping scenario the optimal pumping scenario and the corresponding removal rate calculated by the sear simulation model are summarized in table 5 the sear simulation model s contaminant removal rate is 95 4 which satisfies the remediation target the remediation cost was significantly reduced through optimization compared to the cost of elementary scenarios the lowest remediation cost of elementary scenarios was 126469 while the cost was reduced by optimization to 77575 5 summary and conclusions in this study various wells patterns with different wells numbers were used to construct the surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation model five patterns including regular and inverted k spot regular and inverted 3 column line drive and 2 column line drive were examined the performance of 35 sub patterns was investigated and top sub patterns were recognized based on the lowest remediation time then all sub patterns were compared and evaluated considering the remediation cost and the best sub pattern was selected thereupon 220 random samples were generated using lhs to train the surrogate models kernels have a significant effect on the accuracy of gpr models so nine different kernels were used to construct gpr models and the performance of kernels was examined also the effect of the bayesian hyperparameter optimization method was evaluated and compared with the gs method afterward a bhomk gp model was developed to improve the accuracy of gpr models and its performance was evaluated in comparison with single kernel gpr models eventually the optimal remediation scenario was achieved by minimizing the remediation cost by replacing the bhomk gp model with the sear simulation model in the optimization simulation model the main results of this study have been presented as follows 1 the pattern of the wells has a significant effect on the performance of the sear method only 54 3 of used sub patterns had a contamination removal rate greater than 95 and none of the inverted sub patterns were among them regular or convergent patterns performed best because surfactant distribution in the contaminated area was better in regular patterns 2 the performance of the gpr surrogate model depends on the type of kernel used gpr models constructed with the chi2 kernel had the best accuracy and performance the r2 and rmse values of the test dataset for the gpr model with chi2 kernel were 0 976 and 0 0501 respectively which shows the gpr model s ability to approximate the sear simulation model s input output relationship the test rmse of the gpr model constructed by the chi2 kernel was 49 less than the average test rmse of the other eight models 3 the results showed that using the bho method to optimize the values of hyperparameters has led to the construction of more accurate surrogate models e g the test rmse of the gpr model with the chi2 kernel whose optimal hyperparameters were obtained using the bho method was 34 less than the gpr model which used the gs method 4 the bhomk gp model s accuracy was significantly higher than single kernel gpr models the test and cv rmse of the bhomk gp model were 0 0385 and 0 0435 respectively which were 23 and 40 less than the same criteria values for the best single core model funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from

mutagenic when it enters human body tyagi 2019 nearly 12 of the worldwide dye production belongs to reactive dyes calderon et al 2018 after dyeing about 20 40 of reactive dyes remain in the effluent which makes them highly coloured and alkaline the wastewater containing reactive dyes are highly hazardous due to the presence of azo group along with sulphonate groups iqbal 2016 though there are plenty of techniques being tested for the effective removal of hazardous dyes from wastewater none of the reported techniques serves 100 solution certain techniques are good in terms of its effectiveness in treatment but their operational cost is too high aksakal and ucun 2010 some low cost techniques lack in terms of efficiency and selectivity towards wide range of pollutants belessi et al 2009 kamranifar et al 2018 it is essential to develop an environmental friendly and low cost treatment technique for the removal of dye molecules present in the industrial wastewater adsorption using activated materials like carbon silica alumina etc has been proved to be the most effective towards different varieties of synthetic dyes activated carbon derived from waste precursor material is easy to prepare economically cheap most versatile and easy to regenerate tyagi 2019 biological waste materials like sawdust corn cobs orange peel cotton seed shell oil palm shell epicarp of raphiahookerie fruit and sun flower oil cake are reported to have good affinity towards different dyes in aqueous solution kim et al 2003 kumar et al 2007 sciban et al 2008 batzias and siriras 2007 inyinbor et al 2016 tan et al 2008 the surface area and porosity of an activated carbon depends mainly on the method of preparation and activation generally the preparation methods are classified into physical and chemical methods palanisamy and sivakumar 2009 the physical methods include heating with hot air steam microwave etc in the chemical method the carbon precursor is impregnated with some chemical agents like acid base salts oxidizing agents etc after impregnation the precursor is carbonized and then activated karthikeyan et al 2008 the chemical methods yield carbon with high surface area high carbon content and well formed porosity adsorption capacities increase with increase in the surface area of the adsorbent combination of both physical and chemical methods is also employed to get superior quality of ac s in the present study the seeds of adenanthera paronina l generally named as red sandal wood are used to prepare the activated carbon the tree is tall and grows in the hot and humid regions it grows up to a height of 20 45 feet and belongs to leguminosae family the seeds of a paronina weigh between 25 and 30 g ashokan and asaithambi 2019 certain parts of the plants are used for the preparation of ethanol and the leaves are used as an anti inflammatory agent the plant is cultivated as fuel wood for its hardness and high calorific value highly porous activated carbon was prepared from a paronina seed through chemical impregnation followed by carbonization using microwave oven five different activated carbon samples were prepared by using different chemical impregnation followed by carbonization using microwave oven the prepared carbon was activated in muffle furnace at a specified temperature among the five different activated carbon samples a superior activated carbon was selected and used for the adsorptive removal of reactive red 195 rr195 dye from its aqueous solution under batch and column mode 2 materials and methods all the chemicals used for the investigation were of the analytical grade purchased from e merk india and used without any purification 2 1 preparation of a paronina l seed carbon the seeds of a paronina were collected around the city of dharmapuri in tamilnadu india the collected seeds were washed well with surplus water to remove the surface impurities and dried at 110 c for 24 h the dried seeds were then broken into pieces of 2 5 mm size and soaked in respective chemicals as given in table 1 after 24 h impregnation in the respective chemical agents the supernatant solution was decanted off and the solid mass was sun dried for one day and carbonized in microwave oven at 600 w for 10 min under constant flow of n2 during this period the entire mass has got completely carbonized the char was washed with plenty of water to remove the soluble impurities the washed and filtered carbon was dried at 110 c for 24 h and then activated in muffle furnace for 10 min after attaining 800 c under constant n2 flow the activated carbon was again washed with distilled water and dried for 24 h at 110 c and then cooled to room temperature it is stored in tight lid containers to prevent the moisture adsorption 2 2 characterization of the prepared activated carbon in order to ascertain the nature of surface functionalities present in the activated carbon scanning electron microscope sem images were recorded using evo 18 model carl zeiss make electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kv before sem analysis the samples were coated with au using a sputter device the surface functional groups present on the activated carbon were evaluated by recording the ir spectra of carbon samples using perkinelmer ftir spectrometer 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm 1 for the ir spectra measurements the ac s 0 33 are mixed with dry kbr merck spectroscopy grade and pressed into the tablet the bet surface area of the ac s were measured at 77 k using n2 gas p po 0 21 sorption analyser using quanta chrome autosorb bet surface area analyser 2 3 dye adsorption studies reactive red 195 dye cas no 93050 79 4 was selected as a model adsorbate for the present study the properties of rr195 dye are given in table 2 and the structure is given in fig s1 supplementary data double distilled water was used for all the preparation and dilutions a stock solution of 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving 1 011 g of rr195 dye percentage purity is 99 0 in double distilled water and made up to 1000 ml the stock dye solution was stored in refrigerator at 20 c in a closed container to avoid evaporative loss and diluted with double distilled water as and when required 2 4 batch mode adsorption based on the outcomes of surface property analysis one activated carbon apac5 with superior surface character was selected for dye adsorption studies under batch and column mode under the batch mode analysis specified quantity based on the dosage optimization of apac5 was shaken well with 100 ml aqueous solution of rr195 dye for the evaluation of adsorption kinetics 200 ml of rr195 dye solution was shaken with 100 mg of apac5 and the adsorption progress was monitored by estimating the residual dye concentration in the solution the residual concentration of rr195 dye in the dye bath was evaluated by measuring the optical density at 542 nm the λ max of rr195 dye using uv vis spectrophotometer systronics make the adsorption performance was evaluated at a normal ph of dye solution except for ph effect the adsorption analysis was performed with duplicate and the maximum difference is 4 2 5 column mode adsorption to evaluate the adsorption performance under fixed bed column mode a glass column with 1 cm diameter and 30 cm height was selected the glass column was filled with apac5 up to a specified height by placing the glass wool above and below the carbon column the dye solution under investigation was passed through the column from the bottom through up flow method with the help of a peristaltic pump the effluent coming out of the column was analysed for the residual dye concentration each 50 ml interval using optical density method as stated in the previous paragraph when the concentration of out coming dye was 90 the column was treated to be exhausted some previously proposed mathematical models were employed to study the column adsorption performance 2 6 mathematical expressions used for a long period of time the scientists working in adsorption had been using the linearized pseudo first order and pseudo second order mathematical expressions lima et al 2015 have analysed these kinetic parameters and reported that the linearization of all mathematical models will lead to some errors in the computed results recent developments in the computer based analytical tools helps us to compute the results with great accuracy in the nonlinear mathematical expressions in this experiment the kinetic and isotherm analysis were performed using linear and nonlinear mathematical expressions the suitability of a particular model was ascertained based on the standard deviations r2 r2adj values for the analysis of data derived from fixed bed column thomas and yoon nelson models were employed table s1 supplementary data represents the linear and nonlinear forms of kinetic and isotherm models 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characteristics the five variants of activated carbon prepared from a paronina l seeds using different chemical agents were analysed for their physico chemical characteristics the results are given in table 3 the ph of the prepared activated carbon samples gives an idea about the nature of impurities present on the carbon surface the ph of apac1 apac2 and apac3 were more than 8 which substantiates the basic nature of carbon only the apac5 was acidic in nature owing to the complete removal of surface impurities the moisture content of ac s varied between 6 31 and 11 42 the maximum moisture was observed in apac5 the high surface active carbon can adsorb more quantity of atmospheric moisture on analysing the acid leachable impurities all the five samples had very small quantity of acid soluble content less than 2 14 among them apac5 had the lowest acid soluble impurity of 0 72 the percentage of volatile matter in the prepared ac s varied between 10 2 and 7 75 and apac5 had the lowest amount of volatile matter 7 75 this may be due to the high charring nature of sulphuric acid in comparison to other chemical agents the preparation of char in all five processes involves heating in microwave oven which ensures uniform heating on the surface as well as the bulk of the material rengaraj et al 1999 the uniform heating with microwave yields best charring effect saminathan et al 2016 with the microwave heating all the vaporizable organic compounds were removed and finally a carbon with fewer impurities was obtained generally the prepared carbonaceous activated carbon materials possess high surface area in the range of 500 1500 m2 g thitame and shukla 2015 the bet surface area analysis demonstrates that all the five activated carbon have exceptionally developed porosity and high surface area commercial activated carbon samples with bet surface area in the range of 657 773 m2 g shows good adsorption towards a commercial reactive dye giannakoudakis et al 2016 except apac1 the other four activated carbon samples have a bet surface area greater than 749 m2 g the apac5 prepared by charring with h2so4 has a bet surface area of 948 m2 g and is used to remove the reactive dye rr195 in this study 3 2 sem and ftir analysis the scanning electron microscopic images are presented in fig 1 a e the activated char prepared by five different processes were found to have highly opened surface imperfections with long and deep cavities the imperfections on the apac1 surface were less in comparison with other activated carbons the role of chemical agents towards the development of surface porosity plays a significant role all the chemical agents zncl2 koh h3po4 and h2so4 render their role in developing porosity on carbon surface especially h2so4 is a powerful charring agent which quickly removes the liquid and other soluble organic compounds with great ease followed by the chemical treatment microwave assisted charring greatly develops the porous network on carbon surface the peaks of ftir fig 2 spectra are useful to evaluate the functional groups present in the prepared activated carbon surface the peaks corresponding to oh str belongs to alcohols was observed between 3602 and 3617 cm 1 in apac3 and apac4 all the five samples contain peaks at 3413 to 3435 cm 1 for nh str belongs to aliphatic primary amines mubarak et al 2017 the ch str peaks observed between 2893 and 2924 cm 1 substantiate the presence of alkene and unsaturated carbon network mubarak et al 2017 the co2 absorption frequency found in carbon samples apac1 and apac5was observed to be 2426 cm 1and this could have been originated from the adsorbed co2 molecules after removing the functional impurities all five carbon samples had cc str at 1616 to 1637 cm 1 and ch bending vibrations at 1380 to 1431 cm 1 lima et al 2008 these peaks clearly depicted that the prepared carbon samples has the exceptional graphitic network with minimum amount of surface functional groups palanisamy and sivakumar 2009 ozacar and sengil 2005 on analysing the intensity of major peaks sample apac5 has the major reduction of all functional peaks the graphitic network is substantiated by a sharp and intense peak at 1380 to 1384 cm 1 responsible for ch bending of alkenes qi et al 2016 based on the surface characteristics apac5 has a superior surface area hence it was used for further adsorption of dyes under batch and column mode 3 3 batch mode adsorption of rr195 under the batch mode adsorption analysis the parameters that greatly affect the adsorption of solute by solid adsorbents like solution ph sorbent quantity solute concentration and temperature were studied 3 4 effect of sorbent dosage any sorption process involving porous adsorbent and aqueous phase solutes are greatly influenced by the sorbent dosage generally the total quantity of solute adsorbed is directly proportional to the quantity of sorbent used the reason that could be associated with this trend is that more the quantity of adsorbent the more will be the surface area and obviously the quantity of solute adsorption is also more mahanna and samy 2020 the variation in rr195 adsorption per gram of adsorbent on varying sorbent dosage is shown in fig s2 supplementary data it was observed that the apac5 quantity exceeding 100 mg does not show any remarkable increase in adsorption per unit mass of the adsorbent the decrease in adsorption at higher apac5 dose could be attributed to the reduction in the number of sorbent sites in the vicinity of solute and increase in diffusion path length owing to the overcrowding of adsorbent particles mahvi and dalvand 2020 3 5 effect of ph the ph of dye bath is an important processing condition for the effective affinity of dyes on fabrics similarly adsorption of dyes by solid adsorbents also varies to a great extent on changing the ph of the solution aksakal and ucun 2010 the variation of rr195 adsorption with varying ph was evaluated by taking 100 ml of 50 mg l of rr195 dye solution and it was agitated with 100 mg of apac5 for 90 min the adsorption performance was evaluated by fixing the ph of solution from 2 to 12 the variation of rr195 adsorption onto apac5 at different ph is shown in fig 3 in aqueous solution rr195 dye ionises into rr195 and na the anionic dye species have greater attraction towards apac5 at lower ph at lower ph less than the phzpc of apac5 the surface of adsorbent acquires a positive charge and rr195 ions are adsorbed with greater ease as the phzpc of apac5 is 6 5 when the solution ph exceeds 6 5 the sorbent surface become negative ozcan and ozcan 2004 the negatively charged surface tend to repel the rr195 ions and the adsorption shows a decreasing trend hence the removal of rr195 by apac5 could proceed better under acidic ph ph less than 6 5 dursun and tepe 2011 3 6 effect of dye concentration and temperature the role of rr195 concentration towards its adsorption by apac5 was studied by varying the rr195 initial concentration from 25 to 100 mg l at a temperature of 30 c the variations of rr195 adsorption with time at different initial rr195 concentrations are shown in fig s3 supplementary data the rate of adsorption during the begging was very high almost 50 of the total adsorption happened within 30 min of the agitation after 30 min the rate of adsorption decreased and the equilibrium attained at 90 min at the beginning of adsorption all the adsorption sites are vacant and hence the rate of adsorption was fast as the adsorption proceeded the ratio of vacant sites to the occupied sites diminishes hence the rate of adsorption show a down trend abdelwahab 2008 pormazar et al 2020 by increasing the initial dye concentration from 25 to 100 mg l the percentage of rr195 adsorbed on to apac5 decreased from 100 to 78 85 this can be explained by the fact that for a fixed number of sorbent sites and for an increase in solute concentration there are no sufficient sites available for sorption and hence percentage of adsorption decreases si et al 2015 on increasing the rr195 concentration from 25 to 100 mg l the quantity of rr195 adsorbed at equilibrium was increased from 25 00 to 78 85 mg g the higher initial rr195 concentration provides necessary driving force to surpass the mass transfer resistance developed between the solute and sorbent surface amin 2009 the adsorption of solutes by a sorbent is also influenced by the surrounding temperature to a considerable extent the variations of rr195 adsorption on to apac5 surface at various temperatures are shown in fig s4 supplementary data it was observed that when the temperature increased from 30 to 45 c the amount of rr195 uptake decreased from 47 12 to 44 23 mg g high temperature was not a favourable condition for rr195 adsorption onto apac5 the decrease of rr195 adsorption with increase in temperature substantiated the exothermic nature of adsorption kumaravelan and sivakumar 2018 at higher temperature the kinetic energy of the dye molecules increases and there by the rate of desorption also increases leading to a decreased adsorption 3 7 adsorption kinetics the rate of change of adsorption with time is an essential parameter to develop a large scale system for industrial operations the kinetics of adsorption was evaluated using linear and nonlinear forms of pseudo first order lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order kinetic expressions ho and mckay 1999 the plots are given in fig 4 and the results are summarised in table 4 the results generated from the linearized forms of certain mathematical expression can generate results with poor accuracy or erroneous results in this study the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear forms of kinetic expressions were compared based on the low standard deviation and high r2 value better results were obtained and reported the pseudo first order rate constant calculated using the linear expression increased from 0 041 to 0 047 min 1 whereas it decreased from 0 0425 to 0 0343 min 1 in nonlinear model the value of r2 shows that the linear first order kinetic model fits poor to the present adsorption system and the nonlinear model showed an excellent fit with high r2 ranged between 0 9971 and 0 9996 the standard deviation calculated between the experimental qe and calculated qe in linear model was high 1 018 5 148 the sd value to the nonlinear model was very low 0 140 1 008 the reduced chi square value and r2adj also substantiate that the nonlinear first order kinetic expression best described the adsorption behaviour in comparison with the linear model the second order kinetic expressions in the form of linear and nonlinear model were also employed to analyse the adsorption kinetics the qe calculated using the second order expression both linear and nonlinear shows high standard deviations the second order rate constant k2 decreased from 1 4 10 3 to 3 0 10 4 g mg min in both linear and nonlinear second order expressions the reduced chi square value was high in linear and nonlinear second order expressions most of the reports published by the past researchers have shown that pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable than pseudo first order kinetic model for the study of dye adsorption kinetics aksakal and ucun 2010 mahanna and samy 2020 sismanoglu et al 2010 under different concentration and temperature the application of nonlinear kinetic expression have proved that the residual rr195 concentration was the only factor that controls the rate limiting step as indicated from the nonlinear first order results it may be inferred that linearization of all mathematical expressions are not advisable for the evaluation of kinetic results the intra particle diffusion mechanism proposed by weber and morris 1963 was also employed to analyse the adsorption mechanism of rr195 on to apac5 surface according to this model a plot of square root of agitation time against qe yield a straight line if the adsorption follows intra particle diffusion mechanism it was observed from fig s5 supplementary data that the second and linear phase does not pass through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion was not only the rate limiting step the intra particle diffusion rate constant kid varies between 0 469 and 0 141 mg g min½ under different concentrations 0 216 0 237 mg g min½ under various temperature this trend indicated that high concentration gradient decreases the intra particle diffusion at higher rr195 concentrations 3 8 adsorption isotherm the interaction between solute and sorbent is well evaluated from the isotherm parameters obtained at a given temperature the isotherm analysis gives a relationship between the quantities of solute present at the solid surface with that of solute in the bulk of the solution the widely used isotherm models viz langmuir and freundlich models were used to evaluate the adsorption parameters of rr195 on to apac5 langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 the langmuir isotherm was derived with an assumption of monolayer coverage of adsorbate on energetically homogeneous surface hosseinzehi et al 2020 the langmuir parameters q0 and bl denotes the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity and langmuir rate constant respectively the linear and nonlinear plots of langmuir models are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively and the results are presented in table 6 the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity decreased from 59 88 to 45 66 mg g in the linearized model analysis on analysing the isotherm data using nonlinear model the q0 increased from 87 27 to 106 85 mg g the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity observed in the present adsorbent system is comparable with the other adsorbents used for rr195 adsorption as shown in table s2 supplementary data mahmoud et al 2016 tahir et al 2016 xue et al 2010 yi et al 2012 further the nonlinear model also show poor r2 r2adj and reduced chi square values the freundlich plot of linear and nonlinear expressions are given in fig 5c and d respectively and the calculated results are presented in table 5 the freundlich rate constant shows a decreasing trend in linear and nonlinear analysis the value of adsorption intensity n varies between 2 953 and 13 649 in linear model and 3 333 to 2 003 in nonlinear analysis low standard deviation high r2 and r2adj values close to 1 0 indicates that freundlich adsorption isotherm in its nonlinear form best describes the adsorption isotherm of rr195 adsorption onto apac5 surface the suitability of freundlich isotherm substantiated that during the rr195 adsorption the apac5 surface was energetically heterogeneous and the adsorption of rr195 was not limited to monolayer sismanoglu et al 2010 have reported similar nature for the adsorption of reactive blue 21 and reactive red 195 dyes using clinoptilolite as an adsorbent 3 9 adsorption thermodynamics the standard thermodynamic parameters like enthalpy change δh entropy change δs and gibbs free energy change δg are very much essential to determine the feasibility and energy changes involved during the adsorption cicek et al 2007 these parameters were evaluated from the dimensionless equilibrium constant of adsorption generally these parameters were calculated using langmuir rate constant which is having unit of l mg as suggested by liu 2009 we have employed the following equation for the calculation of δg and the results are provided in table 6 δ g rt ln 55 5 x b l on multiplying the langmuir constant with 55 5 mg l 1000 g divided by the molar mass of water the langmuir constant is converted into the dimensionless parameter this modified equation holds good for the evaluation of δg of charged ions having substantial concentration liu 2009 the enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were evaluated from the slope and intercepts of linear plot of 1 t vs ln 55 5 x bl the negative enthalpy change indicated that the rr195 adsorption onto apsc5 was exothermic as evidenced from the decrease of qe with increase of temperature generally in adsorptions involving physical forces of attraction the enthalpy varies between 2 0 and 20 0 kj mol theydan and ahmed 2012 the enthalpy of rr195 adsorption is 11 21 kj mol which validates the physisorption type interaction that operates between rr195 and apac5 surface the positive and high value of entropy change indicates that there has been an increased randomness at the apac5 solution interface cicek et al 2007 the negative sign of gibbs free energy change depicts that the adsorption of rr195 onto apac5 was spontaneous under a given set of operating conditions 3 10 column adsorption of rr195 the application of an adsorption system for the wastewater treatment in industrial operations can be evaluated with the fixed bed column which will suit the best due to its continuous mode of operation the development of a better column adsorption system is entirely different from that of a batch mode adsorption the major advantage associated with column mode dye adsorption is that a continuous flow is maintained through column and thereby an effective dye removal is ensured 3 10 1 effect of initial rr195 concentration the impacts of rr195 concentration on apac5 column was evaluated by varying the initial rr195 concentration from 25 to 75 mg l for a bed height of 5 0 cm and a flow rate of 10 ml min the breakthrough curves at different initial rr195 concentrations are shown in fig s6 supplementary data on increasing the rr195 concentration the breakthrough curves were more steeper the slope of breakthrough curve increases the break through volume at 90 of initial rr195 concentration decreased from 3500 ml 2800 ml on increasing rr195 concentration from 25 to 75 mg l even though the throughput volume decreased with the inverse of initial concentration the quantity of rr195 adsorption increased from 87 50 mg to 210 0 mg with higher concentration the concentration gradient across the solid liquid interface increases and thereby the quantity of rr195 removed per unit mass increases baek et al 2007 3 11 effect of bed height the effect of apac5 bed height on the break through curves of rr195 was evaluated by changing the height of bed from 5 to 7 5 and to 10 cm for a fixed initial dye concentration of 50 mg l and a flow rate of 10 ml min the breakthrough curves fig s7 supplementary data depicts that the transfer of rr195 on to apac5 column was rapid the volume of rr195 treated at the break through increased from 3050 ml to 4850 ml on increasing the bed height from 5 cm to 10 cm the increase of bed height from 5 to 10 cm the quantity of rr195 adsorbed on apac5 column increased from 152 5 mg to 242 5 mg while increasing the depth of column the number of sorption sites available for adsorption increased and thereby the quantity of dye removed had also increased nwabanne and igbokwe 2012 3 12 effect of flow rate the impact of dye solution flowing through the column also has a significant influence on the column efficiency the breakthrough curves at different flow rates are shown in fig s8 supplementary data the maximum volume of 50 mg l rr195 treated for a bed depth of 5 cm was achieved at a lower flow rate of 5 ml min the quantity of rr195 removed at breakthrough decreased from 165 0 mg to 127 5 mg on increasing the flow rate from 5 to 15 ml min at lower flow rate the dye molecules have enough time for its interaction with sorption sites while at higher flow rates the fraction of molecules having good interaction with sorption sites gets decreased sivakumar and palanisamy 2009 the flow rate optimization is very much essential for setting up large scale industrial treatment plants 3 13 evaluation of column kinetics the column adsorption kinetics was analysed using the well known kinetic models viz yoon nelson and thomas models yoon and nelson 1984 thomas 1944 the column adsorption kinetics was tested with yoon nelson and thomas mathematical models fig s9 s10 supplementary data and the results are given in table 7 the thomas rate constant kt decreased from 1 6 10 4 to 0 8 10 4 with raise in influent concentration from 25 to 75 mg l and it increased with increase in bed depth as well as flow rate basically the thomas model was derived without considering the mass transfer resistance within the adsorbent particle nwabanne and igbokwe 2012 the external fluid film resistance was also not taken into account while calculating the rate constant of thomas model the thomas model maximum adsorption capacity qo t increased from 62 09 to 143 15 mg g on increasing the rr195 concentration and it decreased from 71 09 to 55 37 mg g and 72 10 to 53 64 mg g upon increase in flow rate and bed height respectively the poor r2 value and high standard deviation of thomas model indicate its poor fitness for the rr195 column adsorption data the yoon nelson rate constant kyn show an increasing trend with increase of concentration and flow rate and it decreased with increase of bed height the time needed to achieve 50 break through τ min increased with concentration and bed height and it decreased with raise in flow rate the adsorption capacity evaluated with y n model best coincided with the experimentally calculated values with low sd and good r2 value the yoon nelson model derived with an assumption that the decrease of adsorption rate is proportional to adsorbate adsorption and adsorbate breakthrough best suited for rr195 adsorption on to apac5 column sivakumar and palanisamy 2009 4 conclusions the results of present investigation indicated that a high surface active carbon can potentially be prepared from the seeds of adenanthera paronina l all the five prepared carbon samples were found to have a well developed porous network with high surface area among them apac5 has superior surface characteristics with a bet surface area of 948 m2 g the chemical agents and microwave irradiated activation removes majority of surface impurities and thereby yields a high surface activated carbon the effect of ph on batch mode adsorption study depicts that acidic ph is suitable for rr195 adsorption onto apac5 surface the apac5 has a potential to remove 78 85 mg g of rr195 at an initial concentration of 100 mg l the nonlinear kinetic expressions were most suited and yields more prominent results when compared with the linearized mathematical models the column mode adsorption analysis demonstrated that apac5 could remove 82 35 mg g of rr195 at an initial concentration of 75 mg l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest related to this research work appendix a supplementary data

plenty of techniques being tested for the effective removal of hazardous dyes from wastewater none of the reported techniques serves 100 solution certain techniques are good in terms of its

the investigation were of the analytical grade purchased from e merk india and used without any purification 2 1 preparation of a paronina l seed carbon the seeds of a paronina were collected around the city of dharmapuri in tamilnadu india the collected seeds were washed well with surplus water to remove the surface impurities and dried at 110 c for 24 h the dried seeds were then broken into pieces of 2 5 mm size and soaked in respective chemicals as given in table 1 after 24 h impregnation in the respective chemical agents the supernatant solution was decanted off and the solid mass was sun dried for one day and carbonized in microwave oven at 600 w for 10 min under constant flow of n2 during this period the entire mass has got completely carbonized the char was washed with plenty of water to remove the soluble impurities the washed and filtered carbon was dried at 110 c for 24 h and then activated in muffle furnace for 10 min after attaining 800 c under constant n2 flow the activated carbon was again washed with distilled water and dried for 24 h at 110 c and then cooled to room temperature it is stored in tight lid containers to prevent the moisture adsorption 2 2 characterization of the prepared activated carbon in order to ascertain the nature of surface functionalities present in the activated carbon scanning electron microscope sem images were recorded using evo 18 model carl zeiss make electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kv before sem analysis the samples were coated with au using a sputter device the surface functional groups present on the activated carbon were evaluated by recording the ir spectra of carbon samples using perkinelmer ftir spectrometer 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm 1 for the ir spectra measurements the ac s 0 33 are mixed with dry kbr merck spectroscopy grade and pressed into the tablet the bet surface area of the ac s were measured at 77 k using n2 gas p po 0 21 sorption analyser using quanta chrome autosorb bet surface area analyser 2 3 dye adsorption studies reactive red 195 dye cas no 93050 79 4 was selected as a model adsorbate for the present study the properties of rr195 dye are given in table 2 and the structure is given in fig s1 supplementary data double distilled water was used for all the preparation and dilutions a stock solution of 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving 1 011 g of rr195 dye percentage purity is 99 0 in double distilled water and made up to 1000 ml the stock dye solution was stored in refrigerator at 20 c in a closed container to avoid evaporative loss and diluted with double distilled water as and when required 2 4 batch mode adsorption based on the outcomes of surface property analysis one activated carbon apac5 with superior surface character was selected for dye adsorption studies under batch and column mode under the batch mode analysis specified quantity based on the dosage optimization of apac5 was shaken well with 100 ml aqueous solution of rr195 dye for the evaluation of adsorption kinetics 200 ml of rr195 dye solution was shaken with 100 mg of apac5 and the adsorption progress was monitored by estimating the residual dye concentration in the solution the residual concentration of rr195 dye in the dye bath was evaluated by measuring the optical density at 542 nm the λ max of rr195 dye using uv vis spectrophotometer systronics make the adsorption performance was evaluated at a normal ph of dye solution except for ph effect the adsorption analysis was performed with duplicate and the maximum difference is 4 2 5 column mode adsorption to evaluate the adsorption performance under fixed bed column mode a glass column with 1 cm diameter and 30 cm height was selected the glass column was filled with apac5 up to a specified height by placing the glass wool above and below the carbon column the dye solution under investigation was passed through the column from the bottom through up flow method with the help of a peristaltic pump the effluent coming out of the column was analysed for the residual dye concentration each 50 ml interval using optical density method as stated in the previous paragraph when the concentration of out coming dye was 90 the column was treated to be exhausted some previously proposed mathematical models were employed to study the column adsorption performance 2 6 mathematical expressions used for a long period of time the scientists working in adsorption had been using the linearized pseudo first order and pseudo second order mathematical expressions lima et al 2015 have analysed these kinetic parameters and reported that the linearization of all mathematical models will lead to some errors in the computed results recent developments in the computer based analytical tools helps us to compute the results with great accuracy in the nonlinear mathematical expressions in this experiment the kinetic and isotherm analysis were performed using linear and nonlinear mathematical expressions the suitability of a particular model was ascertained based on the standard deviations r2 r2adj values for the analysis of data derived from fixed bed column thomas and yoon nelson models were employed table s1 supplementary data represents the linear and nonlinear forms of kinetic and isotherm models 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characteristics the five variants of activated carbon prepared from a paronina l seeds using different chemical agents were analysed for their physico chemical characteristics the results are given in table 3 the ph of the prepared activated carbon samples gives an idea about the nature of impurities present on the carbon surface the ph of apac1 apac2 and apac3 were more than 8 which substantiates the basic nature of carbon only the apac5 was acidic in nature owing to the complete removal of surface impurities the moisture content of ac s varied between 6 31 and 11 42 the maximum moisture was observed in apac5 the high surface active carbon can adsorb more quantity of atmospheric moisture on analysing the acid leachable impurities all the five samples had very small quantity of acid soluble content less than 2 14 among them apac5 had the lowest acid soluble impurity of 0 72 the percentage of volatile matter in the prepared ac s varied between 10 2 and 7 75 and apac5 had the lowest amount of volatile matter 7 75 this may be due to the high charring nature of sulphuric acid in comparison to other chemical agents the preparation of char in all five processes involves heating in microwave oven which ensures uniform heating on the surface as well as the bulk of the material rengaraj et al 1999 the uniform heating with microwave yields best charring effect saminathan et al 2016 with the microwave heating all the vaporizable organic compounds were removed and finally a carbon with fewer impurities was obtained generally the prepared carbonaceous activated carbon materials possess high surface area in the range of 500 1500 m2 g thitame and shukla 2015 the bet surface area analysis demonstrates that all the five activated carbon have exceptionally developed porosity and high surface area commercial activated carbon samples with bet surface area in the range of 657 773 m2 g shows good adsorption towards a commercial reactive dye giannakoudakis et al 2016 except apac1 the other four activated carbon samples have a bet surface area greater than 749 m2 g the apac5 prepared by charring with h2so4 has a bet surface area of 948 m2 g and is used to remove the reactive dye rr195 in this study 3 2 sem and ftir analysis the scanning electron microscopic images are presented in fig 1 a e the activated char prepared by five different processes were found to have highly opened surface imperfections with long and deep cavities the imperfections on the apac1 surface were less in comparison with other activated carbons the role of chemical agents towards the development of surface porosity plays a significant role all the chemical agents zncl2 koh h3po4 and h2so4 render their role in developing porosity on carbon surface especially h2so4 is a powerful charring agent which quickly removes the liquid and other soluble organic compounds with great ease followed by the chemical treatment microwave assisted charring greatly develops the porous network on carbon surface the peaks of ftir fig 2 spectra are useful to evaluate the functional groups present in the prepared activated carbon surface the peaks corresponding to oh str belongs to alcohols was observed between 3602 and 3617 cm 1 in apac3 and apac4 all the five samples contain peaks at 3413 to 3435 cm 1 for nh str belongs to aliphatic primary amines mubarak et al 2017 the ch str peaks observed between 2893 and 2924 cm 1 substantiate the presence of alkene and unsaturated carbon network mubarak et al 2017 the co2 absorption frequency found in carbon samples apac1 and apac5was observed to be 2426 cm 1and this could have been originated from the adsorbed co2 molecules after removing the functional impurities all five carbon samples had cc str at 1616 to 1637 cm 1 and ch bending vibrations at 1380 to 1431 cm 1 lima et al 2008 these peaks clearly depicted that the prepared carbon samples has the exceptional graphitic network with minimum amount of surface functional groups palanisamy and sivakumar 2009 ozacar and sengil 2005 on analysing the intensity of major peaks sample apac5 has the major reduction of all functional peaks the graphitic network is substantiated by a sharp and intense peak at 1380 to 1384 cm 1 responsible for ch bending of alkenes qi et al 2016 based on the surface characteristics apac5 has a superior surface area hence it was used for further adsorption of dyes under batch and column mode 3 3 batch mode adsorption of rr195 under the batch mode adsorption analysis the parameters that greatly affect the adsorption of solute by solid adsorbents like solution ph sorbent quantity solute concentration and temperature were studied 3 4 effect of sorbent dosage any sorption process involving porous adsorbent and aqueous phase solutes are greatly influenced by the sorbent dosage generally the total quantity of solute adsorbed is directly proportional to the quantity of sorbent used the reason that could be associated with this trend is that more the quantity of adsorbent the more will be the surface area and obviously the quantity of solute adsorption is also more mahanna and samy 2020 the variation in rr195 adsorption per gram of adsorbent on varying sorbent dosage is shown in fig s2 supplementary data it was observed that the apac5 quantity exceeding 100 mg does not show any remarkable increase in adsorption per unit mass of the adsorbent the decrease in adsorption at higher apac5 dose could be attributed to the reduction in the number of sorbent sites in the vicinity of solute and increase in diffusion path length owing to the overcrowding of adsorbent particles mahvi and dalvand 2020 3 5 effect of ph the ph of dye bath is an important processing condition for the effective affinity of dyes on fabrics similarly adsorption of dyes by solid adsorbents also varies to a great extent on changing the ph of the solution aksakal and ucun 2010 the variation of rr195 adsorption with varying ph was evaluated by taking 100 ml of 50 mg l of rr195 dye solution and it was agitated with 100 mg of apac5 for 90 min the adsorption performance was evaluated by fixing the ph of solution from 2 to 12 the variation of rr195 adsorption onto apac5 at different ph is shown in fig 3 in aqueous solution rr195 dye ionises into rr195 and na the anionic dye species have greater attraction towards apac5 at lower ph at lower ph less than the phzpc of apac5 the surface of adsorbent acquires a positive charge and rr195 ions are adsorbed with greater ease as the phzpc of apac5 is 6 5 when the solution ph exceeds 6 5 the sorbent surface become negative ozcan and ozcan 2004 the negatively charged surface tend to repel the rr195 ions and the adsorption shows a decreasing trend hence the removal of rr195 by apac5 could proceed better under acidic ph ph less than 6 5 dursun and tepe 2011 3 6 effect of dye concentration and temperature the role of rr195 concentration towards its adsorption by apac5 was studied by varying the rr195 initial concentration from 25 to 100 mg l at a temperature of 30 c the variations of rr195 adsorption with time at different initial rr195 concentrations are shown in fig s3 supplementary data the rate of adsorption during the begging was very high almost 50 of the total adsorption happened within 30 min of the agitation after 30 min the rate of adsorption decreased and the equilibrium attained at 90 min at the beginning of adsorption all the adsorption sites are vacant and hence the rate of adsorption was fast as the adsorption proceeded the ratio of vacant sites to the occupied sites diminishes hence the rate of adsorption show a down trend abdelwahab 2008 pormazar et al 2020 by increasing the initial dye concentration from 25 to 100 mg l the percentage of rr195 adsorbed on to apac5 decreased from 100 to 78 85 this can be explained by the fact that for a fixed number of sorbent sites and for an increase in solute concentration there are no sufficient sites available for sorption and hence percentage of adsorption decreases si et al 2015 on increasing the rr195 concentration from 25 to 100 mg l the quantity of rr195 adsorbed at equilibrium was increased from 25 00 to 78 85 mg g the higher initial rr195 concentration provides necessary driving force to surpass the mass transfer resistance developed between the solute and sorbent surface amin 2009 the adsorption of solutes by a sorbent is also influenced by the surrounding temperature to a considerable extent the variations of rr195 adsorption on to apac5 surface at various temperatures are shown in fig s4 supplementary data it was observed that when the temperature increased from 30 to 45 c the amount of rr195 uptake decreased from 47 12 to 44 23 mg g high temperature was not a favourable condition for rr195 adsorption onto apac5 the decrease of rr195 adsorption with increase in temperature substantiated the exothermic nature of adsorption kumaravelan and sivakumar 2018 at higher temperature the kinetic energy of the dye molecules increases and there by the rate of desorption also increases leading to a decreased adsorption 3 7 adsorption kinetics the rate of change of adsorption with time is an essential parameter to develop a large scale system for industrial operations the kinetics of adsorption was evaluated using linear and nonlinear forms of pseudo first order lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order kinetic expressions ho and mckay 1999 the plots are given in fig 4 and the results are summarised in table 4 the results generated from the linearized forms of certain mathematical expression can generate results with poor accuracy or erroneous results in this study the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear forms of kinetic expressions were compared based on the low standard deviation and high r2 value better results were obtained and reported the pseudo first order rate constant calculated using the linear expression increased from 0 041 to 0 047 min 1 whereas it decreased from 0 0425 to 0 0343 min 1 in nonlinear model the value of r2 shows that the linear first order kinetic model fits poor to the present adsorption system and the nonlinear model showed an excellent fit with high r2 ranged between 0 9971 and 0 9996 the standard deviation calculated between the experimental qe and calculated qe in linear model was high 1 018 5 148 the sd value to the nonlinear model was very low 0 140 1 008 the reduced chi square value and r2adj also substantiate that the nonlinear first order kinetic expression best described the adsorption behaviour in comparison with the linear model the second order kinetic expressions in the form of linear and nonlinear model were also employed to analyse the adsorption kinetics the qe calculated using the second order expression both linear and nonlinear shows high standard deviations the second order rate constant k2 decreased from 1 4 10 3 to 3 0 10 4 g mg min in both linear and nonlinear second order expressions the reduced chi square value was high in linear and nonlinear second order expressions most of the reports published by the past researchers have shown that pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable than pseudo first order kinetic model for the study of dye adsorption kinetics aksakal and ucun 2010 mahanna and samy 2020 sismanoglu et al 2010 under different concentration and temperature the application of nonlinear kinetic expression have proved that the residual rr195 concentration was the only factor that controls the rate limiting step as indicated from the nonlinear first order results it may be inferred that linearization of all mathematical expressions are not advisable for the evaluation of kinetic results the intra particle diffusion mechanism proposed by weber and morris 1963 was also employed to analyse the adsorption mechanism of rr195 on to apac5 surface according to this model a plot of square root of agitation time against qe yield a straight line if the adsorption follows intra particle diffusion mechanism it was observed from fig s5 supplementary data that the second and linear phase does not pass through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion was not only the rate limiting step the intra particle diffusion rate constant kid varies between 0 469 and 0 141 mg g min½ under different concentrations 0 216 0 237 mg g min½ under various temperature this trend indicated that high concentration gradient decreases the intra particle diffusion at higher rr195 concentrations 3 8 adsorption isotherm the interaction between solute and sorbent is well evaluated from the isotherm parameters obtained at a given temperature the isotherm analysis gives a relationship between the quantities of solute present at the solid surface with that of solute in the bulk of the solution the widely used isotherm models viz langmuir and freundlich models were used to evaluate the adsorption parameters of rr195 on to apac5 langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 the langmuir isotherm was derived with an assumption of monolayer coverage of adsorbate on energetically homogeneous surface hosseinzehi et al 2020 the langmuir parameters q0 and bl denotes the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity and langmuir rate constant respectively the linear and nonlinear plots of langmuir models are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively and the results are presented in table 6 the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity decreased from 59 88 to 45 66 mg g in the linearized model analysis on analysing the isotherm data using nonlinear model the q0 increased from 87 27 to 106 85 mg g the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity observed in the present adsorbent system is comparable with the other adsorbents used for rr195 adsorption as shown in table s2 supplementary data mahmoud et al 2016 tahir et al 2016 xue et al 2010 yi et al 2012 further the nonlinear model also show poor r2 r2adj and reduced chi square values the freundlich plot of linear and nonlinear expressions are given in fig 5c and d respectively and the calculated results are presented in table 5 the freundlich rate constant shows a decreasing trend in linear and nonlinear analysis the value of adsorption intensity n varies between 2 953 and 13 649 in linear model and 3 333 to 2 003 in nonlinear analysis low standard deviation high r2 and r2adj values close to 1 0 indicates that freundlich adsorption isotherm in its nonlinear form best describes the adsorption isotherm of rr195 adsorption onto apac5 surface the suitability of freundlich isotherm substantiated that during the rr195 adsorption the apac5 surface was energetically heterogeneous and the adsorption of rr195 was not limited to monolayer sismanoglu et al 2010 have reported similar nature for the adsorption of reactive blue 21 and reactive red 195 dyes using clinoptilolite as an adsorbent 3 9 adsorption thermodynamics the standard thermodynamic parameters like enthalpy change δh entropy change δs and gibbs free energy change δg are very much essential to determine the feasibility and energy changes involved during the adsorption cicek et al 2007 these parameters were evaluated from the dimensionless equilibrium constant of adsorption generally these parameters were calculated using langmuir rate constant which is having unit of l mg as suggested by liu 2009 we have employed the following equation for the calculation of δg and the results are provided in table 6 δ g rt ln 55 5 x b l on multiplying the langmuir constant with 55 5 mg l 1000 g divided by the molar mass of water the langmuir constant is converted into the dimensionless parameter this modified equation holds good for the evaluation of δg of charged ions having substantial concentration liu 2009 the enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were evaluated from the slope and intercepts of linear plot of 1 t vs ln 55 5 x bl the negative enthalpy change indicated that the rr195 adsorption onto apsc5 was exothermic as evidenced from the decrease of qe with increase of temperature generally in adsorptions involving physical forces of attraction the enthalpy varies between 2 0 and 20 0 kj mol theydan and ahmed 2012 the enthalpy of rr195 adsorption is 11 21 kj mol which validates the physisorption type interaction that operates between rr195 and apac5 surface the positive and high value of entropy change indicates that there has been an increased randomness at the apac5 solution interface cicek et al 2007 the negative sign of gibbs free energy change depicts that the adsorption of rr195 onto apac5 was spontaneous under a given set of operating conditions 3 10 column adsorption of rr195 the application of an adsorption system for the wastewater treatment in industrial operations can be evaluated with the fixed bed column which will suit the best due to its continuous mode of operation the development of a better column adsorption system is entirely different from that of a batch mode adsorption the major advantage associated with column mode dye adsorption is that a continuous flow is maintained through column and thereby an effective dye removal is ensured 3 10 1 effect of initial rr195 concentration the impacts of rr195 concentration on apac5 column was evaluated by varying the initial rr195 concentration from 25 to 75 mg l for a bed height of 5 0 cm and a flow rate of 10 ml min the breakthrough curves at different initial rr195 concentrations are shown in fig s6 supplementary data on increasing the rr195 concentration the breakthrough curves were more steeper the slope of breakthrough curve increases the break through volume at 90 of initial rr195 concentration decreased from 3500 ml 2800 ml on increasing rr195 concentration from 25 to 75 mg l even though the throughput volume decreased with the inverse of initial concentration the quantity of rr195 adsorption increased from 87 50 mg to 210 0 mg with higher concentration the concentration gradient across the solid liquid interface increases and thereby the quantity of rr195 removed per unit mass increases baek et al 2007 3 11 effect of bed height the effect of apac5 bed height on the break through curves of rr195 was evaluated by changing the height of bed from 5 to 7 5 and to 10 cm for a fixed initial dye concentration of 50 mg l and a flow rate of 10 ml min the breakthrough curves fig s7 supplementary data depicts that the transfer of rr195 on to apac5 column was rapid the volume of rr195 treated at the break through increased from 3050 ml to 4850 ml on increasing the bed height from 5 cm to 10 cm the increase of bed height from 5 to 10 cm the quantity of rr195 adsorbed on apac5 column increased from 152 5 mg to 242 5 mg while increasing the depth of column the number of sorption sites available for adsorption increased and thereby the quantity of dye removed had also increased nwabanne and igbokwe 2012 3 12 effect of flow rate the impact of dye solution flowing through the column also has a significant influence on the column efficiency the breakthrough curves at different flow rates are shown in fig s8 supplementary data the maximum volume of 50 mg l rr195 treated for a bed depth of 5 cm was achieved at a lower flow rate of 5 ml min the quantity of rr195 removed at breakthrough decreased from 165 0 mg to 127 5 mg on increasing the flow rate from 5 to 15 ml min at lower flow rate the dye molecules have enough time for its interaction with sorption sites while at higher flow rates the fraction of molecules having good interaction with sorption sites gets decreased sivakumar and palanisamy 2009 the flow rate optimization is very much essential for setting up large scale industrial treatment plants 3 13 evaluation of column kinetics the column adsorption kinetics was analysed using the well known kinetic models viz yoon nelson and thomas models yoon and nelson 1984 thomas 1944 the column adsorption kinetics was tested with yoon nelson and thomas mathematical models fig s9 s10 supplementary data and the results are given in table 7 the thomas rate constant kt decreased from 1 6 10 4 to 0 8 10 4 with raise in influent concentration from 25 to 75 mg l and it increased with increase in bed depth as well as flow rate basically the thomas model was derived without considering the mass transfer resistance within the adsorbent particle nwabanne and igbokwe 2012 the external fluid film resistance was also not taken into account while calculating the rate constant of thomas model the thomas model maximum adsorption capacity qo t increased from 62 09 to 143 15 mg g on increasing the rr195 concentration and it decreased from 71 09 to 55 37 mg g and 72 10 to 53 64 mg g upon increase in flow rate and bed height respectively the poor r2 value and high standard deviation of thomas model indicate its poor fitness for the rr195 column adsorption data the yoon nelson rate constant kyn show an increasing trend with increase of concentration and flow rate and it decreased with increase of bed height the time needed to achieve 50 break through τ min increased with concentration and bed height and it decreased with raise in flow rate the adsorption capacity evaluated with y n model best coincided with the experimentally calculated values with low sd and good r2 value the yoon nelson model derived with an assumption that the decrease of adsorption rate is proportional to adsorbate adsorption and adsorbate breakthrough best suited for rr195 adsorption on to apac5 column sivakumar and palanisamy 2009 4 conclusions the results of present investigation indicated that a high surface active carbon can potentially be prepared from the seeds of adenanthera paronina l all the five prepared carbon samples were found to have a well developed porous network with high surface area among them apac5 has superior surface characteristics with a bet surface area of 948 m2 g the chemical agents and microwave irradiated activation removes majority of surface impurities and thereby yields a high surface activated carbon the effect of ph on batch mode adsorption study depicts that acidic ph is suitable for rr195 adsorption onto apac5 surface the apac5 has a potential to remove 78 85 mg g of rr195 at an initial concentration of 100 mg l the nonlinear kinetic expressions were most suited and yields more prominent results when compared with the linearized mathematical models the column mode adsorption analysis demonstrated that apac5 could remove 82 35 mg g of rr195 at an initial concentration of 75 mg l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest related to this research work appendix a supplementary data

present study the downscaled bias corrected daily weather data on maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and rainfall rf of the two representative concentration pathways rcp i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 were extracted for four locations namely bathinda ludhiana patiala and ropar using data from csrio mk 6 cm model for the period 2020 2095 table 1 the estimated climate data was then interpolated to obtain district wise values of tmax tmin and rf for the entire tract using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation technique in arcgis the selection of the climate model was based on the study in the neighboring region of pakistan by khan et al 2018 which concluded performance of the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization australia csiro mk3 6 0 and max planck institute mpi esm lr models justified in projecting the climate changes in future the two ranges of pathways adopted by ipcc in the fifth assessment report of 2014 i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 were selected for the present study due to possible reasons for one of these climatic scenarios to occur in future depending on the volume of greenhouse gasses ghg emitted in the years to come the difference downscaling approach was used to downscale the daily future data after which it was bias corrected by the department of climate change and agro meteorology punjab agricultural university ludhiana the bias corrected daily future data on tmax tmin and rf under rcp scenarios were averaged to get monthly and annual values this averaged annual climate data was then averaged for five year interval for e g 2020 25 2025 30 and so on till 2090 95 to compute future groundwater draft and recharge based on the norms previously stated for the following pumping conditions table 2 recharge through rainfall seepage from the canal network recharge through canal and tube well irrigated areas become inputs to the groundwater system since the canal water supply was more or less constant during the study period the parameters of seepage loses and recharge through canal water till 2095 were assumed to be constant as calculated for the year 2017 18 as the values were more or less constant during present time step pts i e from 1998 99 to 2017 18 a stress period of 1825 days was considered for the model to simulate five year averaged impacts of climate data on groundwater system in transient condition from 2020 25 to 2090 95 further two future times lapse i e mid century mc from the years 2020 2050 and end century ec from the years 2065 2095 were considered to analyze the temporal variation of the predicted climate data on groundwater levels with respected to the observed groundwater levels inpts 1998 2018 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation due to heterogeneous topography and varied lithology in the sirhind canal tract inverse simulation model pest was run multiple times to obtain the final calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity between 1 m day to 100 m day and specific yield within 0 0 0 2 fig 4 values of average me calculated as 0 227 and 0 341 as well as rmse calculated as 0 470 and 0 662 between observed and predicted hydraulic heads during calibration and validation period respectively for the tract were found under acceptable limits these calculated low values justify model s rational simulation of the spatial and temporal variations in the magnitude of hydraulic head fig 5 the calculated overall modeling efficiency as 0 9994 and 0 9990 during calibration and validation period respectively show a fair match between simulated hydraulic and observed heads fig 6 a variation of 0 0 75 m between the observed and simulated water levels of the internal nodes validates a satisfactory groundwater model performance boonstra and de ridder 1981 karanjac and altunkaynak 1977 toews and allen 2009 these simulated values fairly match with the results of average modeling efficiency as 0 9993 during calibration period 1996 2001 and 0 9988 during validation period 2001 2006 given by miglani et al 2015 in a study conducted to assess the groundwater resources and simulate groundwater behaviour in sirhind canal tract of punjab using modflow 4 2 future climate data the downscaled bias corrected climatic data on tmax tmin and rf for the period 2020 25 to 2090 95 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 emission scenarios was generated with the help of csiro mk 6 cm model and interpolated for sirhind canal tract of punjab as presented below when compared with pts 1998 2018 tmin is predicted to increase by 2 7 c during mc and 4 5 c during ec under rcp 4 5 whereas under rcp 6 0 this increase would be of 2 4 c and 4 4 c during mc and ec respectively similarly tmax is predicted have a rise of 1 3 c and 2 9 c in mc and ec respectively under rcp 4 5 while a rise of 0 9 c in mc and 2 7 c in ec under rcp 6 0 has been predicted in another study by nayak et al 2015 an increase of 4 5 c and 7 9 c in tmin in mc and ec and corresponding increase of 1 6 c and 4 5 c respectively in tmax was reported under precis a1b climate scenario for joga distributary in sirhind command area of satluj river basin in india during mc the change in the climatic parameters was experienced more under rcp 4 5 in comparison to rcp 6 0 as the emissions under rcp 4 5 are expected to peak around 2040 with a decline while the emissions under rcp 6 0 would peak around 2080 with a further decline the mean temperature tmean of the tract is expected to have a higher increase of 1 9 c in mc and 3 6 c in ec under rcp 4 5 scenario than estimated increase of 1 6 c in mc and 3 5 c in ec under rcp 6 0 fig 7 these results are in disagreement to tmean forecasts by dar et al 2019 for ludhiana district of punjab using global climate model had gem2 es under rcps 4 5 who predicted a low rise of 1 6 c in mc and 3 1 c in ec under rcp 4 5 than the rise of 2 75 c in mc and 5 46 c in ec under rcp 8 5 the average rainfall of 405 mm calculated in pts for the sirhind canal tract is predicted to increase by 22 4 in mc after that it is expected to decrease by 4 7 till ec under rcp 4 5 under rcp 6 0 the increase in the predicted rainfall from pts to mc would be of 17 2 and of18 0 from pts to ec fig 8 fluctuating trends were forecasted by dar et al 2019 using global climate model had gem2 es for ludhiana district of punjab where rf would decrease by 12 8 in mc and 11 8 in ec under rcp 4 5 and would increase by 20 and 33 by mc and ec respectively under rcp 8 5 however an increasing trend was observed by kaur et al 2015 in her study simulating an identical rise of 19 7 by mc and 18 by ec in the annual precipitation by using climate outputs under a1b climate scenario from precis rcm in ludhiana district of punjab similarly nayak et al 2015 estimated an increase of 13 55 in mc and 24 45 in ec in precipitation under precis a1b scenario for satluj river basin of india 4 3 implications of climate change 4 3 1 recharge and draft two pumping conditions i e condition a and condition b were considered to analyze the groundwater levels under changing climate scenarios during mc and ec mentioned in table 2 in condition a the average draft would decrease by 3 3 in mc under rcp 4 5 from the draft observed in 2018 under rcp 6 0 the draft observed in 2018 would witness a decrease of 1 6 till ec the variation in the estimated groundwater draft is the result of high rain fall predicted under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 during mc and ec fig 8 indicating favorable climate change effects on groundwater draft however in condition b where tubewell number is expected to increase as per the historical trend the groundwater draft observed in 2018 is predicted to increase from 1026 mm by 57 4 and 110 7 in mc and ec respectively under rcp 4 5 with a similar increase of 61 5 in mc and 110 7 in ec under rcp 6 0 the increase in rainfall will positively impact the groundwater recharge under both scenarios the recharge of 424 mm observed in pts is expected to increase by29 9 in mc and 31 1 in ec under rcp 4 5 whereas an increase of 30 8 and 30 4 in mc and ec respectively would be witnessed in recharge under rcp 6 0 however during pumping condition b the tract would witness an increase in recharge by 98 1 and 174 1 in mc and ec respectively under rcp 4 5 with a similar increase of 98 6 in mc and 172 1 in ec under rcp 6 0 table 3 these findings are in agreement with nayak et al 2015 that projected an increase in groundwater recharge due to increased precipitation under precis a1b climate scenario for joga distributary of satluj basin however kaur et al 2015 predicted slight decrease in groundwater recharge for ludhiana district of punjab by ec due to increased urbanization and higher runoff loss 4 3 2 groundwater levels prediction of future climate with consequent variability in groundwater draft and recharge influenced the groundwater levels differently under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 during both the pumping conditions fig 9 under rcp 4 5 and in condition a the prediction of high rainfall in more number of years during mc coupled with constant pumpage would result in rise in mean groundwater levels to 21 4 m by 2050 a rise by 1 8 m from pts whereas groundwater level is expected to fall by 7 5 m 7 6 cm year by 2095 due to lesser increase in rainfall during ec as compared to mc similarly under rcp 6 0 and in condition a groundwater level is predicted to rise to 22 5 m by 2050 an increase by 0 7 m but in ec a fall of 3 6 m 5 7 cm year is predicted by 2095 fig 9 in condition b and rcp 4 5 the groundwater level would fall by 34 6 m in 2050 with an additional fall of 10 4 m by 2095 indicating a fall rate of 60 cm year under rcp 6 0 and in condition b the groundwater level would experience a fall of 32 2 m by 2050 and an additional fall of 25 3 m by 2095 with an average fall of 76 6 cm year fig 9 although higher rainfall is predicted during mc in both climate change scenarios a slight increase in the groundwater levels is predicted for pumping condition a during mc yet there is an overall downward trend in groundwater levels kaur 2013 predicted a decrease in groundwater levels by 2 2 m in 2050 and an increase by 4 8 m in 2098 compared to the base year of june 2000 under precis a1b scenario 5 conclusions change in climate is expected to produce a considerable change in groundwater resources and there is need to continuously monitor and predict the variability for its proper management for the same us geological survey model modflow under pmwin environment was used to simulate the future groundwater levels of sirhind canal tract for two groundwater pumping conditions proposed under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 climate scenarios the climatic predictions for 21st century using the outputs of the climate change model csrio mk 6 cm indicated an increase in tmin of 4 5 c under rcp 4 5 and 4 4 c under rcp 6 0 till ec tmax is expected to increase by 2 9 c and 2 7 c till ec under rcp 4 5 and 6 0 respectively whereas the rf is estimated to have increased by 17 7 under rcp 4 5 and 18 2 under rcp 6 0 till ec this modeled climate change predicted a water table fall of 5 7 m and 4 3 m by ec under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 respectively for pumping condition a whereas greater fall of 45 m and 57 5 m by ec under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 respectively during higher groundwater pumping condition b from these predicted results it can be concluded that the changing climate emerges as a risk to the groundwater resources of the sirhind canal tract in near future therefore proper monitoring of the groundwater conditions and development of adaptive policies is vital for sustainable management of groundwater resources in the region however the outcomes of the present study should not be interpreted as accurate quantitative predictions but trends because of various sources of uncertainties although we have tried to reduce uncertainty by adopting ensemble climate change scenarios and majority of findings are in agreement with the earlier research carried out for the region yet certain contradictions in research findings add to uncertainity in climate change impacts conceptualizing and simulating a groundwater model for alluvial aquifers itself is a challenging task and given the limitations in spatial data availability particularly of groundwater draft and recharge the present study utilized gec 2015 norms there is need to collect more hydro geological data across the region so as to enable better representation of groundwater systems declaration of competing interest the

increaseby1 9 c in mc and 3 6 c in ec in rcp 4 5 and by 1 6 c in mc and 3 5 c in ec in rcp 6 0 the rainfall is also predicted to increase by 17 7 and 18 2 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 the projected change in climate is expected to have positive influence of groundwater recharge with an average increase by 30 in condition a and 174 in condition b by ec a fall in water table fall by 5 7 m and 4 3 m by ec under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 respectively for pumping condition a is predicted whereas higher fall of 45 m and 57 5 m by ec under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 was predicted for condition b graphical

computed using the darcy s law a stress period of 365 days the time interval with constant recharge and draft values was considered to simulate annual effects on groundwater system in transient condition for a period of 20 years 1998 99 to 2017 18 3 3 3 data input output the spatial parameters viz hydraulic conductivity specific yield and initial hydraulic head and temporal parameters viz recharge and draft were specific inputs to the model the annual i e pre monsoon june water level records of different observation points in sirhind canal tract for the years 1998 2018were used to create raster map of water table for sirhind canal tract of punjab using arcgis 10 4 these raster maps were then used to prepare initial hydraulic head maps considering the dem of the study area table

present study the downscaled bias corrected daily weather data on maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and rainfall rf of the two representative concentration pathways rcp i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 were extracted for four locations namely bathinda ludhiana patiala and ropar using data from csrio mk 6 cm model for the period 2020 2095 table 1 the estimated climate data was then interpolated to obtain district wise values of tmax tmin and rf for the entire tract using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation technique in arcgis the selection of the climate model was based on the study in the neighboring region of pakistan by khan et al 2018 which concluded performance of the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization australia csiro mk3 6 0 and max planck institute mpi esm lr models justified in projecting the climate changes in future the two ranges of pathways adopted by ipcc in the fifth assessment report of 2014 i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 were selected for the present study due to possible reasons for one of these climatic scenarios to occur in future depending on the volume of greenhouse gasses ghg emitted in the years to come the difference downscaling approach was used to downscale the daily future data after which it was bias corrected by the department of climate change and agro meteorology punjab agricultural university ludhiana the bias corrected daily future data on tmax tmin and rf under rcp scenarios were averaged to get monthly and annual values this averaged annual climate data was then averaged for five year interval for e g 2020 25 2025 30 and so on till 2090 95 to compute future groundwater draft and recharge based on the norms previously stated for the following pumping conditions table 2 recharge through rainfall seepage from the canal network recharge through canal and tube well irrigated areas become inputs to the groundwater system since the canal water supply was more or less constant during the study period the parameters of seepage loses and recharge through canal water till 2095 were assumed to be constant as calculated for the year 2017 18 as the values were more or less constant during present time step pts i e from 1998 99 to 2017 18 a stress period of 1825 days was considered for the model to simulate five year averaged impacts of climate data on groundwater system in transient condition from 2020 25 to 2090 95 further two future times lapse i e mid century mc from the years 2020 2050 and end century ec from the years 2065 2095 were considered to analyze the temporal variation of the predicted climate data on groundwater levels with respected to the observed groundwater levels inpts 1998 2018 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation due to heterogeneous topography and varied lithology in the sirhind canal tract inverse simulation model pest was run multiple times to obtain the final calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity between 1 m day to 100 m day and specific yield within 0 0 0 2 fig 4 values of average me calculated as 0 227 and 0 341 as well as rmse calculated as 0 470 and 0 662 between observed and predicted hydraulic heads during calibration and validation period respectively for the tract were found under acceptable limits these calculated low values justify model s rational simulation of the spatial and temporal variations in the magnitude of hydraulic head fig 5 the calculated overall modeling efficiency as 0 9994 and 0 9990 during calibration and validation period respectively show a fair match between simulated hydraulic and observed heads fig 6 a variation of 0 0 75 m between the observed and simulated water levels of the internal nodes validates a satisfactory groundwater model performance boonstra and de ridder 1981 karanjac and altunkaynak 1977 toews and allen 2009 these simulated values fairly match with the results of average modeling efficiency as 0 9993 during calibration period 1996 2001 and 0 9988 during validation period 2001 2006 given by miglani et al 2015 in a study conducted to assess the groundwater resources and simulate groundwater behaviour in sirhind canal tract of punjab using modflow 4 2 future climate data the downscaled bias corrected climatic data on tmax tmin and rf for the period 2020 25 to 2090 95 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 emission scenarios was generated with the help of csiro mk 6 cm model and interpolated for sirhind canal tract of punjab as presented below when compared with pts 1998 2018 tmin is predicted to increase by 2 7 c during mc and 4 5 c during ec under rcp 4 5 whereas under rcp 6 0 this increase would be of 2 4 c and 4 4 c during mc and ec respectively similarly tmax is predicted have a rise of 1 3 c and 2 9 c in mc and ec respectively under rcp 4 5 while a rise of 0 9 c in mc and 2 7 c in ec under rcp 6 0 has been predicted in another study by nayak et al 2015 an increase of 4 5 c and 7 9 c in tmin in mc and ec and corresponding increase of 1 6 c and 4 5 c respectively in tmax was reported under precis a1b climate scenario for joga distributary in sirhind command area of satluj river basin in india during mc the change in the climatic parameters was experienced more under rcp 4 5 in comparison to rcp 6 0 as the emissions under rcp 4 5 are expected to peak around 2040 with a decline while the emissions under rcp 6 0 would peak around 2080 with a further decline the mean temperature tmean of the tract is expected to have a higher increase of 1 9 c in mc and 3 6 c in ec under rcp 4 5 scenario than estimated increase of 1 6 c in mc and 3 5 c in ec under rcp 6 0 fig 7 these results are in disagreement to tmean forecasts by dar et al 2019 for ludhiana district of punjab using global climate model had gem2 es under rcps 4 5 who predicted a low rise of 1 6 c in mc and 3 1 c in ec under rcp 4 5 than the rise of 2 75 c in mc and 5 46 c in ec under rcp 8 5 the average rainfall of 405 mm calculated in pts for the sirhind canal tract is predicted to increase by 22 4 in mc after that it is expected to decrease by 4 7 till ec under rcp 4 5 under rcp 6 0 the increase in the predicted rainfall from pts to mc would be of 17 2 and of18 0 from pts to ec fig 8 fluctuating trends were forecasted by dar et al 2019 using global climate model had gem2 es for ludhiana district of punjab where rf would decrease by 12 8 in mc and 11 8 in ec under rcp 4 5 and would increase by 20 and 33 by mc and ec respectively under rcp 8 5 however an increasing trend was observed by kaur et al 2015 in her study simulating an identical rise of 19 7 by mc and 18 by ec in the annual precipitation by using climate outputs under a1b climate scenario from precis rcm in ludhiana district of punjab similarly nayak et al 2015 estimated an increase of 13 55 in mc and 24 45 in ec in precipitation under precis a1b scenario for satluj river basin of india 4 3 implications of climate change 4 3 1 recharge and draft two pumping conditions i e condition a and condition b were considered to analyze the groundwater levels under changing climate scenarios during mc and ec mentioned in table 2 in condition a the average draft would decrease by 3 3 in mc under rcp 4 5 from the draft observed in 2018 under rcp 6 0 the draft observed in 2018 would witness a decrease of 1 6 till ec the variation in the estimated groundwater draft is the result of high rain fall predicted under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 during mc and ec fig 8 indicating favorable climate change effects on groundwater draft however in condition b where tubewell number is expected to increase as per the historical trend the groundwater draft observed in 2018 is predicted to increase from 1026 mm by 57 4 and 110 7 in mc and ec respectively under rcp 4 5 with a similar increase of 61 5 in mc and 110 7 in ec under rcp 6 0 the increase in rainfall will positively impact the groundwater recharge under both scenarios the recharge of 424 mm observed in pts is expected to increase by29 9 in mc and 31 1 in ec under rcp 4 5 whereas an increase of 30 8 and 30 4 in mc and ec respectively would be witnessed in recharge under rcp 6 0 however during pumping condition b the tract would witness an increase in recharge by 98 1 and 174 1 in mc and ec respectively under rcp 4 5 with a similar increase of 98 6 in mc and 172 1 in ec under rcp 6 0 table 3 these findings are in agreement with nayak et al 2015 that projected an increase in groundwater recharge due to increased precipitation under precis a1b climate scenario for joga distributary of satluj basin however kaur et al 2015 predicted slight decrease in groundwater recharge for ludhiana district of punjab by ec due to increased urbanization and higher runoff loss 4 3 2 groundwater levels prediction of future climate with consequent variability in groundwater draft and recharge influenced the groundwater levels differently under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 during both the pumping conditions fig 9 under rcp 4 5 and in condition a the prediction of high rainfall in more number of years during mc coupled with constant pumpage would result in rise in mean groundwater levels to 21 4 m by 2050 a rise by 1 8 m from pts whereas groundwater level is expected to fall by 7 5 m 7 6 cm year by 2095 due to lesser increase in rainfall during ec as compared to mc similarly under rcp 6 0 and in condition a groundwater level is predicted to rise to 22 5 m by 2050 an increase by 0 7 m but in ec a fall of 3 6 m 5 7 cm year is predicted by 2095 fig 9 in condition b and rcp 4 5 the groundwater level would fall by 34 6 m in 2050 with an additional fall of 10 4 m by 2095 indicating a fall rate of 60 cm year under rcp 6 0 and in condition b the groundwater level would experience a fall of 32 2 m by 2050 and an additional fall of 25 3 m by 2095 with an average fall of 76 6 cm year fig 9 although higher rainfall is predicted during mc in both climate change scenarios a slight increase in the groundwater levels is predicted for pumping condition a during mc yet there is an overall downward trend in groundwater levels kaur 2013 predicted a decrease in groundwater levels by 2 2 m in 2050 and an increase by 4 8 m in 2098 compared to the base year of june 2000 under precis a1b scenario 5 conclusions change in climate is expected to produce a considerable change in groundwater resources and there is need to continuously monitor and predict the variability for its proper management for the same us geological survey model modflow under pmwin environment was used to simulate the future groundwater levels of sirhind canal tract for two groundwater pumping conditions proposed under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 climate scenarios the climatic predictions for 21st century using the outputs of the climate change model csrio mk 6 cm indicated an increase in tmin of 4 5 c under rcp 4 5 and 4 4 c under rcp 6 0 till ec tmax is expected to increase by 2 9 c and 2 7 c till ec under rcp 4 5 and 6 0 respectively whereas the rf is estimated to have increased by 17 7 under rcp 4 5 and 18 2 under rcp 6 0 till ec this modeled climate change predicted a water table fall of 5 7 m and 4 3 m by ec under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 respectively for pumping condition a whereas greater fall of 45 m and 57 5 m by ec under rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 respectively during higher groundwater pumping condition b from these predicted results it can be concluded that the changing climate emerges as a risk to the groundwater resources of the sirhind canal tract in near future therefore proper monitoring of the groundwater conditions and development of adaptive policies is vital for sustainable management of groundwater resources in the region however the outcomes of the present study should not be interpreted as accurate quantitative predictions but trends because of various sources of uncertainties although we have tried to reduce uncertainty by adopting ensemble climate change scenarios and majority of findings are in agreement with the earlier research carried out for the region yet certain contradictions in research findings add to uncertainity in climate change impacts conceptualizing and simulating a groundwater model for alluvial aquifers itself is a challenging task and given the limitations in spatial data availability particularly of groundwater draft and recharge the present study utilized gec 2015 norms there is need to collect more hydro geological data across the region so as to enable better representation of groundwater systems declaration of competing interest the

potential human health risks caused by long term consumption of saline and nitrate rich groundwater in coastal lowland regions of the mekong delta hence this research aims to evaluate the links between groundwater quality and its suitability for use as irrigation and drinking water and potential human health risk the specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes 2 assess potential effects and health risks to different population groups due to high chloride and nitrate contaminations 2 study area the study is conducted in soc trang a coastal province located in the southeast of the mekong delta vietnam covering approximately 3310 km2 with a flat and low elevation ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 m fig 1 the study area is known for its tropical monsoon climate system with two distinct seasons the dry season starts from may to november and the rainy season lasts from december to april of the following year the average annual rainfall is about 1770 mm with high seasonality about 85 of the annual rainfall occurs during the rainy season in the study area land use land cover is dominated by agricultural land 84 8 of total area followed by residential land 5 2 and forested land 4 40 tran et al 2021 additionally soc trang province has various soil types including sandy alluvial salt and acid sulphate soils kawahigashi et al 2008 economically most of the local population depends primarily on agricultural activities which contribute to 42 of the total provincial gdp therefore the demand for freshwater resources in this province is incredibly high approximately 25 million cubic meters per year field survey data data not shown the study site has a dense surficial drainage network with a density of 2 21 km km2 tran et al 2021 the drainage network directly connects the hau river the bassac river to the northeast and the east sea to the southeast therefore the surface and subsurface flow dynamic in the area is driven by meteorological forces and flow regimes of the hau river streamflow and tidal regimes of the east sea tran et al 2019 2020bib tran et al 2020 bib tran et al 2019 together sands fluvial deposits and gravels with various grain sizes dominate sedimentary deposits tran et al 2019 2020bib tran et al 2020 bib tran et al 2019 also influence on the groundwater systems of the study area the aquifer system consists of seven hydrogeological units including holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 middle pleistocene qp23 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n22 lower pliocene n21 and upper miocene n13 tran et al 2020 wagner et al 2012 each hydrogeological unit has the upper and lower layers with different lithological characteristics the top layer consists of silt clay or mixed silt clay with low water yield wagner et al 2012 in contrast the lower part is relatively permeable consisting of fine to coarse sand gravel and pebbles hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 groundwater in the pleistocene aquifers and upper miocene are the primary supply source of drinking water because of its high yield and good quality compared to other aquifers tran et al 2018 however long term excessive groundwater extraction has caused an increase in chloride and nitrate concentrations in the aquifer system tran et al 2020 indeed soc trang frequently faces extreme seawater intrusion events causing severe water scarcity especially in the dry season 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and chemical analysis a total of 282 groundwater samples were collected from 145 wells in the dry and rainy season between 2017 and 2018 in soc trang fig 1 the wells are either household tube wells of soc trang water supply company and center for rural water supply and sanitation and boreholes from the national groundwater monitoring system the sampling depths varied from 3 5 m to 485 m below ground surface to cover all aquifer layers physical and chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and total dissolved solids tds were measured directly at the field by using hanna instruments portable meters each groundwater sample was collected after 15 20 min of purging until ph ec and do values were stabilised all groundwater samples were stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles kept at dark and 4 c subsequently all groundwater samples were filtered through

titration method finally ion balance was calculated for each sample the error was below 5 justifying the accuracy of the chemical analyses 3 2 drinking groundwater quality index groundwater quality index gwqi is widely used to assess general groundwater quality by converting multiple groundwater quality parameters into a single value adimalla and qian 2019 barakat et al 2019a ghouili et al 2018 zhai et al 2017 therefore the suitability of the groundwater for use as drinking water could be determined based on gwgi derived water quality status table 1 to determine gwqi eq 1 each parameter was assigned with a specific weight value wi depending on its potential to affect groundwater quality for drinking purposes the overall gwqi was calculated linearly by adding the quality rating qi to the unit weight wi 1 g w q i q i w i w i 2 w h e r e q i c o c i s i c i 100 3 w i k s i 4 k 1 1 s i where qi is a water quality rating for the ith parameter eq 2 wi is a unit weight for the ith parameter eq 3 si is a standard value of the ith parameter co is an observed value of the nth parameter ci is an ideal value of ith parameter and k is a constant for proportionality eq 4 here the main parameters used for gwqi calculations are provided in table 2 3 3 irrigation water quality indices iwqi natural groundwater often has high concentrations of dissolved ions because of geochemical reactions e g mineral dissolution ion exchange therefore using groundwater for irrigation could adversely affect the physiochemical conditions of soils and crops adimalla and qian 2019 to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation there are several indices including sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc soluble sodium percent ssp permeability index pi and magnesium hardness mh anim gyampo et al 2019 sabarathinam et al 2020 the relations used to estimate these indices are listed from eq 5 to eq 9 respectively according to these calculations we

health risk assessment human health problems are often related to long term consumption of unsafe water sources caused by natural and anthropogenic contaminants in surface and subsurface environments therefore assessing the potential health risks caused by substandard groundwater quality requires intensive investigation of water supply quality however water quality intimately depends on the hydrogeographic and hydrogeochemical conditions of each specific geographical location therefore the study conducted a health risk assessment hra to determine the potential impacts of contaminated water on human health accordingly we calculated the chronic daily intake cdi by intake and dermal contact of two contaminants nitrate 50 mg l and chloride 1000 mg l as they represent the chemicals of highest concern in drinking water for non carcinogenic risk assessments adimalla 2020 pazhuparambil jayarajan and kuriachan 2020 saleh et al 2019 the exposures of such pollutants to humans are

in eq 10 and eq 11 respectively karunanidhi et al 2020 also in order to accurately assess the overall health risks associated with ingestion and dermal pathways it is necessary to take into consideration as much as possible the solutes in water sources that are deemed harmful in this light chloride and nitrate parameters were selected to assess chloride reference dose 78 68 mg kg day was used for both oral and dermal pathways usepa 2018 whilst nitrate reference dose of 1 6 and 0 8 mg kg day was applied for oral and dermal contact respectively echa 2020 usepa 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater quality for drinking purposes 4 1 1 physio chemical characteristics ec is a fundamental parameter reflecting the ionic concentrations or concentrations of dissolved salts in a water sample in this study groundwater has a wide range of variation in ec values ranging from 117 to 18 500 μs cm average of 1755 2250 μs cm table 4 ec values show a heterogeneous spatial distribution figure s1a most of the high saline groundwater samples are found in shallow wells depth 40 m n 19 excepting a small number of samples n 4 in deep wells 40 m figure s1b such a spatial heterogeneity of ec can be attributed to several factors such as minerals dissolution seawater intrusion and human impacts han and currell 2018 hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 the range of ph variations could indicate the origin of groundwater and geochemical processes during water movement from recharge throughout porous media to discharge areas groundwater in the study area has a relatively wide variation in ph ranging from 6 1 to 9 3 average of 7 3 0 5 table 4 alkaline groundwater samples ph 7 5 were observed in inland to coastal areas southern bound direction figure s1c these high ph values are commonly found in deep aquifers depth 200 m figure s1d and are associated with the influence of the bicarbonate carbonate system tran et al 2020 relative to the drinking water standard ph 6 0 8 5 only three groundwater samples out of 282 exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 8 5 for drinking water however 15 samples have ph values below the minimum acceptable limit of 6 0 this issue was attributed to the process of iron oxidation occurring in the groundwater of the mekong delta ha et al 2019 total dissolved solids tds consist of major dissolved compounds in groundwater such as sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride sulphates nitrate and bicarbonate for this study groundwater tds was in the range of 82 12 950 mg l average of 1228 1576 mg l table 4 according to the who drinking water standard who 2017 acceptable drinking water quality should have tds values 500 mg l and is unpalatable if tds 1500 mg l accordingly 31 6 of the groundwater samples are safe for drinking while at least 19 5 are unpalatable high tds 1500 mg l was observed in both inland and coastal areas figure s1e especially in deep wells figure s1f indicating influences of groundwater salinization tran et al 2020 it was estimated that approximately 35 of groundwater samples exceed the maximum concentration of tds 1000 mg l based on the national technical regulation on domestic water quality qcvn 01 1 2018 byt as shown in table 4 overall concentrations of major elements were in the following order of dominance na ca2 mg2 k for cations and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 for anions sodium and cl showed higher concentrations than other ions and their na cl ratios approximated 0 86 characteristic of seawater composition suggesting seawater intrusion into the shallow aquifer system of the study area xiong et al 2020 although a certain amount of sodium daily intake is essential to ensure human health exceeding sodium intake causes adverse health risks especially hypertension and nausea diseases park and kwock 2015 rahaman et al 2020 therefore sodium is one of the most important parameters for human health risk assessment in this study sodium concentrations varied from 17 mg l to 8536 mg l average of 297 683 mg l while potassium concentrations ranged from 0 5 to 279 mg l average of 19 26 mg l table 4 high sodium and potassium concentrations were mainly observed in shallow aquifers of coastal areas figure s1i s1k figure s1j s1l indicating that seawater intrusion during the holocene period may play an important factor in the accumulation of these ions meyer et al 2019 accordingly more than 30 and 43 of groundwater samples in the study area exceed the maximum limit of sodium and potassium respectively calcium and magnesium are also important elements for human health however excessive uptake of these ions leads to several health problems especially kidney stones and hypertension cormick and belizán 2019 ndii et al 2020 concentrations of calcium varied from 0 1 to 927 mg l average of 45 82 mg l while magnesium concentrations ranged from 0 03 mg l to 693 mg l average of 46 81 mg l table 4 according to who and qcvn 01 1 2018 byt 2 and 4 of total groundwater samples in this study area exceeded the maximum calcium and magnesium concentrations respectively total hardness th reflects the hardness of water caused by calcium and magnesium adimalla and qian 2019 however the variation of th concentrations corresponds to different classes of water hardness for instance th values 75 indicate soft water while th in the ranges of 75 150 151 300 and 300 mg l are related to moderate hard and very hard water respectively adimalla and qian 2019 the th value of groundwater in this area varied from 13 mg l to 3080 mg l average of 280 377 mg l only 5 7 of groundwater samples in this area exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 500 mg l for drinking purposes who 2017 high th concentration 300 mg l in groundwater was observed in some locations in inland and coastal areas figure s1g in shallow aquifers meanwhile deeper aquifers show relatively low th 150 mg l figure s1h we have previously demonstrated that the precipitation of minerals e g calcite could be responsible for decreasing soluble ca mg in those deep aquifers tran et al 2020 besides chloride concentrations in this area ranged from 2 mg l to 15 883 mg l average of 413 1312 mg l table 4 high chloride concentration 1000 mg l was found not only in coastal areas but also in inland areas far from the east sea fig 2 a as well as both shallow and deep wells fig 2b this observation implies the complexity of past and presents seawater intrusion processes in this area hoang and bäumle 2019 pham et al 2019 tran et al 2020 approximately 28 and 23 of groundwater samples in the study area exceeded chloride concentration compared to the maximum concentration of 600 mg l and 300 mg l as regulated by who and qcvn 01 1 2018 byt table 4 respectively this result coupled with spatial heterogeneity of salinity at the aquifer system may exacerbate groundwater quality and put high risks to the water supply system in this study area finally more than 70 of groundwater samples have relatively high bicarbonate concentrations 200 mg l while only 4 of groundwater samples exceed 200 mg l of sulphates this could be associated with pyrite oxidation leading to an accumulation of sulphate in groundwater ha et al 2019 nitrate is among a few representative compounds for anthropogenic impacts on the aquatic environment egbi et al 2020 singh et al 2019 indeed high nitrate concentrations in groundwater are mainly related to domestic waste agricultural fertilizers industrial waste and wastewater egbi et al 2020 for several decades nitrate contamination has been a global problem deteriorating groundwater quality and causing severe health problems in many countries worldwide abdelwaheb et al 2019 adimalla and qian 2019 njuguna et al 2020 wagh et al 2020 nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 0 1 mg l to 260 mg l with an average of 9 26 mg l table 4 relatively high nitrate concentrations 10 mg l were observed in the urban area of soc trang city in an aquaculture field along the main river and on the coastline my xuyen and vinh chau fig 3 a which may be attributed to anthropogenic emissions additionally high nitrate concentration 20 mg l was also found in many deep wells depth 40 m n 16 fig 3b the contamination of nitrate in these deep wells may be associated with leaking artificial nitrate sources from landfills urban and agricultural areas via unprotected wells bourke et al 2019 lockhart et al 2013 pastén zapata et al 2014 tran et al 2020 in summary this assessment of groundwater quality in this area revealed that saline water and nitrate contaminations are significant issues exceeding the who drinking water standards as groundwater is the primary source of drinking water in coastal regions of the mekong delta the results suggested that long term consumption of this groundwater could lead to severe human health problems for the local population therefore assessing human health risks related to high nitrate and chloride concentration in the water supply system in this area is an imperative need 4 1 2 groundwater quality index gwqi groundwater quality index gwqi allows assessment of groundwater quality and it was classified into five categories corresponding to different levels of the suitability of the groundwater for use as drinking water table 1 in this study gwqi values ranged from 8 5 to 284 7 average of 63 8 40 6 table 6 accordingly groundwater quality was classified into excellent 41 5 good 40 4 poor 17 and very poor 1 1 for drinking purposes it was noted that gwqi has a heterogeneous spatial distribution in the study area for example poor gwqi 101 200 and unusable groundwater quality gwqi 201 300 were found in the north western regions and along rivers to the east sea fig 4 it was attributed to the fact that an ongoing and intensive extraction of groundwater in these areas may further reduce the availability of groundwater resources tran et al 2020 2021bib tran et al 2021 bib tran et al 2020 therefore alternative solutions should be adapted and pumping activities should be minimized in the north western and coastal areas of soc trang province 4 2 irrigation water quality groundwater quality assessment also plays a vital role in sustainable agricultural development in the region hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 hence we employed a combination of indices ec sar rsbc ssp pi and mh as shown in table 5 and fig 5 and wilcox s graphic richards 1954 fig 6 was used to evaluate the suitability of the groundwater source for irrigation purposes it is widely accepted that high sodium concentrations lead to the formation of sodic soil while exceeding salinity causes soil salinization both are detrimental to plant development kurunc et al 2020 machado and serralheiro 2017 in addition high concentrations of sodium and carbonate in irrigation water inhibit plant growth and subsequently reduce crops yield kurunc et al 2020 phogat et al 2020 therefore electrical conductivity and sodium concentrations are simple and crucial indicators in classifying irrigation water kurunc et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 according to the classification of irrigation water wilcox 1948 we categorized the groundwater samples into four classes based on their electrical conductivity table 5 these classes reflect their suitability to be used for irrigation as excellent good permissible and unsuitable 1 4 33 3 47 5 and 17 7 of our groundwater samples fall into these categories respectively table 5 in other words almost one in every five groundwater samples of this study area is too saline that could negatively influence the practices of sustainable agricultural development more importantly sar is a valuable index for the contribution of na relative to the sum of divalent cations richards 1954 higher sar reflects the situation where a high proportion of na relative to ca2 and mg2 could saturate the cation exchange complexes in soil and thus decrease soil permeability kurunc et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 in this area sar values of groundwater varied from 0 3 to 51 8 with an average of 6 8 9 2 high sar values 26 or unsuitable groundwater for irrigation correspond to 6 of the total dataset in other words this groundwater of substandard quality if used for agricultural purpose may damage soil structure and form sodic soils moreover another indicator of long term exacerbates soil health risks is the ssp index representing the relative contribution of alkali metals na and k to the total cation charges eq 7 ssp values ranged widely between 14 3 and 98 3 with an average of 58 5 22 7 it was estimated that 40 of groundwater samples were doubtful and unsuitable for irrigation due to the potential impacts of na and k on the soil structure additionally it is also essential to identify the chemical speciation of these alkali metals in groundwater to correctly identify their impacts on arable soils carbonate is a crucial ligand in groundwater high carbonate concentrations in groundwater often result in precipitation of ca2 and mg2 however the residual carbonate could form complexes with sodium that significantly decrease soil permeability and refer to the rsbc index accordingly rsbc values varied from 39 9 to 12 5 with an average of 3 1 5 0 in which nearly 69 of groundwater samples were unsuitable for irrigation based on the rsbc indices the estimation of permeability index pi values eq 8 showed that 54 6 of total groundwater samples in the study area are inappropriate for irrigation because of low permeability in summary most of the groundwater aquifers in this area are unsuitable for irrigation purpose this is mainly due to the alkali metals na and k and their dissolved chemical complexes carbonate more noticeable the alkali earth metals ca2 mg2 are an immediate concern as 87 2 of groundwater samples in the study area have high mh values 50 integration of ec and sar as the two significant factors associated with the poor quality of the groundwater was presented in the wilcox diagram fig 6 this approach allowed an overall classification of groundwater quality as excellent good permissible and unsuitable richards 1954 the result shows that 101 samples 35 4 fall under the excellent and good water classes for irrigation while 49 samples 17 5 fall under the unsuitable water class sodium for irrigation all these indexes pointed out that unsuitable groundwater is observed in the inland soc trang city and my tu district and coastal areas tran de and vinh chau districts fig 5 indicating the need for alternatives to the usage of groundwater for irrigation in these specific locations therefore these results call for imminent actions to protect groundwater resources for the agricultural sector which play a crucial socio economic factor in the mekong delta coastal area 4 3 health risk assessment long term consumption of groundwater containing high nitrate and salt concentrations causes serious human health problems rahaman et al 2020 rakib et al 2019 therefore non carcinogenic risks of nitrate and chloride concentration in drinking water are of primary concern to many coastal regions across the world where most of the population depends on groundwater as a primary water source especially in developing countries adimalla 2019 chakraborty et al 2019 rahaman et al 2020 rakib et al 2019 talukder et al 2016 including vietnam le et al 2020 tran et al 2020 with this regard the usepa health risk assessment method was used to evaluate the non carcinogenic effects of nitrate and chloride on adults males females children and infants the total hazard indices for those groups are calculated based on input parameters integrating nitrate and chloride concentration in each sample the scales for chronic and non carcinogenic risk assessment were classified into four categories including negligible hi 0 1 low 0 1 hi 1 0 medium 1 0 hi 4 0 and high hi 4 0 risks levels bortey sam et al 2015 egbi et al 2020 in general most groundwater samples 85 in this study have hi 1 0 indicating groundwater use in the study area is safe for human consumption fig 7 however approximately 15 of groundwater samples may cause a severe health risk for consumers 4 3 1 health risk assessment for adults the hi values for adult males ranged from 0 01 to 15 0 with an average of 0 4 1 3 table 6 accordingly approximately 93 of groundwater samples are below the male s actual safety limit suggesting that groundwater resources are safe to use fig 7 however around 7 of groundwater samples have their hi 1 for males indicating that they are probably exposed to the risks induced by nitrate contamination and saline water similarly the hi value of adult females varied from 0 01 to 17 7 average of 0 5 1 5 with 91 of groundwater samples under the acceptable level the distribution of hi values among the four categories of risks for male and female individuals has a similar trend fig 7 however the maximum hi value for the female group was 17 7 which was higher than the value of 15 0 for the male group in other words adult males show a stronger anti risk ability against nitrate contamination and high salinity in groundwater this result also indicated that human health risks for adult females are more significant than for adult males in the study area this observation agrees with previous studies egbi et al 2020 zhai et al 2017 for the health risk assessment approach gender diﬀerences constitute an essential factor aﬀecting the accuracy of health risk assessment results because of obvious diﬀerences in physiology and resistance to pollutants interferences between adult males and females zhai et al 2017 the spatial distributions of non carcinogenic index hi values for males fig 8 a and females fig 8b indicated that high risk areas hi 1 were located mainly in the southern inland and estuarine regions this is important to the local authorities as the inception of policies and mitigation solutions should be focused on these areas to protect residents from health risks caused by consuming unsuitable groundwater 4 3 2 health risk assessment for children and infants children and infants are highly vulnerable groups to water contamination because of the lower resistance to pollutants negative impacts when compared to adults zhai et al 2017 consequently the hi values for children and infants were higher than that of adults with maximum values of 20 0 and 29 9 respectively table 6 the infant group has the highest hi values ranging from 0 01 to 20 0 in which 87 of the study area had hi values 1 for infants i e no severe effects on the most sensitive population group more specifically infants health risks were classified into negligible 13 low 72 medium 12 and high risk 3 fig 8d similarly hi values of children indicated that about 91 of the groundwater samples have an acceptable level of water quality e g negligible category 24 and low risk category 67 on the other hand approximately 10 of the children population is exposed to significant risks medium 7 and high 2 fig 8c in short the health risks of diﬀerent population groups in the study area were relatively high the highest nitrate and saline concentrations were found in the inland and coastal areas figs 2 and 3 consequently the population in these regions are exposed to higher risks when compared to the rest of the province in general the average hi indices for diﬀerent populations in the study area vary widely with the order of infants adult females children adult males 5 conclusion this study provides the first comprehensive assessment into the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes and human health risks in soc trang province one of the most vulnerable coastal regions facing water scarcity in the mekong delta vietnam the following main findings from the present study are summarized below 1 high nitrate 50 mg l and chloride 1000 mg l concentrations were found not only in shallow but also in deep aquifers with the maximum values of 260 mg l and 16 000 mg l respectively 2 integrating all datasets into the general groundwater quality index confirmed that 18 of groundwater samples were poor and very poor for drinking 3 nearly 18 of total samples were unsuitable for irrigation purposes because of high salinity and solidity hazard long term use of inappropriate groundwater for irrigation may cause high risks of deteriorating soil health and the formation of sodic soils therefore this study draws more attention to actions and mitigation solutions to decrease the pressure on the available water resources in the impacted areas 4 human health risks were coherent among different population groups and locations in which the highest risks level of contamination was observed for infants 15 2 and followed by adult females 8 5 children 7 4 and adult males 7 1 these findings have been able to elucidate insights into the current water quality of the groundwater resources of the mekong delta lowland region we demonstrated that the current water quality was of vital concern as a significant proportion of wells were not suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes and could promote long term non carcinogenic health effects on the local populations the situation will likely deteriorate with both the ever intensifying anthropogenic activities and the rise of sea level collectively these two pressures would foster seawater intrusion in this multi layered aquifer system and amplify the negative impacts of substandard groundwater resources finally appropriate management strategies and mitigation solutions should be put in place to

collected in dry and rainy seasons between 2017 and 2018 multiple physio chemical parameters groundwater quality index gwqi and irrigation water quality indices iwqi were employed to evaluate the suitability of groundwater resources for drinking and irrigation purposes thereupon the hazard quotient hq and total hazard index hi were used to assess the non carcinogenic risks to different demographic groups gwqi indicates that groundwater samples are excellent 41 5 good 40 4 poor 17 and very poor 1 1 classes for drinking purpose the total hazard index hi indicated that 15 2 8 5 7 4 and 7 1 of samples express non carcinogenic health threats to infants females children and males irrigation water quality indices iwqi namely ec sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium bicarbonate

respectively which are suitable for irrigation use wilcox diagram shows that 17 54 of total groundwater samples exceed the permissible levels of salt tolerant crops and solidity hazards in the study area furthermore high concentrations of nitrate 50 mg l and chloride 1000 mg l were detected in the shallow intermediate and deep aquifers gwqi and iwq maps imply that groundwater in the south western area is suitable whereas groundwater in the central area is not recommended for any purpose these findings provide useful insights into the vulnerable groundwater system of the coastal lowland area of the mekong delta related to human activities agricultural practices dam construction and global climate change impacts accordingly appropriate management strategies for water resources and mitigation

although water resources play a crucial role in socio economic development in the mekong delta water quality has been increasingly deteriorated because of intensive human activities and natural variations dao et al 2020 ha et al 2019 hoang and bäumle 2019 hung van et al 2019 thanh giao et al 2021 thanh nguyen 2020 thu minh et al 2020 tran et al 2020 it is especially applicable to the coastal regions because of severe water pollution and seawater intrusion affecting both surface and groundwater systems dang et al 2020 dao et al 2020 thanh nguyen 2020 tran et al 2020 2021bib tran et al 2021 bib tran et al 2020 trung and tri 2014 intensive agricultural development and rapid industrialization in combination with extreme drought events and seawater intrusion have resulted in severe degradation of surface and groundwater resources buschmann et al 2008 chea et al 2016 nguyen et al 2020 tran et al 2020 recent studies indicated that the long term and unsuitable use of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes amplified human health problems and also threatened agricultural productions in the mekong delta braun et al 2019 le luu 2017 merola et al 2015 reid et al 2021 toan et al 2013 tran et al 2020 however there are few studies providing a quantitative assessment of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes moreover it is necessary to evaluate potential human health risks caused by long term consumption of saline and nitrate rich groundwater in coastal lowland regions of the mekong delta hence this research aims to evaluate the links between groundwater quality and its suitability for use as irrigation and drinking water and potential human health risk the specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes 2 assess potential effects and health risks to different population groups due to high chloride and nitrate contaminations 2 study area the study is conducted in soc trang a coastal province located in the southeast of the mekong delta vietnam covering approximately 3310 km2 with a flat and low elevation ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 m fig 1 the study area is known for its tropical monsoon climate system with two distinct seasons the dry season starts from may to november and the rainy season lasts from december to april of the following year the average annual rainfall is about 1770 mm with high seasonality about 85 of the annual rainfall occurs during the rainy season in the study area land use land cover is dominated by agricultural land 84 8 of total area followed by residential land 5 2 and forested land 4 40 tran et al 2021 additionally soc trang province has various soil types including sandy alluvial salt and acid sulphate soils kawahigashi et al 2008 economically most of the local population depends primarily on agricultural activities which contribute to 42 of the total provincial gdp therefore the demand for freshwater resources in this province is incredibly high approximately 25 million cubic meters per year field survey data data not shown the study site has a dense surficial drainage network with a density of 2 21 km km2 tran et al 2021 the drainage network directly connects the hau river the bassac river to the northeast and the east sea to the southeast therefore the surface and subsurface flow dynamic in the area is driven by meteorological forces and flow regimes of the hau river streamflow and tidal regimes of the east sea tran et al 2019 2020bib tran et al 2020 bib tran et al 2019 together sands fluvial deposits and gravels with various grain sizes dominate sedimentary deposits tran et al 2019 2020bib tran et al 2020 bib tran et al 2019 also influence on the groundwater systems of the study area the aquifer system consists of seven hydrogeological units including holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 middle pleistocene qp23 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n22 lower pliocene n21 and upper miocene n13 tran et al 2020 wagner et al 2012 each hydrogeological unit has the upper and lower layers with different lithological characteristics the top layer consists of silt clay or mixed silt clay with low water yield wagner et al 2012 in contrast the lower part is relatively permeable consisting of fine to coarse sand gravel and pebbles hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 groundwater in the pleistocene aquifers and upper miocene are the primary supply source of drinking water because of its high yield and good quality compared to other aquifers tran et al 2018 however long term excessive groundwater extraction has caused an increase in chloride and nitrate concentrations in the aquifer system tran et al 2020 indeed soc trang frequently faces extreme seawater intrusion events causing severe water scarcity especially in the dry season 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and chemical analysis a total of 282 groundwater samples were collected from 145 wells in the dry and rainy season between 2017 and 2018 in soc trang fig 1 the wells are either household tube wells of soc trang water supply company and center for rural water supply and sanitation and boreholes from the national groundwater monitoring system the sampling depths varied from 3 5 m to 485 m below ground surface to cover all aquifer layers physical and chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and total dissolved solids tds were measured directly at the field by using hanna instruments portable meters each groundwater sample was collected after 15 20 min of purging until ph ec and do values were stabilised all groundwater samples were stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles kept at dark and 4 c subsequently all groundwater samples were filtered through 0 2 μm cellulose ester filters physio chemical properties and compositions of groundwater were analysed according to the standard procedures of the american public health association e w rice et al 2017 and were described in detail in a previous publication tran et al 2020 briefly chemical analyses were performed at the hydrology and water environment laboratory university of tsukuba japan major cations na k ca2 and mg2 were measured by icp oes perkinelmer optima 7300 main anions cl no3 and so4 2 were analysed using ion chromatography shimadzu japan bicarbonate hco3 was determined by the titration method finally ion balance was calculated for each sample the error was below 5 justifying the accuracy of the chemical analyses 3 2 drinking groundwater quality index groundwater quality index gwqi is widely used to assess general groundwater quality by converting multiple groundwater quality parameters into a single value adimalla and qian 2019 barakat et al 2019a ghouili et al 2018 zhai et al 2017 therefore the suitability of the groundwater for use as drinking water could be determined based on gwgi derived water quality status table 1 to determine gwqi eq 1 each parameter was assigned with a specific weight value wi depending on its potential to affect groundwater quality for drinking purposes the overall gwqi was calculated linearly by adding the quality rating qi to the unit weight wi 1 g w q i q i w i w i 2 w h e r e q i c o c i s i c i 100 3 w i k s i 4 k 1 1 s i where qi is a water quality rating for the ith parameter eq 2 wi is a unit weight for the ith parameter eq 3 si is a standard value of the ith parameter co is an observed value of the nth parameter ci is an ideal value of ith parameter and k is a constant for proportionality eq 4 here the main parameters used for gwqi calculations are provided in table 2 3 3 irrigation water quality indices iwqi natural groundwater often has high concentrations of dissolved ions because of geochemical reactions e g mineral dissolution ion exchange therefore using groundwater for irrigation could adversely affect the physiochemical conditions of soils and crops adimalla and qian 2019 to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation there are several indices including sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc soluble sodium percent ssp permeability index pi and magnesium hardness mh anim gyampo et al 2019 sabarathinam et al 2020 the relations used to estimate these indices are listed from eq 5 to eq 9 respectively according to these calculations we classified groundwater samples as per their suitability for irrigation richards 1954 gupta 1983 todd 1980 doneen 1964 szaboles 1964 5 sodium adsorption ratio sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 6 residual sodium

health risk assessment human health problems are often related to long term consumption of unsafe water sources caused by natural and anthropogenic contaminants in surface and subsurface environments therefore assessing the potential health risks caused by substandard groundwater quality requires intensive investigation of water supply quality however water quality intimately depends on the hydrogeographic and hydrogeochemical conditions of each specific geographical location therefore the study conducted a health risk assessment hra to determine the potential impacts of contaminated water on human health accordingly we calculated the chronic daily intake cdi by intake and dermal contact of two contaminants nitrate 50 mg l and chloride 1000 mg l as they represent the chemicals of highest concern in drinking water for non carcinogenic risk assessments adimalla 2020 pazhuparambil jayarajan and kuriachan 2020 saleh et al 2019 the exposures of such pollutants to humans are

in eq 10 and eq 11 respectively karunanidhi et al 2020 also in order to accurately assess the overall health risks associated with ingestion and dermal pathways it is necessary to take into consideration as much as possible the solutes in water sources that are deemed harmful in this light chloride and nitrate parameters were selected to assess chloride reference dose 78 68 mg kg day was used for both oral and dermal pathways usepa 2018 whilst nitrate reference dose of 1 6 and 0 8 mg kg day was applied for oral and dermal contact respectively echa 2020 usepa 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater quality for drinking purposes 4 1 1 physio chemical characteristics ec is a fundamental parameter reflecting the ionic concentrations or concentrations of dissolved salts in a water sample in this study groundwater has a wide range of variation in ec values ranging from 117 to 18 500 μs cm average of 1755 2250 μs cm table 4 ec values show a heterogeneous spatial distribution figure s1a most of the high saline groundwater samples are found in shallow wells depth 40 m n 19 excepting a small number of samples n 4 in deep wells 40 m figure s1b such a spatial heterogeneity of ec can be attributed to several factors such as minerals dissolution seawater intrusion and human impacts han and currell 2018 hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 the range of ph variations could indicate the origin of groundwater and geochemical processes during water movement from recharge throughout porous media to discharge areas groundwater in the study area has a relatively wide variation in ph ranging from 6 1 to 9 3 average of 7 3 0 5 table 4 alkaline groundwater samples ph 7 5 were observed in inland to coastal areas southern bound direction figure s1c these high ph values are commonly found in deep aquifers depth 200 m figure s1d and are associated with the influence of the bicarbonate carbonate system tran et al 2020 relative to the drinking water standard ph 6 0 8 5 only three groundwater samples out of 282 exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 8 5 for drinking water however 15 samples have ph values below the minimum acceptable limit of 6 0 this issue was attributed to the process of iron oxidation occurring in the groundwater of the mekong delta ha et al 2019 total dissolved solids tds consist of major dissolved compounds in groundwater such as sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride sulphates nitrate and bicarbonate for this study groundwater tds was in the range of 82 12 950 mg l average of 1228 1576 mg l table 4 according to the who drinking water standard who 2017 acceptable drinking water quality should have tds values 500 mg l and is unpalatable if tds 1500 mg l accordingly 31 6 of the groundwater samples are safe for drinking while at least 19 5 are unpalatable high tds 1500 mg l was observed in both inland and coastal areas figure s1e especially in deep wells figure s1f indicating influences of groundwater salinization tran et al 2020 it was estimated that approximately 35 of groundwater samples exceed the maximum concentration of tds 1000 mg l based on the national technical regulation on domestic water quality qcvn 01 1 2018 byt as shown in table 4 overall concentrations of major elements were in the following order of dominance na ca2 mg2 k for cations and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 for anions sodium and cl showed higher concentrations than other ions and their na cl ratios approximated 0 86 characteristic of seawater composition suggesting seawater intrusion into the shallow aquifer system of the study area xiong et al 2020 although a certain amount of sodium daily intake is essential to ensure human health exceeding sodium intake causes adverse health risks especially hypertension and nausea diseases park and kwock 2015 rahaman et al 2020 therefore sodium is one of the most important parameters for human health risk assessment in this study sodium concentrations varied from 17 mg l to 8536 mg l average of 297 683 mg l while potassium concentrations ranged from 0 5 to 279 mg l average of 19 26 mg l table 4 high sodium and potassium concentrations were mainly observed in shallow aquifers of coastal areas figure s1i s1k figure s1j s1l indicating that seawater intrusion during the holocene period may play an important factor in the accumulation of these ions meyer et al 2019 accordingly more than 30 and 43 of groundwater samples in the study area exceed the maximum limit of sodium and potassium respectively calcium and magnesium are also important elements for human health however excessive uptake of these ions leads to several health problems especially kidney stones and hypertension cormick and belizán 2019 ndii et al 2020 concentrations of calcium varied from 0 1 to 927 mg l average of 45 82 mg l while magnesium concentrations ranged from 0 03 mg l to 693 mg l average of 46 81 mg l table 4 according to who and qcvn 01 1 2018 byt 2 and 4 of total groundwater samples in this study area exceeded the maximum calcium and magnesium concentrations respectively total hardness th reflects the hardness of water caused by calcium and magnesium adimalla and qian 2019 however the variation of th concentrations corresponds to different classes of water hardness for instance th values 75 indicate soft water while th in the ranges of 75 150 151 300 and 300 mg l are related to moderate hard and very hard water respectively adimalla and qian 2019 the th value of groundwater in this area varied from 13 mg l to 3080 mg l average of 280 377 mg l only 5 7 of groundwater samples in this area exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 500 mg l for drinking purposes who 2017 high th concentration 300 mg l in groundwater was observed in some locations in inland and coastal areas figure s1g in shallow aquifers meanwhile deeper aquifers show relatively low th 150 mg l figure s1h we have previously demonstrated that the precipitation of minerals e g calcite could be responsible for decreasing soluble ca mg in those deep aquifers tran et al 2020 besides chloride concentrations in this area ranged from 2 mg l to 15 883 mg l average of 413 1312 mg l table 4 high chloride concentration 1000 mg l was found not only in coastal areas but also in inland areas far from the east sea fig 2 a as well as both shallow and deep wells fig 2b this observation implies the complexity of past and presents seawater intrusion processes in this area hoang and bäumle 2019 pham et al 2019 tran et al 2020 approximately 28 and 23 of groundwater samples in the study area exceeded chloride concentration compared to the maximum concentration of 600 mg l and 300 mg l as regulated by who and qcvn 01 1 2018 byt table 4 respectively this result coupled with spatial heterogeneity of salinity at the aquifer system may exacerbate groundwater quality and put high risks to the water supply system in this study area finally more than 70 of groundwater samples have relatively high bicarbonate concentrations 200 mg l while only 4 of groundwater samples exceed 200 mg l of sulphates this could be associated with pyrite oxidation leading to an accumulation of sulphate in groundwater ha et al 2019 nitrate is among a few representative compounds for anthropogenic impacts on the aquatic environment egbi et al 2020 singh et al 2019 indeed high nitrate concentrations in groundwater are mainly related to domestic waste agricultural fertilizers industrial waste and wastewater egbi et al 2020 for several decades nitrate contamination has been a global problem deteriorating groundwater quality and causing severe health problems in many countries worldwide abdelwaheb et al 2019 adimalla and qian 2019 njuguna et al 2020 wagh et al 2020 nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 0 1 mg l to 260 mg l with an average of 9 26 mg l table 4 relatively high nitrate concentrations 10 mg l were observed in the urban area of soc trang city in an aquaculture field along the main river and on the coastline my xuyen and vinh chau fig 3 a which may be attributed to anthropogenic emissions additionally high nitrate concentration 20 mg l was also found in many deep wells depth 40 m n 16 fig 3b the contamination of nitrate in these deep wells may be associated with leaking artificial nitrate sources from landfills urban and agricultural areas via unprotected wells bourke et al 2019 lockhart et al 2013 pastén zapata et al 2014 tran et al 2020 in summary this assessment of groundwater quality in this area revealed that saline water and nitrate contaminations are significant issues exceeding the who drinking water standards as groundwater is the primary source of drinking water in coastal regions of the mekong delta the results suggested that long term consumption of this groundwater could lead to severe human health problems for the local population therefore assessing human health risks related to high nitrate and chloride concentration in the water supply system in this area is an imperative need 4 1 2 groundwater quality index gwqi groundwater quality index gwqi allows assessment of groundwater quality and it was classified into five categories corresponding to different levels of the suitability of the groundwater for use as drinking water table 1 in this study gwqi values ranged from 8 5 to 284 7 average of 63 8 40 6 table 6 accordingly groundwater quality was classified into excellent 41 5 good 40 4 poor 17 and very poor 1 1 for drinking purposes it was noted that gwqi has a heterogeneous spatial distribution in the study area for example poor gwqi 101 200 and unusable groundwater quality gwqi 201 300 were found in the north western regions and along rivers to the east sea fig 4 it was attributed to the fact that an ongoing and intensive extraction of groundwater in these areas may further reduce the availability of groundwater resources tran et al 2020 2021bib tran et al 2021 bib tran et al 2020 therefore alternative solutions should be adapted and pumping activities should be minimized in the north western and coastal areas of soc trang province 4 2 irrigation water quality groundwater quality assessment also plays a vital role in sustainable agricultural development in the region hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 hence we employed a combination of indices ec sar rsbc ssp pi and mh as shown in table 5 and fig 5 and wilcox s graphic richards 1954 fig 6 was used to evaluate the suitability of the groundwater source for irrigation purposes it is widely accepted that high sodium concentrations lead to the formation of sodic soil while exceeding salinity causes soil salinization both are detrimental to plant development kurunc et al 2020 machado and serralheiro 2017 in addition high concentrations of sodium and carbonate in irrigation water inhibit plant growth and subsequently reduce crops yield kurunc et al 2020 phogat et al 2020 therefore electrical conductivity and sodium concentrations are simple and crucial indicators in classifying irrigation water kurunc et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 according to the classification of irrigation water wilcox 1948 we categorized the groundwater samples into four classes based on their electrical conductivity table 5 these classes reflect their suitability to be used for irrigation as excellent good permissible and unsuitable 1 4 33 3 47 5 and 17 7 of our groundwater samples fall into these categories respectively table 5 in other words almost one in every five groundwater samples of this study area is too saline that could negatively influence the practices of sustainable agricultural development more importantly sar is a valuable index for the contribution of na relative to the sum of divalent cations richards 1954 higher sar reflects the situation where a high proportion of na relative to ca2 and mg2 could saturate the cation exchange complexes in soil and thus decrease soil permeability kurunc et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 in this area sar values of groundwater varied from 0 3 to 51 8 with an average of 6 8 9 2 high sar values 26 or unsuitable groundwater for irrigation correspond to 6 of the total dataset in other words this groundwater of substandard quality if used for agricultural purpose may damage soil structure and form sodic soils moreover another indicator of long term exacerbates soil health risks is the ssp index representing the relative contribution of alkali metals na and k to the total cation charges eq 7 ssp values ranged widely between 14 3 and 98 3 with an average of 58 5 22 7 it was estimated that 40 of groundwater samples were doubtful and unsuitable for irrigation due to the potential impacts of na and k on the soil structure additionally it is also essential to identify the chemical speciation of these alkali metals in groundwater to correctly identify their impacts on arable soils carbonate is a crucial ligand in groundwater high carbonate concentrations in groundwater often result in precipitation of ca2 and mg2 however the residual carbonate could form complexes with sodium that significantly decrease soil permeability and refer to the rsbc index accordingly rsbc values varied from 39 9 to 12 5 with an average of 3 1 5 0 in which nearly 69 of groundwater samples were unsuitable for irrigation based on the rsbc indices the estimation of permeability index pi values eq 8 showed that 54 6 of total groundwater samples in the study area are inappropriate for irrigation because of low permeability in summary most of the groundwater aquifers in this area are unsuitable for irrigation purpose this is mainly due to the alkali metals na and k and their dissolved chemical complexes carbonate more noticeable the alkali earth metals ca2 mg2 are an immediate concern as 87 2 of groundwater samples in the study area have high mh values 50 integration of ec and sar as the two significant factors associated with the poor quality of the groundwater was presented in the wilcox diagram fig 6 this approach allowed an overall classification of groundwater quality as excellent good permissible and unsuitable richards 1954 the result shows that 101 samples 35 4 fall under the excellent and good water classes for irrigation while 49 samples 17 5 fall under the unsuitable water class sodium for irrigation all these indexes pointed out that unsuitable groundwater is observed in the inland soc trang city and my tu district and coastal areas tran de and vinh chau districts fig 5 indicating the need for alternatives to the usage of groundwater for irrigation in these specific locations therefore these results call for imminent actions to protect groundwater resources for the agricultural sector which play a crucial socio economic factor in the mekong delta coastal area 4 3 health risk assessment long term consumption of groundwater containing high nitrate and salt concentrations causes serious human health problems rahaman et al 2020 rakib et al 2019 therefore non carcinogenic risks of nitrate and chloride concentration in drinking water are of primary concern to many coastal regions across the world where most of the population depends on groundwater as a primary water source especially in developing countries adimalla 2019 chakraborty et al 2019 rahaman et al 2020 rakib et al 2019 talukder et al 2016 including vietnam le et al 2020 tran et al 2020 with this regard the usepa health risk assessment method was used to evaluate the non carcinogenic effects of nitrate and chloride on adults males females children and infants the total hazard indices for those groups are calculated based on input parameters integrating nitrate and chloride concentration in each sample the scales for chronic and non carcinogenic risk assessment were classified into four categories including negligible hi 0 1 low 0 1 hi 1 0 medium 1 0 hi 4 0 and high hi 4 0 risks levels bortey sam et al 2015 egbi et al 2020 in general most groundwater samples 85 in this study have hi 1 0 indicating groundwater use in the study area is safe for human consumption fig 7 however approximately 15 of groundwater samples may cause a severe health risk for consumers 4 3 1 health risk assessment for adults the hi values for adult males ranged from 0 01 to 15 0 with an average of 0 4 1 3 table 6 accordingly approximately 93 of groundwater samples are below the male s actual safety limit suggesting that groundwater resources are safe to use fig 7 however around 7 of groundwater samples have their hi 1 for males indicating that they are probably exposed to the risks induced by nitrate contamination and saline water similarly the hi value of adult females varied from 0 01 to 17 7 average of 0 5 1 5 with 91 of groundwater samples under the acceptable level the distribution of hi values among the four categories of risks for male and female individuals has a similar trend fig 7 however the maximum hi value for the female group was 17 7 which was higher than the value of 15 0 for the male group in other words adult males show a stronger anti risk ability against nitrate contamination and high salinity in groundwater this result also indicated that human health risks for adult females are more significant than for adult males in the study area this observation agrees with previous studies egbi et al 2020 zhai et al 2017 for the health risk assessment approach gender diﬀerences constitute an essential factor aﬀecting the accuracy of health risk assessment results because of obvious diﬀerences in physiology and resistance to pollutants interferences between adult males and females zhai et al 2017 the spatial distributions of non carcinogenic index hi values for males fig 8 a and females fig 8b indicated that high risk areas hi 1 were located mainly in the southern inland and estuarine regions this is important to the local authorities as the inception of policies and mitigation solutions should be focused on these areas to protect residents from health risks caused by consuming unsuitable groundwater 4 3 2 health risk assessment for children and infants children and infants are highly vulnerable groups to water contamination because of the lower resistance to pollutants negative impacts when compared to adults zhai et al 2017 consequently the hi values for children and infants were higher than that of adults with maximum values of 20 0 and 29 9 respectively table 6 the infant group has the highest hi values ranging from 0 01 to 20 0 in which 87 of the study area had hi values 1 for infants i e no severe effects on the most sensitive population group more specifically infants health risks were classified into negligible 13 low 72 medium 12 and high risk 3 fig 8d similarly hi values of children indicated that about 91 of the groundwater samples have an acceptable level of water quality e g negligible category 24 and low risk category 67 on the other hand approximately 10 of the children population is exposed to significant risks medium 7 and high 2 fig 8c in short the health risks of diﬀerent population groups in the study area were relatively high the highest nitrate and saline concentrations were found in the inland and coastal areas figs 2 and 3 consequently the population in these regions are exposed to higher risks when compared to the rest of the province in general the average hi indices for diﬀerent populations in the study area vary widely with the order of infants adult females children adult males 5 conclusion this study provides the first comprehensive assessment into the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes and human health risks in soc trang province one of the most vulnerable coastal regions facing water scarcity in the mekong delta vietnam the following main findings from the present study are summarized below 1 high nitrate 50 mg l and chloride 1000 mg l concentrations were found not only in shallow but also in deep aquifers with the maximum values of 260 mg l and 16 000 mg l respectively 2 integrating all datasets into the general groundwater quality index confirmed that 18 of groundwater samples were poor and very poor for drinking 3 nearly 18 of total samples were unsuitable for irrigation purposes because of high salinity and solidity hazard long term use of inappropriate groundwater for irrigation may cause high risks of deteriorating soil health and the formation of sodic soils therefore this study draws more attention to actions and mitigation solutions to decrease the pressure on the available water resources in the impacted areas 4 human health risks were coherent among different population groups and locations in which the highest risks level of contamination was observed for infants 15 2 and followed by adult females 8 5 children 7 4 and adult males 7 1 these findings have been able to elucidate insights into the current water quality of the groundwater resources of the mekong delta lowland region we demonstrated that the current water quality was of vital concern as a significant proportion of wells were not suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes and could promote long term non carcinogenic health effects on the local populations the situation will likely deteriorate with both the ever intensifying anthropogenic activities and the rise of sea level collectively these two pressures would foster seawater intrusion in this multi layered aquifer system and amplify the negative impacts of substandard groundwater resources finally appropriate management strategies and mitigation solutions should be put in place to
