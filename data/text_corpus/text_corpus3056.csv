economic benefits which could save 6 20 57 14 of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via map recovery the results could provide theoretical and technical support for the development and application of ship sewage treatment process with the functions of pollutant removal and resource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ship domestic sewage struvite recovery induced crystallization seawater magnesium source nitrogen and phosphorus removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the significant development of maritime transportation has promoted the rapid progress of the global economy but the marine pollution caused by the increase in the number of ships has received widespread concern cai et al 2020 owing to the fluidity and spatial characteristics of the ship itself the domestic sewage from ships is directly discharged into the marine and inland river environments which will lead to water eutrophication and substantially affect the dissolved oxygen do content in the water and marine organisms chen et al 2022 kress et al 2016 in recent years the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships and the legislation of countries and regions worldwide have been developed to control the impact of ship sewage on the water environment chen et al 2022 however environmental pollution caused by domestic sewage from ships remains a significant problem that requires urgent attention the salinity chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen n phosphorus p and total suspended solids of ship domestic sewage are higher than those of municipal sewage owing to the special conditions and water saving measures on board kersh et al 2020 vaneeckhaute et al 2020 the characteristics of sewage on ships undoubtedly aggravate the difficulty of sewage treatment meanwhile the limited ship space and the inevitable vibration and shake during ship navigation also pose troubles for the effective treatment of ship domestic sewage at present the main functional unit for the treatment of ship domestic sewage is the activated sludge system p removal is achieved by polyphosphate organisms pao in wastewater treatment specifically pao can absorb a large amount of phosphate under aerobic conditions synthesize polyphosphate in cells and then remove p by discharging phosphorus rich sludge sumathi et al 2018 biological n removal includes nitrification performed by nitrifiers and denitrification by denitrifiers zhang et al 2021 generally nitrification and denitrification processes occur in aerobic and anoxic conditions of activated sludge system respectively li et al 2015 salinity markedly affects microbial activity in biological wastewater treatment processes dang et al 2022 fu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 previous studies found that the ship domestic sewage has approximately 0 9 salinity owing to the mixing of seawater e g using seawater for toilet flushing jiang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 however most nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria and paos originate from freshwater environments and are sensitive to the sewage with high salinity xu et al 2022 therefore the treatment of domestic sewage from ships using activated sludge system faces considerable difficulties the domestic sewage from ships is rich in n and p resources and the recovery of n and p from ship domestic sewage has obvious economic and environmental benefits the crystallization method is one of the most effective approaches for recovering n and p from wastewater saerens et al 2021 at present the struvite map crystallization and hydroxyl calcium phosphate hap crystallization eqs 1 and 2 are the main methods for nutrients recovery dai et al 2016 le et al 2021 ma et al 2020 compared with hap map can simultaneously recover n and p and the recovered product is used as an excellent slow release fertilizer zhang et al 2019 shaddel et al 2020a 2020b currently n and p recovered in the form of struvite mainly come from digested sludge supernatant lahav et al 2013 saerens et al 2021 human and animal excretion liao et al 2020 krishnamoorthy et al 2021 and sewage sludge ash li et al 2021 ravi et al 2022 however the research on recovering n and p from ship domestic sewage in the form of map has rarely been conducted previous studies found that the formation of map needs to be at alkaline ph optimal ph is 8 5 9 5 and the crystallization efficiency of map can also be significantly improved via seeds induced crystallization ic corre et al 2009 mehta et al 2013 li et al 2019 the method of aerated induced crystallization can improve the ph value of the reaction system and ensure the complete mixing of the reactor and save chemical reagents dai et al 2016 simultaneously the seawater is rich in low cost mg2 1530 mg l 63 75 mmol nur et al 2018 using seawater as a magnesium source can effectively improve the efficiency of map crystallization and reduce the economic cost a certain amount of seawater is inevitably mixed in the ship domestic sewage due to the seawater flushing toilet which makes it possible to recover n p and mg in the form of map using an aerated induced crystallization reactor 1 h n p o 4 n 3 m g 2 n h 4 6 h 2 o m g n h 4 p o 4 6 h 2 o n h n 1 2 2 3 p o 4 3 5 c a 2 o h c a 5 p o 4 3 o h in view of the characteristics of the ship domestic sewage and relevant environmental factors seawater as flushing water and the space and vibration prevention of sewage treatment facility a novel integrated process for struvite recovery and nutrient removal from ship domestic sewage srnr sds patent application no 201811551628 5 was developed in this study compared with previous ship sewage treatment systems this integrated process which could purify the ship domestic sewage and achieve the synchronous recovery of n p and mg resources is expected to have more advantages in economy and operability to obtain a good overall treatment performance key functional units of the integrated process need to be pre optimized mainly including the salt tolerance acclimation of activated sludge unit and the optimization of map recovery unit afterwards the integrated process was demonstrated and stably operated for 120 days under different hydraulic retention times hrt moreover the pollutant removal mechanism of the integrated process was explored and a technical and economic evaluation was conducted in order to provide theoretical and technical support for the development and application of ship sewage treatment process with the functions of pollutant removal and resource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus srnr sds process includes a struvite ic reaction column map ic and an activated sludge system for the removal and recovery of n and p fig 1 the volumes of anaerobic baffled reactor struvite crystal column and membrane bioreactor mbr tank were 15 5 and 15 l respectively the map ic

built in membrane module of the mbr was purchased from jiangsu shanhuan membrane technology co ltd jiangsu china the inner diameter of the hollow fiber membrane was 1 0 mm and the outer diameter was 2 2 mm the length and height of the membrane module were 33 cm and 20 cm respectively and the pore diameter of membrane was 0 08 μm an aeration plate was set at the bottom of the membrane tank and the air flow was controlled using a gas flowmeter 2 2 salt tolerant acclimation experiment the activated sludge system consisted of an anaerobic reactor section a and an aerobic mbr section o system 1 in fig 1 to obtain a salt tolerant activated sludge system suitable for the treatment of ship domestic sewage with high salinity the salt content in the process was increased by adding additional nacl in the acclimation period of activated sludge system the initial salt content of wastewater used in this experiment was 1 85 0 11 g l which was gradually increased to 1 85 2 85 3 85 4 85 5 85 6 85 and 7 85 g l each salinity gradient lasted for 30 d and the effluent concentrations of the primary pollutants and activated sludge characteristics were systematically investigated the inoculated sludge was obtained from the return sludge of secondary sedimentation tank of zhenjiang dantu sewage treatment plant a2o process and the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss content was approximately 6000 mg l in this experiment the simulated ship domestic sewage mainly included ch3coona kh2po4 nh4 2so4 cacl2 mgso4 7h2o and nutrient solution table s1 lists the detailed influent compositions 2 3 map ic experiment the map ic unit was investigated from two aspects the induced crystal seed and crystallization reactor system 2 in fig 1 the n and p removal capacities of the reactor were improved by modifying the natural zeolite and optimizing the operating conditions of the reactor the influent of map ic unit was the supernatant of the anaerobic sedimentation tank table s2 shows water quality parameters natural zeolite and modified zeolite were used as induced crystal seeds to investigate the removal efficiency of n and p in map ic unit text s1 s2 shows the specific experimental process the map ic unit with the anaerobic supernatant was continuously aerated for 120 min under different gas flow rates of 100 l h 200 l h 300 l h and 400 l h to investigate the ph changes in the solution 10 70 g l of modified seeds were added to the map ic unit under the optimal gas flow rate and then the optimal dose of seed was obtained based on the n and p removal performance of map ic unit 2 4 coupling experiments the integrated process srnr sds is formed by coupling the acclimated activated sludge system and optimized map ic system 3 in fig 1 the operational stability and pollutant removal mechanism of srnr sds process were explored in this section hrt of 10 15 20 and 25 h were used to explore the performance of srnr sds process and each hrt level was maintained for 30 days the changes in relevant pollutants were tested through a 30 day continuous flow operation with an optimal hrt of 20 h furthermore the pollutant removal capacity of each functional unit in srnr sds process was investigated the changes in the composition of pollutants on the surface of mbr were explored before and after the coupling experiment text s3 finally the technical environmental and economic benefits of srnr sds process were analyzed in this study 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and tp in the influent and effluent of each reactor were analyzed using standard methods sepa 2002 measurements of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi were performed according to the sepa standard methods the ph of the solution was monitored using a ph meter sx 610 sanxin shanghai china the protein pn content in eps extractions was measured according to the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard fr lund et al 1995 the polysaccharide ps content in eps extractions was determined as glucose equivalents using the phenol sulfuric acid method jae et al 2001 the morphology of the crystal

ray diffraction xrd shimadzu co ltd japan the components of membrane fouling were analyzed using fourier infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet380 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 salt tolerant acclimation of activated sludge system performance changes of activated sludge system during the salt tolerant acclimation stage are shown in fig 2 the influent cod concentration was 550 35 mg l and the effluent cod concentration increased from 27 37 8 78 mg l to 35 97 3 60 mg l when the influent salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l this result confirmed that the cod removal performance of activated sludge was inhibited under the salinity of 7 85 g l the nh4 n removal efficiencies were increased from approximately 78 00 to 84 03 with the influent salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 3 85 g l and then the efficiency was decreased to approximately 72 32 under the salinity of 7 85 g l the tn removal efficiencies increased from approximately 66 28 to 72 81 with the influent salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 3 85 g l and then decreased to approximately 67 61 under the salinity of 7 85 g l the tp concentrations of effluent fluctuated with the increase in influent salinity from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l together it appears that the heterotrophic bacteria nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria were all affected by the high salinity to different extents some researchers found that high salinity in wastewater can directly inhibit the infiltration of oxygen into the liquid phase and reduce the activity and metabolism of microorganisms chen et al 2018 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2017 high salinity leads to the inhibition of cell plasma membrane separation and microbial activity hulsen et al 2019 and an increase in cytoplasmic extra osmotic pressure leads to decrease in cell activity reid et al 2006 although being exposed to high levels of salt stress 7 85 g l the system has obtained relatively stable removals for cod 90 nh4 n 70 and tn 70 after long term operation and domestication eps is the primary substance that induces microbial adhesion and maintains the stability of flocs wu et al 2021 the eps of activated sludge is mainly composed of pn and ps substances the eps yield and composition are affected by the influent salinity fang et al 2018 the changes of eps during the acclimation period were shown in table 1 the results showed that pn was the main component of eps under different salinity conditions ps pn was increased from 0 35 0 18a and 0 46 0 16b to 0 85 0 05a and 0 60 0 15b respectively when the salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l indicating that the increase of salinity was conducive to the increase in ps content svi increased from 45 32 3 05a to 60 02 2 95a and from 48 93 3 64b to 66 79 2 48b respectively when the salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l indicating that the sludge sedimentation performance was improved with the increase of salinity campos et al 2002 3 2 performance of map crystallization in ic unit the presence of crystal seeds had a significant influence on the nucleation and growth processes during map crystallization bellier et al 2006 natural zeolites are frequently used to remove ammonia n and p from water because of their adsorption ion exchange and catalytic properties castro et al 2021 lin et al 2011 xu et al 2020 in this section zeolite was used as an induced crystallization seed to explore the n and p removal via map crystallization in ic unit 3 2 1 modification and optimization of induced crystallization seed the n and p removal efficiency using natural zeolite as a crystal seed is shown in fig 3 a the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 were only 14 78 0 91 and 4 83 1 04 respectively fig 3a indicating modification to the seed was required the removal efficiency of nh4 n increased by 12 56 but the removal efficiency of po4 3 remained unchanged after zeolite was modified via roasting 300 c and salt impregnation 1m mgcl2 fig s1a and fig s1b the removal efficiency of nh4 n was increased by 15 78 compared to that of natural clinoptilolite after 400 c modification fig s2 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 were increased by 37 86 and 35 72 respectively compared with that of natural clinoptilolite by the 3m mgcl2 modified zeolite fig s3 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 by the modified zeolite were 60 54 2 61 and 47 51 0 86 respectively fig 3a which were increased by 45 76 and 42 68 respectively compared with that of the natural zeolite 3 2 2 optimization of map ic reactor optimization of the ic reactor was primarily based on regulating the aeration and crystal seed dosage under four aeration rates the ph first increased and then tended to stabilize fig s4 indicating that the aeration could remove co2 from the water body and increase the ph value of anaerobic supernatant shi et al 2012 dai et al 2017 the removal performance of nh4 n and po4 3 was increased with the increase of seed dosage in the ic reactor under the aeration rate of 400 l h fig 3b for instance the po4 3 removal efficiencies increased from 28 26 to 40 26 when the dosage of the crystal seed increased from 10 g l to 60 g l the increase of recovery efficiency for nh4 n and po4 3 was attributed to more active sites for crystal forming ions and heterogeneous crystallization reaction with the increase of seed dosage in the solution shi et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 however the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 were hardly increased when the dosage of crystal seed exceeded 60 g l the surface morphology of seed crystal was considerably different after crystallization fig 3c and d which was covered with a layer of dense amorphous crystalline products fig 3e the modified material had peaks at the characteristic peaks of mgo 42 82 and 62 28 indicating that mgcl2 was successfully converted to mgo on natural clinoptilolite fig 3f there were obvious diffraction peaks at angles of 15 81 20 86 21 45 and 31 93 at 2θ which is consistent with the standard spectrum of struvite pdf 15 0762 indicating that the main component of crystal product was map song et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 3 3 pollutant removal mechanism of coupling srnr sds process 3 3 1 performance of srnr sds under different hrt the integrated process srnr sds is demonstrated by coupling the optimized map ic reactor and the domesticated salt tolerant activated sludge unit the performance of srnr sds under different hrt was investigated systematically in this section hrt is an important parameter in the process operation and has a direct impact on the contact time and mass transfer process between microorganisms and the matrix guerrero et al 2011 the variation in the effluent quality of srnr sds process at different hrt is shown in fig 4 the pollutants removal performance of srnr sds process was gradually enhanced with the increase of hrt the srnr sds process had an ideal performance for pollutant removal under hrt of 20 h and the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and tp were 34 73 12 91 mg l 4 31 3 01 mg l 10 07 0 84 mg l and 0 23 0 12 mg l respectively previous research found that a higher hrt would be conducive to the reproduction of heterotrophic bacteria which was not conducive to the competition between nitrite bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria affecting the removal of nh4 n dai et al 2017 in addition proper extension of hrt would increase the reaction time of map ic unit which was conducive to the formation of struvite crystals on the surface of crystal seeds and effectively reduce the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 p 3 3 2 contribution of different units for pollutants removal performance the pollutants removal performance of each functional unit of srnr sds process under the hrt of 20 h was shown in fig 5 a d for the coupling srnr sds process the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n tn and tp were 93 24 3 15 93 05 5 66 84 21 0 94 and 97 43 1 12 respectively the contributions of different functional units in the srnr sds process were determined in fig 5e h cod removal was mainly achieved in the anaerobic reactor with the average removal efficiency of cod of 79 95 3 54 in contrast the anaerobic reactor only removed limited nh4 n and tn for instance the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn in the effluent of the anaerobic supernatant were 7 32 0 64 and 5 28 0 17 respectively after struvite crystallization the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn were 69 20 2 06 and 67 48 2 57 respectively which were increased to 93 24 2 13 and 84 21 0 94 after aerobic mbr after map ic unit and aerobic mbr unit the effluent concentration of tp was decreased to 0 21 0 12 mg l in summary the anaerobic hydrolysis ammonization of organic nitrogen and anaerobic phosphorus release occurs in the anaerobic tank subsequently nh4 n and po4 3 p form map on the surface of induced crystal seeds in a molar ratio of 1 1 in the map ic unit remaining nh4 n was partially blown off in alkaline and aerated environments jan et al 2019 francesco et al 2021 and partially removed by zeolite seed adsorption lin et al 2011 yasmina et al 2021 in map ic unit finally mbr unit has better pollutant removal efficiency because it has high microbial degradation capacity and membrane separation ability thus greatly improving the effluent quality 3 4 technical and economic evaluation of srnr sds process 3 4 1 comparative analysis of treatment technologies on ship domestic sewage the treatment of ship domestic sewage is mainly adopted and improved based on the municipal sewage treatment because of the characteristics of ship domestic sewage and ship navigation chen et al 2022 at present the treatment methods of ship domestic sewage mainly include physical chemical methods biochemical methods and coupling methods among them coagulation sedimentation as the main functional unit of ship sewage treatment has the poor sedimentation effect caused by the rocking of ship navigation zhang et al 2017 electrochemical and advanced oxidation treatment processes can efficiently remove organic pollutants but there is a problem of high energy consumption chen et al 2021 the activated sludge process and biological process based on biochemical methods also have some problems such as long startup period easily interference by external environment and unstable effluent quality li et al 2014 mbr is considered to be an efficient small footprint and stable effluent sewage treatment process without considering membrane pollution and operating costs which has been widely used in ship domestic sewage treatment bella et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 cai et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the comparative analysis of treatment technologies on ship domestic sewage was summarized in the table 2 in general the above sewage treatment technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages when dealing with domestic sewage from ships these technologies only focus on the pollutants removal and don t consider the resources recovery from sewage according to the characteristics of ship domestic sewage this leads to a lot of waste of resources which does not conform to the concept of sustainable development for future sewage treatment therefore the ship sewage treatment process should possess advantages of high efficiency resisting shock load small footprint bump resistance and resource recovery according to the characteristics of ship domestic sewage and the limitation of ship environment the coupling of sewage treatment and resource recovery is the trend and direction of the development of ship sewage treatment technology in the future mbr as the main functional unit of ship domestic sewage treatment has the most extensive application prospects but the membrane fouling is a problem that needs to be solved chen et al 2022 therefore the mechanism of membrane fouling in mbr before and after process coupling was systematically studied fig s5 s6 table s3 results revealed that the membrane fouling mechanism of mbr in the srnr sds process is mainly due to the increase in salting out microcrystalline and extracellular polymers aggravated the membrane surface pollution therefore it is necessary to solve the membrane fouling problem of srnr sds process in the future application 3 4 2 environmental impact and economic analysis ship domestic sewage mainly composed of black water and gray water which has a higher cod tn tp total suspended solids and salinity compared with conventional municipal sewage cai et al 2022 chen et al 2022 once untreated and substandard domestic sewage from ships is discharged into the marine and inland water environment it will cause serious water pollution and environmental damage among them eutrophication is a serious pollution phenomenon occurred in the water bodies with poor mobility such as coastal areas docks and lakes chen et al 2022 the domestic sewage from ships also contains a large number of viruses bacteria and pathogens due to the existence of black water sharma et al 2015 in addition the discharge of micro plastics antibiotics preservatives and personal care products in the ship domestic sewage will also affect the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms destroy the ecological balance and ultimately endanger human health through the biological chain sharma et al 2017 in sum untreated or substandard domestic sewage from ships has a very serious impact on the environment it has important environmental and social benefits to develop an efficient process for ship sewage treatment the developed ship domestic treatment process srnr sds process according to sewage characteristics and ship navigation environment can realize the pollutants removal and map recovery in srnr sds process the mbr unit can save floor space ensure effluent quality and realize the reuse of reclaimed water and the products recovered from the map ic unit can be sold as agricultural slow release fertilizer zhang et al 2019 shaddel et al 2020a 2020b therefore the srnr sds process has important environmental and economic benefits it can be seen from fig 5 that about 0 27 mm of n and p per liter of sewage was recovered in the form of map in srnr sds process the molar ratio of n p and mg for map formation is 1 1 1 and the molecular formula of map is mg nh4 po4 6h2o ravi et al 2022 the quantity of map recovered from each liter of sewage is about 0 067 g by theoretical calculation the international market price of map fertilizer is estimated as 200 1 885 ton based on historical data barr and münch 2001 doyle and parsons 2002 achilleos et al 2022 so the income of recovered map from ship domestic sewage is 0 013 0 12 m3 it was estimated that the discharge volume of domestic sewage from ships in china was 18 000 000 m3 year ministry of environmental protection of china 2018 zhang et al 2020 and an annual income of map recovered from ship domestic sewage was 234 000 2 160 000 year in china the operation energy consumption of the developed srnr sds process without considering resource recovery was about 0 21 m3 so it could save about 6 20 57 14 of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via map recovery 4 conclusion a novel integrated process of struvite recovery and nutrient removal from ship domestic sewage was systematically investigated in this study from the initial salt tolerant acclimation of activated sludge unit and the optimization of map ic unit to the demonstration of the integrated process and its technical and economic analysis a clear pipeline about how to obtain suitable functional unit and operate the integrated system to achieve efficient pollutants removal and nutrient recovery was demonstrated after salt tolerant acclimation the cod nh4 n tn and tp concentrations in the effluent of activated sludge system were approximately 59 40 mg l 18 64 mg l 21 82 mg l and 4 77 mg l respectively under the influent salinity of 7 85 g l the sedimentation performance of activated sludge was improved with the increase of salinity furthermore the nh4 n and po4 3 removal efficiencies were significantly improved in map ic reactor under the conditions of 60 g l modified zeolite and 400 l h pre aeration the srnr sds process had the ideal performance for pollutant removal and map recovery at the hrt 20 h the introduction of map ic could improve the pollutant removal efficiency of srnr sds process the developed process has obvious environmental social and economic benefits which can save 6 20 57 14 of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via map recovery overall the srnr sds process has great potential for sewage treatment and resource recovery

15280,marine pollution caused by the untreated and substandard discharge of ship domestic sewage has received widespread attention a novel integrated process for struvite recovery and nutrient removal from ship domestic sewage srnr sds based on seawater magnesium source was developed in this study removal efficiencies of the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp for the activated sludge unit in srnr sds process were approximately 67 61 and 41 35 respectively under the salinity of 7 85 g l the coupling induced struvite crystallization unit significantly improved the removal efficiency of tn and tp and the scanning electron microscopy and x ray diffraction demonstrated that magnesium ammonium phosphate map crystals were successfully formed on the surface of zeolite the srnr sds process had an ideal performance for pollutant removal and map recovery under the optimal hydraulic retention time of 20 h the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and tp in srnr sds process were approximately 34 73 mg l 4 31 mg l 10 07 mg l and 0 23 mg l respectively which meet the chinese and international ship sewage discharge standards srnr sds process has obvious environmental social and economic benefits which could save 6 20 57 14 of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via map recovery the results could provide theoretical and technical support for the development and application of ship sewage treatment process with the functions of pollutant removal and resource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ship domestic sewage struvite recovery induced crystallization seawater magnesium source nitrogen and phosphorus removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the significant development of maritime transportation has promoted the rapid progress of the global economy but the marine pollution caused by the increase in the number of ships has received widespread concern cai et al 2020 owing to the fluidity and spatial characteristics of the ship itself the domestic sewage from ships is directly discharged into the marine and inland river environments which will lead to water eutrophication and substantially affect the dissolved oxygen do content in the water and marine organisms chen et al 2022 kress et al 2016 in recent years the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships and the legislation of countries and regions worldwide have been developed to control the impact of ship sewage on the water environment chen et al 2022 however environmental pollution caused by domestic sewage from ships remains a significant problem that requires urgent attention the salinity chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen n phosphorus p and total suspended solids of ship domestic sewage are higher than those of municipal sewage owing to the special conditions and water saving measures on board kersh et al 2020 vaneeckhaute et al 2020 the characteristics of sewage on ships undoubtedly aggravate the difficulty of sewage treatment meanwhile the limited ship space and the inevitable vibration and shake during ship navigation also pose troubles for the effective treatment of ship domestic sewage at present the main functional unit for the treatment of ship domestic sewage is the activated sludge system p removal is achieved by polyphosphate organisms pao in wastewater treatment specifically pao can absorb a large amount of phosphate under aerobic conditions synthesize polyphosphate in cells and then remove p by discharging phosphorus rich sludge sumathi et al 2018 biological n removal includes nitrification performed by nitrifiers and denitrification by denitrifiers zhang et al 2021 generally nitrification and denitrification processes occur in aerobic and anoxic conditions of activated sludge system respectively li et al 2015 salinity markedly affects microbial activity in biological wastewater treatment processes dang et al 2022 fu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 previous studies found that the ship domestic sewage has approximately 0 9 salinity owing to the mixing of seawater e g using seawater for toilet flushing jiang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 however most nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria and paos originate from freshwater environments and are sensitive to the sewage with high salinity xu et al 2022 therefore the treatment of domestic sewage from ships using activated sludge system faces considerable difficulties the domestic sewage from ships is rich in n and p resources and the recovery of n and p from ship domestic sewage has obvious economic and environmental benefits the crystallization method is one of the most effective approaches for recovering n and p from wastewater saerens et al 2021 at present the struvite map crystallization and hydroxyl calcium phosphate hap crystallization eqs 1 and 2 are the main methods for nutrients recovery dai et al 2016 le et al 2021 ma et al 2020 compared with hap map can simultaneously recover n and p and the recovered product is used as an excellent slow release fertilizer zhang et al 2019 shaddel et al 2020a 2020b currently n and p recovered in the form of struvite mainly come from digested sludge supernatant lahav et al 2013 saerens et al 2021 human and animal excretion liao et al 2020 krishnamoorthy et al 2021 and sewage sludge ash li et al 2021 ravi et al 2022 however the research on recovering n and p from ship domestic sewage in the form of map has rarely been conducted previous studies found that the formation of map needs to be at alkaline ph optimal ph is 8 5 9 5 and the crystallization efficiency of map can also be significantly improved via seeds induced crystallization ic corre et al 2009 mehta et al 2013 li et al 2019 the method of aerated induced crystallization can improve the ph value of the reaction system and ensure the complete mixing of the reactor and save chemical reagents dai et al 2016 simultaneously the seawater is rich in low cost mg2 1530 mg l 63 75 mmol nur et al 2018 using seawater as a magnesium source can effectively improve the efficiency of map crystallization and reduce the economic cost a certain amount of seawater is inevitably mixed in the ship domestic sewage due to the seawater flushing toilet which makes it possible to recover n p and

characteristics of the ship domestic sewage and relevant environmental factors seawater as flushing water and the space and vibration prevention of sewage treatment facility a novel integrated process for struvite recovery and nutrient removal from ship domestic sewage srnr sds patent application no 201811551628 5 was developed in this study compared with previous ship sewage treatment systems this integrated process which could purify the ship domestic sewage and achieve the synchronous recovery of n p and mg resources is expected to have more advantages in economy and operability to obtain a good overall treatment performance key functional units of the integrated process need to be pre optimized mainly including the salt tolerance acclimation of activated sludge unit and the optimization of map recovery unit afterwards the integrated process was demonstrated and stably operated for 120 days under different hydraulic retention times hrt moreover the pollutant removal mechanism of the integrated process was explored and a technical and economic evaluation was conducted in order to provide theoretical and technical support for the development and application of ship sewage treatment process with the functions of pollutant removal and resource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus srnr sds process includes a struvite ic reaction column map ic and an activated

built in membrane module of the mbr was purchased from jiangsu shanhuan membrane technology co ltd jiangsu china the inner diameter of the hollow fiber membrane was 1 0 mm and the outer diameter was 2 2 mm the length and height of the membrane module were 33 cm and 20 cm respectively and the pore diameter of membrane was 0 08 μm an aeration plate was set at the bottom of the membrane tank and the air flow was controlled using a gas flowmeter 2 2 salt tolerant acclimation experiment the activated sludge system consisted of an anaerobic reactor section a and an aerobic mbr section o system 1 in fig 1 to obtain a salt tolerant activated sludge system suitable for the treatment of ship domestic sewage with high salinity the salt content in the process was increased by adding additional nacl in the acclimation period of activated sludge system the initial salt content of wastewater used in this experiment was 1 85 0 11 g l which was gradually increased to 1 85 2 85 3 85 4 85 5 85 6 85 and 7 85 g l each salinity gradient lasted for 30 d and the effluent concentrations of the primary pollutants and activated sludge characteristics were systematically investigated the inoculated sludge was obtained from the return sludge of secondary sedimentation tank of zhenjiang dantu sewage treatment plant a2o process and the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss content was approximately 6000 mg l in this experiment the simulated ship domestic sewage mainly included ch3coona kh2po4 nh4 2so4 cacl2 mgso4 7h2o and nutrient solution table s1 lists the detailed influent compositions 2 3 map ic experiment the map ic unit was investigated from two aspects the induced crystal seed and crystallization reactor system 2 in fig 1 the n and p removal capacities of the reactor were improved by modifying the natural zeolite and optimizing the operating conditions of the reactor the influent of map ic unit was the supernatant of the anaerobic sedimentation tank table s2 shows water quality parameters natural zeolite and modified zeolite were used as induced crystal seeds to investigate the removal efficiency of n and p in map ic unit text s1 s2 shows the specific experimental process the map ic unit with the anaerobic supernatant was continuously aerated for 120 min under different gas flow rates of 100 l h 200 l h 300 l h and 400 l h to investigate the ph changes in the solution 10 70 g l of modified seeds were added to the map ic unit under the optimal gas flow rate and then the optimal dose of seed was obtained based on the n and p removal performance of map ic unit 2 4 coupling experiments the integrated process srnr sds is formed by coupling the acclimated activated sludge system and optimized map ic system 3 in fig 1 the operational stability and pollutant removal mechanism of srnr sds process were explored in this section hrt of 10 15 20 and 25 h were used to explore the performance of srnr sds process and each hrt level was maintained for 30 days the changes in relevant pollutants were tested through a 30 day continuous flow operation with an optimal hrt of 20 h furthermore the pollutant removal capacity of each functional unit in srnr sds process was investigated the changes in the composition of pollutants on the surface of mbr were explored before and after the coupling experiment text s3 finally the technical environmental and economic benefits of srnr sds process were analyzed in this study 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and tp in the influent and effluent of each reactor were analyzed using standard methods sepa 2002 measurements of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi were performed according to the sepa standard methods the ph of the solution was monitored using a ph meter sx 610 sanxin shanghai china the protein pn content in eps extractions was measured according to the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard fr lund et al 1995 the polysaccharide ps content in eps extractions was determined as glucose equivalents using the phenol sulfuric acid method jae et al 2001 the morphology of the crystal

ray diffraction xrd shimadzu co ltd japan the components of membrane fouling were analyzed using fourier infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet380 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 salt tolerant acclimation of activated sludge system performance changes of activated sludge system during the salt tolerant acclimation stage are shown in fig 2 the influent cod concentration was 550 35 mg l and the effluent cod concentration increased from 27 37 8 78 mg l to 35 97 3 60 mg l when the influent salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l this result confirmed that the cod removal performance of activated sludge was inhibited under the salinity of 7 85 g l the nh4 n removal efficiencies were increased from approximately 78 00 to 84 03 with the influent salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 3 85 g l and then the efficiency was decreased to approximately 72 32 under the salinity of 7 85 g l the tn removal efficiencies increased from approximately 66 28 to 72 81 with the influent salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 3 85 g l and then decreased to approximately 67 61 under the salinity of 7 85 g l the tp concentrations of effluent fluctuated with the increase in influent salinity from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l together it appears that the heterotrophic bacteria nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria were all affected by the high salinity to different extents some researchers found that high salinity in wastewater can directly inhibit the infiltration of oxygen into the liquid phase and reduce the activity and metabolism of microorganisms chen et al 2018 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2017 high salinity leads to the inhibition of cell plasma membrane separation and microbial activity hulsen et al 2019 and an increase in cytoplasmic extra osmotic pressure leads to decrease in cell activity reid et al 2006 although being exposed to high levels of salt stress 7 85 g l the system has obtained relatively stable removals for cod 90 nh4 n 70 and tn 70 after long term operation and domestication eps is the primary substance that induces microbial adhesion and maintains the stability of flocs wu et al 2021 the eps of activated sludge is mainly composed of pn and ps substances the eps yield and composition are affected by the influent salinity fang et al 2018 the changes of eps during the acclimation period were shown in table 1 the results showed that pn was the main component of eps under different salinity conditions ps pn was increased from 0 35 0 18a and 0 46 0 16b to 0 85 0 05a and 0 60 0 15b respectively when the salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l indicating that the increase of salinity was conducive to the increase in ps content svi increased from 45 32 3 05a to 60 02 2 95a and from 48 93 3 64b to 66 79 2 48b respectively when the salinity increased from 1 85 g l to 7 85 g l indicating that the sludge sedimentation performance was improved with the increase of salinity campos et al 2002 3 2 performance of map crystallization in ic unit the presence of crystal seeds had a significant influence on the nucleation and growth processes during map crystallization bellier et al 2006 natural zeolites are frequently used to remove ammonia n and p from water because of their adsorption ion exchange and catalytic properties castro et al 2021 lin et al 2011 xu et al 2020 in this section zeolite was used as an induced crystallization seed to explore the n and p removal via map crystallization in ic unit 3 2 1 modification and optimization of induced crystallization seed the n and p removal efficiency using natural zeolite as a crystal seed is shown in fig 3 a the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 were only 14 78 0 91 and 4 83 1 04 respectively fig 3a indicating modification to the seed was required the removal efficiency of nh4 n increased by 12 56 but the removal efficiency of po4 3 remained unchanged after zeolite was modified via roasting 300 c and salt impregnation 1m mgcl2 fig s1a and fig s1b the removal efficiency of nh4 n was increased by 15 78 compared to that of natural clinoptilolite after 400 c modification fig s2 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 were increased by 37 86 and 35 72 respectively compared with that of natural clinoptilolite by the 3m mgcl2 modified zeolite fig s3 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 by the modified zeolite were 60 54 2 61 and 47 51 0 86 respectively fig 3a which were increased by 45 76 and 42 68 respectively compared with that of the natural zeolite 3 2 2 optimization of map ic reactor optimization of the ic reactor was primarily based on regulating the aeration and crystal seed dosage under four aeration rates the ph first increased and then tended to stabilize fig s4 indicating that the aeration could remove co2 from the water body and increase the ph value of anaerobic supernatant shi et al 2012 dai et al 2017 the removal performance of nh4 n and po4 3 was increased with the increase of seed dosage in the ic reactor under the aeration rate of 400 l h fig 3b for instance the po4 3 removal efficiencies increased from 28 26 to 40 26 when the dosage of the crystal seed increased from 10 g l to 60 g l the increase of recovery efficiency for nh4 n and po4 3 was attributed to more active sites for crystal forming ions and heterogeneous crystallization reaction with the increase of seed dosage in the solution shi et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 however the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 were hardly increased when the dosage of crystal seed exceeded 60 g l the surface morphology of seed crystal was considerably different after crystallization fig 3c and d which was covered with a layer of dense amorphous crystalline products fig 3e the modified material had peaks at the characteristic peaks of mgo 42 82 and 62 28 indicating that mgcl2 was successfully converted to mgo on natural clinoptilolite fig 3f there were obvious diffraction peaks at angles of 15 81 20 86 21 45 and 31 93 at 2θ which is consistent with the standard spectrum of struvite pdf 15 0762 indicating that the main component of crystal product was map song et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 3 3 pollutant removal mechanism of coupling srnr sds process 3 3 1 performance of srnr sds under different hrt the integrated process srnr sds is demonstrated by coupling the optimized map ic reactor and the domesticated salt tolerant activated sludge unit the performance of srnr sds under different hrt was investigated systematically in this section hrt is an important parameter in the process operation and has a direct impact on the contact time and mass transfer process between microorganisms and the matrix guerrero et al 2011 the variation in the effluent quality of srnr sds process at different hrt is shown in fig 4 the pollutants removal performance of srnr sds process was gradually enhanced with the increase of hrt the srnr sds process had an ideal performance for pollutant removal under hrt of 20 h and the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and tp were 34 73 12 91 mg l 4 31 3 01 mg l 10 07 0 84 mg l and 0 23 0 12 mg l respectively previous research found that a higher hrt would be conducive to the reproduction of heterotrophic bacteria which was not conducive to the competition between nitrite bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria affecting the removal of nh4 n dai et al 2017 in addition proper extension of hrt would increase the reaction time of map ic unit which was conducive to the formation of struvite crystals on the surface of crystal seeds and effectively reduce the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 p 3 3 2 contribution of different units for pollutants removal performance the pollutants removal performance of each functional unit of srnr sds process under the hrt of 20 h was shown in fig 5 a d for the coupling srnr sds process the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n tn and tp were 93 24 3 15 93 05 5 66 84 21 0 94 and 97 43 1 12 respectively the contributions of different functional units in the srnr sds process were determined in fig 5e h cod removal was mainly achieved in the anaerobic reactor with the average removal efficiency of cod of 79 95 3 54 in contrast the anaerobic reactor only removed limited nh4 n and tn for instance the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn in the effluent of the anaerobic supernatant were 7 32 0 64 and 5 28 0 17 respectively after struvite crystallization the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn were 69 20 2 06 and 67 48 2 57 respectively which were increased to 93 24 2 13 and 84 21 0 94 after aerobic mbr after map ic unit and aerobic mbr unit the effluent concentration of tp was decreased to 0 21 0 12 mg l in summary the anaerobic hydrolysis ammonization of organic nitrogen and anaerobic phosphorus release occurs in the anaerobic tank subsequently nh4 n and po4 3 p form map on the surface of induced crystal seeds in a molar ratio of 1 1 in the map ic unit remaining nh4 n was partially blown off in alkaline and aerated environments jan et al 2019 francesco et al 2021 and partially removed by zeolite seed adsorption lin et al 2011 yasmina et al 2021 in map ic unit finally mbr unit has better pollutant removal efficiency because it has high microbial degradation capacity and membrane separation ability thus greatly improving the effluent quality 3 4 technical and economic evaluation of srnr sds process 3 4 1 comparative analysis of treatment technologies on ship domestic sewage the treatment of ship domestic sewage is mainly adopted and improved based on the municipal sewage treatment because of the characteristics of ship domestic sewage and ship navigation chen et al 2022 at present the treatment methods of ship domestic sewage mainly include physical chemical methods biochemical methods and coupling methods among them coagulation sedimentation as the main functional unit of ship sewage treatment has the poor sedimentation effect caused by the rocking of ship navigation zhang et al 2017 electrochemical and advanced oxidation treatment processes can efficiently remove organic pollutants but there is a problem of high energy consumption chen et al 2021 the activated sludge process and biological process based on biochemical methods also have some problems such as long startup period easily interference by external environment and unstable effluent quality li et al 2014 mbr is considered to be an efficient small footprint and stable effluent sewage treatment process without considering membrane pollution and operating costs which has been widely used in ship domestic sewage treatment bella et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 cai et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the comparative analysis of treatment technologies on ship domestic sewage was summarized in the table 2 in general the above sewage treatment technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages when dealing with domestic sewage from ships these technologies only focus on the pollutants removal and don t consider the resources recovery from sewage according to the characteristics of ship domestic sewage this leads to a lot of waste of resources which does not conform to the concept of sustainable development for future sewage treatment therefore the ship sewage treatment process should possess advantages of high efficiency resisting shock load small footprint bump resistance and resource recovery according to the characteristics of ship domestic sewage and the limitation of ship environment the coupling of sewage treatment and resource recovery is the trend and direction of the development of ship sewage treatment technology in the future mbr as the main functional unit of ship domestic sewage treatment has the most extensive application prospects but the membrane fouling is a problem that needs to be solved chen et al 2022 therefore the mechanism of membrane fouling in mbr before and after process coupling was systematically studied fig s5 s6 table s3 results revealed that the membrane fouling mechanism of mbr in the srnr sds process is mainly due to the increase in salting out microcrystalline and extracellular polymers aggravated the membrane surface pollution therefore it is necessary to solve the membrane fouling problem of srnr sds process in the future application 3 4 2 environmental impact and economic analysis ship domestic sewage mainly composed of black water and gray water which has a higher cod tn tp total suspended solids and salinity compared with conventional municipal sewage cai et al 2022 chen et al 2022 once untreated and substandard domestic sewage from ships is discharged into the marine and inland water environment it will cause serious water pollution and environmental damage among them eutrophication is a serious pollution phenomenon occurred in the water bodies with poor mobility such as coastal areas docks and lakes chen et al 2022 the domestic sewage from ships also contains a large number of viruses bacteria and pathogens due to the existence of black water sharma et al 2015 in addition the discharge of micro plastics antibiotics preservatives and personal care products in the ship domestic sewage will also affect the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms destroy the ecological balance and ultimately endanger human health through the biological chain sharma et al 2017 in sum untreated or substandard domestic sewage from ships has a very serious impact on the environment it has important environmental and social benefits to develop an efficient process for ship sewage treatment the developed ship domestic treatment process srnr sds process according to sewage characteristics and ship navigation environment can realize the pollutants removal and map recovery in srnr sds process the mbr unit can save floor space ensure effluent quality and realize the reuse of reclaimed water and the products recovered from the map ic unit can be sold as agricultural slow release fertilizer zhang et al 2019 shaddel et al 2020a 2020b therefore the srnr sds process has important environmental and economic benefits it can be seen from fig 5 that about 0 27 mm of n and p per liter of sewage was recovered in the form of map in srnr sds process the molar ratio of n p and mg for map formation is 1 1 1 and the molecular formula of map is mg nh4 po4 6h2o ravi et al 2022 the quantity of map recovered from each liter of sewage is about 0 067 g by theoretical calculation the international market price of map fertilizer is estimated as 200 1 885 ton based on historical data barr and münch 2001 doyle and parsons 2002 achilleos et al 2022 so the income of recovered map from ship domestic sewage is 0 013 0 12 m3 it was estimated that the discharge volume of domestic sewage from ships in china was 18 000 000 m3 year ministry of environmental protection of china 2018 zhang et al 2020 and an annual income of map recovered from ship domestic sewage was 234 000 2 160 000 year in china the operation energy consumption of the developed srnr sds process without considering resource recovery was about 0 21 m3 so it could save about 6 20 57 14 of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via map recovery 4 conclusion a novel integrated process of struvite recovery and nutrient removal from ship domestic sewage was systematically investigated in this study from the initial salt tolerant acclimation of activated sludge unit and the optimization of map ic unit to the demonstration of the integrated process and its technical and economic analysis a clear pipeline about how to obtain suitable functional unit and operate the integrated system to achieve efficient pollutants removal and nutrient recovery was demonstrated after salt tolerant acclimation the cod nh4 n tn and tp concentrations in the effluent of activated sludge system were approximately 59 40 mg l 18 64 mg l 21 82 mg l and 4 77 mg l respectively under the influent salinity of 7 85 g l the sedimentation performance of activated sludge was improved with the increase of salinity furthermore the nh4 n and po4 3 removal efficiencies were significantly improved in map ic reactor under the conditions of 60 g l modified zeolite and 400 l h pre aeration the srnr sds process had the ideal performance for pollutant removal and map recovery at the hrt 20 h the introduction of map ic could improve the pollutant removal efficiency of srnr sds process the developed process has obvious environmental social and economic benefits which can save 6 20 57 14 of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via map recovery overall the srnr sds process has great potential for sewage treatment and resource recovery

biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc constitutes the most labile fraction of dissolved organic matter dom which also functions as a source of co2 emissions from inland waters however no systematic review is available on dom indicators of bdoc and co2 production potential optical and molecular indices can be used to track small changes in dom composition during biodegradation in this review we identified four different methods for measuring bdoc together with their strengths and limitations in addition we discuss the potential of using documented optical indices based on absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular indices based on fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry as proxies for estimating bdoc and biodegradation induced co2 production based on previously reported relationships in the literature many absorbance and fluorescence based indices showed inconsistent relationships with bdoc depending on watershed characteristics hydrology and anthropogenic impacts nevertheless several indices including specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 humification index hix and terrestrial humic like fluorescent dom fdom components tended to have negative relationships with bdoc in tropical and temperate watersheds under baseflow or drought periods protein like fdom exhibited the strongest correlation with bdoc in different systems except during storms and flood events despite the limited number of studies dom molecular indices exhibited consistent relationships with bdoc suggesting that the relative abundance of aliphatic formulas and the molecular lability index could act as reliable proxies the dom optical indices explain up to 96 and 78 variability in bdoc and co2 respectively nonetheless there were limited studies on molecular indices which explain up to 74 variability in bdoc based on literature survey we recommend several sensitive indices such as suva254 hix and terrestrial humic and protein like fdom which could be useful indicators of bdoc and dissolved co2 in inland water future research should incorporate a wider range of geographic regions with various land use hydrology and anthropogenic disturbances to develop system or condition specific dom optical or molecular proxies for better prediction of bdoc and co2 emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter fluorescence ft icr ms biodegradable dissolved organic carbon co2 emissions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in inland water plays an important role in the global carbon c cycle by linking terrestrial and oceanic c pools battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 previous studies have reported 1 9 to 5 1 pg c yr 1 of terrestrial organic matter om exported to rivers globally battin et al 2009 drake et al 2018 regnier et al 2013 ward et al 2017 during its travel to the ocean terrestrial om is transformed in its composition and exchanges with the om pools of floodplain sediment and the atmosphere through various physical chemical and biological processes fig 1 while c burial in the sediment floodplain of inland waters accounts for 0 6 pg c yr 1 the annual c exports through inland waters were estimated at 0 9 pg c yr 1 battin et al 2009 drake et al 2018 regnier et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 however the largest fraction of terrestrial om is lost through gas exchange with the atmosphere in the inland water and the emissions estimates range between 1 2 and 3 9 pg c yr 1 aufdenkampe et al 2011 drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 with co2 emissions accounting for 2 1 pg c yr 1 sawakuchi et al 2017 ward et al 2017 wehrli 2013 the emitted co2 originates from various routes such as biodegradation and or photomineralization of dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc carbonate weathering and oxidation of ch4 begum et al 2019 hao et al 2021 koehler et al 2014 prairie et al 2018 however biodegradation is considered the predominant pathway for co2 production in inland waters bowen et al 2020 burd et al 2016 lapierre et al 2013 in most aquatic ecosystems only a small fraction of bulk dom is available for microbial degradation and co2 production liu and wang 2022 sondergaard and worm 2001 vonk et al 2015 although photomineralization may be a predominant process in cold climates e g arctic lakes and rivers cory et al 2014 only 1 5 of the dom was photomineralized in temperate and tropical lakes and rivers suggesting little co2 emission from photomineralization amon and benner 1996 dempsey et al 2020 koehler et al 2014 maavara et al 2021 dom in inland waters refractory to microbial degradation servais et al 1989 1987 sondergaard and worm 2001 can become bioavailable after partial photooxidation thus enhancing the net biodegradability bowen et al 2020 other large scale studies have reported that photodegradation accounts for up to 10 of co2 emissions globally and that biodegradation remains the major pathway for co2 emissions in inland waters with photomineralization equivalent to 10 of biodegradation allesson et al 2021 koehler et al 2014 maavara et al 2021 ward et al 2014 biodegradable doc bdoc is operationally defined as the proportion of doc loss relative to the initial doc concentration within a certain period e g days or weeks owing to microbial degradation or assimilation fellman et al 2008 servais et al 1987 wickland et al 2012 previous studies on bdoc have used several terms to distinguish between labile degrade rapidly within 3 7 days and semi labile 7 40 days or more pools from the refractory portion of dom according to the duration of bdoc measurements liu and wang 2022 furthermore the experimental conditions for bdoc measurement can create further diversification in terms of amendment of nutrients microbial community or inoculum from in situ or laboratory supplied oxygen during the experiment and availability of light vonk et al 2015 conducted a meta analysis of the major factors that might affect the measurement of bdoc in high latitude arctic watersheds and most of the investigated factors affected bdoc concentrations in common aquatic environments soil environments and other dom sources worldwide begum et al 2019 servais et al 1987 wickland et al 2012 thus the concentration of bdoc appears to be highly variable for different systems watersheds worldwide a global meta analysis of bdoc data showed high values in sewage effluent 45 lowland wetland 31 and urban runoff 17 and low values in peatland draining river 4 forested river 10 and agricultural river 19 stutter et al 2018 the global average bdoc was reported to be 14 16 of the bulk doc for lakes sondergaard and worm 2001 stutter et al 2018 and 16 18 for rivers liu and wang 2022 stutter et al 2018 bdoc is closely associated with the dom source and composition in the aquatic environment and it serves as a critical factor for determining the fate of dom through microbial transformation of dom and release of co2 and other greenhouse gasses fig 1 therefore information regarding the source composition and transformation of dom is necessary for a better understanding of dom biodegradability and or co2 production in inland water many studies have used spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence and ultraviolet spectrophotometry to explore dom sources and their composition fellman et al 2010 li and hur 2017 for example the rapid depletion of highly biodegradable protein like fluorescent dom fdom components followed by the accumulation of recalcitrant terrestrial humic like fdom is commonly observed in dom optical responses to biodegradation in previous studies begum et al 2019 kim et al 2019 park et al 2021 other commonly used optical indices for linking dom with biodegradability include microbial humic like fluorescent dom fdom components fluorescence index fi specific ultraviolet absorbance spectral slopes and slope ratios advanced analyses such as ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry are also popular for revealing dom sources composition and transformation at high resolution begum et al 2022 d andrilli et al 2015 ohno et al 2014 shi et al 2021 textor et al 2019 notably several recent studies employed spectroscopic and high resolution spectrometric techniques to understand changes in intrinsic composition of dom during biodegradation begum et al 2019 o donnell et al 2016 rogers et al 2021 spencer et al 2015 textor et al 2018 2019 estimating bdoc using the intrinsic properties of dom as proxies can be an alternative method to quantify co2 emissions in natural systems where the direct measurement of greenhouse gasses is not feasible and or not available however despite previous successful examples of tracking dom biodegradation using dom optical molecular indices no systematic review combining optical and molecular surrogates of dom for bdoc or resulting co2 production is available in this review we synthesized optical and molecular properties of dom presenting distinct relationships with bdoc and co2 production potential in inland waters to suggest and discuss the proper dom optical molecular proxies the main objectives of this review were to 1 explore the optical and molecular properties of dom associated with bdoc 2 compare the relationships of dom optical properties with dissolved co2 and 3 provide recommendations and future research directions for utilizing available dom data e g optical and molecular indices to predict bdoc and co2 production to our knowledge this is the first review to compile existing knowledge concerning the association of dom composition with biodegradability and co2 production in inland waters 2 biodegradable dissolved organic carbon measurement 2 1 common measurement methods over the past few decades various methods have been employed to quantify the biodegradable fraction of dom direct methods that measure bdoc as doc loss o2 loss and co2 production as a result of microbial degradation and assimilation are preferred compared to indirect measurement methods based on biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod table 1 indirect methods were used before the introduction of direct measurement of bdoc for example bod or the ratio between bod and cod was adopted as a simple proxy for bdoc chen et al 2014 khan et al 2005 samudro and mangkoedihardjo 2010 however bod is obsolete to measure dom biodegradability owing to its low accuracy precision and sensitivity compared to direct measurements khan et al 2005 samudro and mangkoedihardjo 2010 bod and cod are measured based on the oxygen consumption driven by the biological or chemical breakdown of dom whereas bdoc measurements are based on the consumption or degradation of doc the first direct method for measuring bdoc which is the most widely used method to date is based on the doc loss from microbial degradation respiration and is measured in absolute c concentration mg l 1 or relative to the initial doc servais et al 1989 developed a bdoc measurement method using raw samples as an inoculum from a natural environment previously a single strain of laboratory bacterial culture was used as the inoculum in bdoc incubation however the laboratory culture could not degrade dom as efficiently as microbial assemblage from natural environments servais et al 1989 van der kooij et al 1982 most bdoc experiments mimicking the natural environment require at least a few days to measure labile doc whereas measuring semi labile doc can take up to a few months to a year mcdowell et al 2006 vonk et al 2015 the second most common method for bdoc measurement is based on doc loss from a sample passing through a bioreactor with available microbes nutrients and oxygen sondergaard and worm 2001 in this method the measurement can be completed in a few hours which is very useful in exploring spatiotemporal variations in bdoc for large systems or long term monitoring sondergaard and worm 2001 terry and summers 2018 the third method involves the measurement of bdoc from the production of co2 or the change in dic concentration in the sample assuming that all the degraded c is converted to co2 wickland et al 2012 measurement of bdoc using co2 or dic is suitable for the long term monitoring of biodegradation because repeated sampling of headspace gas is feasible within a minimum number of incubation bottles or containers because such long term time series data are easily attainable this approach can be useful for measuring the labile and refractory fractions of dom however there are two major drawbacks in this method which are associated with 1 maintaining a leakproof incubation vial chamber and 2 facilitating necessary o2 for biodegradation the fourth common method is relatively less popular for bdoc measurement which uses o2 loss from microbial respiration and converts it into co2 production and bdoc using stoichiometry cory et al 2013 this approach is often used in ecosystem metabolism studies but it also has the potential to be used for bdoc measurements the first method using doc loss appears to be preferable for bdoc measurements table 1 this is because the third and fourth methods using dic production and o2 loss cannot account for doc loss caused by microbial assimilation i e c accumulated in biomass whereas the second method cannot facilitate realistic conditions nutrients dissolved o2 microbes etc which may cause inaccuracy in bdoc measurement liu and wang 2022 2 2 factors influencing bdoc measurements several methodological and environmental factors can affect bdoc measurements among methodological factors inoculum type and volume temperature incubation duration filter pore size nutrient amendment oxygen availability light availability bottle size and shaking affect bdoc measurements significantly liu and wang 2022 vonk et al 2015 temperature and dissolved oxygen are the two most critical factors for bdoc because they are directly associated with microbial activity and respiration rates mcdowell et al 2006 wickland et al 2012 samples for bdoc measurement are usually filtered through 0 2 µm filters to remove most of the particulates and phytoplankton subsequently a microbial inoculum 1 10 of the total volume is added to facilitate biodegradation vonk et al 2015 however other studies have reported biodegradability measurements using unfiltered samples to mimic a field condition incubation under intermittent light exposure conditions has been employed in some studies to facilitate realistic conditions for determining dom lability in natural environments cory et al 2013 however light exposure may stimulate photo biodegradation therefore the experimental setting for bdoc measurement requires careful evaluation to minimize the potential inaccuracy caused by photodegradation and photosynthesis bottle volume shaking and dissolved oxygen may also have substantial effects on bdoc however comparative studies on these factors are rare vonk et al 2015 ward et al 2018 2 3 best practice guidelines for bdoc measurements bdoc measurement through doc loss is the most commonly used and recommended method samples need to be filtered through a 0 2 µm filter followed by addition of an inoculum preferably from raw sample filtered through a 2 µm filter servais et al 1989 to ensure data quality control with no inoculum together with the samples are incubated in replicates and the mean values are presented with standard deviation a large deviation among the replicates implies contamination or mismanagement of samples during the experiment to ensure constant temperature and complete darkness a clean incubator or oven with sensors is recommended to monitor temperature and light intensity throughout the incubation period vonk et al 2015 to facilitate dissolved oxygen for bdoc measurement using the doc loss method air permeable glass fiber plug or septa with a needle inserted can be used and shaking incubators are preferred for sufficient mixing however for bdoc measurement based on co2 production or o2 loss septa with aluminum crimps are used to maintain a leakproof condition begum et al 2019 wickland et al 2012 the incubation duration is set based on the source of dom and purpose of measuring bdoc which can be approximately 28 days for lakes and large rivers and 7 days for small streams stutter et al 2018 vonk et al 2015 the temperature for bdoc measurement can be set at field temperature during sample collection to facilitate realistic conditions otherwise a standard room temperature is commonly used 20 25 c for optimum microbial activities finally the initiation of biodegradation experiment immediately after sampling and measurement of doc shortly after the experiment are recommended as labile dom fractions could transform within hours alternatively filtered samples must be placed in dark and cold storage 4 c or in freezer until further analysis 2 4 environmental variables affecting bdoc measurements biodegradability varies along temporal and longitudinal gradients in inland waters as dom with different compositions from various terrestrial and anthropogenic sources enters the aquatic environment for example land use in the watershed and unique features such as permafrost peatlands and landfills can play a significant role in dom biodegradability by contributing dom from particular sources with different levels of lability begum et al 2019 in agricultural watersheds the availability of n and p can also affect dom composition and bdoc mutschlecner et al 2018 wickland et al 2012 in contrast several studies have reported that bdoc could also affect the availability of n and p through heterotrophic assimilation and denitrification which implies the importance of bdoc measurement in c limited system graeber et al 2021 hansen et al 2016b stutter et al 2018 furthermore the addition of a labile source such as algal exudates wastewater rainwater or leaf leachate to the natural dom pool in aquatic environments can alter the bdoc through a positive or negative priming effect which can result in bdoc ranges that deviate from those predicted by a simple mixing effect begum et al 2019 bianchi 2011 catalán et al 2015 zhuang et al 2021 however priming effect is still debated because a few studies reported no priming effect upon mixing dom from different sources bengtsson et al 2018 catalán et al 2015 therefore dom optical and molecular indices can be useful not only for quantitative bdoc estimation but also for revealing the composition and transformation processes of biodegradable fraction of dom in a region watershed lacking direct measurements of bdoc 3 optical indices of dom as bdoc proxy fluorescence and absorbance based indices are popularly adopted to probe dom composition because the measurements are cost effective simple and practicable with a small amount of sample although optical descriptors can reveal the intrinsic properties of dom only a limited number of studies have directly linked them with bdoc measurements in inland aquatic environments the optical descriptors used in bdoc studies of natural systems are defined and compiled in tables 2 and 3 respectively specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 a proxy of dom aromatic content is useful for tracking changes in the aromatic moieties in dom samples weishaar et al 2003 for example massicotte et al 2017 used suva254 to track the transformation of dom across the aquatic continuum and suggested preferential degradation of colored dom particularly in freshwater systems while a small fraction of terrestrial dom is readily biodegradable e g fresh leaf leachate upon entering rivers and lakes the remainder can become biodegradable only after breaking down into smaller molecules through photodegradation hansen et al 2016a helms et al 2008 massicotte et al 2017 ward et al 2013 higher suva254 values were associated with degraded plant and soil derived dom owing to the abundance of uv light absorbing moieties in the sources whereas fresh autochthonous dom showed the opposite trend weishaar et al 2003 suva254 values were generally negatively correlated with bdoc table 3 as shown in many previous studies fellman et al 2008 2009a 2009b fork et al 2020 shi et al 2016 however in anthropogenically modified river systems such as urban rivers there was no significant relationship between suva254 and bdoc begum et al 2019 the relationship between suva254 and bdoc can vary within the same watershed with different predominant land use types for example a significant negative relationship between suva254 2 5 4 5 l mg c 1m 1 and bdoc 7 38 was reported for the wetland dominated reach but no relationship was found in the forest dominated upland in a temperate rainforest watershed fellman et al 2009a in a study on the lower ganges suva254 values were highly variable with a higher value range in the monsoon months 4 0 5 1 l mg c 1 m 1 because of inputs from wetlands and soils and a lower range in the dry months 2 6 5 0 l mg c 1 m 1 due to primary production which led to no significant relationship with bdoc haque et al 2022 many other factors such as microbial production of dom flocculation sedimentation and photodegradation can affect the relationship between suva254 and bdoc massicotte et al 2017 in addition a minor interference may occur in the presence of inorganic ions such as iron and nitrate owing to their scattering and absorption at similar wavelengths as suva254 weishaar et al 2003 however the interference is mostly negligible in freshwater systems unlike groundwater or wastewater containing higher ion concentrations weishaar et al 2003 therefore suva254 should be used with caution when interpreting dom biodegradability despite their consistent negative relationships common fluorescence descriptors including the hix fi and biological index bix have also been linked to dom biodegradability in previous studies table 3 hix is an indicator of the degree of humification and higher values are associated with terrestrial dom ohno 2002 zsolnay et al 1999 several studies have shown a significant negative relationship between hix and bdoc fork et al 2020 gu et al 2020 mao and li 2019 for example the bdoc in a mediterranean river was 11 42 casas ruiz et al 2016 higher values were observed in the flowing water 41 42 owing to the lack of terrestrial dom as indicated by low hix values 4 0 4 2 while low bdoc 11 35 values were found in the high hix range 6 5 8 3 in the upstream and downstream locations because of the large input of terrestrial dom from humification of leaf litter casas ruiz et al 2016 such a negative relationship between hix and bdoc is expected because of the recalcitrant properties of humic substances however a study on urban stormwater and dom leachates with ten different sources various leaves pine needles soil biofilms etc reported a positive relationship between hix and bdoc measured for six days fork et al 2020 the study showed an increase in hix from an initial value of 4 04 to 5 03 and 8 36 during six and 60 days of biodegradation respectively with no significant relationship with bdoc fork et al 2020 because the study included dom samples from storm events a large amount of labile dom from fresh leaf leachates might have disproportionately increased bdoc while hix values remained high due to their high humic content or from soil dom fork et al 2020 although such positive relationships are site specific and rarely reported the negative relationships between bdoc and hix are quite consistent in many studies and can be safely used to probe the proxy if used for long term bdoc measurement regardless of dom sources table 3 fi has been used in dom studies to distinguish between terrestrial and microbial sources in aquatic systems the typical range is 1 2 to 1 8 for most inland waters mcknight et al 2001 whereas wastewater dom can result in fi values exceeding 1 8 wang et al 2019 microbial dom has high fi values and is considered more labile than terrestrial dom positive relationships with bdoc have been reported in a study on urbanized rivers begum et al 2019 however fi was negatively correlated with bdoc in another study on the three gorges reservoir region in china mao and li 2019 several other studies reported no significant relationships fork et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 in the three gorges reservoir region bdoc did not change significantly between the dry and wet seasons however dom optical indices that is hix and fi showed distinctive differences between the different seasons mao and li 2019 while the relationship between bdoc and hix was significant during the wet season the relationship with fi was significant only during the dry season these season specific correlations of bdoc with fi and hix suggest that labile dom may also originate from terrestrial sources e g leaf leachates during the wet season and microbial sources e g algal exudates during the dry season mao and li 2019 a relatively new index bix is an indicator of recently produced microbial derived dom and is thus associated with the lability or biodegradability of dom huguet et al 2009 recent studies have reported significant positive relationships between bdoc and bix fork et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a suggesting a higher biodegradability of microbial derived dom however bix was unsuccessful in predicting bdoc particularly in aquatic systems with predominant terrestrial dom or highly processed dom e g wastewater inputs simply because of the insufficient presence of autochthonous fresh dom begum et al 2019 thus its application might be limited to systems heavily affected by microbial production of dom commonly observed fdom components from excitation emission matrix parallel factor eem parafac analysis in aquatic systems include terrestrial humic microbial humic and protein like components the terrestrial humic like fdom component fluoresces in the excitation emission matrix eem region at ex 260 320 360 nm and em 420 480 nm table 2 fellman et al 2010 microbial humic like components are found at ex 250 290 325 and em 370 430 nm whereas protein like components are reported at ex 270 280 nm and em 304 368 nm fellman et al 2010 terrestrial humic like dom components originate mainly from terrestrial sources and are refractory in nature previous studies on soil leachate headwater agricultural streams and urban streams have shown significant negative relationships between bdoc and terrestrial humic like components fellman et al 2008 fork et al 2020 graeber et al 2021 gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 although a study on the amazon watershed reported the degradation of terrestrially derived dom e g lignin and phenolic compounds along the riverine continuum no relationship between bdoc and fdom components was reported ward et al 2013 microbial humic like dom is derived from microbial processing of allochthonous and autochthonous dom significant positive relationships between microbial humic like dom and bdoc have been reported in a few studies in which microbial humic like dom was perceived as labile dom begum et al 2019 fork et al 2020 in contrast several studies reported no significant relationship between bdoc and humic like dom probably because dom samples originate from diverse sources including autochthonous terrestrial and anthropogenic dom gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 besides anthropogenic sources the biodegradation process itself can produce microbial humic like fdom particularly in watersheds receiving large amounts of wastewater agricultural and or wetland effluents which makes the relationship between microbial humic like fdom and bdoc quite uncertain gu et al 2020 therefore microbial humic like fdom can exhibit positive relationships with bdoc in some systems begum et al 2019 fork et al 2020 and no relationship in some scenarios gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 protein like dom includes tryptophan like tyrosine like and other proteinaceous materials in dom which originate from wastewater algae and other sources fellman et al 2010 protein like dom was the most labile fraction of bulk dom fig 2 many studies have consistently reported significant positive relationships between protein like dom and bdoc fellman et al 2008 2009a 2009b fork et al 2020 gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 lapierre and del giorgio 2014 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021a however fork et al 2020 reported a negative relationship with bdoc in urban headwater streams after 5 days of biodegradation but the study was restricted to a small headwater stream network during storm events 4 molecular indices of dom as bdoc proxy fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a popular tool for exploring the molecular composition of dom owing to its ultrahigh resolution chen et al 2021 spencer et al 2014 ft icr ms identifies individual molecular formulas present in bulk dom and the results are commonly presented in van krevelen diagrams based on elemental ratios of c h and o in general h c versus o c fig 2 the ft icr ms application was expanded to provide useful dom indices and parameters including elemental composition e g cho chon chos and chons biomolecular groups e g aliphatics peptides highly unsaturated hydrocarbons polyphenols and condensed aromatic structures and other intensity weighted indices e g molecular masses modified aromatic index and double bond equivalent chen et al 2021 koch and dittmar 2006 spencer et al 2014 despite the high resolution outputs ft icr ms data have not been linked or studied together with biodegradability until recently biodegradability was first linked to molecular formulas in glaciers singer et al 2012 and soil derived dom ohno et al 2014 using spearman s rank correlation correlation analysis revealed the association of polyphenolic compounds derived from lignins and tannins with higher biodegradability in glacier fed streams singer et al 2012 in addition to tannins ohno et al 2014 reported a positive correlation between bdoc and protein and carbohydrate content in soil derived dom they also suggested that highly bioavailable dom was abundant in the h c 1 2 and o c 0 5 regions of the van krevelen diagram fig 2 similar findings were reported in another study on soil derived dom drake et al 2018 a study on blackwater systems natural rivers and surface vegetation leachates demonstrated that higher biodegradability is correlated with aliphatic formulas h c 1 5 o c 0 9 textor et al 2018 while the dom from the vegetation leachate showed a high bdoc fraction and abundant aliphatic formulas 9 3 blackwater dom was mostly recalcitrant with only 1 9 of the formulas being aliphatic textor et al 2018 consequently linking bdoc with the relative abundance of aliphatic aliphatic formulas can be a simple alternative to a complex approach involving numerous molecular formulas textor et al 2019 reported significant positive correlations between bdoc and aliphatic compounds in permafrost influenced watersheds using rank correlations with the molecular formula and aliphatic compounds and concluded that aliphatic compounds can be a good predictor of bdoc particularly in permafrost derived dom textor et al 2019 furthermore a number of studies have reported a significant reduction in aliphatic formulas during the bio incubation of dom in permafrost fed streams arctic rivers urbanized rivers blackwater systems and forest soils begum et al 2019 o donnell et al 2016 rogers et al 2021 spencer et al 2015 textor et al 2018 2019 therefore aliphatic compounds can be used to predict the biodegradability in a wide range of aquatic systems the molecular lability boundary mlb can be used as a direct index of biodegradability the mlb index was first proposed by d andrilli et al 2015 to distinguish relatively labile molecular constituents this index was calculated using the number of molecular formulas with h c 1 5 and total molecular formula in the bulk dom table 4 fig 2 d andrilli et al 2015 he et al 2019 the mlb has been successfully employed to identify labile anthropogenic dom inputs in urbanized coastal rivers in china he et al 2019 and recalcitrant terrestrial dom inputs in the yangtze river during flood events pang et al 2021 another study used the mlb index to provide evidence of labile and semi labile dom from the sediment water interface entering the riverine dom pool wang et al 2021b therefore mlb can be more reliable particularly for exploring biodegradability across different aquatic environments and geological areas estimation of the potential bioavailability of dom based on ft icr ms data can be applicable in rivers or lotic systems where multiple samples are investigated this unique approach was first proposed by zhang et al 2021 to reveal the potential bioavailability along the longitudinal or downstream gradient bioavailability was calculated based on the number of stable molecular formulas present in all sampling sites resistant molecular formulas present in two sampling sites including the uppermost site and unique molecular formulas in each sampling site compared to all the samples included in the study table 4 because the calculation of potential bioavailability is relative to the respective study sites this method is applicable only in the case of a lotic continuum such as rivers and streams with a spatial gradient the method is relatively new and only one study has used a modified version of the method to explore temporal changes in dom molecular composition during storm events begum et al 2022 although this method can provide high resolution information on dom biodegradability the potential bioavailability relative to a single site cannot reveal the true bdoc of samples in large scale studies furthermore the determination of potential bioavailability in downstream rivers may not be feasible because of hydrological disconnection caused by dams and drought casas ruiz et al 2016 floods can also give misleading results regarding biodegradability casas ruiz et al 2016 zhou et al 2021b 5 linking biodegradation derived co2 with dom optical properties dom biodegradation is the key process in the aquatic system responsible for the large co2 emissions from inland waters 1 2 3 9 pg c yr 1 relative to terrestrial om exports 1 9 5 1 pg c yr 1 battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 in inland waters co2 emissions from biodegradation outweigh those from other processes such as carbonate weathering ch4 oxidation and dom photomineralization begum et al 2021 coble 2007 jin et al 2018 sawakuchi et al 2016 considering that the ratio of respiration to primary production is larger than 1 in the majority of river networks such as the amazon with primary production accounting for 25 50 of respiration biodegradation remains the single most important process for co2 emissions in inland waters garnier and billen 2007 ward et al 2018 despite the close link between biodegradability and co2 production few studies have reported both measured parameters in natural systems begum et al 2019 kim et al 2019 ward et al 2018 meanwhile some studies have reported significant relationships between dom optical properties and co2 in inland waters which raises the possibility of estimating dom lability without measuring actual biodegradability table 5 the presence of various environmental factors affecting net co2 emissions from inland waters makes it challenging to identify a proper proxy for dom indices of co2 production fig 3 for instance a fraction of biodegradation derived co2 can return to the primary producers through photosynthesis dampening the relationship between dom biodegradation and co2 production environmental variables such as water temperature and flow velocity can greatly affect the rate of biodegradation particularly in cold regions where water temperature and high discharge rate impede dom biodegradation o donnell et al 2016 ward et al 2018 furthermore the types of land use and vegetation in watersheds play a major role in dom composition biodegradability and the resulting co2 emissions d amario and xenopoulos 2015 several studies have reported significant relationships between dom optical properties and dissolved co2 in inland waters table 5 to link dom composition with co2 production from dom fdom components from either 1 eem parafac modeling or 2 literature based peaks such as terrestrial humic like microbial humic like and protein like fluorescence have been widely used table 5 terrestrial humic like fdom components are considered to have a negative relationship with co2 production owing to their recalcitrant nature begum et al 2021 2019 in a previous study very diverse dom compositions were reported in three large asian rivers with a wide range of terrestrial humic like fdom 5 45 and partial pressure of co2 pco2 180 34 151 μatm suggesting the effects of various land uses begum et al 2021 in addition impoundments and polluted tributaries can increase the relative abundance of microbial humic and protein like fdom respectively lowering terrestrial humic like fdom in the affected reaches consequently higher levels of dissolved co2 have been reported in rivers with polluted tributaries and impoundments begum et al 2021 nayna et al 2022 similarly an urbanized river in korea showed a wide range of terrestrial humic like fdom 13 53 and dissolved co2 0 07 4 96 mg c l 1 consistent with the diverse land use and anthropogenic impacts in a relatively small watershed begum et al 2019 however previous studies on asian rivers and canadian streams have shown positive relationships between dissolved co2 and terrestrial humic like fdom d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 the reported positive relationships between co2 and terrestrial humic like fdom might have resulted from the predominant land use of the watershed such as the effects of wetlands on the canadian streams d amario and xenopoulos 2015 or the lower reach of the ganges haque et al 2022 anthropogenic impacts such as impoundment and pollution may also have produced a positive relationship between terrestrial humic like fdom and dissolved co2 in the affected reaches of an anthropogenically modified river jin et al 2018 unlike the negative relationship when the entire basin is covered begum et al 2019 therefore more diverse datasets are necessary to use humic like fdom as a predictor of co2 production similarly microbial humic like fdom components exhibit a negative relationship with dissolved co2 in large watersheds with diverse dom compositions begum et al 2021 whereas positive relationships have been reported in relatively smaller watersheds influenced by certain land use and anthropogenic activities d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 microbial humic like fdom can be bi directional towards biodegradation i e produced or degraded during biodegradation therefore the net change in the relative intensity of microbial humic like fdom would hardly describe the actual change in bdoc or co2 production limiting its use as a surrogate of bdoc unlike the strong positive relationships between protein like dom and bdoc the relationship between protein like fdom and dissolved co2 is inconsistent across the literature tables 3 and 5 while a study on asian rivers reported a significant positive relationship between protein like fdom and dissolved co2 begum et al 2021 another study on the temporal variation in pco2 and dom composition in ganges reported a significant negative relationship haque et al 2022 one possible explanation for the inconsistent correlations could be the concurrent consumption and production of protein like materials by microbes rather than complete mineralization to co2 begum et al 2019 in addition to fdom components relationships between co2 and other optical indices have also been reported in other studies table 5 the first set of optical indices including hix suva254 absorption coefficients at 254 and 350 nm i e a 254 and a 350 and spectral slope at 350 400 nm s 350 400 were associated with aromatic and high molecular weight dom positive relationships between these indices and dissolved co2 in rivers and streams were observed in tropical and temperate systems table 5 while these positive relationships appear to contradict the assumption that terrestrial dom is more recalcitrant concurrent increases in aquatic dom and co2 can be caused by large external inputs of terrestrial dom and co2 released from soils during storms floods or permafrost thawing d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 ni et al 2020 the positive relationships between dissolved co2 and hix and suva254 may indicate two concurrent processes 1 co2 production from highly humified dom components released from soils and 2 the co transport of soil derived co2 and humified dom components d amario and xenopoulos 2015 reported that dom components with higher molecular weights derived from wetlands play a strong role in microbial production of co2 through two possible mechanisms 1 increasing the efficiency of microbial consumption of higher molecular weight dom after quick removal of labile dom and 2 photodegradation of higher molecular weight dom followed by photomineralization or biodegradation allesson et al 2021 amon and benner 1996 fellman et al 2009c maavara et al 2021 a stronger relationship between dissolved co2 and the hix was observed in the summer than in the spring season in canadian streams d amario and xenopoulos 2015 studies on the amazon river have also reported that degradation of macromolecules such as lignin and cellulose in terrestrial dom is more efficient in producing co2 than that of bulk dom in tropical and temperate settings during the monsoon season mayorga et al 2005 rodríguez zúñiga et al 2008 ward et al 2013 ward et al 2013 estimated that 40 and 55 of terrestrial dom i e lignin was degraded into smaller molecular weight and biodegradable dom in soils and rivers respectively in the amazon river watershed biodegradation of riverine dom tends to be rapid in warm and wet climates where labile dom components derived from upland soils or floodplains enter the stream during rainfall and large floods meanwhile co2 can be directly discharged from soils which is difficult to be distinguished from biodegradation derived co2 in stream haque et al 2022 ward et al 2013 for example haque et al 2022 reported a concurrent increase in pco2 and dom indices representing terrestrial sources i e hix and terrestrial humic like fdom during the monsoon season in the lower ganges river in contrast lower levels of pco2 were reported in the dry season owing to intense primary production and poor connectivity with the soil and plant dom ni et al 2020 reported significant positive relationships between co2 and a 254 a 350 and s 350 400 in the longchuan river and its tributaries under different hydrological conditions although biodegradation was the predominant pathway during the post wet and drought periods direct inputs of co2 from soil and terrestrial systems were also the prevailing source of dissolved co2 in the longchuan river during the initial wet period ni and li 2019 ni et al 2020 therefore these indices could be applicable in systems with good hydrological connectivity particularly in the warmer months e g monsoon or summer months as predictors of dissolved co2 in the inland waters however the dissolved co2 will most probably reflect production from both autochthonous and allochthonous dom during the monsoon nevertheless optical indices such as fi bix s 275 295 and slope ratio s r have been used as indicators of autochthonous dom that tends to be fresh having low molecular weight and labile table 5 because higher values of these indices represent more biodegradable dom positive relationships with co2 were anticipated consistent with previous studies begum et al 2019 jin et al 2018 ni et al 2020 however a negative relationship between bix and co2 was found in the lower ganges where high levels of bdoc and bix contrasted with relatively low concentrations of dissolved co2 were associated with enhanced primary production during the dry season with low hydrological connectivity haque et al 2022 because this study focused on seasonal variations in pco2 bdoc and dom optical properties it remains to be explored how dissolved co2 enhanced by terrestrial inputs during the monsoon season and consumed by primary production in the dry season could affect the simple relationship between dom optical properties and co2 these findings highlight the importance of further studies covering various land uses seasons and anthropogenic impacts to propose reliable dom optical surrogates for estimating the potential of co2 production from dom biodegradation in inland waters 6 selection of optimal dom indices and limitations among the dom optical indices bdoc values showed significant positive correlations with bix and microbial humic like and protein like fdom however fi did not exhibit a consistent trend with bdoc indicating that it is more prone to be affected by other factors such as hydrology land use and anthropogenic perturbation e g wastewater discharge although suva254 hix terrestrial humic like fdom and protein like fdom have been successful in distinguishing different dom components from various sources ulliman et al 2020 their applications as dom biodegradability surrogates appear condition specific terrestrial humic and protein like fdom showed the strongest relationships with bdoc among the optical indices accounting for 11 92 and 28 96 of the variability in bdoc respectively table 3 previous studies have revealed that biodegradation rapidly depletes protein like fdom whereas refractory terrestrial humic like fdom accumulates accordingly begum et al 2019 park et al 2021 although the successful dom optical indices including suva254 hix and terrestrial humic like fdom are known as photoreactive aromatic dom with low biodegradability these indices clearly showed strong negative correlations with bdoc in various inland water systems table 3 contrary to the conventional assumption that photomineralization is the predominant pathway for processing aromatic dom which may be more relevant in the marine environment co2 emission from photodegradation accounted for 0 05 of the total emission in the amazon river watershed the largest river in the world with exposure to strong sunlight throughout the year in the tropical region remington et al 2011 moreover aromatic dom including lignin and phenol is preferentially utilized as a growth substrate in microbial biomass while fueling the microbial production of fresh and biodegradable dom ward et al 2013 therefore the negative relationships between bdoc and dom optical indices i e suva254 hix and terrestrial humic like fdom are still applicable to the biodegradation of dom particularly in inland waters however to provide a focused and balanced discussion studies highlighting the effects of photo and biodegradation on dom within restricted study areas amon and benner 1996 bowen et al 2020 chen and jaffé 2016 dempsey et al 2020 which reported dissimilar results across different environmental settings were not included in the present review compared to optical indices dom molecular indices showed more consistency in their relationships with bdoc table 4 because potential bioavailability designated as index d in table 4 is calculated by the relative changes in the dom molecular composition of several samples collected along a continuum or watershed it cannot be utilized as a universal proxy of bdoc or lability at this point mlb aliphatic and rank correlations with the relative intensity of molecular formulas can reveal biodegradability and other relevant mechanisms associated with dom transformation begum et al 2019 o donnell et al 2016 rogers et al 2021 spencer et al 2015 textor et al 2018 2019 using mlb and aliphatic as bdoc proxy appears to facilitate simpler correlation analysis of large number of samples than the employment of spearman s rank correlations between bdoc and each molecular formula within a sample although previous studies have found significant relationships between dissolved co2 and terrestrial humic microbial humic and protein like fdom components these relationships have not been consistent across studies begum et al 2021 2019 d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 hix suva254 and other absorbance indices have often been positively associated with dissolved co2 but studies reporting these associations are limited begum et al 2021 2019 d amario and xenopoulos 2015 haque et al 2022 jin et al 2018 ni et al 2020 unlike bdoc dom optical properties have shown limited efficiency in predicting co2 owing to the difficulty in separating biodegradation from other sources of co2 in inland waters fig 3 for example suva254 hix and terrestrial humic like dom might be effective in predicting bdoc and dissolved co2 in the dry period or prolonged droughts but they may be misleading in estimating dissolved co2 in the monsoon season simply because of the abundant input of co2 from soil floodplains and other point sources of pollution similarly protein like fdom can be a good predictor of co2 under geographical settings of poor hydrological connectivity such as during prolonged droughts or in impounded rivers and polluted urbanized streams other major processes that impact co2 emission from inland waters include dom photomineralization weathering and primary production nonetheless these processes prevail in certain geographic or environmental conditions for instance carbonate weathering can be a major contributor to co2 emissions in headwaters arctic and boreal streams humborg et al 2010 marx et al 2017 whereas primary production plays a major role in impounded rivers or eutrophic lakes liu et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 therefore dom optical and molecular indices may not be equally efficient in predicting bdoc or co2 production in various inland waters with different characteristics despite these limitations sensitive bdoc surrogates including suva254 hix terrestrial humic like fdom and protein like fdom can be applied to predict co2 by restricting the relationships to a specific hydrological condition or by employing time series data of a certain stream river watershed and region however the association between dom molecular composition and co2 production using statistical analysis are not reported yet since ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry can enhance the current understanding of the changes in dom molecular composition caused by biodegradation future studies are warranted to directly link aquatic co2 with information on dom molecular composition 7 conclusions the synthesis of previous studies reporting the relationships of dom optical and molecular indices with bdoc and dissolved co2 in inland waters and the critical review provided the following conclusions bdoc is a key feature of dom and can be determined by four different methods of which measurement via doc loss during bio incubation following the best practice guidelines is recommended optical and molecular indices can be used as potential surrogates for bdoc the significant relationships between dom molecular and optical properties and bdoc can provide qualitative information about the underlying mechanisms besides the quantification of labile dom although absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy provide many indices for exploring the composition and lability of dom several fluorescent components have shown a strong association with bdoc in statistical analyses particularly suva254 hix terrestrial humic like components and protein like components were evaluated as reliable predictors of bdoc while other biogeochemical processes such as photomineralization weathering and primary production can also affect co2 emission from inland waters we recommend these indices as sensitive surrogates for the potential for co2 production from dom biodegradation the molecular composition of dom provides valuable information on lability and reveals a strong association between bdoc and aliphatic moieties including the assigned aliphatic formulas and their relative abundance in bulk dom the fdom components and aliphatic moieties should be explored as potential proxies for co2 production from dom biodegradation in future studies this review provides a benchmark for identifying easily available potential surrogates for co2 production from dom biodegradation coupling simpler spectroscopic methods with ultra high resolution spectrometric techniques has been powerful in revealing dom sources composition and fate i e co2 production in natural systems thus similar approaches combining spectroscopic and molecular level analyses of dom can be employed to estimate the co2 production in a wide range of aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc constitutes the most labile fraction of dissolved organic matter dom which also functions as a source of co2 emissions from inland waters however no systematic review is available on dom indicators of bdoc and co2 production potential optical and molecular indices can be used to track small changes in dom composition during biodegradation in this review we identified four different methods for measuring bdoc together with their strengths and limitations in addition we discuss the potential of using documented optical indices based on absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular indices based on fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry as proxies for estimating bdoc and biodegradation induced co2 production based on previously reported relationships in the literature many absorbance and fluorescence based indices showed inconsistent relationships with bdoc depending on watershed characteristics hydrology and anthropogenic impacts nevertheless several indices including specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 humification index hix and terrestrial humic like fluorescent dom fdom components tended to have negative relationships with bdoc in tropical and temperate watersheds under baseflow or drought periods protein like fdom exhibited the strongest correlation with bdoc in different systems except during storms and flood events despite the limited number of studies dom molecular indices exhibited consistent relationships with bdoc suggesting that the relative abundance of aliphatic formulas and the molecular lability index could act as reliable proxies the dom optical indices explain up to 96 and 78 variability in bdoc and co2 respectively nonetheless there were limited studies on molecular indices which explain up to 74 variability in bdoc based on literature survey we recommend several sensitive indices such as suva254 hix and terrestrial humic and protein like fdom which could be useful indicators of bdoc and dissolved co2 in inland water future research should incorporate a wider range of geographic regions with various land use hydrology and anthropogenic disturbances to develop system or condition specific dom optical or molecular proxies for better prediction of bdoc and co2 emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter

an important role in the global carbon c cycle by linking terrestrial and oceanic c pools battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 previous studies have reported 1 9 to 5 1 pg c yr 1 of terrestrial organic matter om exported to rivers globally battin et al 2009 drake et al 2018 regnier et al 2013 ward et al 2017 during its travel to the ocean terrestrial om is transformed in its composition and exchanges with the om pools of floodplain sediment and the atmosphere through various physical chemical and biological processes fig 1 while c burial in the sediment floodplain of inland waters accounts for 0 6 pg c yr 1 the annual c exports through inland waters were estimated at 0 9 pg c yr 1 battin et al 2009 drake et al 2018 regnier et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 however the largest fraction of terrestrial om is lost through gas exchange with the atmosphere in the inland water and the emissions estimates range between 1 2 and 3 9 pg c yr 1 aufdenkampe et al 2011 drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 with co2 emissions accounting for 2 1 pg c yr 1 sawakuchi et al 2017 ward et al 2017 wehrli 2013 the emitted co2 originates from various routes such as biodegradation and or photomineralization of dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc carbonate weathering and oxidation of ch4 begum et al 2019 hao et al 2021 koehler et al 2014 prairie et al 2018 however biodegradation is considered the predominant pathway for co2 production in inland waters bowen et al 2020 burd et al 2016 lapierre et al 2013 in most aquatic ecosystems only a small fraction of bulk dom is available for microbial degradation and co2 production liu and wang 2022 sondergaard and worm 2001 vonk et al 2015 although photomineralization may be a predominant process in cold climates e g arctic lakes and rivers cory et al 2014 only 1 5 of the dom was photomineralized in temperate and tropical lakes and rivers suggesting little co2 emission from photomineralization amon and benner 1996 dempsey et al 2020 koehler et al 2014 maavara et al 2021 dom in inland waters refractory to microbial degradation servais et al 1989 1987 sondergaard and worm 2001 can become bioavailable after partial photooxidation thus enhancing the net biodegradability bowen et al 2020 other large scale studies have reported that photodegradation accounts for up to 10 of co2 emissions globally and that biodegradation remains the major pathway for co2 emissions in inland waters with photomineralization equivalent to 10 of biodegradation allesson et al 2021 koehler et al 2014 maavara et al 2021 ward et al 2014 biodegradable doc bdoc is operationally defined as the proportion of doc loss relative to the initial doc concentration within a certain period e g days or weeks owing to microbial degradation or assimilation fellman et al 2008 servais et al 1987 wickland et al 2012 previous studies on bdoc have used several terms to distinguish between labile degrade rapidly within 3 7 days and semi labile 7 40 days or more pools from the refractory portion of dom according to the duration of bdoc measurements liu and wang 2022 furthermore the experimental conditions for bdoc measurement can create further diversification in terms of amendment of nutrients microbial community or inoculum from in situ or laboratory supplied oxygen during the experiment and availability of light vonk et al 2015 conducted a meta analysis of the major factors that might affect the measurement of bdoc in high latitude arctic watersheds and most of the investigated factors affected bdoc concentrations in common aquatic environments soil environments and other dom sources worldwide begum et al 2019 servais et al 1987 wickland et al 2012 thus the concentration of bdoc appears to be highly variable for different systems watersheds worldwide a global meta analysis of bdoc data showed high values in sewage effluent 45 lowland wetland 31 and urban runoff 17 and low values in peatland draining river 4 forested river 10 and agricultural river 19 stutter et al 2018 the global average bdoc was reported to be 14 16 of the bulk doc for lakes sondergaard and worm 2001 stutter et al 2018 and 16 18 for rivers liu and wang 2022 stutter et al 2018 bdoc is closely associated with the dom source and composition in the aquatic environment and it serves as a critical factor for determining the fate of dom through microbial transformation of dom and release of co2 and other greenhouse gasses fig 1 therefore information regarding the source composition and transformation of dom is necessary for a better understanding of dom biodegradability and or co2 production in inland water many studies have used spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence and ultraviolet spectrophotometry to explore dom sources and their composition fellman et al 2010 li and hur 2017 for example the rapid depletion of highly biodegradable protein like fluorescent dom fdom components followed by the accumulation of recalcitrant terrestrial humic like fdom is commonly observed in dom optical responses to biodegradation in previous studies begum et al 2019 kim et al 2019 park et al 2021 other commonly used optical indices for linking dom with biodegradability include microbial humic like fluorescent dom fdom components fluorescence index fi specific ultraviolet absorbance spectral slopes and slope ratios advanced analyses such as ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry are also popular for revealing dom sources composition and transformation at high resolution begum et al 2022 d andrilli et al 2015 ohno et al 2014 shi et al 2021 textor et al 2019 notably several recent studies employed spectroscopic and high resolution spectrometric techniques to understand changes in intrinsic composition of dom during biodegradation begum et al 2019 o donnell et al 2016 rogers et al 2021 spencer et al 2015 textor et al 2018 2019 estimating bdoc using the intrinsic properties of dom as proxies can be an alternative method to quantify co2 emissions in natural systems where the direct measurement of greenhouse gasses is not feasible and or not available however despite previous successful examples of tracking dom biodegradation using dom optical molecular indices no systematic review combining optical and molecular surrogates of dom for bdoc or resulting co2 production is available in this review we synthesized optical and molecular properties of dom presenting distinct relationships with bdoc and co2 production potential in inland waters to suggest and discuss the proper dom optical molecular proxies the main objectives of this review were to 1 explore the optical and molecular properties of dom associated with bdoc 2 compare the relationships of dom optical properties with dissolved co2 and 3 provide recommendations and future research directions for utilizing available dom data e g optical and molecular indices to predict bdoc and co2 production to our knowledge this is the first review to compile existing knowledge concerning the association of dom composition with biodegradability and co2 production in inland waters 2 biodegradable dissolved organic carbon measurement 2 1 common measurement methods over the past few decades various methods have been employed to quantify the biodegradable fraction of dom direct methods that measure bdoc as doc loss o2 loss and co2 production as a result of microbial degradation and assimilation are preferred compared to indirect measurement methods based on biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod table 1 indirect methods were used before the introduction of direct measurement of bdoc for example bod or the ratio between bod and cod was adopted as a simple proxy for bdoc chen et al 2014 khan et al 2005 samudro and mangkoedihardjo 2010 however bod is obsolete to measure dom biodegradability owing to its low accuracy precision and sensitivity compared to direct measurements khan et al 2005 samudro and mangkoedihardjo 2010 bod and cod are measured based on the oxygen consumption driven by the biological or chemical breakdown of dom whereas bdoc measurements are based on the consumption or degradation of doc the first direct method for measuring bdoc which is the most widely used method to date is based on the doc loss from microbial degradation respiration and is measured in absolute c concentration mg l 1 or relative to the initial doc servais et al 1989 developed a bdoc measurement method using raw samples as an inoculum from a natural environment previously a single strain of laboratory bacterial culture was used as the inoculum in bdoc incubation however the laboratory culture could not degrade dom as efficiently as microbial assemblage from natural environments servais et al 1989 van der kooij et al 1982 most bdoc experiments mimicking the natural environment require at least a few days to measure labile doc whereas measuring semi labile doc can take up to a few months to a year mcdowell et al 2006 vonk et al 2015 the second most common method for bdoc measurement is based on doc loss from a sample passing through a bioreactor with available microbes nutrients and oxygen sondergaard and worm 2001 in this method the measurement can be completed in a few hours which is very useful in exploring spatiotemporal variations in bdoc for large systems or long term monitoring sondergaard and worm 2001 terry and summers 2018 the third method involves the measurement of bdoc from the production of co2 or the change in dic concentration in the sample assuming that all the degraded c is converted to co2 wickland et al 2012 measurement of bdoc using co2 or dic is suitable for the long term monitoring of biodegradation because repeated sampling of headspace gas is feasible within a minimum number of incubation bottles or containers because such long term time series data are easily attainable this approach can be useful for measuring the labile and refractory fractions of dom however there are two major drawbacks in this method which are associated with 1 maintaining a leakproof incubation vial chamber and 2 facilitating necessary o2 for biodegradation the fourth common method is relatively less popular for bdoc measurement which uses o2 loss from microbial respiration and converts it into co2 production and bdoc using stoichiometry cory et al 2013 this approach is often used in ecosystem metabolism studies but it also has the potential to be used for bdoc measurements the first method using doc loss appears to be preferable for bdoc measurements table 1 this is because the third and fourth methods using dic production and o2 loss cannot account for doc loss caused by microbial assimilation i e c accumulated in biomass whereas the second method cannot facilitate realistic conditions nutrients dissolved o2 microbes etc which may cause inaccuracy in bdoc measurement liu and wang 2022 2 2 factors influencing bdoc measurements several methodological and environmental factors can affect bdoc measurements among methodological factors inoculum type and volume temperature incubation duration filter pore size nutrient amendment oxygen availability light availability bottle size and shaking affect bdoc measurements significantly liu and wang 2022 vonk et al 2015 temperature and dissolved oxygen are the two most critical factors for bdoc because they are directly associated with microbial activity and respiration rates mcdowell et al 2006 wickland et al 2012 samples for bdoc measurement are usually filtered through 0 2 µm filters to remove most of the particulates and phytoplankton subsequently a microbial inoculum 1 10 of the total volume is added to facilitate biodegradation vonk et al 2015 however other studies have reported biodegradability measurements using unfiltered samples to mimic a field condition incubation under intermittent light exposure conditions has been employed in some studies to facilitate realistic conditions for determining dom lability in natural environments cory et al 2013 however light exposure may stimulate photo biodegradation therefore the experimental setting for bdoc measurement requires careful evaluation to minimize the potential inaccuracy caused by photodegradation and photosynthesis bottle volume shaking and dissolved oxygen may also have substantial effects on bdoc however comparative studies on these factors are rare vonk et al 2015 ward et al 2018 2 3 best practice guidelines for bdoc measurements bdoc measurement through doc loss is the most commonly used and recommended method samples need to be filtered through a 0 2 µm filter followed by addition of an inoculum preferably from raw sample filtered through a 2 µm filter servais et al 1989 to ensure data quality control with no inoculum together with the samples are incubated in replicates and the mean values are presented with standard deviation a large deviation among the replicates implies contamination or mismanagement of samples during the experiment to ensure constant temperature and complete darkness a clean incubator or oven with sensors is recommended to monitor temperature and light intensity throughout the incubation period vonk et al 2015 to facilitate dissolved oxygen for bdoc measurement using the doc loss method air permeable glass fiber plug or septa with a needle inserted can be used and shaking incubators are preferred for sufficient mixing however for bdoc measurement based on co2 production or o2 loss septa with aluminum crimps are used to maintain a leakproof condition begum et al 2019 wickland et al 2012 the incubation duration is set based on the source of dom and purpose of measuring bdoc which can be approximately 28 days for lakes and large rivers and 7 days for small streams stutter et al 2018 vonk et al 2015 the temperature for bdoc measurement can be set at field temperature during sample collection to facilitate realistic conditions otherwise a standard room temperature is commonly used 20 25 c for optimum microbial activities finally the initiation of biodegradation experiment immediately after sampling and measurement of doc shortly after the experiment are recommended as labile dom fractions could transform within hours alternatively filtered samples must be placed in dark and cold storage 4 c or in freezer until further analysis 2 4 environmental variables affecting bdoc measurements biodegradability varies along temporal and longitudinal gradients in inland waters as dom with different compositions from various terrestrial and anthropogenic sources enters the aquatic environment for example land use in the watershed and unique features such as permafrost peatlands and landfills can play a significant role in dom biodegradability by contributing dom from particular sources with different levels of lability begum et al 2019 in agricultural watersheds the availability of n and p can also affect dom composition and bdoc mutschlecner et al 2018 wickland et al 2012 in contrast several studies have reported that bdoc could also affect the availability of n and p through heterotrophic assimilation and denitrification which implies the importance of bdoc measurement in c limited system graeber et al 2021 hansen et al 2016b stutter et al 2018 furthermore the addition of a labile source such as algal exudates wastewater rainwater or leaf leachate to the natural dom pool in aquatic environments can alter the bdoc through a positive or negative priming effect which can result in bdoc ranges that deviate from those predicted by a simple mixing effect begum et al 2019 bianchi 2011 catalán et al 2015 zhuang et al 2021 however priming effect is still debated because a few studies reported no priming effect upon mixing dom from different sources bengtsson et al 2018 catalán et al 2015 therefore dom optical and molecular indices can be useful not only for quantitative bdoc estimation but also for revealing the composition and transformation processes of biodegradable fraction of dom in a region watershed lacking direct measurements of bdoc 3 optical indices of dom as bdoc proxy fluorescence and absorbance based indices are popularly adopted to probe dom composition because the measurements are cost effective simple and practicable with a small amount of sample although optical descriptors can reveal the intrinsic properties of dom only a limited number of studies have directly linked them with bdoc measurements in inland aquatic environments the optical descriptors used in bdoc studies of natural systems are defined and compiled in tables 2 and 3 respectively specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 a proxy of dom aromatic content is useful for tracking changes in the aromatic moieties in dom samples weishaar et al 2003 for example massicotte et al 2017 used suva254 to track the transformation of dom across the aquatic continuum and suggested preferential degradation of colored dom particularly in freshwater systems while a small fraction of terrestrial dom is readily biodegradable e g fresh leaf leachate upon entering rivers and lakes the remainder can become biodegradable only after breaking down into smaller molecules through photodegradation hansen et al 2016a helms et al 2008 massicotte et al 2017 ward et al 2013 higher suva254 values were associated with degraded plant and soil derived dom owing to the abundance of uv light absorbing moieties in the sources whereas fresh autochthonous dom showed the opposite trend weishaar et al 2003 suva254 values were generally negatively correlated with bdoc table 3 as shown in many previous studies fellman et al 2008 2009a 2009b fork et al 2020 shi et al 2016 however in anthropogenically modified river systems such as urban rivers there was no significant relationship between suva254 and bdoc begum et al 2019 the relationship between suva254 and bdoc can vary within the same watershed with different predominant land use types for example a significant negative relationship between suva254 2 5 4 5 l mg c 1m 1 and bdoc 7 38 was reported for the wetland dominated reach but no relationship was found in the forest dominated upland in a temperate rainforest watershed fellman et al 2009a in a study on the lower ganges suva254 values were highly variable with a higher value range in the monsoon months 4 0 5 1 l mg c 1 m 1 because of inputs from wetlands and soils and a lower range in the dry months 2 6 5 0 l mg c 1 m 1 due to primary production which led to no significant relationship with bdoc haque et al 2022 many other factors such as microbial production of dom flocculation sedimentation and photodegradation can affect the relationship between suva254 and bdoc massicotte et al 2017 in addition a minor interference may occur in the presence of inorganic ions such as iron and nitrate owing to their scattering and absorption at similar wavelengths as suva254 weishaar et al 2003 however the interference is mostly negligible in freshwater systems unlike groundwater or wastewater containing higher ion concentrations weishaar et al 2003 therefore suva254 should be used with caution when interpreting dom biodegradability despite their consistent negative relationships common fluorescence descriptors including the hix fi and biological index bix have also been linked to dom biodegradability in previous studies table 3 hix is an indicator of the degree of humification and higher values are associated with terrestrial dom ohno 2002 zsolnay et al 1999 several studies have shown a significant negative relationship between hix and bdoc fork et al 2020 gu et al 2020 mao and li 2019 for example the bdoc in a mediterranean river was 11 42 casas ruiz et al 2016 higher values were observed in the flowing water 41 42 owing to the lack of terrestrial dom as indicated by low hix values 4 0 4 2 while low bdoc 11 35 values were found in the high hix range 6 5 8 3 in the upstream and downstream locations because of the large input of terrestrial dom from humification of leaf litter casas ruiz et al 2016 such a negative relationship between hix and bdoc is expected because of the recalcitrant properties of humic substances however a study on urban stormwater and dom leachates with ten different sources various leaves pine needles soil biofilms etc reported a positive relationship between hix and bdoc measured for six days fork et al 2020 the study showed an increase in hix from an initial value of 4 04 to 5 03 and 8 36 during six and 60 days of biodegradation respectively with no significant relationship with bdoc fork et al 2020 because the study included dom samples from storm events a large amount of labile dom from fresh leaf leachates might have disproportionately increased bdoc while hix values remained high due to their high humic content or from soil dom fork et al 2020 although such positive relationships are site specific and rarely reported the negative relationships between bdoc and hix are quite consistent in many studies and can be safely used to probe the proxy if used for long term bdoc measurement regardless of dom sources table 3 fi has been used in dom studies to distinguish between terrestrial and microbial sources in aquatic systems the typical range is 1 2 to 1 8 for most inland waters mcknight et al 2001 whereas wastewater dom can result in fi values exceeding 1 8 wang et al 2019 microbial dom has high fi values and is considered more labile than terrestrial dom positive relationships with bdoc have been reported in a study on urbanized rivers begum et al 2019 however fi was negatively correlated with bdoc in another study on the three gorges reservoir region in china mao and li 2019 several other studies reported no significant relationships fork et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 in the three gorges reservoir region bdoc did not change significantly between the dry and wet seasons however dom optical indices that is hix and fi showed distinctive differences between the different seasons mao and li 2019 while the relationship between bdoc and hix was significant during the wet season the relationship with fi was significant only during the dry season these season specific correlations of bdoc with fi and hix suggest that labile dom may also originate from terrestrial sources e g leaf leachates during the wet season and microbial sources e g algal exudates during the dry season mao and li 2019 a relatively new index bix is an indicator of recently produced microbial derived dom and is thus associated with the lability or biodegradability of dom huguet et al 2009 recent studies have reported significant positive relationships between bdoc and bix fork et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a suggesting a higher biodegradability of microbial derived dom however bix was unsuccessful in predicting bdoc particularly in aquatic systems with predominant terrestrial dom or highly processed dom e g wastewater inputs simply because of the insufficient presence of autochthonous fresh dom begum et al 2019 thus its application might be limited to systems heavily affected by microbial production of dom commonly observed fdom components from excitation emission matrix parallel factor eem parafac analysis in aquatic systems include terrestrial humic microbial humic and protein like components the terrestrial humic like fdom component fluoresces in the excitation emission matrix eem region at ex 260 320 360 nm and em 420 480 nm table 2 fellman et al 2010 microbial humic like components are found at ex 250 290 325 and em 370 430 nm whereas protein like components are reported at ex 270 280 nm and em 304 368 nm fellman et al 2010 terrestrial humic like dom components originate mainly from terrestrial sources and are refractory in nature previous studies on soil leachate headwater agricultural streams and urban streams have shown significant negative relationships between bdoc and terrestrial humic like components fellman et al 2008 fork et al 2020 graeber et al 2021 gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 although a study on the amazon watershed reported the degradation of terrestrially derived dom e g lignin and phenolic compounds along the riverine continuum no relationship between bdoc and fdom components was reported ward et al 2013 microbial humic like dom is derived from microbial processing of allochthonous and autochthonous dom significant positive relationships between microbial humic like dom and bdoc have been reported in a few studies in which microbial humic like dom was perceived as labile dom begum et al 2019 fork et al 2020 in contrast several studies reported no significant relationship between bdoc and humic like dom probably because dom samples originate from diverse sources including autochthonous terrestrial and anthropogenic dom gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 besides anthropogenic sources the biodegradation process itself can produce microbial humic like fdom particularly in watersheds receiving large amounts of wastewater agricultural and or wetland effluents which makes the relationship between microbial humic like fdom and bdoc quite uncertain gu et al 2020 therefore microbial humic like fdom can exhibit positive relationships with bdoc in some systems begum et al 2019 fork et al 2020 and no relationship in some scenarios gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 protein like dom includes tryptophan like tyrosine like and other proteinaceous materials in dom which originate from wastewater algae and other sources fellman et al 2010 protein like dom was the most labile fraction of bulk dom fig 2 many studies have consistently reported significant positive relationships between protein like dom and bdoc fellman et al 2008 2009a 2009b fork et al 2020 gu et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 lapierre and del giorgio 2014 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021a however fork et al 2020 reported a negative relationship with bdoc in urban headwater streams after 5 days of biodegradation but the study was restricted to a small headwater stream network during storm events 4 molecular indices of dom as bdoc proxy fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a popular tool for exploring the molecular composition of dom owing to its ultrahigh resolution chen et al 2021 spencer et al 2014 ft icr ms identifies individual molecular formulas present in bulk dom and the results are commonly presented in van krevelen diagrams based on elemental ratios of c h and o in general h c versus o c fig 2 the ft icr ms application was expanded to provide useful dom indices and parameters including elemental composition e g cho chon chos and chons biomolecular groups e g aliphatics peptides highly unsaturated hydrocarbons polyphenols and condensed aromatic structures and other intensity weighted indices e g molecular masses modified aromatic index and double bond equivalent chen et al 2021 koch and dittmar 2006 spencer et al 2014 despite the high resolution outputs ft icr ms data have not been linked or studied together with biodegradability until recently biodegradability was first linked to molecular formulas in glaciers singer et al 2012 and soil derived dom ohno et al 2014 using spearman s rank correlation correlation analysis revealed the association of polyphenolic compounds derived from lignins and tannins with higher biodegradability in glacier fed streams singer et al 2012 in addition to tannins ohno et al 2014 reported a positive correlation between bdoc and protein and carbohydrate content in soil derived dom they also suggested that highly bioavailable dom was abundant in the h c 1 2 and o c 0 5 regions of the van krevelen diagram fig 2 similar findings were reported in another study on soil derived dom drake et al 2018 a study on blackwater systems natural rivers and surface vegetation leachates demonstrated that higher biodegradability is correlated with aliphatic formulas h c 1 5 o c 0 9 textor et al 2018 while the dom from the vegetation leachate showed a high bdoc fraction and abundant aliphatic formulas 9 3 blackwater dom was mostly recalcitrant with only 1 9 of the formulas being aliphatic textor et al 2018 consequently linking bdoc with the relative abundance of aliphatic aliphatic formulas can be a simple alternative to a complex approach involving numerous molecular formulas textor et al 2019 reported significant positive correlations between bdoc and aliphatic compounds in permafrost influenced watersheds using rank correlations with the molecular formula and aliphatic compounds and concluded that aliphatic compounds can be a good predictor of bdoc particularly in permafrost derived dom textor et al 2019 furthermore a number of studies have reported a significant reduction in aliphatic formulas during the bio incubation of dom in permafrost fed streams arctic rivers urbanized rivers blackwater systems and forest soils begum et al 2019 o donnell et al 2016 rogers et al 2021 spencer et al 2015 textor et al 2018 2019 therefore aliphatic compounds can be used to predict the biodegradability in a wide range of aquatic systems the molecular lability boundary mlb can be used as a direct index of biodegradability the mlb index was first proposed by d andrilli et al 2015 to distinguish relatively labile molecular constituents this index was calculated using the number of molecular formulas with h c 1 5 and total molecular formula in the bulk dom table 4 fig 2 d andrilli et al 2015 he et al 2019 the mlb has been successfully employed to identify labile anthropogenic dom inputs in urbanized coastal rivers in china he et al 2019 and recalcitrant terrestrial dom inputs in the yangtze river during flood events pang et al 2021 another study used the mlb index to provide evidence of labile and semi labile dom from the sediment water interface entering the riverine dom pool wang et al 2021b therefore mlb can be more reliable particularly for exploring biodegradability across different aquatic environments and geological areas estimation of the potential bioavailability of dom based on ft icr ms data can be applicable in rivers or lotic systems where multiple samples are investigated this unique approach was first proposed by zhang et al 2021 to reveal the potential bioavailability along the longitudinal or downstream gradient bioavailability was calculated based on the number of stable molecular formulas present in all sampling sites resistant molecular formulas present in two sampling sites including the uppermost site and unique molecular formulas in each sampling site compared to all the samples included in the study table 4 because the calculation of potential bioavailability is relative to the respective study sites this method is applicable only in the case of a lotic continuum such as rivers and streams with a spatial gradient the method is relatively new and only one study has used a modified version of the method to explore temporal changes in dom molecular composition during storm events begum et al 2022 although this method can provide high resolution information on dom biodegradability the potential bioavailability relative to a single site cannot reveal the true bdoc of samples in large scale studies furthermore the determination of potential bioavailability in downstream rivers may not be feasible because of hydrological disconnection caused by dams and drought casas ruiz et al 2016 floods can also give misleading results regarding biodegradability casas ruiz et al 2016 zhou et al 2021b 5 linking biodegradation derived co2 with dom optical properties dom biodegradation is the key process in the aquatic system responsible for the large co2 emissions from inland waters 1 2 3 9 pg c yr 1 relative to terrestrial om exports 1 9 5 1 pg c yr 1 battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 in inland waters co2 emissions from biodegradation outweigh those from other processes such as carbonate weathering ch4 oxidation and dom photomineralization begum et al 2021 coble 2007 jin et al 2018 sawakuchi et al 2016 considering that the ratio of respiration to primary production is larger than 1 in the majority of river networks such as the amazon with primary production accounting for 25 50 of respiration biodegradation remains the single most important process for co2 emissions in inland waters garnier and billen 2007 ward et al 2018 despite the close link between biodegradability and co2 production few studies have reported both measured parameters in natural systems begum et al 2019 kim et al 2019 ward et al 2018 meanwhile some studies have reported significant relationships between dom optical properties and co2 in inland waters which raises the possibility of estimating dom lability without measuring actual biodegradability table 5 the presence of various environmental factors affecting net co2 emissions from inland waters makes it challenging to identify a proper proxy for dom indices of co2 production fig 3 for instance a fraction of biodegradation derived co2 can return to the primary producers through photosynthesis dampening the relationship between dom biodegradation and co2 production environmental variables such as water temperature and flow velocity can greatly affect the rate of biodegradation particularly in cold regions where water temperature and high discharge rate impede dom biodegradation o donnell et al 2016 ward et al 2018 furthermore the types of land use and vegetation in watersheds play a major role in dom composition biodegradability and the resulting co2 emissions d amario and xenopoulos 2015 several studies have reported significant relationships between dom optical properties and dissolved co2 in inland waters table 5 to link dom composition with co2 production from dom fdom components from either 1 eem parafac modeling or 2 literature based peaks such as terrestrial humic like microbial humic like and protein like fluorescence have been widely used table 5 terrestrial humic like fdom components are considered to have a negative relationship with co2 production owing to their recalcitrant nature begum et al 2021 2019 in a previous study very diverse dom compositions were reported in three large asian rivers with a wide range of terrestrial humic like fdom 5 45 and partial pressure of co2 pco2 180 34 151 μatm suggesting the effects of various land uses begum et al 2021 in addition impoundments and polluted tributaries can increase the relative abundance of microbial humic and protein like fdom respectively lowering terrestrial humic like fdom in the affected reaches consequently higher levels of dissolved co2 have been reported in rivers with polluted tributaries and impoundments begum et al 2021 nayna et al 2022 similarly an urbanized river in korea showed a wide range of terrestrial humic like fdom 13 53 and dissolved co2 0 07 4 96 mg c l 1 consistent with the diverse land use and anthropogenic impacts in a relatively small watershed begum et al 2019 however previous studies on asian rivers and canadian streams have shown positive relationships between dissolved co2 and terrestrial humic like fdom d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 the reported positive relationships between co2 and terrestrial humic like fdom might have resulted from the predominant land use of the watershed such as the effects of wetlands on the canadian streams d amario and xenopoulos 2015 or the lower reach of the ganges haque et al 2022 anthropogenic impacts such as impoundment and pollution may also have produced a positive relationship between terrestrial humic like fdom and dissolved co2 in the affected reaches of an anthropogenically modified river jin et al 2018 unlike the negative relationship when the entire basin is covered begum et al 2019 therefore more diverse datasets are necessary to use humic like fdom as a predictor of co2 production similarly microbial humic like fdom components exhibit a negative relationship with dissolved co2 in large watersheds with diverse dom compositions begum et al 2021 whereas positive relationships have been reported in relatively smaller watersheds influenced by certain land use and anthropogenic activities d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 microbial humic like fdom can be bi directional towards biodegradation i e produced or degraded during biodegradation therefore the net change in the relative intensity of microbial humic like fdom would hardly describe the actual change in bdoc or co2 production limiting its use as a surrogate of bdoc unlike the strong positive relationships between protein like dom and bdoc the relationship between protein like fdom and dissolved co2 is inconsistent across the literature tables 3 and 5 while a study on asian rivers reported a significant positive relationship between protein like fdom and dissolved co2 begum et al 2021 another study on the temporal variation in pco2 and dom composition in ganges reported a significant negative relationship haque et al 2022 one possible explanation for the inconsistent correlations could be the concurrent consumption and production of protein like materials by microbes rather than complete mineralization to co2 begum et al 2019 in addition to fdom components relationships between co2 and other optical indices have also been reported in other studies table 5 the first set of optical indices including hix suva254 absorption coefficients at 254 and 350 nm i e a 254 and a 350 and spectral slope at 350 400 nm s 350 400 were associated with aromatic and high molecular weight dom positive relationships between these indices and dissolved co2 in rivers and streams were observed in tropical and temperate systems table 5 while these positive relationships appear to contradict the assumption that terrestrial dom is more recalcitrant concurrent increases in aquatic dom and co2 can be caused by large external inputs of terrestrial dom and co2 released from soils during storms floods or permafrost thawing d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 ni et al 2020 the positive relationships between dissolved co2 and hix and suva254 may indicate two concurrent processes 1 co2 production from highly humified dom components released from soils and 2 the co transport of soil derived co2 and humified dom components d amario and xenopoulos 2015 reported that dom components with higher molecular weights derived from wetlands play a strong role in microbial production of co2 through two possible mechanisms 1 increasing the efficiency of microbial consumption of higher molecular weight dom after quick removal of labile dom and 2 photodegradation of higher molecular weight dom followed by photomineralization or biodegradation allesson et al 2021 amon and benner 1996 fellman et al 2009c maavara et al 2021 a stronger relationship between dissolved co2 and the hix was observed in the summer than in the spring season in canadian streams d amario and xenopoulos 2015 studies on the amazon river have also reported that degradation of macromolecules such as lignin and cellulose in terrestrial dom is more efficient in producing co2 than that of bulk dom in tropical and temperate settings during the monsoon season mayorga et al 2005 rodríguez zúñiga et al 2008 ward et al 2013 ward et al 2013 estimated that 40 and 55 of terrestrial dom i e lignin was degraded into smaller molecular weight and biodegradable dom in soils and rivers respectively in the amazon river watershed biodegradation of riverine dom tends to be rapid in warm and wet climates where labile dom components derived from upland soils or floodplains enter the stream during rainfall and large floods meanwhile co2 can be directly discharged from soils which is difficult to be distinguished from biodegradation derived co2 in stream haque et al 2022 ward et al 2013 for example haque et al 2022 reported a concurrent increase in pco2 and dom indices representing terrestrial sources i e hix and terrestrial humic like fdom during the monsoon season in the lower ganges river in contrast lower levels of pco2 were reported in the dry season owing to intense primary production and poor connectivity with the soil and plant dom ni et al 2020 reported significant positive relationships between co2 and a 254 a 350 and s 350 400 in the longchuan river and its tributaries under different hydrological conditions although biodegradation was the predominant pathway during the post wet and drought periods direct inputs of co2 from soil and terrestrial systems were also the prevailing source of dissolved co2 in the longchuan river during the initial wet period ni and li 2019 ni et al 2020 therefore these indices could be applicable in systems with good hydrological connectivity particularly in the warmer months e g monsoon or summer months as predictors of dissolved co2 in the inland waters however the dissolved co2 will most probably reflect production from both autochthonous and allochthonous dom during the monsoon nevertheless optical indices such as fi bix s 275 295 and slope ratio s r have been used as indicators of autochthonous dom that tends to be fresh having low molecular weight and labile table 5 because higher values of these indices represent more biodegradable dom positive relationships with co2 were anticipated consistent with previous studies begum et al 2019 jin et al 2018 ni et al 2020 however a negative relationship between bix and co2 was found in the lower ganges where high levels of bdoc and bix contrasted with relatively low concentrations of dissolved co2 were associated with enhanced primary production during the dry season with low hydrological connectivity haque et al 2022 because this study focused on seasonal variations in pco2 bdoc and dom optical properties it remains to be explored how dissolved co2 enhanced by terrestrial inputs during the monsoon season and consumed by primary production in the dry season could affect the simple relationship between dom optical properties and co2 these findings highlight the importance of further studies covering various land uses seasons and anthropogenic impacts to propose reliable dom optical surrogates for estimating the potential of co2 production from dom biodegradation in inland waters 6 selection of optimal dom indices and limitations among the dom optical indices bdoc values showed significant positive correlations with bix and microbial humic like and protein like fdom however fi did not exhibit a consistent trend with bdoc indicating that it is more prone to be affected by other factors such as hydrology land use and anthropogenic perturbation e g wastewater discharge although suva254 hix terrestrial humic like fdom and protein like fdom have been successful in distinguishing different dom components from various sources ulliman et al 2020 their applications as dom biodegradability surrogates appear condition specific terrestrial humic and protein like fdom showed the strongest relationships with bdoc among the optical indices accounting for 11 92 and 28 96 of the variability in bdoc respectively table 3 previous studies have revealed that biodegradation rapidly depletes protein like fdom whereas refractory terrestrial humic like fdom accumulates accordingly begum et al 2019 park et al 2021 although the successful dom optical indices including suva254 hix and terrestrial humic like fdom are known as photoreactive aromatic dom with low biodegradability these indices clearly showed strong negative correlations with bdoc in various inland water systems table 3 contrary to the conventional assumption that photomineralization is the predominant pathway for processing aromatic dom which may be more relevant in the marine environment co2 emission from photodegradation accounted for 0 05 of the total emission in the amazon river watershed the largest river in the world with exposure to strong sunlight throughout the year in the tropical region remington et al 2011 moreover aromatic dom including lignin and phenol is preferentially utilized as a growth substrate in microbial biomass while fueling the microbial production of fresh and biodegradable dom ward et al 2013 therefore the negative relationships between bdoc and dom optical indices i e suva254 hix and terrestrial humic like fdom are still applicable to the biodegradation of dom particularly in inland waters however to provide a focused and balanced discussion studies highlighting the effects of photo and biodegradation on dom within restricted study areas amon and benner 1996 bowen et al 2020 chen and jaffé 2016 dempsey et al 2020 which reported dissimilar results across different environmental settings were not included in the present review compared to optical indices dom molecular indices showed more consistency in their relationships with bdoc table 4 because potential bioavailability designated as index d in table 4 is calculated by the relative changes in the dom molecular composition of several samples collected along a continuum or watershed it cannot be utilized as a universal proxy of bdoc or lability at this point mlb aliphatic and rank correlations with the relative intensity of molecular formulas can reveal biodegradability and other relevant mechanisms associated with dom transformation begum et al 2019 o donnell et al 2016 rogers et al 2021 spencer et al 2015 textor et al 2018 2019 using mlb and aliphatic as bdoc proxy appears to facilitate simpler correlation analysis of large number of samples than the employment of spearman s rank correlations between bdoc and each molecular formula within a sample although previous studies have found significant relationships between dissolved co2 and terrestrial humic microbial humic and protein like fdom components these relationships have not been consistent across studies begum et al 2021 2019 d amario and xenopoulos 2015 jin et al 2018 hix suva254 and other absorbance indices have often been positively associated with dissolved co2 but studies reporting these associations are limited begum et al 2021 2019 d amario and xenopoulos 2015 haque et al 2022 jin et al 2018 ni et al 2020 unlike bdoc dom optical properties have shown limited efficiency in predicting co2 owing to the difficulty in separating biodegradation from other sources of co2 in inland waters fig 3 for example suva254 hix and terrestrial humic like dom might be effective in predicting bdoc and dissolved co2 in the dry period or prolonged droughts but they may be misleading in estimating dissolved co2 in the monsoon season simply because of the abundant input of co2 from soil floodplains and other point sources of pollution similarly protein like fdom can be a good predictor of co2 under geographical settings of poor hydrological connectivity such as during prolonged droughts or in impounded rivers and polluted urbanized streams other major processes that impact co2 emission from inland waters include dom photomineralization weathering and primary production nonetheless these processes prevail in certain geographic or environmental conditions for instance carbonate weathering can be a major contributor to co2 emissions in headwaters arctic and boreal streams humborg et al 2010 marx et al 2017 whereas primary production plays a major role in impounded rivers or eutrophic lakes liu et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 therefore dom optical and molecular indices may not be equally efficient in predicting bdoc or co2 production in various inland waters with different characteristics despite these limitations sensitive bdoc surrogates including suva254 hix terrestrial humic like fdom and protein like fdom can be applied to predict co2 by restricting the relationships to a specific hydrological condition or by employing time series data of a certain stream river watershed and region however the association between dom molecular composition and co2 production using statistical analysis are not reported yet since ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry can enhance the current understanding of the changes in dom molecular composition caused by biodegradation future studies are warranted to directly link aquatic co2 with information on dom molecular composition 7 conclusions the synthesis of previous studies reporting the relationships of dom optical and molecular indices with bdoc and dissolved co2 in inland waters and the critical review provided the following conclusions bdoc is a key feature of dom and can be determined by four different methods of which measurement via doc loss during bio incubation following the best practice guidelines is recommended optical and molecular indices can be used as potential surrogates for bdoc the significant relationships between dom molecular and optical properties and bdoc can provide qualitative information about the underlying mechanisms besides the quantification of labile dom although absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy provide many indices for exploring the composition and lability of dom several fluorescent components have shown a strong association with bdoc in statistical analyses particularly suva254 hix terrestrial humic like components and protein like components were evaluated as reliable predictors of bdoc while other biogeochemical processes such as photomineralization weathering and primary production can also affect co2 emission from inland waters we recommend these indices as sensitive surrogates for the potential for co2 production from dom biodegradation the molecular composition of dom provides valuable information on lability and reveals a strong association between bdoc and aliphatic moieties including the assigned aliphatic formulas and their relative abundance in bulk dom the fdom components and aliphatic moieties should be explored as potential proxies for co2 production from dom biodegradation in future studies this review provides a benchmark for identifying easily available potential surrogates for co2 production from dom biodegradation coupling simpler spectroscopic methods with ultra high resolution spectrometric techniques has been powerful in revealing dom sources composition and fate i e co2 production in natural systems thus similar approaches combining spectroscopic and molecular level analyses of dom can be employed to estimate the co2 production in a wide range of aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15282,bubble aeration has been widely applied in water wastewater treatment however its low gas utilization rate results in high energy consumption application of micro nanobubbles mnb has emerged as a process with the potential to significantly increase gas utilisation due to their high relative surface area and high gas liquid mass transfer efficiency in this study we demonstrate through calibrated models that mnb of an optimum bubble size can shrink and burst at or below the water surface enabling 1 all encapsulated gas to thoroughly dissolve in water and 2 the bursting of nanobubbles to potentially generate free radicals through the understanding of mnb dimensional characteristics and bubble behaviour in water a dynamic model that integrated force balance i e buoyancy force gravity drag force basset force and virtual mass force and mass transfer was developed to describe the rising velocity and radius variation of mnb along its upward trajectory unlike for conventional millimetre sized bubbles intensive gas dissolution of mnbs led to radius reduction for small bubbles while a large initial radius triggers bubble swelling the initial water depth was also crucial where greater depth could drive the potential for bubble shrinkage so that they were more liable to contract for example the optimum bubble size of air 42 194 μm and oxygen 127 470 μm mnb that could achieve complete gas transfer 100 gas utilisation for a range of specific water depths 0 5 10 m were calculated the modelling results for microbubbles 10 530 μm were well validated by the experimental data r2 0 85 however the validation of the modelling results for nanobubble 1 μm aeration requires further study due to a lack of available empirical data in this study the proposed model and analysis provided new insights into understanding bubble dynamics in water and offered fundamental guidance for practitioners looking to upgrade bubble aeration system graphical abstract image

widely applied in many areas for water and wastewater treatment energy production aquaculture and chemical engineering fan et al 2021 courtney et al 2021 aeration using conventional millimetre sized bubbles provides effective mixing but has limited oxygen transfer efficiency 6 10 for example in activated sludge treatment plants zhang et al 2020 bubble size can significantly affect the gas liquid mass transfer where small bubbles are more efficient due to the increased gas liquid contact area and extended bubble residence time in solution therefore micro nanobubble mnb technology with a reported oxygen transfer efficiency of 30 100 muroyama et al 2013 abadie et al 2022 has recently been developed and utilised in biological chemical and environmental applications azevedo et al 2016 temesgen et al 2017 during conventional bubble aeration large bubbles in the water will rise swell and collapse at the water surface which results in low gas liquid transfer efficiency on the contrary mnbs may shrink and burst at or below the water surface due to the lower buoyancy and higher gas transfer rate however the basic definition categorisation of mnbs remains inconsistent takahashi et al 2007 and terasaka et al 2011 classified microbubbles or fine bubbles as tiny bubbles with sizes in the range of 10 50 or 10 60 μm respectively agarwal et al 2011 categorized bubbles under the size of 200 nm as nanobubbles seddon et al 2012 reported that bulk nanobubbles were observed in solution with typical radii of curvature of 50 100 nm zimmerman et al 2011 defined nanobubbles as bubbles having sizes in the range of 1 nm to 1 μm in 2017 the published standard of iso 20 480 1 2017 defined a fine bubble microbubble as a bubble with a volume equivalent diameter of less than 100 μm and an ultrafine bubble nanobubble as a bubble with a diameter of less than 1 μm iso tc 281 2017 in many cases researchers lumped the microbubbles and nanobubbles together and called them micro nano bubbles without strict partition in terms of real implementation practitioners need clear guidance in choosing the specific size of mnb for aeration the application of bubbles with the optimum size can also avoid energy waste caused by the excessive pursuit of the production of ultrafine bubbles besides having a mall size and large specific surface area mnbs have other interesting properties such as a negatively charged surface and the potential to generate free radicals for pollutant removal during bubble collapse takahashi et al 2007 therefore mnbs have also been used to remediate hydrocarbon contaminated soil agarwal et al 2016 reduce surface membranes fouling ghadimkhani et al 2016 and remove micropollutants in wastewater li et al 2009 however the importance of free radical generation from the collapse of micro nanobubbles has been questioned for the range of bubble sizes 1 100 µm typically seen for most microbubble generators john et al 2022a for smaller bubbles in the low nm size range 200 nm some studies have either directly monitored or indirectly demonstrated the radical formation from bubble collapse through experimental investigations tang et al 2021 takahashi et al 2007 proposed a theory based on the accumulation of ions to explain radical generation from collapsing microbubbles the shrinking of the bubble leads to an accumulation of ions near the bubble water interface resulting in a rapid increase in the absolute value of the surface charge measured by the ζ potential takahashi 2005 subsequently the drastic environmental change caused by the extinction of the gas water interface triggers radical generation from the dispersion of the elevated chemical potential that has accumulated around the interface takahashi et al 2012 yasui et al 2018b claimed that the temperature and pressure inside a bubble increased to about 3000 k and 1 5 gpa respectively at the final moment of bubble dissolution due to the quasi adiabatic compression these extreme conditions thus lead to another possible mechanistic route for hydroxyl radical generation therefore delivering an appropriately sized bubble that can shrink at or below the water surface can not only achieve complete gas utilisation during aeration but also generate activated oxidizers to boost the treatment to obtain the perfect bubble size for aeration it is important to understand the dynamics of the bubble rising in water including the rising velocity and diameter change stoke s law davies and taylor s equation or hadmard rybczynski s equation are the most commonly used models to estimate the terminal velocity of a single spherical bubble at low reynolds number parkinson et al 2008 parmar et al 2015 liu et al 2016 these readily applied analytic formulas were developed to establish the relationship between the specific diameter of the bubble and the terminal velocity in ideal conditions uniform motion thus they do not describe dynamic changes in bubble properties the epstein plesset theory plesset and satwindar 1982 and models proposed by yasui et al 2018b and xue et al 2022 describe the gas diffusion heat transfer and energy transformation over time for a dissolving bubble however these models do not consider the bubble rising in the liquid because their focus is on the bubble dynamics during the final dissolution stage when the rising velocity of a bubble with a diameter in the tens of nanometre range could be ignored hirai et al 2015 also proposed a theoretical equation for the change of microbubble diameter but it was assumed that the change rate was constant during the rising process which disagreed with the conventional view that the rate of bubble shrinkage increases as bubbles rise yasui et al 2016 therefore the development of the theory and an integrated dynamic model are urgently needed to determine the threshold diameter for the most effective mnb aeration the study aims to develop and investigate a numerical model that can identify the optimum bubble size for mnb aeration to achieve complete gas transfer and free radicals generation we claim that only a bubble with a radius smaller than the threshold value can collapse below the water surface and achieve the best mnb aeration fig 1 a the model considered force balances buoyancy force gravity drag force basset force and virtual mass force and the mass transfer of a gas bubble rising in water additionally the experimental data from the literature were collected to validate the model finally the optimum bubble size of air and oxygen mnb at certain water depths 0 5 10 m was calculated the proposed model and results aim to provide a new insight to understand bubble dynamics in water and provide fundamental guidance for practitioners for upgrading of bubble aeration systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 model descriptions the model framework is shown in fig 1 which considers a single isolated gas bubble in water there are five forces fig 1b that act on the bubble kulkarni and joshi 2005 muhlbauer et al 2019 the buoyancy f b is an upward force while the gravity f g drag f d basset f b and virtual mass also called added mass f a are the downward forces interactions between these forces are determined by gas density ρ g surface tension σ viscosity μ and the initial bubble size producing various effects on the rising trajectories and radius r the variations of the inertial and viscous energy dissipation were considered to quantify the drag force the bubble size and velocity at a specific time during the rising process were calculated as a function of bubble size gas type and water depth at a specific flow regime the radius of the bubble that will shrink and precisely collapse at the water surface was determined as the corresponding threshold value to simplify the bubble rising process all analyses have been implemented based on the following commonly used assumptions kulkarni and joshi 2005 yasui et al 2016 xue et al 2022 1 the bubble remains spherical during the rising process 2 the surrounding water is static and the concentrations of gas species in ambient water are constant 3 the temperature inside the bubble remains stable most of the time and only increases to about 3000 k at the final moment in several picoseconds of collapse 4 the gas inside the bubble is ideal 5 the initial rising velocity equals zero at time t 0 s 2 1 1 description of the bubble rising and trajectory according to newton s second law the balance of forces can be presented as eq 1 1 m g d u d t f g f b f d f a f b where m g is the mass of the gas bubble u is the rising velocity of the bubble at a time t all these forces are given as follows kulkarni and joshi 2005 moreno casas and bombardelli 2016 muhlbauer et al 2019 2 f g 4 π 3 r 3 ρ

is the acceleration of gravity τ is a dummy integration variable k m is the virtual mass coefficient and is commonly set to 0 5 feng and bolotnov 2017 k b is the basset coefficient and equal to 6 chuang and hibiki 2017 c d is a drag coefficient that is related to the reynolds number re 2 u r μ and eotvos number e o 4 r 2 g ρ l ρ g σ where μ is the viscosity of liquid and σ is the surface tension of the liquid the relationship between c d e o and re is shown in eq 7 darmana et al 2009 7 c d max min 16 re 1 0 15 re 0 687 48 re 8 3 e o e o 4 combining eqs 1 6 we get eq 8 illustrating the

d z d t u where z is water depth the distance from the bubble centre to the water surface 2 1 2 description of the variation of bubble size while a bubble rises in a liquid the gas in the bubble keeps dissolving during this process the bubble size radius is a function of the inner pressure the liquid pressure depth under the water surface the surface tension and the gas diffusion at the gas liquid interface considering that the gas in the bubble is an ideal gas the ideal gas state equation is applicable as follows 10 v d p d t p d v d t p v n d n d t the time derivative of the bubble radius can then be expressed in eq 11 11 d r d t r 3 1 n d n d t 1 p d p d t where v is the volume of the bubble n is the total number of moles of gas inside the bubble p is the internal pressure of the bubble and can be described by the young laplace equation p p 0 ρ l g z 2 σ r where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure therefore the variation of p can be calculated as follows 12 d p d t ρ l g u 2 σ r 2 d r d t for an individual bubble the gas diffusion at the gas liquid interface can be described in eq 13 13 d n i d t 4 π r 2 w i c a i c s i where n i is the number of moles inside a bubble for the gas species i i e nitrogen and oxygen in the air w i is the mass transfer coefficient at the bubble surface for the gas species i c a i is the concentration of the dissolved gas species i in the surrounding fluid c s i is the concentration of the dissolved gas species i on the bubble skin the interfacial mass transfer coefficient w i is considered to depend on the gas to liquid diffusivity density viscosity as well as how the transfer of gas from the bubble takes place miner et al 1986 accordingly the mass transfer coefficients w i are given by miner et al 1986 14 w i 2 d i u 2 π r r 0 15 cm 7 53 r 84 17 d i 0 03 r 0 15 cm 0 31 μ g ρ l 1 3 μ ρ l d i 2 3 r 0 03 cm where d i is the molecular diffusivity of the gas species i d n 2 1 90 10 9 m 2 s d o 2 2 50 10 9 m 2 s the concentration of the dissolved gas species i on the bubble skin c s i is calculated by henry s law constant yasui et al 2016 15 c s i 10 3 ρ l r s i p k h i m h 2 o where k h i is henry s law constant of the gas species i at the bubble wall m h 2 o is the molecular weight of h2o 18 g mol r s i is the molar ratio of the gas species i inside the bubble r s i n i n t n i is the instantaneous number of moles of the gas species i and n t is the total number of moles inside a bubble n t n o 2 n n 2 thus during the bubble rising process the oxygen utilization coefficient j o 2 can be calculated from the following equation 16 j o 2 n o 2 0 n o 2 t n o 2 0 where n o 2 0 is the initial number of moles of oxygen inside the bubble n o 2 t is the number of moles of oxygen inside the bubble at time t k h i is a function of temperature and can be calculated using the following equations yasui et al 2016 17 ln k h n 2 10 9 58 190472 86 32129 t 100 24 79808 ln t 100 18 ln k h o 2 10 9 55 017904 83 91236 t 100 23 24323 ln t 100 where t is the temperature in kelvin the concentration of the dissolved gas species i in the surrounding ambient fluid c a i is calculated by eq 18 19 c a i 10 3 ρ l p 0 k h i m h 2 o r i where r i is the molar ratio of the gas species i in the air r n 2 0 79 r o 2 0 21 substituting eqs 12 19 into eq 11 the final form of the derivative of bubble radius can be obtained in eq 20 20 d r d t 3 r t r w i c a i c s i ρ l g u r 2 3 r p 0 3 r ρ l g z 4 σ where r is the universal gas constant 8 31 p a m 3 m o l k therefore the velocity trajectory and radius of the bubble at time t can be found from eqs 8 9 and 20 2 2 model calculations the proposed model was programmed and computed using matlab 2020a by inputting different parameters including water depth initial bubble radius gas type and liquid density the bubble motion data under different scenarios were obtained including the bubble radius change velocity and trajectory 2 2 1 calculation of basset force the basset force also called history force is a kind of viscous force which arises due to the lagging boundary layer development with changing relative velocity acceleration of bodies particles or bubbles moving through a fluid barrio perotti et al 2009 moreno casas and bombardelli 2016 in this study the size of the bubble changes as the bubble rises and the forces exerted on the bubble are not constant thus the bubble velocity is variable and the influence of the basset force should be considered the integral of the basset force in eq 6 is a singular integral and the integrand contains an unknown function to be solved this feature and the nonlinearity of the equation make the theoretical analysis of differential equations more difficult daitche 2013 because the integrand in the basset force expression has a singularity in the integration interval it belongs to the generalized integral according to the compound gradient formula the calculation format for constructing the basset force integral term is text s1 in supporting information shows the proof of eq 21 21 0 t d u d τ d τ t τ 1 2 h f 0 t 2 i 1 n 2 f i h t i h f t h h f t f t h h where h t n is the integration step length and its size is determined by the given calculation accuracy f i h d u d t t i h is the acceleration at time i h although the basset force has been converted to a cumulative form the model is still a hidden function containing the acceleration term which is difficult to solve analytically this study employs a fourth order runge kutta method moreno casas and bombardelli 2016 to compute the numerical solution of the model as a single step method the fourth order runge kutta has a high calculation accuracy however each step of this method requires calculation of four slopes of each differential equation which requires a significant amount of computation thus the multistep fourth order predictor corrector adams bashforth moulton method chang and yen 1998 was used as an alternative during the middle period of the calculation to ensure the accuracy of the differential equation and reduce the calculation time numerical iteration and concrete computational process are discussed in text s2 2 2 2 calculation of the threshold of bubble radius the tendency of bubble expansion or shrinkage is determined by eq 20 eq 20 can be rewritten as the sum of eqs 22 and 23 22 f c 3 r t r w i π c a i c s i 3 r p 0 3 r ρ l g z 4 σ 23 g r ρ l g u r 2 3 r p 0 3 r ρ l g z 4 σ where eq 22 indicates the influence of gas dissolution and eq 23 indicates the influence of bubble velocity f c is negative because the concentration of dissolved gas in the bubble skin is more than that in the surrounding ambient fluid while g r is positive in other words f c causes the bubble to shrink while g r leads the bubble to expand if f c g r the bubble will shrink otherwise the bubble will swell and burst at the water surface however not all shrinking bubbles can collapse exactly at the water surface the residence time of a bubble in water is controlled by two factors one is the time that it takes for the bubble to move to the water surface t m and the other is the time required for the radius to change to zero t s the former is influenced by eq 8 while the latter is impacted by eq 20 when a bubble precisely collapses at the water surface the time from eq 8 should equal the time gained from eq 20 in other words a bubble with the initial radius of r c would collapse while just rising to the water surface if the initial radius is less than this threshold the bubble will collapse under the water surface and potentially generate free radicals whereas when the initial radius is more than the threshold the bubble may still shrink but burst at the water surface this threshold can thus be solved using an iterative method based on the comparison between t m and t s 2 3 model validation and optimum bubble size calculation the bubble motion in the gas liquid system has been explored extensively at lab scale duineveld 1995 parkinson et al 2008 azevedo et al 2016 pawliszak et al 2019 tanaka et al 2020 therefore existing experimental data were collected to validate the proposed model the results of the model were compared with available experimental data from these previous studies including the terminal velocity bubble size and trajectory of bubbles with different initial radii 10 530 µm see section 3 4 after validation the model was applied to analyse the bubble dynamics mass transfer and determine the threshold of bubble radius for mnb considering various factors i e initial bubble radius water depth and filled gas the range of initial bubble radius was from 0 to 1 mm the range of water depth was from 0 5 to 10 m and two bubble types air bubble and oxygen bubble were considered in the model the liquid phase was pure water 3 results and discussion 3 1 force balance and bubble motion in water the five forces i e f b f g f d f b f a and the bubble motion characteristics were calculated from eqs 2 to 8 and presented in fig 2 during the rising process the gravitational force was two orders of magnitude lower than the other forces and thus can be neglected while the buoyancy force was nearly constant for both bubble sizes 20 and 200 μm at the selected water depth of 0 5 m the virtual mass force was proportional to the bubble acceleration d u d t and so its maximum value was at the beginning of the motion and declined to zero as the d u d t 0 the drag force reached its final value as a result of the increased velocity the basset force initially increased and then decreased to zero as the d u d t 0 during the first moments of the bubble motion the drag force was small due to the low velocity where the virtual mass force and the basset force act against the buoyancy force when the bubble reaches terminal velocity the virtual mass vanishes and the basset force remains constant at less than 1 of the buoyancy force at this moment the buoyancy force mainly overcomes the drag force and they collectively dominate the bubble movement for the larger bubble 200 μm all forces are three orders of magnitude higher than that of the smaller bubble 20 μm thus the net force exerted on the larger bubble is greater and the larger bubble moves upwards with a higher velocity moreover the time required to reach the final velocity 15 20 ms far exceeds the time 1 ms required by a smaller bubble 20 μm the overall changes of bubble motion on a larger time scale are shown in fig s1 both the velocities of the 20 μm and the 200 μm bubble initially increase sharply until an inflection point is reached quick acceleration phase then the velocity of the 20 μm bubble decreases quite slowly slow change phase while that of 200 μm bubble continuously increases until it bursts on the water surface 3 2 the dynamics of bubble radius gas dissolution and inner pressure whether the bubble expands or shrinks during the rising process depends on the values of functions described by eqs 22 and 23 the bubble sizes of 20 and 200 μm at a water depth of 0 5 m were selected to present the modelling results for the bubble with the initial radius of 20 μm it shrinks and totally collapses in water after 54 s fig 3 a the absolute value of f c is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than g r indicating that gas dissolution has a greater impact on bubble radius fig 3b according to eq 23 g r is proportional to r 2 and thus is more sensitive to initial radius compared to f c when the initial radius increases from 20 to 200 μm the value of g r increases by three orders of magnitude whereas f c maintains the same order of magnitude fig 3e in this case the g r dominates causing the bubble to expand these results infer that the gas dissolution results in radius reduction for small bubbles while a large initial radius triggers bubble swelling the dissolution of n2 and o2 plays an essential role in radius variation during the bubble rising process in the present model the mass transfer coefficient w i is a function of viscosity gas molecular diffusivity and gas density the w i of each gas species were calculated according to eq 14 with values of 1 02 10 4 m s for n2 and 1 22 10 4 m s for o2 o2 has higher solubility than n2 and hence dissolved into the water faster for a small bubble with an initial radius of 20 μm the molar ratio of n2 inside the bubble almost remains constant in the early stage about 0 79 and then increases sharply at the final stage about 0 90 at t 53 s while the ratio of o2 decreases from 0 21 to 0 10 fig 3c this result was consistent with previous research for example yasui et al 2016 suggested that only nitrogen molecules are present in the shrinking bubble in the final few nanoseconds the bubble size changed along its rising path in response to both the mass transfer and the local hydrostatic pressure the rate of change in the bubble radius was constant to begin with 0 246 μm s but increased rapidly to 0 728 μm s by the end fig 3b with decreasing bubble size the pressure inside the bubble increases thus the partial pressure of the dissolved gas component the driving force for dissolution increases and the gas dissolves easily the results also indicate that the collapse of these shrinking bubbles creates a localised point which has an extremely high pressure fig 3c the inner pressure increased from 101 33 to 250 kpa in 55 s and then entered a sharp rising phase as a consequence ambient water molecules may be decomposed by shock wave emission to form reactive hydroxyl radicals agarwal et al 2011 tsuchida et al 2022 this is of significance in the field of water and wastewater treatment as radicals with a high oxidising power are desired in decontamination or sterilization for a larger bubble with an initial radius of 200 μm it rises in water rapidly and expands with decreasing pressure by this time the molar ratios of n2 and o2 inside the bubble have changed slightly less than 1 fig 3f this is because the inner pressure and c s i of a big bubble is lower than that of a smaller bubble in particular the inner pressure of a small bubble is extremely high at the final stage due to the bubble shrinking while it is close to atmospheric pressure for the expanded big bubble consequently the gas diffusion at the gas liquid interface for a big bubble was quite slow and the molar ratio or concentration of both gas species inside the bubble have only changed slightly 3 3 uncertainties in the performance of nanobubbles the results show that small bubbles are prone to shrink and disappear in water due to the gas dissolution driven by the pressure difference fig 3 the high internal pressure and thermodynamic instability of ultrafine bubbles has been shown in many previous studies ohgaki et al 2010 lee et al 2021 xue et al 2022 nevertheless the longevity of nanobubbles has also been reported in various experimental observations and their life has been reported to be from days to months nirmalkar et al 2018 jadhav et al 2021 this stability has been attributed to several possible mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion ion shielding organic coatings particle armouring local oversaturation and high internal density alheshibri et al 2021 soyluoglu et al 2021 sun et al 2022 however each mechanism can only explain part of the phenomena observed and may be inconsistent with many other phenomena the dynamics of bulk nanobubbles thus remains partly unknown because of the limited development of detection tools for measuring these bubbles and the relevant theory for bubble properties at the nanoscale in the present study the modelling results showed that a bubble with an initial radius of 20 μm shrank to become a 1 μm bubble after 53 07 s by this time more than 99 90 of oxygen had dissolved from the bubble and its rising velocity was quite slow less than 3 μm per second the time for the complete dissolution of oxygen from the 20 μm bubble fig 3a was 53 61 s these results were in line with previous numerical simulations showing that the radius of any bubble passes the nanoscale during the complete dissolution of the bubble yasui et al 2016 xue et al 2022 though our result does not match the reported long lifetime of bulk nanobubbles the model prediction is mainly intended to unravel the aeration and dissolution behaviour of mnbs in the middle and early period of aeration this is particularly relevant given that the initial bubble radius in engineering applications is usually in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometres the period of bubble shrinkage during the last tens or hundreds of microseconds has neither been proven or explained quantitatively and thus remains a problem in our understanding of bulk nanobubble behaviour yasui et al 2018a sun et al 2022 3 4 model validation the proposed model was verified using experimental data from previous studies table 1 in these previous works a single air bubble was usually created in distilled water and the bubble behaviour was recorded by a high speed camera to measure the rising velocity and radius of the bubble all such experiments have been carried out at constant temperature conditions the predictions from the model presented here were compared with the experimental data using the same reported conditions the terminal velocity bubble size and trajectory of bubbles with different initial radii were compared the comparisons between the predicted results from our model and the experimental measurements are shown in fig 4 all theoretical predictions were very close to the experimental data r2 0 85 it can be seen that the model was validated over a wide range of bubble parameters i e the initial radius ranges from 10 to 530 μm and hence it can provide a good prediction of bubble size trajectory and rising velocity for many different conditions there was a small discrepancy for large bubbles with an initial radius over 500 μm fig 4b the overestimation can be attributed to the uncertainty in the bubble shape i e deformation since the experimental bubble size was calculated using a bubble contour method in this study duineveld 1995 and consequently this influences the drag coefficient notably due to the lack of experimental data available for nanobubbles and the unsolved mechanisms section 3 3 the modelling results for nanoscale bubbles requires further validation in addition most of these validations focus on the characteristics of the bubble motion at present there is insufficient direct empirical evidence to validate the gas transfer model predictions i e gas concentration inner pressure although the change of bubble radius during rising process provides indirect evidence the direct monitoring of these characteristics and corresponding model verification needs to form further studies 3 5 determination of the threshold of bubble radius based upon the above analysis we know that the change in bubble radius d r d t depends on the balance between negative f c and positive g r forces which are influenced by the initial bubble size the external pressure water depth and the encapsulated gas type fig 5 a d shows the modelling results of the size changes along the rising path for air bubbles with different initial radii 20 400 μm at specific initial water depths 0 5 10 m it clearly shows that there exists a critical bubble radius for each scenario below which the bubble will shrink and above which the bubble will grow the critical bubble radiuses are around 20 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200 μm when it rises from water depths of 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 m respectively that is because greater initial water depth leads to a more negative f c and a less positive g r which makes the bubble contract more intensively for example the f c for a 200 μm bubble at 10 m water depth was about 4 82 times that at 1 m water depth while the g r for the former was only half of that for the latter fig 6 a in other words for a given bubble it may swell in shallow water but contract in deep water for example when a bubble with a radius of 127 μm rises from different water depths we can see that at 0 5 m water depth it will grow quickly in 15 5 s grow slowly at 1 0 m in 30 9 s shrink slowly at 3 0 m in 103 1 s precisely collapse at the water surface at 5 m in 369 1 s and shrink quickly at 10 0 m in 194 0 s fig 6b greater initial water depth thus drives the potential for high bubble shrinkage and then raises the threshold of the critical bubble radius the oxygen utilization coefficient j o 2 for bubbles with different initial radii 1 1000 μm at different initial water depths 0 5 10 m was modelled from eqs 13 and 16 fig 6c and d for a specific water depth while the bubble radius was smaller than a certain threshold the coefficient j o 2 always equals 100 for example the inflection point threshold of the curve in fig 6c was 194 μm for an initial water depth of 10 m a coefficient value of 100 means that the bubble has collapsed underwater and all of the encapsulated gas inside the bubble has thoroughly dissolved in water achieving a complete phase transfer as the bubble size becomes greater than the threshold the j o 2 decreases with increasing radius and the greater the initial water depth the higher the j o 2 becomes for a given specific bubble size the above results demonstrate the radius variation tendency of the rising bubble however the exact threshold of the bubble radius for each scenario has not yet been obtained a bubble that shrinks and precisely collapses at or just below the water surface t m t s is the desired mnb in the present study based on the criteria the thresholds of bubble radius for two gas species o2 and n2 were determined fig 7 a for air bubbles the thresholds were 42 54 96 127 157 and 194 μm for initial water depths of 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 m respectively for oxygen bubbles the equivalent thresholds were 127 164 254 350 405 and 470 μm the latter was about 58 72 67 07 higher than the former because the relatively higher solubility of o2 shortened the t s compared with n2 for a water depth of 1 m an air bubble with a radius of 54 μm will shrink and precisely collapse at the water surface in 253 2 s however an oxygen bubble under the same condition will totally dissolve under water within 13 1 s and finally collapse at a water depth of 0 96 m this collapse depth increases with increasing initial bubble size while the residence shrinkage time also displays a synchronously increasing tendency the threshold for an oxygen bubble radius for the same water depth 1 m was as high as 164 μm therefore the more soluble the gas species the larger the critical bubble radius will be 3 6 bubble size selection and further implications artificial bubbles are usually formed by dispersing the gas phase into the liquid phase in many different fields such as water and wastewater treatment waste gas capture biomass energy production froth flotation and stripping lyu et al 2019 fan et al 2021 liu et al 2021 mass transfer and reaction at the two phase interface are heavily dependant on the bubble size there are always two main obstacles in these systems firstly large bubbles can quickly rise to the surface and escape from the bulk solution so gas transfer to the liquid is limited and the interfacial reaction is incomplete levitsky et al 2022 secondly while many studies have paid close attention to the generation of mnbs due to their fascinating characteristics fan et al 2021 john et al 2022b the generation of these mnbs is usually associated with high energy consumption zimmerman et al 2011 therefore generation of coarse bubbles or the excessive pursuit of going to smaller bubble scales is not an economic path however there is reason to believe that many bubbling systems are not optimally designed and operated in order to obtain the desired bubble size as has been demonstrated in the present study the desired bubble size is case dependant which needs to account for the water depth and gas species an optimal strategy should be adopted whereby bubble contactors are designed such that they generate bubbles that have a slightly smaller diameter than the critical threshold size in the present study we shed light on the hypothesis that the size of desired mnb for aeration can be determined by dimensional characteristics and bubble dynamics in a liquid medium we propose the radius thresholds of mnbs for specific water depths and we expect that this will be a reference for bubbling system design and provide a framework for defining appropriate mnb characteristics however despite a number of recent studies bulk mnb particularly the nanobubble is still an emerging field of study and speculation remains prevalent about their existence stability and mobility aspects such as the operation of the aeration system for obtaining the desired bubble size and the energy spent on generating the targeted bubbles still need to be evaluated the optimum bubble size is also about the trade off between additional energy costs of the smaller bubble compared to additional mass transfer in addition both the conceptual and numerical models presented in this study have been simplified to improve their computability and practicability based upon a series of assumptions the single bubble dynamics presented in this study may be not feasible for bubbles clusters or clouds that are typically seen in many operational practices the gas transfer on bubble surfaces in sewage is also different from that in pure water because the dissolved gas in sewage comprises a mixture of gases including nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide etc given the complexity of bubble motion in real water bodies or other liquid mediums further study on the impacts of real environmental conditions on the bubble radius thresholds is needed the mnb dynamics may be influenced by coexisting dissolved organic matter suspended particles solid impurity biomass surfactant bubble bubble interactions gas supersaturation and gas stripping in the surrounding liquid and the electrokinetic characterization of these substances these substances may alter the bubble stability motion and mass transfer through several possible mechanisms i e ion shielding and organic coatings therefore the current model may be more suitable for clean water systems such as drinking water treatment further mathematic studies and experimental validations are needed to expand the findings to more practical scenarios it is possible that the radius thresholds of mnbs in these cases would be different nevertheless they are not discussed here since it would require more targeted research of its own 4 conclusions the present study developed a model with revealed mechanisms for identifying the optimum bubble size for mnb aeration through effective gas transfer and potential free radical generation we proposed a smart bubbling strategy herein by generating bubbles with an optimum size only bubbles with a radius smaller than the threshold value can collapse below the water surface and fulfil the purpose of the best mnb aeration these targeted mnbs will thoroughly dissolve in water to achieve complete gas transfer and potentially generate free radicals following bubble collapse to purify the surrounding water a numerical model was successfully developed to describe the bubble motion and mass transfer during the rising process the critical thresholds were 54 μm and 194 μm for air bubbles at initial water depths of 1 0 m and 10 0 m respectively the two corresponding thresholds for oxygen bubbles were 164 μm and 470 μm greater initial water depth and soluble gas species drove the high shrinkage potential of bubbles such that the bubbles were more liable to contract overall this study opens up a new prospect on the definition of mnb and provides useful guidance for bubbling system design to realize precise aeration using optimal bubble size credit authorship contribution statement wei fan methodology investigation writing original draft yuhang li methodology investigation tao lyu writing

15282,bubble aeration has been widely applied in water wastewater treatment however its low gas utilization rate results in high energy consumption application of micro nanobubbles mnb has emerged as a process with the potential to significantly increase gas utilisation due to their high relative surface area and high gas liquid mass transfer efficiency in this study we demonstrate through calibrated models that mnb of an optimum bubble size can shrink and burst at or below the water surface enabling 1 all encapsulated gas to thoroughly dissolve in water and 2 the bursting of nanobubbles to potentially generate free radicals through the understanding of mnb dimensional characteristics and bubble behaviour in water a dynamic model that integrated force balance i e buoyancy force gravity drag force basset force and virtual mass force and mass transfer was developed to describe the rising velocity and radius variation of mnb along its upward trajectory unlike for conventional millimetre sized bubbles intensive gas dissolution of mnbs led to radius reduction for small bubbles while a large initial radius triggers bubble swelling the initial water depth was also crucial where greater depth could drive the potential for bubble shrinkage so that they were more liable to contract for example the optimum bubble size of air 42 194 μm and oxygen 127 470 μm mnb that could achieve complete gas transfer 100 gas utilisation for a range of specific water depths 0 5 10 m were calculated the modelling results for microbubbles 10 530 μm were well validated by the experimental data r2 0 85 however the validation of the modelling results for nanobubble 1 μm aeration requires further study due to a lack of available empirical data in this study the proposed model and analysis provided new insights into understanding bubble dynamics in water and offered fundamental guidance for practitioners looking to upgrade bubble aeration system graphical abstract image

widely applied in many areas for water and wastewater treatment energy production aquaculture and chemical engineering fan et al 2021 courtney et al 2021 aeration using conventional millimetre sized bubbles provides effective mixing but has limited oxygen transfer efficiency 6 10 for example in activated sludge treatment plants zhang et al 2020 bubble size can significantly affect the gas liquid mass transfer where small bubbles are more efficient due to the increased gas liquid contact area and extended bubble residence time in solution therefore micro nanobubble mnb technology with a reported oxygen transfer efficiency of 30 100 muroyama et al 2013 abadie et al 2022 has recently been developed and utilised in biological chemical and environmental applications azevedo et al 2016 temesgen et al 2017 during conventional bubble aeration large bubbles in the water will rise swell and collapse at the water surface which results in low gas liquid transfer efficiency on the contrary mnbs may shrink and burst at or below the water surface due to the lower buoyancy and higher gas transfer rate however the basic definition categorisation of mnbs remains inconsistent takahashi et al 2007 and terasaka et al 2011 classified microbubbles or fine bubbles as tiny bubbles with sizes in the range of 10 50 or 10 60 μm respectively agarwal et al 2011 categorized bubbles under the size of 200 nm as nanobubbles seddon et al 2012 reported that bulk nanobubbles were observed in solution with typical radii of curvature of 50 100 nm zimmerman et al 2011 defined nanobubbles as bubbles having sizes in the range of 1 nm to 1 μm in 2017 the published standard of iso 20 480 1 2017 defined a fine bubble microbubble as a bubble with a volume equivalent diameter of less than 100 μm and an ultrafine bubble nanobubble as a bubble with a diameter of less than 1 μm iso tc 281 2017 in many cases researchers lumped the microbubbles and nanobubbles together and called them micro nano bubbles without strict partition in terms of real implementation practitioners need clear guidance in choosing the specific size of mnb for aeration the application of bubbles with the optimum size can also avoid energy waste caused by the excessive pursuit of the production of ultrafine bubbles besides having a mall size and large specific surface area mnbs have other interesting properties such as a negatively charged surface and the potential to generate free radicals for pollutant removal during bubble collapse takahashi et al 2007 therefore mnbs have also been used to remediate hydrocarbon contaminated soil agarwal et al 2016 reduce surface membranes fouling ghadimkhani et al 2016 and remove micropollutants in wastewater li et al 2009 however the importance of free radical generation from the collapse of micro nanobubbles has been questioned for the range of bubble sizes 1 100 µm typically seen for most microbubble generators john et al 2022a for smaller bubbles in the low nm size range 200 nm some studies have either directly monitored or indirectly demonstrated the radical formation from bubble collapse through experimental investigations tang et al 2021 takahashi et al 2007 proposed a theory based on the accumulation of ions to explain radical generation from collapsing microbubbles the shrinking of the bubble leads to an accumulation of ions near the bubble water interface resulting in a rapid increase in the absolute value of the surface charge measured by the ζ potential takahashi 2005 subsequently the drastic environmental change caused by the extinction of the gas water interface triggers radical generation from the dispersion of the elevated chemical potential that has accumulated around the interface takahashi et al 2012 yasui et al 2018b claimed that the temperature and pressure inside a bubble increased to about 3000 k and 1 5 gpa respectively at the final moment of bubble dissolution due to the quasi adiabatic compression these extreme conditions thus lead to another possible mechanistic route for hydroxyl radical generation therefore delivering an appropriately sized bubble that can shrink at or below the water surface can not only achieve complete gas utilisation during aeration but also generate activated oxidizers to boost the treatment to obtain the perfect bubble size for aeration it is important to understand the dynamics of the bubble rising in water including the rising velocity and diameter change stoke s law davies and taylor s equation or hadmard rybczynski s equation are the most commonly used models to estimate the terminal velocity of a single spherical bubble at low reynolds number parkinson et al 2008 parmar et al 2015 liu et al 2016 these readily applied analytic formulas were developed to establish the relationship between the specific diameter of the bubble and the terminal velocity in ideal conditions uniform motion thus they do not describe dynamic changes in bubble properties the epstein plesset theory plesset and satwindar 1982 and models proposed by yasui et al 2018b and xue et al 2022 describe the gas diffusion heat transfer and energy transformation over time for a dissolving bubble however these models do not consider the bubble rising in the liquid because their focus is on the bubble dynamics during the final dissolution stage when the rising velocity of a bubble with a diameter in the tens of nanometre range could be ignored hirai et al 2015 also proposed a theoretical equation for the change of microbubble diameter but it was assumed that the change rate was constant during the rising process which disagreed with the conventional view that the rate of bubble shrinkage increases as bubbles rise yasui et al 2016 therefore the development of the theory and an integrated dynamic model are urgently needed to determine the threshold diameter for the most effective mnb aeration the study aims to develop and investigate a numerical model that can identify the optimum bubble size for mnb aeration to achieve complete gas transfer and free radicals generation we claim that only a bubble with a radius smaller than the threshold value can collapse below the water surface and achieve the best mnb aeration fig 1 a the model considered force balances buoyancy force gravity drag force basset force and virtual mass force and the mass transfer of a gas bubble rising in water additionally the experimental data from the literature were collected to validate the model finally the optimum bubble size of air and oxygen mnb at certain water depths 0 5 10 m was calculated the proposed model and results aim to provide a new insight to understand bubble dynamics in water and provide fundamental guidance for practitioners for upgrading of bubble aeration systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 model descriptions the model framework is shown in fig 1 which considers a single isolated gas bubble in water there are five forces fig 1b that act on the bubble kulkarni and joshi 2005 muhlbauer et al 2019 the buoyancy f b is an upward force while the gravity f g drag f d basset f b and virtual mass also called added mass f a are the downward forces interactions between these forces are determined by gas density ρ g surface tension σ viscosity μ and the initial bubble size producing various effects on the rising trajectories and radius r the variations of the inertial and viscous energy dissipation were considered to quantify the drag force the bubble size and velocity at a specific time during the rising process were calculated as a function of bubble size gas type and water depth at a specific flow regime the radius of the bubble that will shrink and precisely collapse at the water surface was determined as the corresponding threshold value to simplify the bubble rising process all analyses have been implemented based on the following commonly used assumptions kulkarni and joshi 2005 yasui et al 2016 xue et al 2022 1 the bubble remains spherical during the rising process 2 the surrounding water is static and the concentrations of gas species in ambient water are constant 3 the temperature inside the bubble remains stable most of the time and only increases to about 3000 k at the final moment in several picoseconds of collapse 4 the gas inside the bubble is ideal 5 the initial rising velocity equals zero at time t 0 s 2 1 1 description of the bubble rising and trajectory according to newton s second law the balance of forces can be presented as eq 1 1 m g d u d t f g f b f d f a f b where m g is the mass of the gas bubble u is the rising velocity of the bubble at a time t all these forces are given as follows kulkarni and joshi 2005 moreno casas and bombardelli 2016 muhlbauer et al 2019 2 f g 4 π 3 r 3 ρ

chuang and hibiki 2017 c d is a drag coefficient that is related to the reynolds number re 2 u r μ and eotvos number e o 4 r 2 g ρ l ρ g σ where μ is the viscosity of liquid and σ is the surface

d z d t u where z is water depth the distance from the bubble centre to the water surface 2 1 2 description of the variation of bubble size while a bubble rises in a liquid the gas in the bubble keeps dissolving during this process the bubble size radius is a function of the inner pressure the liquid pressure depth under the water surface the surface tension and the gas diffusion at the gas liquid interface considering that the gas in the bubble is an ideal gas the ideal gas state equation is applicable as follows 10 v d p d t p d v d t p v n d n d t the time derivative of the bubble radius can then be expressed in eq 11 11 d r d t r 3 1 n d n d t 1 p d p d t where v is the volume of the bubble n is the total number of moles of gas inside the bubble p is the internal pressure of the bubble and can be described by the young laplace equation p p 0 ρ l g z 2 σ r where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure therefore the variation of p can be calculated as follows 12 d p d t ρ l g u 2 σ r 2 d r d t for an individual bubble the gas diffusion at the gas liquid interface can be described in eq 13 13 d n i d t 4 π r 2 w i c a i c s i where n i is the number of moles inside a bubble for the gas species i i e nitrogen and oxygen in the air w i is the mass transfer coefficient at the bubble surface for the gas species i c a i is the concentration of the dissolved gas species i in the surrounding fluid c s i is the concentration of the dissolved gas species i on the bubble skin the interfacial mass transfer coefficient w i is considered to depend on the gas to liquid diffusivity density viscosity as well as how the transfer of gas from the bubble takes place miner et al 1986 accordingly the mass transfer coefficients w i are given by miner et al 1986 14 w i 2 d i u 2 π r r 0 15 cm 7 53 r 84 17 d i 0 03 r 0 15 cm 0 31 μ g ρ l 1 3 μ ρ l d i 2 3 r 0 03 cm where d i is the molecular diffusivity of the gas species i d n 2 1 90 10 9 m 2 s d o 2 2 50 10 9 m 2 s the concentration of the dissolved gas species i on the bubble skin c s i is calculated by henry s law constant yasui et al 2016 15 c s i 10 3 ρ l r s i p k h i m h 2 o where k h i is henry s law constant of the gas

the gas species i and n t is the total number of moles inside a bubble n t n o 2 n n 2 thus during the bubble rising process the oxygen utilization coefficient j o 2 can be calculated from the following equation 16 j o 2 n o 2 0 n o 2 t n o 2 0 where n o 2 0 is the initial number of moles of oxygen inside the bubble n o 2 t is the number of moles of oxygen inside the bubble at time t k h i is a function of temperature and can be calculated using the following equations yasui et al 2016 17 ln k h n 2 10 9 58 190472 86 32129 t 100 24 79808 ln t 100 18 ln k h o 2 10 9 55 017904 83 91236 t 100 23 24323 ln t 100 where t is the temperature in kelvin the concentration of the dissolved gas species i in the surrounding ambient fluid c a i is calculated by eq 18 19 c a i 10 3 ρ l p 0 k h i m h 2 o r i where r i is the molar ratio of the gas species i in the air r n 2 0 79 r o 2 0 21 substituting eqs 12 19 into eq 11 the final form of the derivative of bubble radius can be obtained in eq 20 20 d r d t 3 r t r w i c a i c s i ρ l g u r 2 3 r p 0 3 r ρ l g z 4 σ where r is the universal gas constant 8 31 p a m 3 m o l k therefore the velocity trajectory and radius of the bubble at time t can be found from eqs 8 9 and 20 2 2 model calculations the proposed model was programmed and computed using matlab 2020a by inputting different parameters including water depth initial bubble radius gas type and liquid density the bubble motion data under different scenarios were obtained including the bubble radius change velocity and trajectory 2 2 1 calculation of basset force the basset force also called history force is a kind of viscous force which arises due to the lagging boundary layer development with changing relative velocity acceleration of bodies particles or bubbles moving through a fluid barrio perotti et al 2009 moreno casas and bombardelli 2016 in this study the size of the bubble changes as the bubble rises and the forces exerted on the bubble are not constant thus the bubble velocity is variable and the influence of the basset force should be considered the integral of the basset force in eq 6 is a singular integral and the integrand contains an unknown function to be solved this feature and the nonlinearity of the equation make the theoretical analysis of differential equations more difficult daitche 2013 because the integrand in the basset force expression has a singularity in the integration interval it belongs to the generalized integral according to the compound gradient formula the calculation format for constructing the basset force integral term is text s1 in supporting information shows the proof of eq 21 21 0 t d u d τ d τ t τ 1 2 h f 0 t 2 i 1 n 2 f i h t i h f t h h f t f t h h where h t n is the integration step length and its size is determined by the given calculation accuracy f i h d u d t t i h is the acceleration at time i h although the basset force has been converted to a cumulative form the model is still a hidden function containing the acceleration term which is difficult to solve analytically this study employs a fourth order runge kutta method moreno casas and bombardelli 2016 to compute the numerical solution of the model as a single step method the fourth order runge kutta has a high calculation accuracy however each step of this method requires calculation of four slopes of each differential equation which requires a significant amount of computation thus the multistep fourth order predictor corrector adams bashforth moulton method chang and yen 1998 was used as an alternative during the middle period of the calculation to ensure the accuracy of the differential equation and reduce the calculation time numerical iteration and concrete computational process are discussed in text s2 2 2 2 calculation of the threshold of bubble radius the tendency of bubble expansion or shrinkage is determined by eq 20 eq 20 can be rewritten as the sum of eqs 22 and 23 22 f c 3 r t r w i π c a i c s i 3 r p 0 3 r ρ l g z 4 σ 23 g r ρ l g u r 2 3 r p 0 3 r ρ l g z 4 σ where eq 22 indicates the influence of gas dissolution and eq 23 indicates the influence of bubble velocity f c is negative because the concentration of dissolved gas in the bubble skin is more than that in the surrounding ambient fluid while g r is positive in other words f c causes the bubble to shrink while g r leads the bubble to expand if f c g r the bubble will shrink otherwise the bubble will swell and burst at the water surface however not all shrinking bubbles can collapse exactly at the water surface the residence time of a bubble in water is controlled by two factors one is the time that it takes for the bubble to move to the water surface t m and the other is the time required for the radius to change to zero t s the former is influenced by eq 8 while the latter is impacted by eq 20 when a bubble precisely collapses at the water surface the time from eq 8 should equal the time gained from eq 20 in other words a bubble with the initial radius of r c would collapse while just rising to the water surface if the initial radius is less than this threshold the bubble will collapse under the water surface and potentially generate free radicals whereas when the initial radius is more than the threshold the bubble may still shrink but burst at the water surface this threshold can thus be solved using an iterative method based on the comparison between t m and t s 2 3 model validation and optimum bubble size calculation the bubble motion in the gas liquid system has been explored extensively at lab scale duineveld 1995 parkinson et al 2008 azevedo et al 2016 pawliszak et al 2019 tanaka et al 2020 therefore existing experimental data were collected to validate the proposed model the results of the model were compared with available experimental data from these previous studies including the terminal velocity bubble size and trajectory of bubbles with different initial radii 10 530 µm see section 3 4 after validation the model was applied to analyse the bubble dynamics mass transfer and determine the threshold of bubble radius for mnb considering various factors i e initial bubble radius water depth and filled gas the range of initial bubble radius was from 0 to 1 mm the range of water depth was from 0 5 to 10 m and two bubble types air bubble and oxygen bubble were considered in the model the liquid phase was pure water 3 results and discussion 3 1 force balance and bubble motion in water the five forces i e f b f g f d f b f a and the bubble motion characteristics were calculated from eqs 2 to 8 and presented in fig 2 during the rising process the gravitational force was two orders of magnitude lower than the other forces and thus can be neglected while the buoyancy force was nearly constant for both bubble sizes 20 and 200 μm at the selected water depth of 0 5 m the virtual mass force was proportional to the bubble acceleration d u d t and so its maximum value was at the beginning of the motion and declined to zero as the d u d t 0 the drag force reached its final value as a result of the increased velocity the basset force initially increased and then decreased to zero as the d u d t 0 during the first moments of the bubble motion the drag force was small due to the low velocity where the virtual mass force and the basset force act against the buoyancy force when the bubble reaches terminal velocity the virtual mass vanishes and the basset force remains constant at less than 1 of the buoyancy force at this moment the buoyancy force mainly overcomes the drag force and they collectively dominate the bubble movement for the larger bubble 200 μm all forces are three orders of magnitude higher than that of the smaller bubble 20 μm thus the net force exerted on the larger bubble is greater and the larger bubble moves upwards with a higher velocity moreover the time required to reach the final velocity 15 20 ms far exceeds the time 1 ms required by a smaller bubble 20 μm the overall changes of bubble motion on a larger time scale are shown in fig s1 both the velocities of the 20 μm and the 200 μm bubble initially increase sharply until an inflection point is reached quick acceleration phase then the velocity of the 20 μm bubble decreases quite slowly slow change phase while that of 200 μm bubble continuously increases until it bursts on the water surface 3 2 the dynamics of bubble radius gas dissolution and inner pressure whether the bubble expands or shrinks during the rising process depends on the values of functions described by eqs 22 and 23 the bubble sizes of 20 and 200 μm at a water depth of 0 5 m were selected to present the modelling results for the bubble with the initial radius of 20 μm it shrinks and totally collapses in water after 54 s fig 3 a the absolute value of f c is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than g r indicating that gas dissolution has a greater impact on bubble radius fig 3b according to eq 23 g r is proportional to r 2 and thus is more sensitive to initial radius compared to f c when the initial radius increases from 20 to 200 μm the value of g r increases by three orders of magnitude whereas f c maintains the same order of magnitude fig 3e in this case the g r dominates causing the bubble to expand these results infer that the gas dissolution results in radius reduction for small bubbles while a large initial radius triggers bubble swelling the dissolution of n2 and o2 plays an essential role in radius variation during the bubble rising process in the present model the mass transfer coefficient w i is a function of viscosity gas molecular diffusivity and gas density the w i of each gas species were calculated according to eq 14 with values of 1 02 10 4 m s for n2 and 1 22 10 4 m s for o2 o2 has higher solubility than n2 and hence dissolved into the water faster for a small bubble with an initial radius of 20 μm the molar ratio of n2 inside the bubble almost remains constant in the early stage about 0 79 and then increases sharply at the final stage about 0 90 at t 53 s while the ratio of o2 decreases from 0 21 to 0 10 fig 3c this result was consistent with previous research for example yasui et al 2016 suggested that only nitrogen molecules are present in the shrinking bubble in the final few nanoseconds the bubble size changed along its rising path in response to both the mass transfer and the local hydrostatic pressure the rate of change in the bubble radius was constant to begin with 0 246 μm s but increased rapidly to 0 728 μm s by the end fig 3b with decreasing bubble size the pressure inside the bubble increases thus the partial pressure of the dissolved gas component the driving force for dissolution increases and the gas dissolves easily the results also indicate that the collapse of these shrinking bubbles creates a localised point which has an extremely high pressure fig 3c the inner pressure increased from 101 33 to 250 kpa in 55 s and then entered a sharp rising phase as a consequence ambient water molecules may be decomposed by shock wave emission to form reactive hydroxyl radicals agarwal et al 2011 tsuchida et al 2022 this is of significance in the field of water and wastewater treatment as radicals with a high oxidising power are desired in decontamination or sterilization for a larger bubble with an initial radius of 200 μm it rises in water rapidly and expands with decreasing pressure by this time the molar ratios of n2 and o2 inside the bubble have changed slightly less than 1 fig 3f this is because the inner pressure and c s i of a big bubble is lower than that of a smaller bubble in particular the inner pressure of a small bubble is extremely high at the final stage due to the bubble shrinking while it is close to atmospheric pressure for the expanded big bubble consequently the gas diffusion at the gas liquid interface for a big bubble was quite slow and the molar ratio or concentration of both gas species inside the bubble have only changed slightly 3 3 uncertainties in the performance of nanobubbles the results show that small bubbles are prone to shrink and disappear in water due to the gas dissolution driven by the pressure difference fig 3 the high internal pressure and thermodynamic instability of ultrafine bubbles has been shown in many previous studies ohgaki et al 2010 lee et al 2021 xue et al 2022 nevertheless the longevity of nanobubbles has also been reported in various experimental observations and their life has been reported to be from days to months nirmalkar et al 2018 jadhav et al 2021 this stability has been attributed to several possible mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion ion shielding organic coatings particle armouring local oversaturation and high internal density alheshibri et al 2021 soyluoglu et al 2021 sun et al 2022 however each mechanism can only explain part of the phenomena observed and may be inconsistent with many other phenomena the dynamics of bulk nanobubbles thus remains partly unknown because of the limited development of detection tools for measuring these bubbles and the relevant theory for bubble properties at the nanoscale in the present study the modelling results showed that a bubble with an initial radius of 20 μm shrank to become a 1 μm bubble after 53 07 s by this time more than 99 90 of oxygen had dissolved from the bubble and its rising velocity was quite slow less than 3 μm per second the time for the complete dissolution of oxygen from the 20 μm bubble fig 3a was 53 61 s these results were in line with previous numerical simulations showing that the radius of any bubble passes the nanoscale during the complete dissolution of the bubble yasui et al 2016 xue et al 2022 though our result does not match the reported long lifetime of bulk nanobubbles the model prediction is mainly intended to unravel the aeration and dissolution behaviour of mnbs in the middle and early period of aeration this is particularly relevant given that the initial bubble radius in engineering applications is usually in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometres the period of bubble shrinkage during the last tens or hundreds of microseconds has neither been proven or explained quantitatively and thus remains a problem in our understanding of bulk nanobubble behaviour yasui et al 2018a sun et al 2022 3 4 model validation the proposed model was verified using experimental data from previous studies table 1 in these previous works a single air bubble was usually created in distilled water and the bubble behaviour was recorded by a high speed camera to measure the rising velocity and radius of the bubble all such experiments have been carried out at constant temperature conditions the predictions from the model presented here were compared with the experimental data using the same reported conditions the terminal velocity bubble size and trajectory of bubbles with different initial radii were compared the comparisons between the predicted results from our model and the experimental measurements are shown in fig 4 all theoretical predictions were very close to the experimental data r2 0 85 it can be seen that the model was validated over a wide range of bubble parameters i e the initial radius ranges from 10 to 530 μm and hence it can provide a good prediction of bubble size trajectory and rising velocity for many different conditions there was a small discrepancy for large bubbles with an initial radius over 500 μm fig 4b the overestimation can be attributed to the uncertainty in the bubble shape i e deformation since the experimental bubble size was calculated using a bubble contour method in this study duineveld 1995 and consequently this influences the drag coefficient notably due to the lack of experimental data available for nanobubbles and the unsolved mechanisms section 3 3 the modelling results for nanoscale bubbles requires further validation in addition most of these validations focus on the characteristics of the bubble motion at present there is insufficient direct empirical evidence to validate the gas transfer model predictions i e gas concentration inner pressure although the change of bubble radius during rising process provides indirect evidence the direct monitoring of these characteristics and corresponding model verification needs to form further studies 3 5 determination of the threshold of bubble radius based upon the above analysis we know that the change in bubble radius d r d t depends on the balance between negative f c and positive g r forces which are influenced by the initial bubble size the external pressure water depth and the encapsulated gas type fig 5 a d shows the modelling results of the size changes along the rising path for air bubbles with different initial radii 20 400 μm at specific initial water depths 0 5 10 m it clearly shows that there exists a critical bubble radius for each scenario below which the bubble will shrink and above which the bubble will grow the critical bubble radiuses are around 20 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200 μm when it rises from water depths of 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 m respectively that is because greater initial water depth leads to a more negative f c and a less positive g r which makes the bubble contract more intensively for example the f c for a 200 μm bubble at 10 m water depth was about 4 82 times that at 1 m water depth while the g r for the former was only half of that for the latter fig 6 a in other words for a given bubble it may swell in shallow water but contract in deep water for example when a bubble with a radius of 127 μm rises from different water depths we can see that at 0 5 m water depth it will grow quickly in 15 5 s grow slowly at 1 0 m in 30 9 s shrink slowly at 3 0 m in 103 1 s precisely collapse at the water surface at 5 m in 369 1 s and shrink quickly at 10 0 m in 194 0 s fig 6b greater initial water depth thus drives the potential for high bubble shrinkage and then raises the threshold of the critical bubble radius the oxygen utilization coefficient j o 2 for bubbles with different initial radii 1 1000 μm at different initial water depths 0 5 10 m was modelled from eqs 13 and 16 fig 6c and d for a specific water depth while the bubble radius was smaller than a certain threshold the coefficient j o 2 always equals 100 for example the inflection point threshold of the curve in fig 6c was 194 μm for an initial water depth of 10 m a coefficient value of 100 means that the bubble has collapsed underwater and all of the encapsulated gas inside the bubble has thoroughly dissolved in water achieving a complete phase transfer as the bubble size becomes greater than the threshold the j o 2 decreases with increasing radius and the greater the initial water depth the higher the j o 2 becomes for a given specific bubble size the above results demonstrate the radius variation tendency of the rising bubble however the exact threshold of the bubble radius for each scenario has not yet been obtained a bubble that shrinks and precisely collapses at or just below the water surface t m t s is the desired mnb in the present study based on the criteria the thresholds of bubble radius for two gas species o2 and n2 were determined fig 7 a for air bubbles the thresholds were 42 54 96 127 157 and 194 μm for initial water depths of 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 m respectively for oxygen bubbles the equivalent thresholds were 127 164 254 350 405 and 470 μm the latter was about 58 72 67 07 higher than the former because the relatively higher solubility of o2 shortened the t s compared with n2 for a water depth of 1 m an air bubble with a radius of 54 μm will shrink and precisely collapse at the water surface in 253 2 s however an oxygen bubble under the same condition will totally dissolve under water within 13 1 s and finally collapse at a water depth of 0 96 m this collapse depth increases with increasing initial bubble size while the residence shrinkage time also displays a synchronously increasing tendency the threshold for an oxygen bubble radius for the same water depth 1 m was as high as 164 μm therefore the more soluble the gas species the larger the critical bubble radius will be 3 6 bubble size selection and further implications artificial bubbles are usually formed by dispersing the gas phase into the liquid phase in many different fields such as water and wastewater treatment waste gas capture biomass energy production froth flotation and stripping lyu et al 2019 fan et al 2021 liu et al 2021 mass transfer and reaction at the two phase interface are heavily dependant on the bubble size there are always two main obstacles in these systems firstly large bubbles can quickly rise to the surface and escape from the bulk solution so gas transfer to the liquid is limited and the interfacial reaction is incomplete levitsky et al 2022 secondly while many studies have paid close attention to the generation of mnbs due to their fascinating characteristics fan et al 2021 john et al 2022b the generation of these mnbs is usually associated with high energy consumption zimmerman et al 2011 therefore generation of coarse bubbles or the excessive pursuit of going to smaller bubble scales is not an economic path however there is reason to believe that many bubbling systems are not optimally designed and operated in order to obtain the desired bubble size as has been demonstrated in the present study the desired bubble size is case dependant which needs to account for the water depth and gas species an optimal strategy should be adopted whereby bubble contactors are designed such that they generate bubbles that have a slightly smaller diameter than the critical threshold size in the present study we shed light on the hypothesis that the size of desired mnb for aeration can be determined by dimensional characteristics and bubble dynamics in a liquid medium we propose the radius thresholds of mnbs for specific water depths and we expect that this will be a reference for bubbling system design and provide a framework for defining appropriate mnb characteristics however despite a number of recent studies bulk mnb particularly the nanobubble is still an emerging field of study and speculation remains prevalent about their existence stability and mobility aspects such as the operation of the aeration system for obtaining the desired bubble size and the energy spent on generating the targeted bubbles still need to be evaluated the optimum bubble size is also about the trade off between additional energy costs of the smaller bubble compared to additional mass transfer in addition both the conceptual and numerical models presented in this study have been simplified to improve their computability and practicability based upon a series of assumptions the single bubble dynamics presented in this study may be not feasible for bubbles clusters or clouds that are typically seen in many operational practices the gas transfer on bubble surfaces in sewage is also different from that in pure water because the dissolved gas in sewage comprises a mixture of gases including nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide etc given the complexity of bubble motion in real water bodies or other liquid mediums further study on the impacts of real environmental conditions on the bubble radius thresholds is needed the mnb dynamics may be influenced by coexisting dissolved organic matter suspended particles solid impurity biomass surfactant bubble bubble interactions gas supersaturation and gas stripping in the surrounding liquid and the electrokinetic characterization of these substances these substances may alter the bubble stability motion and mass transfer through several possible mechanisms i e ion shielding and organic coatings therefore the current model may be more suitable for clean water systems such as drinking water treatment further mathematic studies and experimental validations are needed to expand the findings to more practical scenarios it is possible that the radius thresholds of mnbs in these cases would be different nevertheless they are not discussed here since it would require more targeted research of its own 4 conclusions the present study developed a model with revealed mechanisms for identifying the optimum bubble size for mnb aeration through effective gas transfer and potential free radical generation we proposed a smart bubbling strategy herein by generating bubbles with an optimum size only bubbles with a radius smaller than the threshold value can collapse below the water surface and fulfil the purpose of the best mnb aeration these targeted mnbs will thoroughly dissolve in water to achieve complete gas transfer and potentially generate free radicals following bubble collapse to purify the surrounding water a numerical model was successfully developed to describe the bubble motion and mass transfer during the rising process the critical thresholds were 54 μm and 194 μm for air bubbles at initial water depths of 1 0 m and 10 0 m respectively the two corresponding thresholds for oxygen bubbles were 164 μm and 470 μm greater initial water depth and soluble gas species drove the high shrinkage potential of bubbles such that the bubbles were more liable to contract overall this study opens up a new prospect on the definition of mnb and provides useful guidance for bubbling system design to realize precise aeration using optimal bubble size credit authorship contribution statement wei fan methodology investigation writing original draft yuhang li methodology investigation tao lyu writing

15283,direct cultivation of aerobic granular sludge ags in membrane bioreactor mbr has gained increasing attention mycelial pellets mps has been shown capable of promoting rapid granulation of aerobic sludge in mbr yet mechanisms remain unclear and in depth insight into cross scale interactions between mps and indigenous microbiota as well as the corresponding protein expression functions is necessary herein we found that the addition of mps in mbr resulted in massive growth of metazoans with 40 400 ml for rotifers 20 140 ml for nematodes and 2 420 ml for oligochaetes in the initial phase of granulation this facilitated the mps to rapidly aggregate with bacteria to form defensive granules for physical protection from predation by metazoans which inhibited the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and promoted the reproduction of functional bacteria related to nitrogen removal nitrospira trichococcus and acinetobacter proteomic analysis demonstrated that the upregulation of functional proteins was mainly ascribed to the decrease of thiothrix and the increase of nitrospira resulting in the enhancement of metabolic pathways involved in glycolysis gluconeogenesis citrate tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate metabolism nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids which was responsible for mps induced ags with denser structure more abundant proteins and β polysaccharides higher species diversity significant nitrogen removal 33 12 42 33 and lower membrane fouling potential this study provided a novel and comprehensive insight into the enhanced granulation of aerobic sludge by mps and the functional superiority of mps induced ags in mbr system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mycelial pellets aerobic granular sludge metazoans microbial communities proteomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the integration of aerobic granular sludge ags and membrane bioreactor mbr i e ag mbr system is a promising technology for improved pollutants removal and mitigation of membrane fouling iorhemen et al 2019 sajjad et al 2016 concern has raised on direct cultivation of ags in mbr due to economic applicability and operational convenience compared with the pre cultured ags mode chen et al 2017 recently mycelial pellets mps are reported capable of serving as biomass carriers with densely packed form of fungal hyphae and high hydrophobicity to promote rapid granulation of aerobic sludge through enhancing the network structure and adhesion force of flocculent sludge in mbr system xiao et al 2022 additionally mycelium of mps could play the role of framework replacing part of extracellular polymeric substances eps that strengthens the internal structure of ags de graaff et al 2020 geng et al 2020 compared with conventional ags the mps induced ags is more advantageous in terms of short lag phase structural stability and decontamination performances geng et al 2021 this makes mps a promising manner for development of ag mbr technology han et al 2022 however the mechanisms for mps induced granulation remain unclear up to present we in previous study showed that the enhancement of aerobic sludge granulation might be the result of abundant pore structure and hydrophobicity of mps where the mps mainly served as bio carriers to provide a large habitat for microbial cells xiao et al 2021 however the living fungal organisms may play a role beyond the carriers and thus the species interaction between mps and indigenous microorganisms may exist to the best of our knowledge longer sludge retention time srt in activated sludge system is extremely conducive to reproduction of potential grazers of floc forming bacteria such as rotifers nematodes and oligochaetes pajdak stós et al 2010 these metazoans are natural consumers of biomass in the benthic layers of ecosystems tamis et al 2011 and usually feed on microbial residues bacterial cells and organic bioparticles li et al 2013b in addition they could convert the morphology of the biofilm from a compact and homogeneous construction into a loosely porous and heterogeneous structure resulting in a decline of thickness and density of basal layer klein et al 2016 prior studies found the spherically structured mps to be only maintained for 8 15 days in sbr or mbr geng et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 this phenomenon inspired the search for possible existence of complex relationships between mps and metazoans it is reasonable to assume that in addition to sensitivity of mps to ph and hydrodynamic condition espinosa ortiz et al 2016 wargenau and kwade 2010 metazoans may also exert impact to the survival or structure of mps in mbr system based on their predatory preference moreover some bacteria such as nitrifying bacteria were believed capable of sensing diffusible chemicals secreted by predators thereby they are physically protected from predation by forming microcolonies in activated sludge system ding et al 2017 pajdak stós et al 2010 similarly mps have been reported to enrich functional bacteria to form aggregates in activated sludge system geng et al 2021 however it is still an open question whether this behavior is associated with metazoans as such it would be of considerable interest to explore the interactions among mps metazoans and bacteria during enhanced sludge granulation in mbr despite synergistic interaction that may exist for mps induced ags in mbr system efforts made in earlier study only focused on macroscopic explanation to the structural composition xiao et al 2022 the molecular mechanisms and corresponding functional properties remain unclear metaproteomic technology offers a powerful tool to identify microbial functional proteins associated with metabolic and physiological activities in mixed microbial samples salerno et al 2019 and further elucidate macroscopic behaviors e g membrane fouling nitrate removal from the viewpoint of overall ecosystems zhang et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 for instance proteomics analysis can characterize the impact of functional composition of proteins in eps on the ags structure yang et al 2021 the extracellular protein constitutes an important component being responsible for maintaining integrity and stability of ags lv et al 2014 prior study revealed that the addition of mps had contribution to increasing the protein content in mbr system xiao et al 2022 but the effect on protein expression and metabolic properties of the community members were not understood well for a complex micro ecosystem changes in any factors can lead to different living status resistance capability and metabolic behaviors guo et al 2017 the moderate presence of fungal hyphae was described in relation to the stabilization of microbial cell aggregates in biological wastewater treatment maza márquez et al 2016 however the limited data were incapable of elucidating the interactions among the microbial communities proteins and metabolisms in the presence of mps this necessitates the metaproteomic analysis to provide in depth proteomic level insight into the relationship between microbiota functional status and protein expression for mps induced ags in mbr system this study focuses on mechanistic insight into enhanced granulation of aerobic sludge by mps in mbr system first we investigated the granules development and reactor performances followed by the characterization of ags second we analyzed the relationships among the mps metazoans and microbial communities to evaluate the role of mps in enhancing aerobic sludge granulation last we elucidated the functional superiority of mps induced ags from the perspective of protein expression and molecular metabolisms 2

two mbrs during an operational time of 170 days the mean size of granules in control mbr underwent a gradual increase from 0 085 mm to 0 28 mm during days 1 170 and only tiny granules with loose filamentous outer layer appeared fig 1b by contrast three phases of granule development were noticed in mps mbr from 0 085 mm day 1 to 0 22 mm day 40 then to 0 51 mm day 80 and finally to 0 74 mm day 120 particle size distribution analysis illustrated an obvious increase in fraction of granules in mps mbr during days 40 120 while the sludge system in mbr was always dominated by floc sludge with a diameter smaller than 0 2 mm fig s1a from day 120 on typical ags with hydrophobic outer layer of colloidal substances and rod shaped bacteria were prevalently observed in mps mbr fig 1b and the mean size of granules stabilized at the range of 0 68 0 76 mm fig 1a meanwhile mlss concentration in mps mbr was found to increased gradually to12 8 g l on day 170 much higher than that in mbr 9 8 g l fig s1b moreover mps mbr exhibited significant advantages in terms of cod reduction 97 0 99 1 and tn reduction 33 12 42 33 during days 121 170 compared with 96 4 98 6 and 14 14 20 42 in mbr table s3 with respect to membrane fouling fig s2 the tmp in mps mbr was observe to increase at a slightly faster fouling rate during the first 52 day operation compared with that in mbr whereas the tmp for both mbrs almost reached the critical values on day 62 32 0 kpa in mbr 29 5 kpa in mps mbr during days 63 121 an obviously lower tmp development rate in mps mbr was found with a longer average filtration cycle of 9 8 d while a rapid tmp increase in mbr was observed with an average filtration cycle of only 6 5 d as granulation proceeded the ags in mps mbr demonstrated significantly lower fouling potential with a more mildly increase from 3 0 kpa to 19 5 kpa on day 122 170 clsm analysis was performed to characterize the distribution of major eps and microbial cells on ags fig 1c for mps induced ags proteins were observed to distribute evenly throughout the granule with the most abundant content the α polysaccharides were located on the surface and inner layers of the granule while most β polysaccharides were found on the outer rim total microbial cells were observed to be mainly distributed on the surface but some of them were still contained within the granule the conventional ags followed the similar tendency of distribution i e mostly proteins followed by α polysaccharides and total microbial cells and finally β polysaccharides in comparison mps induced ags contained more abundant proteins β polysaccharides and microbial cells it was noticed that both protein and α polysaccharide were responsible for maintaining the integrity of ags while β polysaccharide was another factor in stabilizing the surface structure of ags and microbial cells played an essential role in retaining the granules viability chen et al 2017 3 2 relationship between mps and metazoans to investigate the relationship between mps and metazoans during granulation of aerobic sludge we detected the variations of three dominant metazoans including rotifers figs s3a c nematodes figs s3d f and oligochaetes figs s3g i as shown in fig 2 a clearly visible is a rapid increase in the mean number of rotifers in mps mbr from 40 ml to 180 ml on day 1 10 and then to 400 ml on day 35 thereafter this was observed to decrease gradually in mps mbr during days 40 120 and ultimately stabilized over the conventional range of 15 30 ml during days 125 170 by contrast the mean number of rotifers in mbr was lower than that in mps mbr on day 1 100 20 380 ml and higher than that in mps mbr on day 120 170 20 100 ml fig 2b showed that the mean number of nematodes in mps mbr underwent a remarkable increase to reach the maximum of 140 ml on day 1 15 the values being larger than that in mbr from 20 ml to 120 ml with the extension of operational time the mean number of nematodes in mps mbr were found to be stabilized over the range of 2 5 ml with observation of a considerable fluctuation in mbr 8 15 ml in addition the mean number of oligochaetes in mps mbr was observed to increase remarkably from 2 ml to 380 ml and then fluctuated in the range of 320 420 ml during days 1 40 fig 2c from day 40 on there was an observation of dramatic decrease in the mean number of oligochaetes from 380 ml day 40 to 5 ml day 170 in mps mbr in comparison the mean number of oligochaetes in mbr was 2 200 ml on day 1 40 lower than that in mps mbr and 20 120 ml on day 40 170 higher than that in mps mbr fig 2c to further reveal the reason for the massive growth of metazoans caused by mps during days 1 40 ftir spectra in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 were performed to analyze the functional groups of mps as shown in fig 3 the broad band at 3300 3500 cm 1 was assigned to the hydrogen bond of oh and nh functional groups in polysaccharides and proteins compounds deng et al 2022 the characteristic peaks at 1045 and 2930 cm 1 were attributed to the c o stretching vibration of polysaccharide like compounds and aliphatic chains with oh groups respectively xiao et al 2021 and the two peaks at 1655 and 1530 cm 1 belonged to the amides i and ii associated with the protein secondary structure and deformation vibration of nh functional groups zhang et al 2020 besides the absorption at 1365 cm 1 was the characteristic peak of the co symmetric stretching vibration of carboxyl group zhang et al 2020 these peak patterns provided qualitative evidence for the presence of protein polysaccharide and lipids containing a large number of amino hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in mps on the one hand these hydrophobic substances play a positive role for adhesion of microbial cells and other metabolites fig s4 on the other hand during our microscopic observations we found that major three metazoans i e rotifers nematodes sp plectus aquatilis and oligochaetes sp aelosoma hemprichi readily ingested the hyphae in mps fig s3 metazoans as predators at the top of the food chain in activated sludge prey on almost all biological residues klein et al 2016 therefore the addition of mps increased the available food for predators thereby remarkably improving the number of three types of metazoans during days 1 40 3 3 relationship between mps and microbial community the illumina miseq sequencing were performed to reveal the impact of mps on functional communities in two mbrs we analyzed the richness ace chao and sobs and diversity shannon and simpson of bacterial communities based on statistical results of otus and alpha diversity table s4 the ace chao and sobs indexes followed the order of s0 s2 s1 s3 in mbr and s0 s11 s22 s33 in mps mbr despite the decline of bacterial richness in both mbrs during the granulation process the richness index in mps mbr was always higher than that in mbr the shannon value in mbr was found to decrease from 5 72 in seed sludge to 1 29 on day 120 while that in mps mbr was observed to stabilize in a range of 2 70 3 10 on day 20 120 implying higher bacterial diversity in mps mbr fig 4 a shows the compositions of bacterial communities at the genus level others 1 the four dominant genera from rhodobacter 8 65 candidatus alysiosphaera 5 85 norank f saprospiraceae 3 65 and norank f jg30 kf cm45 2 76 in s0 were shifted to thiothrix 74 89 unclassified f enterobacteriaceae 4 23 and exiguobacterium 2 23 acinetobacter 2 18 in mbr thiothrix 53 32 unclassified f enterobacteriaceae 5 89 rhodobacter 4 57 and lactococcus 2 77 in mps mbr on day 20 as the granulation proceeded to day 40 the relative abundance of thiothrix decreased sharply from 74 89 to 25 29 in mbr and from 53 32 to 40 9 in mps mbr following 120 day operation the top most abundant genus was always thiothrix followed by kouleothrix in two mbrs thiothrix with filamentous morphology was reported to decline sludge settling ability increase apparent viscosity in aerobic environment and cause dense biofilm formation on membrane surface wu et al 2019 which presented lower abundance in mps mbr 59 87 compared with that in mbr 83 39 this result was in consistence with the slower fouling development rate observed in mps mbr on day 63 170 fig s2 kouleothrix was the another filamentous bacterium that was negatively correlated to do concentration in aeration tank nittami et al 2019 accounting for 3 84 and 1 78 in mps mbr and mbr respectively this was likely due to the anoxic zone created by large sized granules for the growth of kouleothrix in mps mbr it was worth noting that terrimonas could improve flocculation and aggregation capacity of anammox community by secreting hydrophobic eps zhao et al 2019 accounting for 0 422 and 0 096 in mps mbr and mbr respectively the higher abundance of eps producer in mps mbr contributed to rapid granulation and structural stability of ags in relative to mbr furthermore dominant functional bacteria involved in nutrients removal were obtained in two mbrs nitrospira was known as the most typical nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob geng et al 2021 the relative abundance of nitrospira in mps mbr was increased greatly from 0 05 on day 20 to 1 52 on day 120 the value being higher than that in mbr from 0 05 to 0 55 trichococcus was a representative denitrifying bacterium dnb that could receive electrons from electron donor to reduce nitrate and nitrite under aerobic or anoxic conditions and acinetobacter was also responsible for heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification du et al 2022 the relative abundances of trichococcus and acinetobacter in mps mbr were 10 10 and 13 68 on day 40 0 51 and 0 23 on day 120 respectively higher than those in mbr 7 98 and 12 66 on day 40 0 080 and 0 034 on day 120 compared with that in mbr higher nobs and dnbs abundance in mps mbr implied that the addition of mps contributed to the growth and reproduction of functional bacteria we next investigated the distribution of fungal communities at the genus level others 0 05 both mbrs followed the similar trends with time in richness and diversity of fungal communities the fungal richness gradually declined with the extension of operational time following the order of f0 f1 f2 f3 in mbr and fp f11 f22 f33 in mps mbr after 120 day operation there was a significant decrease with over 60 loss in richness of fungal communities and no significant change in the diversity of fungal communities table s4 as shown in fig 4b unclassified k fungi was the predominant genus in seed sludge samples 53 91 in f0 44 73 in fp followed by unclassified p rozellomycota 38 35 in f0 34 54 in fp whereas the relative abundance of candida in fp 1 46 was higher than that in f0 15 20 this could be because of the fact that the fungal community was less diverse and remarkably dynamic and subjected to a strong influence of the operational and environmental variables in activated sludge maza márquez et al 2016 candida as an important human fungal commensals of mucosa is rarely the dominant fungus in activated sludge vanessa et al 2012 as the granulation proceeded to day 120 the relative abundance of candida decreased gradually to 0 3 in both mbrs besides that the relative abundance of unclassified k fungi increased to 91 01 in mps mbr and 84 24 in mbr on day 120 while the other genera were only represented by a small number of sequences notably the genus aspergillus was in an inferior position with very low relative abundance 0 05 in seed sludge f0 and other sludge samples in mbr in comparison the relative abundance of aspergillus in mps mbr from 0 634 in mps added seed sludge fp increased to 0 930 on day 20 then gradually decreased to 0 400 on day 40 and finally to 0 158 on day 120 to the best of our knowledge the known fungal communities are extremely sensitive to survive in activated sludge or granular sludge systems at ph neutral condition espinosa ortiz et al 2016 in principle therefore bacterial communities should be responsible for the overall performance of reactor compared with fungal communities zhang et al 2011 the above results indicated that mps underwent three phases i e proliferation phase day 1 20 stagnation phase day 21 40 and decline phase day 41 120 despite the decline in the relative abundance of mps during the enhanced granulation the presence of mps inhibited the excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and promoted the reproduction of beneficial genus for removing nitrogenous pollutants nobs and dnbs and even the fungal bacterial combination greatly facilitated the removal of pollutants geng et al 2021 3 4 protein expression of mps induced ags label free quantitative proteomics analysis was conducted to evaluate the protein category and function of ags in two mbrs according to go annotation the function of protein was classified and annotated into biological process bp cellular component cc and molecular function mf fig s5 after global normalization analysis 733 differentially expressed proteins deps in mps mbr vs mbr were identified including 423 up regulated proteins and 310 down regulated proteins table s5 clearly visible is a significant difference in mps mbr vs mbr in visual volcano plot of deps fig s6a where the intensity of obviously up regulated proteins was most under the condition of p 0 01 regarding the bp and cc analyses in mps mbr vs mbr more up regulated proteins were found in relation to cellular process go 0009987 and metabolic process go 0008152 than down regulated proteins figs 5 a b and table s6 suggesting that biochemical reactions may be enhanced as most of these proteins act as reactive enzymes wu et al 2017 the up regulated proteins relevant to cellular anatomical entity go 0110165 and protein containing complex go 0032991 in cc were more than down regulated proteins this was instrumental in the basic physiological metabolism of all organisms zhang et al 2020 with regard to mf analysis major up regulated proteins belonged to catalytic activity go 0003824 and binding go 0005488 figs 5a b and table s6 the upregulation of catalytic activity implied an increase in the cell activity and biochemical reactions in mps induced ags geng et al 2022 this was in good agreement with previous study where larger granules showed more redundant functions due to the enhanced catalytic reactions caused by providing habitats for both aerobes and anaerobes and deriving more nutrients and energy from wastewater chen et al 2020 additionally the proteins associated with catalytic activity in eps could facilitate macromolecules hydrolysis and the resulting hydrolysate could provide carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic bacteria zhang et al 2015 in addition the number of up regulated binding proteins in mf was almost 1 5 times that of down regulated proteins fig 5a we further classified the binding proteins into 18 subgroups fig 5c in which heterocyclic compound small molecule ion including cation anion and metal ions carbohydrate derivative nucleoside phosphate nucleotide ribonucleotide purine ribonucleoside purine nucleotide nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate atp binding were the major up regulated binding proteins among them considering that more cation binding proteins could have substantial impacts on eps surface charge and lead to an increase of feedback regulation in the ability of microbial cells to bind to cations the improved expression of cation binding proteins in mps mbr supported the fact of the enhancement in intercellular bridging effect in mps induced ags li et al 2020 wu et al 2017 on the other hand higher amount of anion binding proteins in mps mbr indicated the decline in sludge flocculation ability as a result of the presence of hydrophilic free amino groups wu et al 2017 this was because of the fact that despite the improvement of internal adhesion capacity in granules each granule housed an independent micro ecosystem and the interaction between granules were relatively poor compared with that between granules and flocs as a result the reduction of sludge flocs caused by the completion of sludge granulation led to a decline of the overall flocculation ability in the mixed liquor this appeared to be in good agreement with our earlier study where large amounts of gel epss were applied for ags formation resulting in decrease in free gel epss and viscosity in the mixed liquor with the completion of granulation xiao et al 2022 it is also pertinent to mention that the upregulation of nucleoside phosphate nucleotide and ribonucleotide binding proteins implied the enhancement of intracellular protein biosynthesis or metabolism in microorganisms due to the faster biomass growth in mps mbr fig s1b especially atp synthase subunit beta e g atpd fig s6b a representative of the above three proteins can be utilized as a catalytic site to produce atp from adp in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is necessary for almost all biological activities li et al 2020 3 5 metabolic pathways of mps induced ags to gain further insights into the potential functions and macro behavior of mps induced ags from proteomic level the analysis of corresponding molecular metabolism was carried out based on kegg pathway as shown in fig 6 a and table s7 the deps in mps mbr vs mbr were mostly involved in nine metabolic pathways including glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00010 citrate tca cycle ko00020 oxidative phosphorylation ko00190 pyruvate metabolism ko00620 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 carbon metabolism ko01200 biosynthesis of amino acids ko01230 and abc transports ko02010 primary enriched pathways of up regulated proteins in mps mbr vs mbr contained glycolysis gluconeogenesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate metabolism nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids p 0 05 fig 6b and table s7 energy metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate metabolism remarkably upregulated in mps mbr vs mbr it is known that glycolysis is an energy releasing pathway that supply the reducing power for anaerobic conversion of volatile fatty acids vfas to polyhydroxyalkanoates phas by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos while gluconeogenesis is an energy consuming pathway that convert a variety of non sugar substances into glycogen zhou et al 2009 both of them were accompanied by the decomposition and synthesis of substances for cell growth and cellular homeostasis e g acetyl coa glycerate 3 phosphate fructose 6 phosphate nadh dehydrogenase f type atpase etc fig 6c and table s8 besides that tca cycle was the source of the reducing power necessary to reduce acetyl coa to poly beta hydroxybutyrate zhou et al 2009 and the enrichment of this pathway might be responsible for the enhancement of a series of enzymatic reactions as a major product in glycolysis metabolism pyruvate can achieve interconversion among carbohydrates lipids and amino acids in vivo through the acetyl coa and tca cycle mukherjee and venkata mohan 2021 and thus the upregulation of pyruvate metabolism greatly facilitated the mutual transformation of these substances oxidative phosphorylation pathway has been generally accepted to favor electron transport activity and atp synthesis in sludge system zhang et al 2022 which was remarkably enriched as a result of higher expression of nadh dehydrogenase e g nuoc nuod nuog and f type atpase in mps mbr these results suggested that mps induced ags were more active and energetic than the sludge in control mbr this could be explained by the fact that mps induced ags contributed to the storage transport consumption and interaction of nutrients substrate due to more favorable habitats and higher microbial diversity leading to the enhanced microbial activity and energy metabolism biosynthesis of amino acids the upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis pathway in mps mbr vs mbr enhanced the 16 amino acid metabolisms including histidine tryptophan phosphoserine serine cysteine glycine methionine homocysteine cystathionine valine leucine homoserine threonine isoleucine glutamate arginine fig 6c and table s8 most of them except valine and arginine were considered indispensable for proteins synthesis geng et al 2022 especially the hydrophobic amino acids including tryptophan isoleucine cysteine methionine valine leucine and glycine were significantly up regulated which was in response to the demand for extracellular protein synthesis during the enhanced granulation guo et al 2017 indicating that mps induced ags had a high capacity to synthesize more amino acids closely related to eps for maintaining good structural stability in granules this result was in accordance with the increased protein content in mps mbr fig s7 nitrogen metabolism the expression of key enzymes involving dissimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification and nitrification such as nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab nitrite reductase nirk and nitrate reductase narghi were up regulated in mps mbr vs mbr fig 6c and table s8 the most likely reason was that mps induced ags created more aerobic anoxic anaerobic zones for the multiplication of microorganisms involved in nitrogen removal resulting in enhanced expression of the above mentioned enzymes and thus upregulating nitrogen metabolism in comparison fewer nitrifiers nitrospira and denitrifiers trichococcus and acinetobacter worked in the sludge in control mbr these results were consistent with the enhanced nitrogen removal in mps mbr table s3 furthermore the nitrogen sources can be transferred to ammonium via nar or nir controlled pathways and then metabolized by glutamate pathway for assimilation which is used to support other nitrogen related metabolisms and bacterial growth zhang et al 2022 afterwards we analyzed the main contributors to the deps based on the species annotation others 1 fig 6d despite that deps in two mbrs were mainly governed by thiothrix the relative abundance of thiothrix responsible for deps was 36 3 0 5 in mps mbr much lower than that in mbr 63 4 0 6 nitrospira chondromyces and sorangium were the other contributors accounting for 12 4 0 5 4 4 0 2 and 2 2 0 1 in mps mbr respectively higher than those in mbr 5 9 0 1 1 2 0 4 0 35 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 why did the addition of mps promote rapid sludge granulation in mbr system the mps have been reported to adhere to microbial cells via abundant hydrophobic substances and serve as habitats for attachment and proliferation of microbes by virtue of porous and intertwined structure fig 3 and fig s4 another unanticipated finding was that the mps promoted rapid sludge granulation in response to the specific living environment for self protection among the three metazoans that prey on the mps it has been suggested that rotifer population growth is mainly limited by dissolved oxygen the amount of food available and the effect of wastewater treatment lapinski and tunnacliffe 2003 regarding the predation tendency rotifers could consume several times their body weight per day and prefer to attack the filaments of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge fiałkowska and pajdak stós 2008 they are well tolerant of living conditions and usually feed on different types of particles in suspension making it easy to balance their lacking nutrients thereby maintaining a high population growth rate in new environments li et al 2013a mps are densely packed form of branching hyphae with abundant eps which was in line with the appetite for rotifers in the micro ecosystem with mps nematodes sp plectus aquatilis were identified to macro predators that usually fed on bacteria klein et al 2016 but we noticed that they obviously enjoyed grazing on palatable secretions within the mps besides that oligochaetes sp aelosoma hemprichi have partiality for nutrient rich environment with sufficient oxygen and are commonly applied for the decrement of secondary sludge and the reduction of membrane biofilm klein et al 2016 li et al 2013b the mps with a large number of proteins and polysaccharides offered more accessible food sources to oligochaetes accordingly the increase of available food promoted the massive growth of these metazoans during days 1 40 meanwhile it must be pointed out that long srt and negligible biomass loss in mbr system were unfavorable for community screening within short term operational time in this case it is difficult to instantly reduce the number of metazoans that affect the survival of mps without external intervention to this end it is reasonable to hypothesize that the mps turned on self protection in the jungle community for survival of the fittest they took advantages of the porous structure and adhesion ability to rapidly aggregate various bacteria to form defensive aggregates for physical protection from direct predation by metazoans fig s4 this could be because of the fact that metazoans were not able to access the mycelium which were tucked away in the inner part of the co aggregates ding et al 2017 moreover rotifers were reported to secret an adhesive gluey substance containing non protein organic nitrogen and polysaccharides groups by pedal glands for their own exponential growth lapinski and tunnacliffe 2003 ohmori et al 2011 and these secretions could function as an infochemical to enhance the flocculation performance of bioflocculation producing bacteria ding et al 2017 that is the enhancement of bioflocculability in flocs sludge can increase the chance of collision between the mps and microbial cells which further facilitated the aggregates formation with the increase of microbial aggregates and the decrease of free flocs in the mixed liquor the number of metazoans was observed to drastically reduce in mps mbr this observation can be explained by the decline in available food it was difficult for metazoans to reach the anoxic areas inside the granules to ingest food due to the dense shell of the granules and the aversion of metazoans to hypoxic environments the above discussions indicated that the mps are subjective in defending against predators indeed the porous structures and compound compositions in mps were used as powerful weapons to accelerate agglomeration with various bacteria resulting in the granulation of aerobic sludge taken together the enhanced sludge granulation in the presence of mps in mbr system is a complex dynamic evolution which not only depends on the single adsorption attachment of mps but also involves the joint participation competition and succession of various organisms under the tenacious struggles of mps for self protection 4 2 why is mps induced ags superior to conventional ags in mbr system there were significant differences between the mps induced ags and conventional ags in terms of apparent structure substance components and biological functions it is an interesting question why the mps induced ags exhibited denser structure fig 1b more abundant protein and β polysaccharides fig 1c higher species diversity fig 4a and table s4 enhanced nitrogen removal table s3 and lower membrane fouling potential fig s2 on the one hand although the relative abundance of mps i e aspergillus in mps mbr declined with the extension of operational time their residual mycelium in co aggregates provided habitats for bacterial reproduction and channels for nutrients exchange promoting the formation of larger sized ags the increase in ags size not only causes the formation of new niches due to the substrate gradients generated in the incipient granules liébana et al 2019 but also enriches the rare species in wastewater belonging to putative functional populations related to nitrogen and phosphorus removal in virtue of habitat differentiation and enhanced heterogeneity ali et al 2019 resulting in higher microbial diversity diverse microbial populations have contribution to micro ecosystem functions in equivalent manners e g scavengers nitrogen fixation leading to functional redundancy that guarantees system stability under extreme conditions liébana et al 2019 on the other hand the increase in the number of rotifers in the initial phase of granulation can restrain the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria responsible for bulking by foraging on their filaments fiałkowska and pajdak stós 2008 in addition the size of oral organs of bacterivorous oligochaetes limits which prey they can consume and thus other bacteria such as nitrifying bacteria take advantage of the habitats provided by mps to grow into larger colonies for escaping their predation pajdak stós et al 2010 the above discussions provided the most likely explanation for the lower abundant of filamentous bacteria and the higher abundant of functional bacteria related to flocculation capacity and nitrogen removal in mps mbr on day 120 compared with that in mbr fig 4a species annotation demonstrated that most of deps were originated from thiothrix nitrospira chondromyces and sorangium the controllable growth of thiothrix could substrate diffusive transport within the granules and serve as skeleton to bridge flocs sludge for maintaining granule morphology de graaff et al 2020 the excessive proliferation of thiothrix may lead to fluffy structure or even disintegration in granules and interfere with the growth of other beneficial bacteria due to its competitive advantage thus changing the population structure and metabolite secretion in sludge wan et al 2014 as nob communities nitrospira can perform the conversion of nitrite to nitrate with oxygen as electron acceptor thereby affecting nitrogen catabolism however chondromyces were reported to be a gram negative bacterium that was susceptible to heavy metals associated with human disease ramírez et al 2022 and sorangium was known as the potential bacteria for preferential degradation of chiral fungicide and specific metal ions truu et al 2022 few studies have reported that the genera chondromyces and sorangium were the dominant bacteria in activated sludge and had significant effects on the metabolism treating municipal wastewater therefore among the above mentioned species the first two was considered to have a critical effect on the molecular functions of proteins and metabolic activities of sludge as such the decrease of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and the increase of nobs nitrospira in mps mbr should be responsible for the upregulation of functional proteins involved in binding catalytic activity cellular process metabolic process cellular anatomical entity and protein containing complex fig 5a and b among them the greater the number of proteins with binding function fig 5c the more binding sites for other molecules which may affect the regulatory function of molecular metabolism as expected the energy metabolisms including glycolysis gluconeogenesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate metabolism in mps mbr were strengthened compared with those in mbr resulting in the enhancement of atp synthesis and metabolites secretion which highly favored the activity of microorganisms and the stability of micro ecosystem in mps induced ags mukherjee and venkata mohan 2021 additionally the enrichment of hydrophobic amino acids metabolism implied that more extracellular proteins were produced which were extremely beneficial to the tight adhesion of microbes in granules guo et al 2017 this was the most likely reason for the compact structure and high protein content in mps induced ags suggesting that it has better mechanical strength to resist onging hydraulic shear force these ags with rigid and stable structure could effectively diminish the concentration polarization by causing a strong scouring effect and reduce the filtration resistance by forming a highly permeable and loose bio cake thus mitigating membrane fouling zhang et al 2021 furthermore the upregulation of nitrogen metabolism pathway can enhance the nitrogen removal and promote the growth of other bacteria related to nitrogen metabolites in mps mbr zhang et al 2022 this makes mps induced ags more advantageous in terms of species diversity and nitrogen removal efficiency 4 3 implications to the best of our knowledge this is the first assessment of aerobic sludge granulation in the presence of mps in mbr system from the perspective of metazoan predation microbial community succession and proteomic level which will provide fundamental information and important implications for the widespread application of mps in ag mbr technology moreover the functions of mps proposed in this study included controlling the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria and regulating the species diversity in micro ecosystem by providing habitats for functional bacteria and affecting metazoans that phagocytize filamentous bacteria looking into the results may direct us in finding other potential inspiration such as applying mps to mitigate the collapse of ags systems due to bulking of filamentous bacteria during practical engineering applications notwithstanding this there remain regions with several aspects that need in depth investigation in the future from the perspective of economic cost mps with a mass ratio below 20 could be explored to achieve granulation development with the equivalent effects as 20 wmps wsludge addition on the other hand considering that the addition of grazing metazoans in biofilm controlled membrane systems can improve the membrane flux klein et al 2016 the impact of metazoans caused by mps on membrane fouling should be identified and addressed well moreover it is important to investigate how to optimize the scouring effect and maintain the size shape of mps induced ags for maximizing the mitigation of membrane fouling in mbr during long term operation 5 conclusions this study was the first to evaluate the interrelationships among metazoans microbial communities and protein expression during mps induced sludge granulation in mbr the results showed that the addition of mps enhanced the formation of large size ags with more compact structure richer protein and β polysaccharides content higher species diversity and significant nitrogen removal 33 12 42 33 leading to lower membrane fouling development rate the increase of available food caused by the addition of mps promoted the massive growth of rotifers 40 400 ml nematodes 20 140 ml and oligochaetes 2 420 ml during days 1 40 the porous structures and compound compositions in mps were used as powerful weapons to accelerate agglomeration with various bacteria to defend against predators which prompted the formation of initial granules meanwhile this process inhibited the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria and promoted the reproduction of functional bacteria involved in nitrogen removal proteomic analysis demonstrated that the upregulation of functional proteins in mps mbr was attributed to the decline in thiothrix abundance and increase in nitrospira abundance based on species annotation resulting in the enhancement of energy metabolisms nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids which facilitated the structural stability and functional diversity of mps

15283,direct cultivation of aerobic granular sludge ags in membrane bioreactor mbr has gained increasing attention mycelial pellets mps has been shown capable of promoting rapid granulation of aerobic sludge in mbr yet mechanisms remain unclear and in depth insight into cross scale interactions between mps and indigenous microbiota as well as the corresponding protein expression functions is necessary herein we found that the addition of mps in mbr resulted in massive growth of metazoans with 40 400 ml for rotifers 20 140 ml for nematodes and 2 420 ml for oligochaetes in the initial phase of granulation this facilitated the mps to rapidly aggregate with bacteria to form defensive granules for physical protection from predation by metazoans which inhibited the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and promoted the reproduction of functional bacteria related to nitrogen removal nitrospira trichococcus and acinetobacter proteomic analysis demonstrated that the upregulation of functional proteins was mainly ascribed to the decrease of thiothrix and the increase of nitrospira resulting in the enhancement of metabolic pathways involved in glycolysis gluconeogenesis citrate tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate metabolism nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids which was responsible for mps induced ags with denser structure more abundant proteins and β polysaccharides higher species diversity significant nitrogen removal 33 12 42 33 and lower membrane fouling potential this study provided a novel and comprehensive insight into the enhanced granulation of aerobic sludge by mps and the functional superiority of mps induced ags in mbr system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mycelial pellets aerobic granular sludge metazoans microbial communities proteomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the integration of aerobic granular sludge ags and membrane bioreactor mbr i e ag mbr system is a promising technology for improved pollutants removal and mitigation of membrane fouling iorhemen et al 2019 sajjad et al 2016 concern has raised on direct cultivation of ags in mbr due to economic applicability and operational convenience compared with the pre cultured ags mode chen et al 2017 recently mycelial pellets mps are reported capable of serving as biomass carriers with densely packed form of fungal hyphae and high hydrophobicity to promote rapid granulation of aerobic sludge through enhancing the network structure and adhesion force of flocculent sludge in mbr system xiao et al 2022 additionally mycelium of mps could play the role of framework replacing part of extracellular polymeric substances eps that strengthens the internal structure of ags de graaff et al 2020 geng et al 2020 compared with conventional ags the mps induced ags is more advantageous in terms of short lag phase structural stability and decontamination performances geng et al 2021 this makes mps a promising manner for development of ag mbr technology han et al 2022 however the mechanisms for mps induced granulation remain unclear up to present we in previous study showed that the enhancement of aerobic sludge granulation might be the result of abundant pore structure and hydrophobicity of mps where the mps mainly served as bio carriers to provide a large habitat for microbial cells xiao et al 2021 however the living fungal organisms may play a role beyond the carriers and thus the species interaction between mps and indigenous microorganisms may exist to the best of our knowledge longer sludge retention time srt in activated sludge system is extremely conducive to reproduction of potential grazers of floc forming bacteria such as rotifers nematodes and oligochaetes pajdak stós et al 2010 these metazoans are natural consumers of biomass in the benthic layers of ecosystems tamis et al 2011 and usually feed on microbial residues bacterial cells and organic bioparticles li et al 2013b in addition they could convert the morphology of the biofilm from a compact and homogeneous construction into a loosely porous and heterogeneous structure resulting in a decline of thickness and density of basal layer klein et al 2016 prior studies found the spherically structured mps to be only maintained for 8 15 days in sbr or mbr geng et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 this phenomenon inspired the search for possible existence of complex relationships between mps and metazoans it is reasonable to assume that in addition to sensitivity of mps to ph and hydrodynamic condition espinosa ortiz et al 2016 wargenau and kwade 2010 metazoans may also exert impact to the survival or structure of mps in mbr system based on their predatory preference moreover some bacteria such as nitrifying bacteria were believed capable of sensing diffusible chemicals secreted by predators thereby they are physically protected from predation by forming microcolonies in activated sludge system ding et al 2017 pajdak stós et al 2010 similarly mps have been reported to enrich functional bacteria to form aggregates in activated sludge system geng et al 2021 however it is still an open question whether this behavior is associated with metazoans as such it would be of considerable interest to explore the interactions among mps metazoans and bacteria during enhanced sludge granulation in mbr despite synergistic interaction that may exist for mps induced ags in mbr system efforts made in earlier study only focused on macroscopic explanation to the structural composition xiao et al 2022 the molecular mechanisms and corresponding functional properties remain unclear metaproteomic technology offers a powerful tool to identify microbial functional proteins associated with metabolic and physiological activities in mixed microbial samples salerno et al 2019 and further elucidate macroscopic behaviors e g membrane fouling nitrate removal from the viewpoint of overall ecosystems zhang et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 for instance proteomics analysis can characterize the impact of functional composition of proteins in eps on the ags structure yang et al 2021 the extracellular protein constitutes an important component being responsible for maintaining integrity and stability of ags lv et al 2014 prior study revealed that the addition of mps had contribution to increasing the protein content in mbr system xiao et al 2022 but the effect on protein expression and metabolic properties of the community members were not understood well for a complex micro ecosystem changes in any factors can lead to different living status resistance capability and metabolic behaviors guo et al 2017 the moderate presence of fungal hyphae was described in relation to the stabilization of microbial cell aggregates in biological wastewater treatment maza márquez et al 2016 however the limited data were incapable of elucidating the interactions among the microbial communities proteins and metabolisms in the presence of mps this necessitates the metaproteomic analysis to provide in depth proteomic level insight into the relationship between microbiota functional status and protein expression for mps induced ags in mbr system this study focuses on mechanistic insight into enhanced granulation of aerobic sludge by mps in mbr system first we investigated the granules development and reactor performances followed by the characterization of ags second we analyzed the relationships among the mps metazoans and microbial communities to evaluate the role of mps in enhancing aerobic sludge granulation last we elucidated the functional superiority of mps induced ags from the perspective of protein expression and molecular metabolisms 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation two lab scale mbrs effective volume of 15 l with and without mps were operated in parallel for a period of 170 days under continuous flow

et al 2017 and the staining protocol of ags was illustrated in table s2 3 results 3 1 sludge granulation in the presence of mps in mbr system fig 1 a shows the time course of mean size for granules in two mbrs during an operational time of 170 days the mean size of granules in control mbr underwent a gradual increase from 0 085 mm to 0 28 mm during days 1 170 and only tiny granules with loose filamentous outer layer appeared fig 1b by contrast three phases of granule development were noticed in mps mbr from 0 085 mm day 1 to 0 22 mm day 40 then to 0 51 mm day 80 and finally to 0 74 mm day 120 particle size distribution analysis illustrated an obvious increase in fraction of granules in mps mbr during days 40 120 while the sludge system in mbr was always dominated by floc sludge with a diameter smaller than 0 2 mm fig s1a from day 120 on typical ags with hydrophobic outer layer of colloidal substances and rod shaped bacteria were prevalently observed in mps mbr fig 1b and the mean size of granules stabilized at the range of 0 68 0 76 mm fig 1a meanwhile mlss concentration in mps mbr was found to increased gradually to12 8 g l on day 170 much higher than that in mbr 9 8 g l fig s1b moreover mps mbr exhibited significant advantages in terms of cod reduction 97 0 99 1 and tn reduction 33 12 42 33 during days 121 170 compared with 96 4 98 6 and 14 14 20 42 in mbr table s3 with respect to membrane fouling fig s2 the tmp in mps mbr was observe to increase at a slightly faster fouling rate during the first 52 day operation compared with that in mbr whereas the tmp for both mbrs almost reached the critical values on day 62 32 0 kpa in mbr 29 5 kpa in mps mbr during days 63 121 an obviously lower tmp development rate in mps mbr was found with a longer average filtration cycle of 9 8 d while a rapid tmp increase in mbr was observed with an average filtration cycle of only 6 5 d as granulation proceeded the ags in mps mbr demonstrated significantly lower fouling potential with a more mildly increase from 3 0 kpa to 19 5 kpa on day 122 170 clsm analysis was performed to characterize the distribution of major eps and microbial cells on ags fig 1c for mps induced ags proteins were observed to distribute evenly throughout the granule with the most abundant content the α polysaccharides were located on the surface and inner layers of the granule while most β polysaccharides were found on the outer rim total microbial cells were observed to be mainly distributed on the surface but some of them were still contained within the granule the conventional ags followed the similar tendency of distribution i e mostly proteins followed by α polysaccharides and total microbial cells and finally β polysaccharides in comparison mps induced ags contained more abundant proteins β polysaccharides and microbial cells it was noticed that both protein and α polysaccharide were responsible for maintaining the integrity of ags while β polysaccharide was another factor in stabilizing the surface structure of ags and microbial cells played an essential role in retaining the granules viability chen et al 2017 3 2 relationship between mps and metazoans to investigate the relationship between mps and metazoans during granulation of aerobic sludge we detected the variations of three dominant metazoans including rotifers figs s3a c nematodes figs s3d f and oligochaetes figs s3g i as shown in fig 2 a clearly visible is a rapid increase in the mean number of rotifers in mps mbr from 40 ml to 180 ml on day 1 10 and then to 400 ml on day 35 thereafter this was observed to decrease gradually in mps mbr during days 40 120 and ultimately stabilized over the conventional range of 15 30 ml during days 125 170 by contrast the mean number of rotifers in mbr was lower than that in mps mbr on day 1 100 20 380 ml and higher than that in mps mbr on day 120 170 20 100 ml fig 2b showed that the mean number of nematodes in mps mbr underwent a remarkable increase to reach the maximum of 140 ml on day 1 15 the values being larger than that in mbr from 20 ml to 120 ml with the extension of operational time the mean number of nematodes in mps mbr were found to be stabilized over the range of 2 5 ml with observation of a considerable fluctuation in mbr 8 15 ml in addition the mean number of oligochaetes in mps mbr was observed to increase remarkably from 2 ml to 380 ml and then fluctuated in the range of 320 420 ml during days 1 40 fig 2c from day 40 on there was an observation of dramatic decrease in the mean number of oligochaetes from 380 ml day 40 to 5 ml day 170 in mps mbr in comparison the mean number of oligochaetes in mbr was 2 200 ml on day 1 40 lower than that in mps mbr and 20 120 ml on day 40 170 higher than that in mps mbr fig 2c to further reveal the reason for the massive growth of metazoans caused by mps during days 1 40 ftir spectra in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 were performed to analyze the functional groups of mps as shown in fig 3 the broad band at 3300 3500 cm 1 was assigned to the hydrogen bond of oh and nh functional groups in polysaccharides and proteins compounds deng et al 2022 the characteristic peaks at 1045 and 2930 cm 1 were attributed to the c o stretching vibration of polysaccharide like compounds and aliphatic chains with oh groups respectively xiao et al 2021 and the two peaks at 1655 and 1530 cm 1 belonged to the amides i and ii associated with the protein secondary structure and deformation vibration of nh functional groups zhang et al 2020 besides the absorption at 1365 cm 1 was the characteristic peak of the co symmetric stretching vibration of carboxyl group zhang et al 2020 these peak patterns provided qualitative evidence for the presence of protein polysaccharide and lipids containing a large number of amino hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in mps on the one hand these hydrophobic substances play a positive role for adhesion of microbial cells and other metabolites fig s4 on the other hand during our microscopic observations we found that major three metazoans i e rotifers nematodes sp plectus aquatilis and oligochaetes sp aelosoma hemprichi readily ingested the hyphae in mps fig s3 metazoans as predators at the top of the food chain in activated sludge prey on almost all biological residues klein et al 2016 therefore the addition of mps increased the available food for predators thereby remarkably improving the number of three types of metazoans during days 1 40 3 3 relationship between mps and microbial community the illumina miseq sequencing were performed to reveal the impact of mps on functional communities in two mbrs we analyzed the richness ace chao and sobs and diversity shannon and simpson of bacterial communities based on statistical results of otus and alpha diversity table s4 the ace chao and sobs indexes followed the order of s0 s2 s1 s3 in mbr and s0 s11 s22 s33 in mps mbr despite the decline of bacterial richness in both mbrs during the granulation process the richness index in mps mbr was always higher than that in mbr the shannon value in mbr was found to decrease from 5 72 in seed sludge to 1 29 on day 120 while that in mps mbr was observed to stabilize in a range of 2 70 3 10 on day 20 120 implying higher bacterial diversity in mps mbr fig 4 a shows the compositions of bacterial communities at the genus level others 1 the four dominant genera from rhodobacter 8 65 candidatus alysiosphaera 5 85 norank f saprospiraceae 3 65 and norank f jg30 kf cm45 2 76 in s0 were shifted to thiothrix 74 89 unclassified f enterobacteriaceae 4 23 and exiguobacterium 2 23 acinetobacter 2 18 in mbr thiothrix 53 32 unclassified f enterobacteriaceae 5 89 rhodobacter 4 57 and lactococcus 2 77 in mps mbr on day 20 as the granulation proceeded to day 40 the relative abundance of thiothrix decreased sharply from 74 89 to 25 29 in mbr and from 53 32 to 40 9 in mps mbr following 120 day operation the top most abundant genus was always thiothrix followed by kouleothrix in two mbrs thiothrix with filamentous morphology was reported to decline sludge settling ability increase apparent viscosity in aerobic environment and cause dense biofilm formation on membrane surface wu et al 2019 which presented lower abundance in mps mbr 59 87 compared with that in mbr 83 39 this result was in consistence with the slower fouling development rate observed in mps mbr on day 63 170 fig s2 kouleothrix was the another filamentous bacterium that was negatively correlated to do concentration in aeration tank nittami et al 2019 accounting for 3 84 and 1 78 in mps mbr and mbr respectively this was likely due to the anoxic zone created by large sized granules for the growth of kouleothrix in mps mbr it was worth noting that terrimonas could improve flocculation and aggregation capacity of anammox community by secreting hydrophobic eps zhao et al 2019 accounting for 0 422 and 0 096 in mps mbr and mbr respectively the higher abundance of eps producer in mps mbr contributed to rapid granulation and structural stability of ags in relative to mbr furthermore dominant functional bacteria involved in nutrients removal were obtained in two mbrs nitrospira was known as the most typical nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob geng et al 2021 the relative abundance of nitrospira in mps mbr was increased greatly from 0 05 on day 20 to 1 52 on day 120 the value being higher than that in mbr from 0 05 to 0 55 trichococcus was a representative denitrifying bacterium dnb that could receive electrons from electron donor to reduce nitrate and nitrite under aerobic or anoxic conditions and acinetobacter was also responsible for heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification du et al 2022 the relative abundances of trichococcus and acinetobacter in mps mbr were 10 10 and 13 68 on day 40 0 51 and 0 23 on day 120 respectively higher than those in mbr 7 98 and 12 66 on day 40 0 080 and 0 034 on day 120 compared with that in mbr higher nobs and dnbs abundance in mps mbr implied that the addition of mps contributed to the growth and reproduction of functional bacteria we next investigated the distribution of fungal communities at the genus level others 0 05 both mbrs followed the similar trends with time in richness and diversity of fungal communities the fungal richness gradually declined with the extension of operational time following the order of f0 f1 f2 f3 in mbr and fp f11 f22 f33 in mps mbr after 120 day operation there was a significant decrease with over 60 loss in richness of fungal communities and no significant change in the diversity of fungal communities table s4 as shown in fig 4b unclassified k fungi was the predominant genus in seed sludge samples 53 91 in f0 44 73 in fp followed by unclassified p rozellomycota 38 35 in f0 34 54 in fp whereas the relative abundance of candida in fp 1 46 was higher than that in f0 15 20 this could be because of the fact that the fungal community was less diverse and remarkably dynamic and subjected to a strong influence of the operational and environmental variables in activated sludge maza márquez et al 2016 candida as an important human fungal commensals of mucosa is rarely the dominant fungus in activated sludge vanessa et al 2012 as the granulation proceeded to day 120 the relative abundance of candida decreased gradually to 0 3 in both mbrs besides that the relative abundance of unclassified k fungi increased to 91 01 in mps mbr and 84 24 in mbr on day 120 while the other genera were only represented by a small number of sequences notably the genus aspergillus was in an inferior position with very low relative abundance 0 05 in seed sludge f0 and other sludge samples in mbr in comparison the relative abundance of aspergillus in mps mbr from 0 634 in mps added seed sludge fp increased to 0 930 on day 20 then gradually decreased to 0 400 on day 40 and finally to 0 158 on day 120 to the best of our knowledge the known fungal communities are extremely sensitive to survive in activated sludge or granular sludge systems at ph neutral condition espinosa ortiz et al 2016 in principle therefore bacterial communities should be responsible for the overall performance of reactor compared with fungal communities zhang et al 2011 the above results indicated that mps underwent three phases i e proliferation phase day 1 20 stagnation phase day 21 40 and decline phase day 41 120 despite the decline in the relative abundance of mps during the enhanced granulation the presence of mps inhibited the excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and promoted the reproduction of beneficial genus for removing nitrogenous pollutants nobs and dnbs and even the fungal bacterial combination greatly facilitated the removal of pollutants geng et al 2021 3 4 protein expression of mps induced ags label free quantitative proteomics analysis was conducted to evaluate the protein category and function of ags in two mbrs according to go annotation the function of protein was classified and annotated into biological process bp cellular component cc and molecular function mf fig s5 after global normalization analysis 733 differentially expressed proteins deps in mps mbr vs mbr were identified including 423 up regulated proteins and 310 down regulated proteins table s5 clearly visible is a significant difference in mps mbr vs mbr in visual volcano plot of deps fig s6a where the intensity of obviously up regulated proteins was most under the condition of p 0 01 regarding the bp and cc analyses in mps mbr vs mbr more up regulated proteins were found in relation to cellular process go 0009987 and metabolic process go 0008152 than down regulated proteins figs 5 a b and table s6 suggesting that biochemical reactions may be enhanced as most of these proteins act as reactive enzymes wu et al 2017 the up regulated proteins relevant to cellular anatomical entity go 0110165 and protein containing complex go 0032991 in cc were more than down regulated proteins this was instrumental in the basic physiological metabolism of all organisms zhang et al 2020 with regard to mf analysis major up regulated proteins belonged to catalytic activity go 0003824 and binding go 0005488 figs 5a b and table s6 the upregulation of catalytic activity implied an increase in the cell activity and biochemical reactions in mps induced ags geng et al 2022 this was in good agreement with previous study where larger granules showed more redundant functions due to the enhanced catalytic reactions caused by providing habitats for both aerobes and anaerobes and deriving more nutrients and energy from wastewater chen et al 2020 additionally the proteins associated with catalytic activity in eps could facilitate macromolecules hydrolysis and the resulting hydrolysate could provide carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic bacteria zhang et al 2015 in addition the number of up regulated binding proteins in mf was almost 1 5 times that of down regulated proteins fig 5a we further classified the binding proteins into 18 subgroups fig 5c in which heterocyclic compound small molecule ion including cation anion and metal ions carbohydrate derivative nucleoside phosphate nucleotide ribonucleotide purine ribonucleoside purine nucleotide nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate atp binding were the major up regulated binding proteins among them considering that more cation binding proteins could have substantial impacts on eps surface charge and lead to an increase of feedback regulation in the ability of microbial cells to bind to cations the improved expression of cation binding proteins in mps mbr supported the fact of the enhancement in intercellular bridging effect in mps induced ags li et al 2020 wu et al 2017 on the other hand higher amount of anion binding proteins in mps mbr indicated the decline in sludge flocculation ability as a result of the presence of hydrophilic free amino groups wu et al 2017 this was because of the fact that despite the improvement of internal adhesion capacity in granules each granule housed an independent micro ecosystem and the interaction between granules were relatively poor compared with that between granules and flocs as a result the reduction of sludge flocs caused by the completion of sludge granulation led to a decline of the overall flocculation ability in the mixed liquor this appeared to be in good agreement with our earlier study where large amounts of gel epss were applied for ags formation resulting in decrease in free gel epss and viscosity in the mixed liquor with the completion of granulation xiao et al 2022 it is also pertinent to mention that the upregulation of nucleoside phosphate nucleotide and ribonucleotide binding proteins implied the enhancement of intracellular protein biosynthesis or metabolism in microorganisms due to the faster biomass growth in mps mbr fig s1b especially atp synthase subunit beta e g atpd fig s6b a representative of the above three proteins can be utilized as a catalytic site to produce atp from adp in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is necessary for almost all biological activities li et al 2020 3 5 metabolic pathways of mps induced ags to gain further insights into the potential functions and macro behavior of mps induced ags from proteomic level the analysis of corresponding molecular metabolism was carried out based on kegg pathway as shown in fig 6 a and table s7 the deps in mps mbr vs mbr were mostly involved in nine metabolic pathways including glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00010 citrate tca cycle ko00020 oxidative phosphorylation ko00190 pyruvate metabolism ko00620 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 carbon metabolism ko01200 biosynthesis of amino acids ko01230 and abc transports ko02010 primary enriched pathways of up regulated proteins in mps mbr vs mbr contained glycolysis gluconeogenesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate metabolism nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids p 0 05 fig 6b and table s7 energy metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate metabolism remarkably upregulated in mps mbr vs mbr it is known that glycolysis is an energy releasing pathway that supply the reducing power for anaerobic conversion of volatile fatty acids vfas to polyhydroxyalkanoates phas by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos while gluconeogenesis is an energy consuming pathway that convert a variety of non sugar substances into glycogen zhou et al 2009 both of them were accompanied by the decomposition and synthesis of substances for cell growth and cellular homeostasis e g acetyl coa glycerate 3 phosphate fructose 6 phosphate nadh dehydrogenase f type atpase etc fig 6c and table s8 besides that tca cycle was the source of the reducing power necessary to reduce acetyl coa to poly beta hydroxybutyrate zhou et al 2009 and the enrichment of this pathway might be responsible for the enhancement of a series of enzymatic reactions as a major product in glycolysis metabolism pyruvate can achieve interconversion among carbohydrates lipids and amino acids in vivo through the acetyl coa and tca cycle mukherjee and venkata mohan 2021 and thus the upregulation of pyruvate metabolism greatly facilitated the mutual transformation of these substances oxidative phosphorylation pathway has been generally accepted to favor electron transport activity and atp synthesis in sludge system zhang et al 2022 which was remarkably enriched as a result of higher expression of nadh dehydrogenase e g nuoc nuod nuog and f type atpase in mps mbr these results suggested that mps induced ags were more active and energetic than the sludge in control mbr this could be explained by the fact that mps induced ags contributed to the storage transport consumption and interaction of nutrients substrate due to more favorable habitats and higher microbial diversity leading to the enhanced microbial activity and energy metabolism biosynthesis of amino acids the upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis pathway in mps mbr vs mbr enhanced the 16 amino acid metabolisms including histidine tryptophan phosphoserine serine cysteine glycine methionine homocysteine cystathionine valine leucine homoserine threonine isoleucine glutamate arginine fig 6c and table s8 most of them except valine and arginine were considered indispensable for proteins synthesis geng et al 2022 especially the hydrophobic amino acids including tryptophan isoleucine cysteine methionine valine leucine and glycine were significantly up regulated which was in response to the demand for extracellular protein synthesis during the enhanced granulation guo et al 2017 indicating that mps induced ags had a high capacity to synthesize more amino acids closely related to eps for maintaining good structural stability in granules this result was in accordance with the increased protein content in mps mbr fig s7 nitrogen metabolism the expression of key enzymes involving dissimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification and nitrification such as nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab nitrite reductase nirk and nitrate reductase narghi were up regulated in mps mbr vs mbr fig 6c and table s8 the most likely reason was that mps induced ags created more aerobic anoxic anaerobic zones for the multiplication of microorganisms involved in nitrogen removal resulting in enhanced expression of the above mentioned enzymes and thus upregulating nitrogen metabolism in comparison fewer nitrifiers nitrospira and denitrifiers trichococcus and acinetobacter worked in the sludge in control mbr these results were consistent with the enhanced nitrogen removal in mps mbr table s3 furthermore the nitrogen sources can be transferred to ammonium via nar or nir controlled pathways and then metabolized by glutamate pathway for assimilation which is used to support other nitrogen related metabolisms and bacterial growth zhang et al 2022 afterwards we analyzed the main contributors to the deps based on the species annotation others 1 fig 6d despite that deps in two mbrs were mainly governed by thiothrix the relative abundance of thiothrix responsible for deps was 36 3 0 5 in mps mbr much lower than that in mbr 63 4 0 6 nitrospira chondromyces and sorangium were the other contributors accounting for 12 4 0 5 4 4 0 2 and 2 2 0 1 in mps mbr respectively higher than those in mbr 5 9 0 1 1 2 0 4 0 35 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 why did the addition of mps promote rapid sludge granulation in mbr system the mps have been reported to adhere to microbial cells via abundant hydrophobic substances and serve as habitats for attachment and proliferation of microbes by virtue of porous and intertwined structure fig 3 and fig s4 another unanticipated finding was that the mps promoted rapid sludge granulation in response to the specific living environment for self protection among the three metazoans that prey on the mps it has been suggested that rotifer population growth is mainly limited by dissolved oxygen the amount of food available and the effect of wastewater treatment lapinski and tunnacliffe 2003 regarding the predation tendency rotifers could consume several times their body weight per day and prefer to attack the filaments of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge fiałkowska and pajdak stós 2008 they are well tolerant of living conditions and usually feed on different types of particles in suspension making it easy to balance their lacking nutrients thereby maintaining a high population growth rate in new environments li et al 2013a mps are densely packed form of branching hyphae with abundant eps which was in line with the appetite for rotifers in the micro ecosystem with mps nematodes sp plectus aquatilis were identified to macro predators that usually fed on bacteria klein et al 2016 but we noticed that they obviously enjoyed grazing on palatable secretions within the mps besides that oligochaetes sp aelosoma hemprichi have partiality for nutrient rich environment with sufficient oxygen and are commonly applied for the decrement of secondary sludge and the reduction of membrane biofilm klein et al 2016 li et al 2013b the mps with a large number of proteins and polysaccharides offered more accessible food sources to oligochaetes accordingly the increase of available food promoted the massive growth of these metazoans during days 1 40 meanwhile it must be pointed out that long srt and negligible biomass loss in mbr system were unfavorable for community screening within short term operational time in this case it is difficult to instantly reduce the number of metazoans that affect the survival of mps without external intervention to this end it is reasonable to hypothesize that the mps turned on self protection in the jungle community for survival of the fittest they took advantages of the porous structure and adhesion ability to rapidly aggregate various bacteria to form defensive aggregates for physical protection from direct predation by metazoans fig s4 this could be because of the fact that metazoans were not able to access the mycelium which were tucked away in the inner part of the co aggregates ding et al 2017 moreover rotifers were reported to secret an adhesive gluey substance containing non protein organic nitrogen and polysaccharides groups by pedal glands for their own exponential growth lapinski and tunnacliffe 2003 ohmori et al 2011 and these secretions could function as an infochemical to enhance the flocculation performance of bioflocculation producing bacteria ding et al 2017 that is the enhancement of bioflocculability in flocs sludge can increase the chance of collision between the mps and microbial cells which further facilitated the aggregates formation with the increase of microbial aggregates and the decrease of free flocs in the mixed liquor the number of metazoans was observed to drastically reduce in mps mbr this observation can be explained by the decline in available food it was difficult for metazoans to reach the anoxic areas inside the granules to ingest food due to the dense shell of the granules and the aversion of metazoans to hypoxic environments the above discussions indicated that the mps are subjective in defending against predators indeed the porous structures and compound compositions in mps were used as powerful weapons to accelerate agglomeration with various bacteria resulting in the granulation of aerobic sludge taken together the enhanced sludge granulation in the presence of mps in mbr system is a complex dynamic evolution which not only depends on the single adsorption attachment of mps but also involves the joint participation competition and succession of various organisms under the tenacious struggles of mps for self protection 4 2 why is mps induced ags superior to conventional ags in mbr system there were significant differences between the mps induced ags and conventional ags in terms of apparent structure substance components and biological functions it is an interesting question why the mps induced ags exhibited denser structure fig 1b more abundant protein and β polysaccharides fig 1c higher species diversity fig 4a and table s4 enhanced nitrogen removal table s3 and lower membrane fouling potential fig s2 on the one hand although the relative abundance of mps i e aspergillus in mps mbr declined with the extension of operational time their residual mycelium in co aggregates provided habitats for bacterial reproduction and channels for nutrients exchange promoting the formation of larger sized ags the increase in ags size not only causes the formation of new niches due to the substrate gradients generated in the incipient granules liébana et al 2019 but also enriches the rare species in wastewater belonging to putative functional populations related to nitrogen and phosphorus removal in virtue of habitat differentiation and enhanced heterogeneity ali et al 2019 resulting in higher microbial diversity diverse microbial populations have contribution to micro ecosystem functions in equivalent manners e g scavengers nitrogen fixation leading to functional redundancy that guarantees system stability under extreme conditions liébana et al 2019 on the other hand the increase in the number of rotifers in the initial phase of granulation can restrain the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria responsible for bulking by foraging on their filaments fiałkowska and pajdak stós 2008 in addition the size of oral organs of bacterivorous oligochaetes limits which prey they can consume and thus other bacteria such as nitrifying bacteria take advantage of the habitats provided by mps to grow into larger colonies for escaping their predation pajdak stós et al 2010 the above discussions provided the most likely explanation for the lower abundant of filamentous bacteria and the higher abundant of functional bacteria related to flocculation capacity and nitrogen removal in mps mbr on day 120 compared with that in mbr fig 4a species annotation demonstrated that most of deps were originated from thiothrix nitrospira chondromyces and sorangium the controllable growth of thiothrix could substrate diffusive transport within the granules and serve as skeleton to bridge flocs sludge for maintaining granule morphology de graaff et al 2020 the excessive proliferation of thiothrix may lead to fluffy structure or even disintegration in granules and interfere with the growth of other beneficial bacteria due to its competitive advantage thus changing the population structure and metabolite secretion in sludge wan et al 2014 as nob communities nitrospira can perform the conversion of nitrite to nitrate with oxygen as electron acceptor thereby affecting nitrogen catabolism however chondromyces were reported to be a gram negative bacterium that was susceptible to heavy metals associated with human disease ramírez et al 2022 and sorangium was known as the potential bacteria for preferential degradation of chiral fungicide and specific metal ions truu et al 2022 few studies have reported that the genera chondromyces and sorangium were the dominant bacteria in activated sludge and had significant effects on the metabolism treating municipal wastewater therefore among the above mentioned species the first two was considered to have a critical effect on the molecular functions of proteins and metabolic activities of sludge as such the decrease of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and the increase of nobs nitrospira in mps mbr should be responsible for the upregulation of functional proteins involved in binding catalytic activity cellular process metabolic process cellular anatomical entity and protein containing complex fig 5a and b among them the greater the number of proteins with binding function fig 5c the more binding sites for other molecules which may affect the regulatory function of molecular metabolism as expected the energy metabolisms including glycolysis gluconeogenesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate metabolism in mps mbr were strengthened compared with those in mbr resulting in the enhancement of atp synthesis and metabolites secretion which highly favored the activity of microorganisms and the stability of micro ecosystem in mps induced ags mukherjee and venkata mohan 2021 additionally the enrichment of hydrophobic amino acids metabolism implied that more extracellular proteins were produced which were extremely beneficial to the tight adhesion of microbes in granules guo et al 2017 this was the most likely reason for the compact structure and high protein content in mps induced ags suggesting that it has better mechanical strength to resist onging hydraulic shear force these ags with rigid and stable structure could effectively diminish the concentration polarization by causing a strong scouring effect and reduce the filtration resistance by forming a highly permeable and loose bio cake thus mitigating membrane fouling zhang et al 2021 furthermore the upregulation of nitrogen metabolism pathway can enhance the nitrogen removal and promote the growth of other bacteria related to nitrogen metabolites in mps mbr zhang et al 2022 this makes mps induced ags more advantageous in terms of species diversity and nitrogen removal efficiency 4 3 implications to the best of our knowledge this is the first assessment of aerobic sludge granulation in the presence of mps in mbr system from the perspective of metazoan predation microbial community succession and proteomic level which will provide fundamental information and important implications for the widespread application of mps in ag mbr technology moreover the functions of mps proposed in this study included controlling the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria and regulating the species diversity in micro ecosystem by providing habitats for functional bacteria and affecting metazoans that phagocytize filamentous bacteria looking into the results may direct us in finding other potential inspiration such as applying mps to mitigate the collapse of ags systems due to bulking of filamentous bacteria during practical engineering applications notwithstanding this there remain regions with several aspects that need in depth investigation in the future from the perspective of economic cost mps with a mass ratio below 20 could be explored to achieve granulation development with the equivalent effects as 20 wmps wsludge addition on the other hand considering that the addition of grazing metazoans in biofilm controlled membrane systems can improve the membrane flux klein et al 2016 the impact of metazoans caused by mps on membrane fouling should be identified and addressed well moreover it is important to investigate how to optimize the scouring effect and maintain the size shape of mps induced ags for maximizing the mitigation of membrane fouling in mbr during long term operation 5 conclusions this study was the first to evaluate the interrelationships among metazoans microbial communities and protein expression during mps induced sludge granulation in mbr the results showed that the addition of mps enhanced the formation of large size ags with more compact structure richer protein and β polysaccharides content higher species diversity and significant nitrogen removal 33 12 42 33 leading to lower membrane fouling development rate the increase of available food caused by the addition of mps promoted the massive growth of rotifers 40 400 ml nematodes 20 140 ml and oligochaetes 2 420 ml during days 1 40 the porous structures and compound compositions in mps were used as powerful weapons to accelerate agglomeration with various bacteria to defend against predators which prompted the formation of initial granules meanwhile this process inhibited the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria and promoted the reproduction of functional bacteria involved in nitrogen removal proteomic analysis demonstrated that the upregulation of functional proteins in mps mbr was attributed to the decline in thiothrix abundance and increase in nitrospira abundance based on species annotation resulting in the enhancement of energy metabolisms nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids which facilitated the structural stability and functional diversity of mps induced ags these findings made an important contribution to the economic practicability of mps in ag mbr engineering application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15284,antibiotic stewardship is hindered by a lack of consideration for complicated environmental fate of antibiotics and their role in resistance development while the current methodology of eco toxicological risk assessment has not been fully protective against their potential to select for antibiotic resistance to address this problem we established a novel methodologic framework to perform comprehensive environmental risk assessment of antibiotics in terms of resistance development which was based on selection effect phenotype resistance level heteroresistance frequency as well as prevalence and stability of antibiotic resistance genes we tracked the contribution of antibiotic load reduction to the mitigation of environmental risk of resistance development by fate and transport modeling the method was instantiated in a lake river network basin complex system taking the taihu basin as a case study overall antibiotic load posed no eco toxicological risk but an average medium level environmental risk for resistance development in taihu lake the effect of antibiotic load on resistance risk was both seasonal dependent and category dependent while quinolones posed the greatest environmental risk for resistance development mass flow analysis indicated that temporal spatial variation in hydrological regime and antibiotic fate together exerted a significant effect on antibiotic load in the system by apportioning antibiotic load to riverine influx we identified the hotspots for load reduction and predicted the beneficial response of resistance risk under load reduction scenarios our study proposed a risk oriented strategy of basin scaled antibiotic load reduction for environmental risk control of resistance development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords environmental risk assessment resistance development antibiotic load reduction antibiotic stewardship river lake complex data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the extensive use of antibiotics and their subsequent release into treated and untreated sewage hospital wastewater aquaculture discharges and agricultural runoff have led to increasing ecological risk in aquatic environments liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 under constant antibiotic pressure the widespread emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance ar has become a significant global threat to public health and economy particularly as a collateral covid 19 pandemic effect with a conservatively estimated contribution to 10 million annual deaths 40 cases of serious illness and a cumulative loss of 100 trillion dollars worldwide by 2050 o neill 2016 notably the first who global report on ar surveillance described substantially higher resistance levels and rates of seven specific clinical pathogens in china than the global mean world health organization 2014 environmental dimension and propagation of ar have been widely recognized as an area for potential mitigation with several international efforts to raise the profile of this issue european commission 2019 united nation environment programme 2019 world health organisation 2015 in the past decades the chinese government has issued national stewardships to curtail overuse and emission of antibiotics as well as to contain ar ministry of health of china 2012 national health and family planning commission of china 2016 despite all these endeavors the capacity to provide effective management strategies for antibiotic load reduction at basin scale is often thwarted by our inability to attributing antibiotic loads to their primary sources particularly in the populated plain region containing densely crisscrossed river networks with undirectional flow patterns as strong evidence continues to demonstrate that antibiotics in the environment are closely related to the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb as well as antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges ågerstrand et al 2015 environmental fate of antibiotics and their role in ar development should be a key component of national strategy to improve antibiotic stewardship rosi marshall and kelly 2015 environmental behaviors of antibiotics and resistance determinants could be in principle attributable to various factors including geo hydrological conditions mass flow effects potential inputs from point sources and possible existence of biological drivers i e horizontal and or vertical gene transfer lee et al 2021 previous studies have explored methods for estimation of antibiotic emission using multimedia fate model zhang et al 2015a and source identification of antibiotics by sortation of land use or pollution source types using statistical approaches li et al 2016 zhang et al 2020c however these attempts are not sufficient to trace antibiotic load in river network lake complexes with complicated transport processes and to predict the benefits of risk control in response to antibiotic load reduction considering the alarming antibiotic emission and increasing ar it becomes inevitable to address the link between antibiotic source loadings and their environmental risk in particular for river lake complex systems to formulate mitigation strategies and support the integrated basin scale antibiotic stewardship another issue is the limited understanding of how ar levels translate to environmental risk and the inadequate agreement on antibiotic thresholds of possible concern concerns over these risks of antibiotic residues in the environment are mainly 1 the potential hazard of ingested antibiotic residues in the environment altering the human microbiome and promoting emergence and selection for bacteria resistance inhabiting the human body human health risk and 2 the potential hazard of creating a selection pressure on environmental microbiome and resulting in an increase in ar in the environment environmental risk ben et al 2019 ar acquisition through genetic mutations or horizontal vertical gene transfer under antibiotic pressure might be advantageous for environmental microbes allowing them to survive and proliferate as arb martínez 2008 antibiotic residues may pose strong selection on both human and natural microbial system qiao et al 2018 and args have become recognized as emerging environmental pollutant pruden et al 2006 although environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics in aquatic systems are significantly lower than point of therapeutic use concentrations or sub inhibitory concentrations of susceptible bacteria there is increasing evidence that suggests these concentrations may still select and enrich ar gullberg et al 2011 minimal selective concentrations mscs can be as much as three orders of magnitudes lower than minimum inhibitory concentrations mics gullberg et al 2011 as a result conventional eco toxicological mics adopted by current environmental risk assessment era are not always protective against potential ar selection european commission 2003 le page et al 2017 in light of these evidences a rigorous and standardized novel methodology performing era of antibiotics in terms of both resistance selective potential and environmental consequence needs to be developed to ensure that diffuse and point source discharges are safe ågerstrand et al 2015 murray et al 2021 recognizing that antibiotic emissions from livestock and poultry pharmaceuticals hospitals and other facilities represent hotspots for ar development it is critical that these discharges are minimized and managed effectively across the whole supply chain and roadmap for protection of ecosystem structure and function hence it remains highly ambitious to reasonably adjust and consolidate current era approaches by incorporating ar development and establishing risk based targets for safe antibiotic loads instead of antibiotic concentrations to reduce their environmental impact on overall health of aquatic ecosystems this study was to establish a novel method to identify major pollution sources for making antibiotic load reduction strategy at a basin scale with the key objective of controlling resistance development risk particularly for river network lake complexes taking the taihu lake basin as a typical case study we first investigated the profile of antibiotic residues and the associated ar in the system we established a new era methodological protocol for ar development in replacement of conventional eco toxicological era further we quantified the contribution of various pollution sources as well as inflowing rivers and their tributaries to antibiotic loads in different lake zones and their effects on resistance development risk to achieve a risk driven antibiotic stewardship we proposed an optimized strategy of basin scaled antibiotic load reduction serving for resistance risk control by hotspot tracking 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection we established 32 sampling sites in the eight sub zones of taihu lake 29 sampling sites in the main inflow outflow rivers of taihu lake and 1 site at the entrance exit of each river respectively we further carefully selected 40 sampling sites in the upstream river network in the huxi region northwest region of the taihu basin which accounts for the major partition of 70 pollution loads entering taihu lake yi et al 2017 location of all sampling sites was plotted in fig 1 the information of study area and all sampling sites were detailed in text s1 and tables s1 s2 samples of water sediment and aquatic biota were seasonally collected in triplicates at each site in january winter april spring july summer and october autumn of 2017 and 2018 respectively data of hydrological regime of the study area was collected from taihu basin authority of the ministry of water resources of china tables s3 s4 and fig s1 sampling and pre treatment method was detailed in text s2 2 2 analysis of antibiotic concentration in water sediment and aquatic biota samples through market investigation and literature survey we selected 33 antibiotics with high detection rate in taihu lake as target chemicals tables s5 s8 the list of target antibiotics covered most of the antibiotic categories that can be detected in china and covered all major human and veterinary uses and pharmaceutical production in the study area including seven classes of 9 macrolides 8 sulphonamides 4 tetracyclines 4 quinolones 3 β lactams 2 amphenicols and 3 aminoglycosides their abbreviation modes of action and physiochemical properties are listed in tables s9 s10 most antibiotics tested for resistance and their quantities were available for purchase without prescription from community pharmacies drug stores and healthcare facilities in the study area or online table s10 the extraction and analytical method are detailed in text s3 and table s11 target antibiotics were extracted from pretreated samples using autotrace solid phase extraction 280 system dionex sunnyvale ca usa with oasis hlb cartridge waters milford ma usa antibiotic measurement was performed with the high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry hplc esi ms ms system quality assurance and control for antibiotic analysis were conducted using standard addition coupled with internal standard method to determine the recoveries of target compounds and compensate for matrix effects detailed in text s4 2 3 analysis of cyanobacteria associated antibiotic resistance we chose cyanobacteria as model organisms for era of resistance development according to the recommendation of current regulatory era guidance cyanobacteria has been regarded as the most sensitive taxa of those currently recommended in the era framework of human pharmaceuticals european medicines agency 2018 as the indicative organism of ecosystem function cyanobacteria act as a crucial driver of arg acquisition and dissemination in freshwater environment and provide a hazardous reference of environmental resistome for the ecology and evolution of args and arbs in aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in this study three dominant cyanobacterial wild type species microcystis aeruginosa anabaena and synechococcus were analyzed for cyanobacteria associated ar profiles phenotype resistance level heteroresistance prevalence arg and mge relative abundance and resistance stability that were adopted in the era for resistance development analytical methods quality assurance and control detailed in text s5 2 3 1 cyanobacterial density and community composition the pre filtered water samples were passed through glass fiber filters whatman gf c 0 45 μm pore size to collect cyanobacterial cells cyanobacterial density was determined by microscopic cell counting at 400 1 000 magnification axioskop 40 pol carl zeiss göttingen germany taxonomic composition was identified at least to genus and to species whenever possible according to hu s standard protocol hu and wei 2006 2 3 2 resistance level of cyanobacterial population resistance level expressed by mic of the main cyanobacterial population was determined by standard microdilution method for bacteria recommended by the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing 2019 and the specific culturing conditions for cyanobacteria with little modification wang et al 2021 in brief cyanobacterial colonies randomly picked from stock cultures of field samples were organized by broth microdilutions in 96 well microplates containing 100 μl of freshly prepared bg11 medium and were grown in a range of different antibiotic concentrations for 14 days each in triplicate microplates were incubated in culture chamber at 25 0 0 5 c under a 14 10 h light dark photoperiod with a light intensity of 50 5 μe m s mic of single colonies from each population was considered the lowest antibiotic concentration that totally inhibited cyanobacterial cell growth the maintenance of antibiotic activity was verified by performing a quality control stability assay of using the bacterial standard strain e coli k12 e coli atcc 47076 2 3 3 cyanobacteria derived antibiotic heteroresistance the factor of antibiotic heteroresistance was adopted in the era framework for resistance development to prevent the misclassification of heteroresistance susceptible in traditional mic testing which can better reflect the phenotype resistance of cyanobacterial population and therefore avoid the underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistance prevalence and stability of antibiotic heteroresistance were determined by modified population analysis profile pap test as previously described band et al 2016 wang et al 2021 briefly serial dilutions of parallel growing cyanobacterial isolates were inoculated in 96 well plates supplemented with or without doubling dilutions of respective antibiotics bg11 broth media were made for each antibiotic at eight specific concentrations at 0 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 times the resistance level of the main population each in triplicate the proportion of cells growing eightfold above the highest concentration that did not affect the growth of the dominant population was defined as the hr frequency and calculated by dividing the cyanobacterial population growing in the presence of antibiotics by the total cell population without antibiotic selection a non resistant isolate was classified as heteroresistant if the number of colonies that grew eightfold above the resistance level of the main population was at least 0 0001 1 in 106 of the number that grew in the antibiotic free group fig s2 2 3 4 relative abundance of cyanobacteria associated args and mges relative abundance of cyanobacteria associated args and mges was determined by quantitative real time pcr qpcr and calculated by normalizing to 16s rrna gene copies wang et al 2020 cyanobacterial samples was subjected to lysozyme sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment for elimination of bacterial impurities and lyophilized for dry weight measurement total dna of approximately 100 mg cyanobacterial samples was extracted by a combination of physical and chemical cell lysing techniques using a mo bio power biofilm dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa with an extraction efficiency from 72 3 to 91 5 in this study the pellets were re suspended with lysing buffer provided with the kit and bead beaten with a vortex plate vortex genie 2 and vortex adapter bohemia ny usa the crude extracts were further processed following the manufacturer s instructions dna extraction yield and quality were checked via agarose gel electrophoresis and ultraviolet absorbance nanodrop nd2000 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and quantified using a quantifluor dsdna kit promega in a 96 well microplate reader spectramax m5 molecular devices six major classes of args transposase gene tnpa class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and 16s rrna gene were detected in triplicates by qpcr using the sybr green

genes stra aph 2 id aac 6 ib aada and multidrug resistance genes acra ceoa oprj flor qach 2 3 5 cyanobacteria associated resistance stability resistance stability was determined by a comparison of mic level and arg prevalence with the control at the endpoint of the successive passages without antibiotic selection wang et al 2021 antibiotic resistant colonies with decreased susceptibility selected from pap test medium were re isolated on similar antibiotic selective plates and grown in sterile bg11 medium supplemented with the same antibiotic selection pressure as the plate from which the resistant colonies originated to test the stability of resistance the cultures were then grown for 50 successive passages 1 ml inoculated into 50 ml of bg11 broth medium for each passage without antibiotic selection parental strains were grown in the absence of antibiotics as a control to confirm that gene amplifications were present before antibiotic selection and not induced by the antibiotics the mics were examined for resistance development at each passage and the resistance was deemed unstable if the mic clearly decreased or reverted to that of the parental isolate in at least one of the cultures in the absence of antibiotics for fitness cost measurements the relative growth rates were followed and normalized to that of the parental isolate aliquots from each culture were collected for dna extraction as described above gene amplification levels amplification copy number per plasmid plasmid copy numbers were verified by qpcr 2 4 environmental risk assessment for eco toxicological effect we performed the conventional era for eco toxicological effect by means of risk quotient rqe values according to the current era guidelines european commission 2003 the rqe values were expressed as the ratio of measured environmental concentration mec to predicted no toxicological effect concentration pnece table 1 pnece values were calculated from the toxicity data of green algae using an assessment factor of 1000 for acute toxicity and 100 for chronic toxicity of antibiotics respectively european commission 2003 ding et al 2017 yan et al 2013 acute and chronic toxicity data of green algae table s13 were predicted using the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar model v2 0 u s epa rqe value of 0 01 0 01 0 1 0 1 1 0 and 1 0 corresponds to no low medium and high risk respectively 2 5 environmental risk assessment for resistance development we established a novel era methodology for resistance development with a compartment combination of selection effect resistance genotype and phenotype conceptual framework shown in fig 2 risk quotient for resistance development rqr were expressed by risk quotient for selection effect for resistance rqre multiplied with risk factor rf consisting of resistance level r heteroresistance prevalence hr prevalence of args and mges p and resistance stability s terminology and formula of all parameters shown in table 1 rqre was estimated as the ratio between mec of antibiotics and predicted no effect concentration for the selection of resistance pnecr pnecr values of selected cyanobacterial species were derived from the mic database recommended by european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing 2019 and antimicrobial index knowledgebase http antibiotics toku e com according to the methodology described by bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 table s14 the lowest observed mics were adjusted for sample size in cases of limited number of observations and divided by an assessment factor of 10 for resistance selection which was adopted to account for the median value of observed differences between mics and mscs according to european medicines agency 2018 and previous studies of zhang 2020b hanna 2018 and gullberg 2011 uncertainty of era for resistance development resulting from model parameters was examined with monte carlo simulation text s6 and fig s3 2 6 estimation of antibiotic flux and mass load antibiotic flux of 33 main inflow and outflow rivers around taihu lake was seasonally estimated with the detected antibiotic concentrations multiplied by river flow rates antibiotic mass loads in water sediment and aquatic biota of taihu lake were estimated with the detected antibiotic concentrations multiplied by water volume sediment mass and aquatic biomass of different lake zones of taihu lake respectively data of antibiotic mass loads from six types of potential pollution sources 53 wwtps 26 hospitals 10 pharmaceuticals 18 industrial effluents 26 aquacultures and 16 livestock and poultry in the river network of huxi region were collected based on field survey estimation methods are detailed in text s7 fig s4 and tables s15 s17 2 7 multimedia fate modeling using fugacity aquivalence approach we established a modified version of the original level iii multimedia fugacity aquivalence model under a steady state but with non equilibrium conditions to characterize the multimedia fate of antibiotics in taihu lake as described in our previous work wang et al 2019b the model included expressions for inter and intra media transport by diffusion and advection as well as bioaccumulation and degradation in individual environmental matrices according to the steady state assumption and conservation law of mass the mass balance equations were established in terms of transfer fluxes for water water suspended solids fishes macrophytes algae and sediment water solids and benthic invertebrates bulk compartments parameters describing the environmental characteristics physio chemical properties and half lives of antibiotics in addition to inflow outflow flux were incorporated in the model to predict phase partitioning of antibiotics in different environmental media modeling details are described in texts s8 s9 figs s5 s7 and tables s18 s21 2 8 river network modeling for transfer of antibiotic load we employed mike11 model to simulate the hydrodynamic process and transport of antibiotic load in the river network of huxi region consisting of 292 river segments as described previously wang et al 2017a measured antibiotic load data representing the discharges of the nearest clustering pollution sources was added at the nearest node point of sampling site as external loading measured river flow data at the boundary node was used to drive the model the response of antibiotic load in taihu lake to the reduction scenarios for antibiotic riverine influx from huxi region was predicted under the mass flow balance equations an average relative error of 15 2 for the river network suggested a confident validity of model performance in hydrology predictions model results were in agreement with measured values at 11 main inflow river sites with an average relative error of 29 9 model setup calibration and validation were detailed in text s10 and figs s8 s10 2 9 statistical analysis statistical significance of box plots were calculated using a two sided student s two sample t test and p values were bonferroni corrected pairwise mantel and spearman s rank correlation analysis redundancy analysis rda and multivariate linear regression mlr models were performed to illustrate the impact of riverine influx on antibiotic load of taihu lake variation partitioning was conducted to reveal the effect of pollution sources on antibiotic load in the river network of huxi region network analysis was applied to visualize the co occurrence pattern of antibiotic loads in the river network of huxi region and in taihu lake under load reduction scenario method for statistical analysis was detailed in text s11 3 results 3 1 antibiotic residues and their environmental risk for resistance development antibiotic residue level was significantly higher in zhushan bay than in other lake zones p 0 05 fig 3 a total antibiotic concentration ranged between 25 51 95 94 ng l in water phase and between 0 11 9 32 ng g in sediment phase of taihu lake table s22 out of 33 target antibiotics four dominant antibiotics were detected in all lake samples tables s23 s24 while sulfonamides and quinolones were the major antibiotic classes fig 3b for water samples highest concentrations in taihu lake were observed for sulfamethoxazole all samples 7 25 3 83 ng l max 15 92 ng l in meiliang bay ciprofloxacin all samples 4 05 5 02 ng l max 18 50 ng l in meiliang bay ofloxacin all samples 3 66 3 48 ng l max 13 92 ng l in eastern zone trimethoprim all samples 3 28 3 38 ng l max 12 40 ng l in zhushan bay

as shown in fig 3c the antibiotic level posed no eco toxicological risk in all lake zones but their potential environmental risk for resistance development was generally rated at medium level 0 01 rqr 1 0 with an average rqr value of 0 38 even climbing up to high level rqr 1 0 in zhushan bay meiliang bay and gonghu bay data shown in table s26 high level of environmental risk for resistance development was mostly observed in april and october with maximum value reaching 13 47 fig 3d 3 2 antibiotic loads and their effect on environmental risk for resistance development antibiotic load varied between 13 20 363 64 g km2 with 95 cases no more than 197 g km2 fig 4 a with antibiotic load increasing resistance level increased up to 64 folds above that of the main population and heteroresistance level increased up to 3 48 at 95 confidence level risk factor for arg prevalence and stability ranged between 8 24 92 64 and 0 008 0 69 at 95 confidence level respectively seasonal variation in cyanobacterial density and community composition cyanobacteria associated resistance level heteroresistance prevalence relative abundance of args and mges and resistance stability detected in different lake zones was shown in fig s11 and table s27 quinolones were the most likely to pose the greatest environmental risk for resistance development while macrolides and sulfonamides were the least fig 4b overall both cyanobacteria derived phenotype and genotype resistance level showed a significantly positive relationship with antibiotic load in the water phase under the same level of antibiotic load a higher environmental risk for resistance development was likely to be induced in april and october than in january and july 3 3 source identification of antibiotic load at a basin level fate model simulations revealed that antibiotic degradation and bioaccumulation were the primary output flux in the water phase with 67 6 contribution followed by deposition to sediment and direct outflow fig 5 a in the sediment phase over 99 9 of input flux was attributed to the diffusion process of sedimentation from water phase while degradation only contributed 39 7 of output flux according to the output of fugacity model and mass inventory under steady state 93 3 99 3 of total antibiotic load was distributed in sediment phase fig 5b in both water and sediment phases the average antibiotic mass load was substantially higher in zhushan bay and meiliang bay than in other lake zones four lake zones were dominated by antibiotic influx of 3 08 3 92 g km2 a in the water phase while the other four lakes zones were dominated by outflux of 0 95 3 42 g km2 a hydraulic residence time hrt of most lake zones ranged between 20 5 132 6 d while meiliang bay possessed a notably long hrt of 354 3 d huxi region and zhexi region contributed 76 1 and 22 1 of antibiotic influx respectively fig 5c pca mlr revealed that antibiotic influx of inflowing rivers i5 i6 i7 and i11 in huxi region explained most of antibiotic load in zhushan bay and meiliang bay six types of potential sources of antibiotic load were comprehensively apportioned and the assemblages of predominant sources with the largest contribution to antibiotic load in huxi region were identified fig 5d as shown in the hotspot map antibiotic load increased from upstream to downstream along the transfer route fig s3 while wwtps 24 5 pharmaceuticals 12 2 and livestock and poultry 10 1 occupied the largest contribution of antibiotic load fig s12 3 4 strategy of antibiotic load reduction based on resistance specific risk mitigation based on the load risk relationship almost all classes of antibiotic load in zhushan bay posed high level of environmental risk for resistance development fig 6 a quinolones presented high risk level in six lake zones in the load reduction scenario targeting a risk transition from high level to medium level load reduction of 30 macrolides 74 1 tetracyclines 42 6 60 6 aminoglycosides 40 0 84 5 amphenicols 3 1 78 3 β lactams and 43 2 92 3 quinolones were recommended for different lake zones respectively the recommended load reduction strategy of huxi region and the expected outcome of environmental risk for resistance development was described in fig 6b to achieve the goal of environmental risk control for resistance development in lake zones 13 including gehu lake and 4 inflowing rivers out of 55 sites in huxi region were screened out for 22 9 29 7 of load reduction which led to 5 8 35 4 of collateral reduction of antibiotic load in 18 sites including 11 inflowing rivers in the load reduction scenario antibiotic load of zhushan bay and meiliang bay were predicted to decrease by 32 8 and 21 3 with 97 4 and 92 1 of explanation respectively a corresponding decrease of 9 4 29 5 in antibiotic load of other lake zones was also expected accordingly rqr of all lake zones was expected to drop below the high risk threshold of 1 0 4 discussion 4 1 novel methodology for environmental risk assessment of resistance development to better characterize the safe release limit of antibiotics and closely align to the current era method this study proposed new era terms describing consequences of resistance development resistance level heteroresistance frequency prevalence and stability of args and mges etc as a significant improvement of simple estimate of selective effect comparison to selective concentration era involves dealing with uncertainties while trying to strike a balance between the probability for an event to occur the severity of potential outcome and the costs or consequences involved in managing the risk chapman et al 1998 in the context of current regulatory guidance standardized test methodologies have not yet been established to help ensure reliable and repeatable results for the experimental determination of pnecr which may require further knowledge on resistance mechanisms model variability and the application to mixed communities that vary over time and space le page et al 2017 this emphasizes the future need for the development of validated experimental assays to more accurately evaluate mscs in complex and simple systems as a result theoretical approach for pnecr advocated by bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 based on mic data in the eucast database provides a valuable alternative as part of a broader evidence based approach to era since our pnecr values were theoretically derived from mic data owing to the absence of experimentally derived pnecr values for most target antibiotics the size of assessment factor would be an important factor of uncertainty in the era process reflecting how far the precautionary principle of resistance selection needs to be enforced gullberg et al 2011 reported experimentally derived mscs in laboratory strain competition experiments to be in the range of 1 230 to 1 4 of mic for different antibiotics and an assessment factor of up to 230 for theoretically derived pnecr could be warranted however establishing pnecr by selecting the lowest mic of the most sensitive species in eucast and assuming the maximal described difference between the size adjusted mic and msc could be overly conservative bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 instead we adopted a more modest assessment factor of 10 corresponding to the median mic msc ratio as indicated by le page et al 2017 an assessment factor of 10 will provide a suitable safety margin to account for selection below the mic and conversely that adjusting the mic down to account for species numbers and then applying a further assessment factor of 10 isn t overprotective it should be cautioned that these theoretically derived pnecr might lead to possible underestimation of mic msc ratio for certain antibiotics with high selective potency overall theoretically derived pnecr with an assessment factor of 10 provides an efficient and cost effective method to address concerns and prioritise legacy antibiotics that have already been registered and are present in the environment although the detected antibiotic concentrations in taihu lake were generally lower or comparable to other lakes in china li et al 2019 liu et al 2018 and worldwide yang et al 2018 the potential environmental risk for resistance development of these target antibiotics was observed to be significantly higher than their eco toxicological risk notably the drinking water sources distributed in gonghu bay with relatively low antibiotic concentrations exhibited a medium to high level of environmental risk for resistance development fig s13 the mics or mscs relevant for clinical breakpoint of therapeutic process is inadequate to assess antibiotic susceptibility and resistance evolution with low levels of antibiotics ben et al 2019 berendonk et al 2015 when the concentrations are lower than the mscs bacteria may trigger different cellular responses or alter gene expression as well as induce gene mutation and horizontal gene transfer leading to ar selection as a longstanding assumption gullberg et al 2014 the interpretation of holistic parameters of ar enrichment and dissemination containing relative abundances diversity and stability of args and mges is therefore recommended le page et al 2017 as it is essential to establish direct link bridges between antibiotic selection and resistance evolution we caution that novel era methodology tracking resistance development should employ a combination of indicating factors including selection effect driven by antibiotic pressure probability of ar emergence together with resistance prevalence and persistence specific consequence of ar selection to be robust besides of the selection effect heteroresistance prevalence and resistance stability were apportioned with relatively high weight coefficient in the framework our previous study has revealed that examination of heteroresistance prevalence aid to prevent the misclassification of heteroresistance as susceptibility in traditional mic testing which can better reflect the phenotype resistance of cyanobacterial population and therefore avoid the underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistance wang et al 2021 resistance stability was tested to verify that phenotype and genotype resistance of clones isolated from the resistant subpopulation did not decrease in the absence of antibiotic pressure unstable resistance usually conferring with high fitness cost act as drivers for the cyanobacterial population to revert to susceptibility under non antibiotic selective conditions andersson et al 2019 which substantially decreased the potential hazards of resistance selection and arg dissemination we advocate consideration of these parameters as indispensable protective measure against overprotection or underestimation for resistance development only until more data are obtained to support that new methodologies for ar assessment are developed or protection goals are updated while this study provided a novel methodologic framework to explore such a complex system of antibiotic resistance the model has been simplified in several aspects and there are scopes for further improvement our research motivates those who are readily curious to examine the interdependence of rqr and rf by adjusting weight coefficients which may expand the practicality and promote the standardization of this model the era framework aims to establish the safe concentrations for the protection of wildlife populations aquatic ecosystem structure and function cyanobacteria which have been used as model organisms in the current regulatory era guidance were the most sensitive taxa of those currently recommended in the era framework of human pharmaceuticals european medicines agency 2018 cyanobacteria are important primary producer of oxygen and carbohydrates and photosynthetic organisms in the aquatic food web huisman et al 2018 as the largest group of gram negative photosynthetic prokaryotes cyanobacteria are structurally similar to bacteria and are equally sensitive as other bacteria clinically relevant bacteria and v fischeri and more sensitive than macrophytes microalgae and metazoans fishes and invertebrates le page et al 2017 cyanobacteria are exposed to antibiotic pollution and in straight contact with native bacteria harbouring multiple args and related mges dias et al 2019 our previous study demonstrated that cyanobacteria which are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems acted as a significant reservoir and source for the acquisition and dissemination of args between aquatic biotic elements wang et al 2020 it has been revealed that cyanobacterial blooms are a crucial driver of arg diffusion and enrichment in freshwater providing a hazardous reference of environmental resistome for the ecology and evolution of args and arbs in aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2020a since potential bias might be introduced in our era analysis due to variation of taxa sensitivity to antibiotics the inclusion of a wider range of environmentally relevant bacterial species and their resistance profile in other environmental matrices was recommended to improve the novel era framework for resistance development in future works 4 2 effect of antibiotic load on environmental risk for resistance development and its hydrological impacts our study revealed that the effect of antibiotic mass loadings on environmental risk for resistance development should be deciphered in terms of both temperature and antibiotic category the complex and inconsistent nature of their relationship could be attributed to different environmental fates related to args and antibiotics themselves in different environmental settings bacterial selection responses to antibiotics may not occur in a concentration dependent manner in bacterial communities presumably due to a cross protective effect that resistant bacteria may break down extracellular antibiotics to the benefit of nearby susceptible bacteria murray et al 2018 several processes were reported to contribute to the observed decrease of resistance determinants during flood season including dilution by additional water inflows via tributary inputs biological deterioration e g cell metabolism accompanied with cyanobacterial bloom predation etc and cell sedimentation lee et al 2021 although resistance persistence could be facilitated by low water temperature during dry season bacterial assimilation of args was likely to be simultaneously hampered due to the limited conjugative transfer ability of mges wang et al 2020 on the other hand the greatest risk for resistance development of quinolones should not only be attributed to their highest load our approach using the currently available data suggested that quinolones originated from sewage effluents of wwtps and pharmaceuticals table s17 posed a relatively higher risk level for resistance development than other antibiotics i e sulfamethoxazoles mainly originated from aquaculture livestock and poultry breeding wastewater at the same level of antibiotic load fig s14a as shown in fig s14b quinolones presented a higher risk factor than other classes of antibiotics exhibiting their greater ability to facilitate the resistance development quinolones which are broad spectrum antibiotics available for both veterinary and medical use can be purchased without prescription from community pharmacies drug stores healthcare facilities in the study area or online table s10 the high load of quinolones such as norfloxacin and ofloxacin could be attributed to their extensive application as oral medication injection and clinical medicine for external use in the treatment or prevention of a variety of bacterial infections previous studies found quinolones to be the most prescribed antibiotics for human epidemic prevention aldred et al 2013 and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants to be prevalent in the taihu basin zhang et al 2015b although there was significant removal of quinolones through some advanced water treatment technologies ozone disinfection nanofiltration biodegradation activated carbon filtration etc in wwtps dorival garcía et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the medical wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and domestic sewage from hospitals and households draining into wwtps contributed a large amount of quinolone load through the effluent and dewatered sludge plasmid encoded and highly transferrable quinolone resistance qnr genes were the most common and significant form of resistance associated with the use of quinolones in non clinical environments hernández et al 2011 low level quinolone resistance has been found to more facilitate the emergence and stability of higher level resistance in the presence of quinolones at therapeutic levels than other sort of antibiotics aldred et al 2014 robicsek et al 2006 pnecr values of quinolones were generally comparable to other classes of antibiotics even higher than tetracyclines and β lactams demonstrating that overprotection against selection should not be claimed for pnecr of quinolones fig s14c the effect of antibiotic load on risk for resistance development was exploited based on the assumption that antibiotics within the same class would have additive effects on risk of resistance selection among the target antibiotics quinolones are bactericidal antibiotics which refer to killing the bacteria directly while the others are bacteriostatic antibiotics which refer to slowing down the reproduction of bacteria and allowing host defenses to kill them table s9 antibiotics within the same classes have the same mode of action and their corresponding resistance mechanism are similar tables s9 and s12 gullberg et al 2014 supported this assumption that combination of various concentrations of antibiotics with same mechanism of action resulted in additive effect or less than additive effect while those with different mechanisms of action could interfere with the other and therefore result in either greater or lesser combination effects stanton et al 2020 also assumed that antibiotics within the same class would have an additive effect although this assumption has not been tested and should be considered in future studies based on this assumption singer et al 2019 explored risk based targets for prescription reduction of macrolides and quinolones to alleviate the hazard of resistance selection however the threshold for resistance selection might still be over or underestimated with synergistic and antagonistic interactions increasing in frequency with the number of antibiotics tekin et al 2018 brochado et al 2018 demonstrated that some antibiotic combinations within the same class could target the same cellular process and exhibit a synergistic effect while the others were less inhibitory than expected non additive because one s cellular response helped to buffer the effects from another notably cyanobacteria in the aquatic environment are most likely to be exposed to antibiotic mixtures rather than single substances which may show a synergistic effect and further lower the mscs gullberg et al 2014 although extensive studies have been conducted on the combined effect of antibiotic mixtures on cyanobacterial growth gonzález pleiter et al 2013 wang et al 2017b wang et al 2019a the understanding of such effect on resistance selection in cyanobacterial species is limited roemhild et al 2022 summarized that synergistic and antagonistic antibiotic interactions hysteresis in temporal interactions between antibiotics that arise from microbial physiology and interactions between antibiotics and resistance mutations can cause collateral sensitivity or cross resistance combination effect of antibiotics with different action mechanisms interfering with each other could be an important contributing factor to the transfer and persistence of multidrug resistance plasmids even with each individual antibiotic present below msc gullberg et al 2014 which might lead to underestimation of ar risk in a complex system furthermore mixture effects with potentially relevant chemicals in the aquatic environments such as biocides metals herbicides pesticides and other classes of pharmaceuticals might have synergistic or antagonistic impacts on resistance selection singer et al 2019 or co select for resistance genes in bacterial communities murray et al 2019 hence the relationship between single exposure laboratory testing and mixture effects with antibiotics other co selecting chemical compounds on msc is unknown and requires further efforts as part of a holistic era for resistance development temporal spatial variation in volumetric inflow pattern of river network and hydraulic residence time of different lake zones exerted a significant effect on antibiotic load in this river lake system the increasing antibiotic load from upstream to downstream in the river network of huxi region indicated that local diffusive antibiotic inputs along the transfer route were more influential than diverted water from the yangtze river comparing total antibiotic concentration and mass loadings we demonstrate that reduced rainfall and surface runoff during dry season resulted in increased antibiotic concentration in the inflowing rivers of zhushan bay and meiliang bay while antibiotic influx did not vary across seasons with the exception of summer fig s15 considering the combination of their relatively lower antibiotic concentrations and riverine influx during flood season of taihu basin increased rainfall and or cleaner tributaries was likely to dilute the inflow water with antibiotics degrading and or settling to sediment intensified by high temperature and clumping of fine particles respectively ott et al 2021 xu et al 2018 our previous study has pointed out that more pollution loadings derived from local sources were flushed toward downstream through the great canal during flood season causing less impact on the water quality of taihu lake yi et al 2017 despite a short retention time and high water exchange frequency zhushan bay directly received 64 8 of total antibiotic influx of taihu lake explaining its high antibiotic inventory accordingly we found that meiliang bay dominated by antibiotic outflux possessed the highest antibiotic inventories in both water and sediment phase due to limited attenuation caused by degradation and resuspension as a result of longer hrt and weaker disturbance than other lake zones tang et al 2020 4 3 source identification and risk oriented reduction strategy of antibiotic load in the present study a systematic methodology taking account of compartment dependent aspects between antibiotic load and dynamic risk response on the basis of experimental and modeling approaches was proposed to provide antibiotic reduction strategy targeting for environmental risk control of ar development for the purpose of effectively decreasing high level risk for resistance development in certain lake zones dense populated clustering urban area causing massive sewage wastewater and large consumption of antibiotics for human medicine and agricultural therapy and promoters for ensuring meat supply were identified as hotspots in the river network of huxi region which called for achievable load reduction by full scale advanced water treatment e g ozone disinfection and biological activated carbon filtration with stricter standard and higher cost wang et al 2019b river lake complex systems are tightly connected terrestrial ecosystems jointly impacted by natural and anthropogenic conditions gao et al 2014 where inflowing rivers are important aisles in the migration of terrigenous pollutants into lakes and largely exert a fundamental control over the ecological risk status of lakes zhang et al 2019 especially source identification of antibiotic loads in lake river complex still remained challenging due to the interaction of contamination sources and the complexity of transportation and fate process involved with physical chemical and biological dynamic mechanisms although several attempts have been made for source tracking of args in interconnected river lake system chen et al 2020 lee et al 2021 few data have been available to support the limit of antibiotic discharges against ar development le page et al 2017 here we combined statistical analysis with fate and transport modeling to apportion contribution of load transport from potential sources in lake river complex system and to predict the responses of riverine influx and antibiotic inventories of taihu lake under load reduction scenarios our previous studies have applied multimedia fugacity based fate modeling and mass balance analysis to simulate emission and migration of tetracyclines in river catchments chen et al 2017 wang et al 2019b verifying the applicability of this approach however when tracking source contribution to antibiotic influx antibiotic mass loadings in reclamation runoffs and untreated rural sewage were not taken into consideration since the required precise data is severely limited meanwhile bioaccumulation potential of other aquatic biota in the food web zhou et al 2020 leading to underestimation of antibiotic load needed to be further clarified these uncertainties together enhanced the inference that environmental risk for resistance development in taihu lake was possibly underestimated and huxi region might have contributed a larger proportion of antibiotic influx than our estimation 5 conclusions our work is one of the first to establish a novel era methodology for resistance development and proposed a risk oriented antibiotic load reduction strategy in lake river basin systems we conclude that environmental risk for resistance development and antibiotic load are interlinked phenomena which should be deciphered by both hydrological regime and environmental fate of antibiotics the novel era methodology for resistance development draws a more holistic understanding of ecological impact of antibiotic load than the conventional eco toxicological effect adopted by current era guidelines which is not always protective against potential resistance selection despite multiple sources of uncertainty that exist in fate and transport modeling this risk targeted strategy of load reduction is expected to provide a coherent implication for basin scale antibiotic stewardship and

15284,antibiotic stewardship is hindered by a lack of consideration for complicated environmental fate of antibiotics and their role in resistance development while the current methodology of eco toxicological risk assessment has not been fully protective against their potential to select for antibiotic resistance to address this problem we established a novel methodologic framework to perform comprehensive environmental risk assessment of antibiotics in terms of resistance development which was based on selection effect phenotype resistance level heteroresistance frequency as well as prevalence and stability of antibiotic resistance genes we tracked the contribution of antibiotic load reduction to the mitigation of environmental risk of resistance development by fate and transport modeling the method was instantiated in a lake river network basin complex system taking the taihu basin as a case study overall antibiotic load posed no eco toxicological risk but an average medium level environmental risk for resistance development in taihu lake the effect of antibiotic load on resistance risk was both seasonal dependent and category dependent while quinolones posed the greatest environmental risk for resistance development mass flow analysis indicated that temporal spatial variation in hydrological regime and antibiotic fate together exerted a significant effect on antibiotic load in the system by apportioning antibiotic load to riverine influx we identified the hotspots for load reduction and predicted the beneficial response of resistance risk under load reduction scenarios our study proposed a risk oriented strategy of basin scaled antibiotic load reduction for environmental risk control of resistance development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords environmental risk assessment resistance development antibiotic load reduction antibiotic stewardship river lake complex data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the extensive use of antibiotics and their subsequent release into treated and untreated sewage hospital wastewater aquaculture discharges and agricultural runoff have led to increasing ecological risk in aquatic environments liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 under constant antibiotic pressure the widespread emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance ar has become a significant global threat to public health and economy particularly as a collateral covid 19 pandemic effect with a conservatively estimated contribution to 10 million annual deaths 40 cases of serious illness and a cumulative loss of 100 trillion dollars worldwide by 2050 o neill 2016 notably the first who global report on ar surveillance described substantially higher resistance levels and rates of seven specific clinical pathogens in china than the global mean world health organization 2014 environmental dimension and propagation of ar have been widely recognized as an area for potential mitigation with several international efforts to raise the profile of this issue european commission 2019 united nation environment programme 2019 world health organisation 2015 in the past decades the chinese government has issued national stewardships to curtail overuse and emission of antibiotics as well as to contain ar ministry of health of china 2012 national health and family planning commission of china 2016 despite all these endeavors the capacity to provide effective management strategies for antibiotic load reduction at basin scale is often thwarted by our inability to attributing antibiotic loads to their primary sources particularly in the populated plain region containing densely crisscrossed river networks with undirectional flow patterns as strong evidence continues to demonstrate that antibiotics in the environment are closely related to the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb as well as antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges ågerstrand et al 2015 environmental fate of antibiotics and their role in ar development should be a key component of national strategy to improve antibiotic stewardship rosi marshall and kelly 2015 environmental behaviors of antibiotics and resistance determinants could be in principle attributable to various factors including geo hydrological conditions mass flow effects potential inputs from point sources and possible existence of biological drivers i e horizontal and or vertical gene transfer lee et al 2021 previous studies have explored methods for estimation of antibiotic emission using multimedia fate model zhang et al 2015a and source identification of antibiotics by sortation of land use or pollution source types using statistical approaches li et al 2016 zhang et al 2020c however these attempts are not sufficient to trace antibiotic load in river network lake complexes with complicated transport processes and to predict the benefits of risk control in response to antibiotic load reduction considering the alarming antibiotic emission and increasing ar it becomes inevitable to address the link between antibiotic source loadings and their environmental risk in particular for river lake complex systems to formulate mitigation strategies and support the integrated basin scale antibiotic stewardship another issue is the limited understanding of how ar levels translate to environmental risk and the inadequate agreement on antibiotic thresholds of possible concern concerns over these risks of antibiotic residues in the environment are mainly 1 the potential hazard of ingested antibiotic residues in the environment altering the human microbiome and promoting emergence and selection for bacteria resistance inhabiting the human body human health risk and 2 the potential hazard of creating a selection pressure on environmental microbiome and resulting in an increase in ar in the environment environmental risk ben et al 2019 ar acquisition through genetic mutations or horizontal vertical gene transfer under antibiotic pressure might be advantageous for environmental microbes allowing them to survive and proliferate as arb martínez 2008 antibiotic residues may pose strong selection on both human and natural microbial system qiao et al 2018 and args have become recognized as emerging environmental pollutant pruden et al 2006 although environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics in aquatic systems are significantly lower than point of therapeutic use concentrations or sub inhibitory concentrations of susceptible bacteria there is increasing evidence that suggests these concentrations may still select and enrich ar gullberg et al 2011 minimal selective concentrations mscs can be as much as three orders of magnitudes lower than minimum inhibitory concentrations mics gullberg et al 2011 as a result conventional eco toxicological mics adopted by current environmental risk assessment era are not always protective against potential ar selection european commission 2003 le page et al 2017 in light of these evidences a rigorous and standardized novel methodology performing era of antibiotics in terms of both resistance selective potential and environmental consequence needs to be developed to ensure that diffuse and point source discharges are safe ågerstrand et al 2015 murray et al 2021 recognizing that antibiotic emissions from livestock and poultry pharmaceuticals hospitals and other facilities represent hotspots for ar development it is critical that these discharges are minimized and managed effectively across the whole supply chain and roadmap for protection of ecosystem structure and function hence it remains highly ambitious to reasonably adjust and consolidate current era approaches by incorporating ar development and establishing risk based targets for safe antibiotic loads instead of antibiotic concentrations to reduce their environmental impact on overall health of aquatic ecosystems this study was to establish a novel method to identify major pollution sources for making antibiotic load reduction strategy at a basin scale with the key objective of controlling resistance development risk particularly for river network lake complexes taking the taihu lake basin as a typical case study we first investigated the profile of antibiotic residues and the associated ar in the system we established a new era methodological protocol for ar development in replacement of conventional eco toxicological era further we quantified the contribution of various pollution sources as well as inflowing rivers and their tributaries to antibiotic loads in different lake zones and their effects on resistance development risk to achieve a risk driven antibiotic stewardship we proposed an optimized strategy of basin scaled antibiotic load reduction serving for resistance risk control by hotspot tracking 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection we established 32 sampling sites in the eight sub zones of taihu lake 29 sampling sites in the main inflow outflow rivers of taihu lake and 1 site at the entrance exit of each river respectively we further carefully selected 40 sampling sites in the upstream river network in the huxi region northwest region of the taihu basin which accounts for the major partition of 70 pollution loads entering taihu lake yi et al 2017 location of all sampling sites was plotted in fig 1 the information of study area and all sampling sites were detailed in text s1 and tables s1 s2 samples of water sediment and aquatic biota were seasonally collected in triplicates at each site in january winter april spring july summer and october autumn of 2017 and 2018 respectively data of hydrological regime of the study area was collected from taihu basin authority of the ministry of water resources of china tables s3 s4 and fig s1 sampling and pre treatment method was detailed in text s2 2 2 analysis of antibiotic concentration in water sediment and aquatic biota samples through market investigation and literature survey we selected 33 antibiotics with high detection rate in taihu lake as target chemicals tables s5 s8 the list of target antibiotics covered most of the antibiotic categories that can be detected in china and covered all major human and veterinary uses and pharmaceutical production in the study area including seven classes of 9 macrolides 8 sulphonamides 4 tetracyclines 4 quinolones 3 β lactams 2 amphenicols and 3 aminoglycosides their abbreviation modes of action and physiochemical properties are listed in tables s9 s10 most antibiotics tested for resistance and their quantities were available for purchase without prescription from community pharmacies drug stores and healthcare facilities in the study area or online table s10 the extraction and analytical method are detailed in text s3 and table s11 target antibiotics were extracted from pretreated samples using autotrace solid phase extraction 280 system dionex sunnyvale ca usa with oasis hlb cartridge waters milford ma usa antibiotic measurement was performed with the high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry hplc esi ms ms system quality assurance and control for antibiotic analysis were conducted using standard addition coupled with internal standard method to determine the recoveries of target compounds and compensate for matrix effects detailed in text s4 2 3 analysis of cyanobacteria associated antibiotic resistance we chose cyanobacteria as model organisms for era of resistance development according to the recommendation of current regulatory era guidance cyanobacteria has been regarded as the most sensitive taxa of those currently recommended in the era framework of human pharmaceuticals european medicines agency 2018 as the indicative organism of ecosystem function cyanobacteria act as a crucial driver of arg acquisition and dissemination in freshwater environment and provide a hazardous reference of environmental resistome for the ecology and evolution of args and arbs in aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in this study three dominant cyanobacterial wild type species microcystis aeruginosa anabaena and synechococcus were analyzed for cyanobacteria associated ar profiles phenotype resistance level heteroresistance prevalence arg and mge relative abundance and resistance stability that were adopted in the era for resistance development analytical methods quality assurance and control detailed in text s5 2 3 1 cyanobacterial density and community composition the pre filtered water samples were passed through glass fiber filters whatman gf c 0 45 μm pore size to collect cyanobacterial cells cyanobacterial density was determined by microscopic cell counting at 400 1 000 magnification axioskop 40 pol carl zeiss göttingen germany taxonomic composition was identified at least to genus and to species whenever possible according to hu s standard protocol hu and wei 2006 2 3 2 resistance level of cyanobacterial population resistance level expressed by mic of the main cyanobacterial population was determined by standard microdilution method for bacteria recommended by the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing 2019 and the specific culturing conditions for cyanobacteria with little modification wang et al 2021 in brief cyanobacterial colonies randomly picked from stock cultures of field samples were organized by broth microdilutions in 96 well microplates containing 100 μl of freshly prepared bg11 medium and were grown in a range of different antibiotic concentrations for 14 days each in triplicate microplates were incubated in culture chamber at 25 0 0 5 c under a 14 10 h light dark photoperiod with a light intensity of 50 5 μe m s mic of single colonies from each population was considered the lowest antibiotic concentration that totally inhibited cyanobacterial cell growth the maintenance of antibiotic activity was verified by performing a quality control stability assay of using the bacterial standard strain e coli k12 e coli atcc 47076 2 3 3 cyanobacteria derived antibiotic heteroresistance the factor of antibiotic heteroresistance was adopted in the era framework for resistance development to prevent the misclassification of heteroresistance susceptible in traditional mic testing which can better reflect the phenotype resistance of cyanobacterial population and therefore avoid the underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistance prevalence and stability of antibiotic heteroresistance were determined by modified population analysis profile pap test as previously described band et al 2016 wang et al 2021 briefly serial dilutions of parallel growing cyanobacterial isolates were inoculated in 96 well plates supplemented with or without doubling dilutions of respective antibiotics bg11 broth media were made for each antibiotic at eight specific concentrations at 0 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 times the resistance level of the main population each in triplicate the proportion of cells growing eightfold above the highest concentration that did not affect the growth of the dominant population was defined as the hr frequency and calculated by dividing the cyanobacterial population growing in the presence of antibiotics by the total cell population without antibiotic selection a non resistant isolate was classified as heteroresistant if the number of colonies that grew eightfold above the resistance level of the main population was at least 0 0001 1 in 106 of the number that grew in the antibiotic free group fig s2 2 3 4 relative abundance of cyanobacteria associated args and mges relative abundance of cyanobacteria associated args and mges was determined by quantitative real time pcr qpcr and calculated by normalizing to 16s rrna gene copies wang et al 2020 cyanobacterial samples was subjected to lysozyme sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment for elimination of bacterial impurities and lyophilized for dry weight measurement total dna of approximately 100 mg cyanobacterial samples was extracted by a combination of physical and chemical cell lysing techniques using a mo bio power biofilm dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa with an extraction efficiency from 72 3 to 91 5 in this study the pellets were re suspended with lysing buffer provided with the kit and bead beaten with a

spectramax m5 molecular devices six major classes of args transposase gene tnpa class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and 16s rrna gene were detected in triplicates by qpcr using the sybr green

level and arg prevalence with the control at the endpoint of the successive passages without antibiotic selection wang et al 2021 antibiotic resistant colonies with decreased susceptibility selected from pap test medium were re isolated on similar antibiotic selective plates and grown in sterile bg11 medium supplemented with the same antibiotic selection pressure as the plate from which the resistant colonies originated to test the stability of resistance the cultures were then grown for 50 successive passages 1 ml inoculated into 50 ml of bg11 broth medium for each passage without antibiotic selection parental strains were grown in the absence of antibiotics as a control to confirm that gene amplifications were present before antibiotic selection and not induced by the antibiotics the mics were examined for resistance development at each passage and the resistance was deemed unstable if the mic clearly decreased or reverted to that of the parental isolate in at least one of the cultures in the absence of antibiotics for fitness cost measurements the relative growth rates were followed and normalized to that of the parental isolate aliquots from each culture were collected for dna extraction as described above gene amplification levels amplification copy number per plasmid plasmid copy numbers were verified by qpcr 2 4 environmental risk assessment for eco toxicological effect we performed the conventional era for eco toxicological effect by means of risk quotient rqe values according to the current era guidelines european commission 2003 the rqe values were expressed as the ratio of measured environmental concentration mec to predicted no toxicological effect concentration pnece table 1 pnece values were calculated from the toxicity data of green algae using an assessment factor of 1000 for acute toxicity and 100 for chronic toxicity of antibiotics respectively european commission 2003 ding et al 2017 yan et al 2013 acute and chronic toxicity data of green algae table s13 were predicted using the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar model v2 0 u s epa rqe value of 0 01 0 01 0 1 0 1 1 0 and 1 0 corresponds to no low medium and high risk respectively 2 5 environmental risk assessment for resistance development we established a novel era methodology for resistance development with a compartment combination of selection effect resistance genotype and phenotype conceptual framework shown in fig 2 risk quotient for resistance development rqr were expressed by risk quotient for selection effect for resistance rqre multiplied with risk factor rf consisting of resistance level r heteroresistance prevalence hr prevalence of args and mges p and resistance stability s terminology and formula of all parameters shown in table 1 rqre was estimated as the ratio between mec of antibiotics and predicted no effect concentration for the selection of resistance pnecr pnecr values of selected cyanobacterial species were derived from the mic database recommended by european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing 2019 and antimicrobial index knowledgebase http antibiotics toku e com according to the methodology described by bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 table s14 the lowest observed mics were adjusted for sample size in cases of limited number of observations and divided by an assessment factor of 10 for resistance selection which was adopted to account for the median value of observed differences between mics and mscs according to european medicines agency 2018 and previous studies of zhang 2020b hanna 2018 and gullberg 2011 uncertainty of era for resistance development resulting from model parameters was examined with monte carlo simulation text s6 and fig s3 2 6 estimation of antibiotic flux and mass load antibiotic flux of 33 main inflow and outflow rivers around taihu lake was seasonally estimated with the detected antibiotic concentrations multiplied by river flow rates antibiotic mass loads in water sediment and aquatic biota of taihu lake were estimated with the detected antibiotic concentrations multiplied by water volume sediment mass and aquatic biomass of different lake zones of taihu lake respectively data of antibiotic mass loads from six types of potential pollution sources 53 wwtps 26 hospitals 10 pharmaceuticals 18 industrial effluents 26 aquacultures and 16 livestock and poultry in the river network of huxi region were collected based on field survey estimation methods are detailed in text s7 fig s4 and tables s15 s17 2 7 multimedia fate modeling using fugacity aquivalence approach we established a modified version of the original level iii multimedia fugacity aquivalence model under a steady state but with non equilibrium conditions to characterize the multimedia fate of antibiotics in taihu lake as described in our previous work wang et al 2019b the model included expressions for inter and intra media transport by diffusion and advection as well as bioaccumulation and degradation in individual environmental matrices according to the steady state assumption and conservation law of mass the mass balance equations were established in terms of transfer fluxes for water water suspended solids fishes macrophytes algae and sediment water solids and benthic invertebrates bulk compartments parameters describing the environmental characteristics physio chemical properties and half lives of antibiotics in addition to inflow outflow flux were incorporated in the model to predict phase partitioning of antibiotics in different environmental media modeling details are described in texts s8 s9 figs s5 s7 and tables s18 s21 2 8 river network modeling for transfer of antibiotic load we employed mike11 model to simulate the hydrodynamic process and transport of antibiotic load in the river network of huxi region consisting of 292 river segments as described previously wang et al 2017a measured antibiotic load data representing the discharges of the nearest clustering pollution sources was added at the nearest node point of sampling site as external loading measured river flow data at the boundary node was used to drive the model the response of antibiotic load in taihu lake to the reduction scenarios for antibiotic riverine influx from huxi region was predicted under the mass flow balance equations an average relative error of 15 2 for the river network suggested a confident validity of model performance in hydrology predictions model results were in agreement with measured values at 11 main inflow river sites with an average relative error of 29 9 model setup calibration and validation were detailed in text s10 and figs s8 s10 2 9 statistical analysis statistical significance of box plots were calculated using a two sided student s two sample t test and p values were bonferroni corrected pairwise mantel and spearman s rank correlation analysis redundancy analysis rda and multivariate linear regression mlr models were performed to illustrate the impact of riverine influx on antibiotic load of taihu lake variation partitioning was conducted to reveal the effect of pollution sources on antibiotic load in the river network of huxi region network analysis was applied to visualize the co occurrence pattern of antibiotic loads in the river network of huxi region and in taihu lake under load reduction scenario method for statistical analysis was detailed in text s11 3 results 3 1 antibiotic residues and their environmental risk for resistance development antibiotic residue level was significantly higher in zhushan bay than in other lake zones p 0 05 fig 3 a total antibiotic concentration ranged between 25 51 95 94 ng l in water phase and between 0 11 9 32 ng g in sediment phase of taihu lake table s22 out of 33 target antibiotics four dominant antibiotics were detected in all lake samples tables s23 s24 while sulfonamides and quinolones were the major antibiotic classes fig 3b for water samples highest concentrations in taihu lake were observed for sulfamethoxazole all samples 7 25 3 83 ng l max 15 92 ng l in meiliang bay ciprofloxacin all samples 4 05 5 02 ng l max 18 50 ng l in meiliang bay ofloxacin all samples 3 66 3 48 ng l max 13 92 ng l in eastern zone trimethoprim all samples 3 28 3 38 ng l max 12 40 ng l in zhushan bay norfloxacin all samples 3 06 3 12 ng l max 10 62 ng l in southeastern bay and chlortetracycline all samples 2 45 4 92 ng l max 24 62 ng l in zhushan bay with maximum values detected in april table s25 as shown in fig 3c the antibiotic level posed no eco toxicological risk in all lake zones but their potential environmental risk for resistance development was generally rated at medium level 0 01 rqr 1 0 with an average rqr value of 0 38 even climbing up to high level rqr 1 0 in zhushan bay meiliang bay and gonghu bay data shown in table s26 high level of environmental risk for resistance development was mostly observed in april and october with maximum value reaching 13 47 fig 3d 3 2 antibiotic loads and their effect on environmental risk for resistance development antibiotic load varied between 13 20 363 64 g km2 with 95 cases no more than 197 g km2 fig 4 a with antibiotic load increasing resistance level increased up to 64 folds above that of the main population and heteroresistance level increased up to 3 48 at 95 confidence level risk factor for arg prevalence and stability ranged between 8 24 92 64 and 0 008 0 69 at 95 confidence level respectively seasonal variation in cyanobacterial density and community composition cyanobacteria associated resistance level heteroresistance prevalence relative abundance of args and mges and resistance stability detected in different lake zones was shown in fig s11 and table s27 quinolones were the most likely to pose the greatest environmental risk for resistance development while macrolides and sulfonamides were the least fig 4b overall both cyanobacteria derived phenotype and genotype resistance level showed a significantly positive relationship with antibiotic load in the water phase under the same level of antibiotic load a higher environmental risk for resistance development was likely to be induced in april and october than in january and july 3 3 source identification of antibiotic load at a basin level fate model simulations revealed that antibiotic degradation and bioaccumulation were the primary output flux in the water phase with 67 6 contribution followed by deposition to sediment and direct outflow fig 5 a in the sediment phase over 99 9 of input flux was attributed to the diffusion process of sedimentation from water phase while degradation only contributed 39 7 of output flux according to the output of fugacity model and mass inventory under steady state 93 3 99 3 of total antibiotic load was distributed in sediment phase fig 5b in both water and sediment phases the average antibiotic mass load was substantially higher in zhushan bay and meiliang bay than in other lake zones four lake zones were dominated by antibiotic influx of 3 08 3 92 g km2 a in the water phase while the other four lakes zones were dominated by outflux of 0 95 3 42 g km2 a hydraulic residence time hrt of most lake zones ranged between 20 5 132 6 d while meiliang bay possessed a notably long hrt of 354 3 d huxi region and zhexi region contributed 76 1 and 22 1 of antibiotic influx respectively fig 5c pca mlr revealed that antibiotic influx of inflowing rivers i5 i6 i7 and i11 in huxi region explained most of antibiotic load in zhushan bay and meiliang bay six types of potential sources of antibiotic load were comprehensively apportioned and the assemblages of predominant sources with the largest contribution to antibiotic load in huxi region were identified fig 5d as shown in the hotspot map antibiotic load increased from upstream to downstream along the transfer route fig s3 while wwtps 24 5 pharmaceuticals 12 2 and livestock and poultry 10 1 occupied the largest contribution of antibiotic load fig s12 3 4 strategy of antibiotic load reduction based on resistance specific risk mitigation based on the load risk relationship almost all classes of antibiotic load in zhushan bay posed high level of environmental risk for resistance development fig 6 a quinolones presented high risk level in six lake zones in the load reduction scenario targeting a risk transition from high level to medium level load reduction of 30 macrolides 74 1 tetracyclines 42 6 60 6 aminoglycosides 40 0 84 5 amphenicols 3 1 78 3 β lactams and 43 2 92 3 quinolones were recommended for different lake zones respectively the recommended load reduction strategy of huxi region and the expected outcome of environmental risk for resistance development was described in fig 6b to achieve the goal of environmental risk control for resistance development in lake zones 13 including gehu lake and 4 inflowing rivers out of 55 sites in huxi region were screened out for 22 9 29 7 of load reduction which led to 5 8 35 4 of collateral reduction of antibiotic load in 18 sites including 11 inflowing rivers in the load reduction scenario antibiotic load of zhushan bay and meiliang bay were predicted to decrease by 32 8 and 21 3 with 97 4 and 92 1 of explanation respectively a corresponding decrease of 9 4 29 5 in antibiotic load of other lake zones was also expected accordingly rqr of all lake zones was expected to drop below the high risk threshold of 1 0 4 discussion 4 1 novel methodology for environmental risk assessment of resistance development to better characterize the safe release limit of antibiotics and closely align to the current era method this study proposed new era terms describing consequences of resistance development resistance level heteroresistance frequency prevalence and stability of args and mges etc as a significant improvement of simple estimate of selective effect comparison to selective concentration era involves dealing with uncertainties while trying to strike a balance between the probability for an event to occur the severity of potential outcome and the costs or consequences involved in managing the risk chapman et al 1998 in the context of current regulatory guidance standardized test methodologies have not yet been established to help ensure reliable and repeatable results for the experimental determination of pnecr which may require further knowledge on resistance mechanisms model variability and the application to mixed communities that vary over time and space le page et al 2017 this emphasizes the future need for the development of validated experimental assays to more accurately evaluate mscs in complex and simple systems as a result theoretical approach for pnecr advocated by bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 based on mic data in the eucast database provides a valuable alternative as part of a broader evidence based approach to era since our pnecr values were theoretically derived from mic data owing to the absence of experimentally derived pnecr values for most target antibiotics the size of assessment factor would be an important factor of uncertainty in the era process reflecting how far the precautionary principle of resistance selection needs to be enforced gullberg et al 2011 reported experimentally derived mscs in laboratory strain competition experiments to be in the range of 1 230 to 1 4 of mic for different antibiotics and an assessment factor of up to 230 for theoretically derived pnecr could be warranted however establishing pnecr by selecting the lowest mic of the most sensitive species in eucast and assuming the maximal described difference between the size adjusted mic and msc could be overly conservative bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 instead we adopted a more modest assessment factor of 10 corresponding to the median mic msc ratio as indicated by le page et al 2017 an assessment factor of 10 will provide a suitable safety margin to account for selection below the mic and conversely that adjusting the mic down to account for species numbers and then applying a further assessment factor of 10 isn t overprotective it should be cautioned that these theoretically derived pnecr might lead to possible underestimation of mic msc ratio for certain antibiotics with high selective potency overall theoretically derived pnecr with an assessment factor of 10 provides an efficient and cost effective method to address concerns and prioritise legacy antibiotics that have already been registered and are present in the environment although the detected antibiotic concentrations in taihu lake were generally lower or comparable to other lakes in china li et al 2019 liu et al 2018 and worldwide yang et al 2018 the potential environmental risk for resistance development of these target antibiotics was observed to be significantly higher than their eco toxicological risk notably the drinking water sources distributed in gonghu bay with relatively low antibiotic concentrations exhibited a medium to high level of environmental risk for resistance development fig s13 the mics or mscs relevant for clinical breakpoint of therapeutic process is inadequate to assess antibiotic susceptibility and resistance evolution with low levels of antibiotics ben et al 2019 berendonk et al 2015 when the concentrations are lower than the mscs bacteria may trigger different cellular responses or alter gene expression as well as induce gene mutation and horizontal gene transfer leading to ar selection as a longstanding assumption gullberg et al 2014 the interpretation of holistic parameters of ar enrichment and dissemination containing relative abundances diversity and stability of args and mges is therefore recommended le page et al 2017 as it is essential to establish direct link bridges between antibiotic selection and resistance evolution we caution that novel era methodology tracking resistance development should employ a combination of indicating factors including selection effect driven by antibiotic pressure probability of ar emergence together with resistance prevalence and persistence specific consequence of ar selection to be robust besides of the selection effect heteroresistance prevalence and resistance stability were apportioned with relatively high weight coefficient in the framework our previous study has revealed that examination of heteroresistance prevalence aid to prevent the misclassification of heteroresistance as susceptibility in traditional mic testing which can better reflect the phenotype resistance of cyanobacterial population and therefore avoid the underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistance wang et al 2021 resistance stability was tested to verify that phenotype and genotype resistance of clones isolated from the resistant subpopulation did not decrease in the absence of antibiotic pressure unstable resistance usually conferring with high fitness cost act as drivers for the cyanobacterial population to revert to susceptibility under non antibiotic selective conditions andersson et al 2019 which substantially decreased the potential hazards of resistance selection and arg dissemination we advocate consideration of these parameters as indispensable protective measure against overprotection or underestimation for resistance development only until more data are obtained to support that new methodologies for ar assessment are developed or protection goals are updated while this study provided a novel methodologic framework to explore such a complex system of antibiotic resistance the model has been simplified in several aspects and there are scopes for further improvement our research motivates those who are readily curious to examine the interdependence of rqr and rf by adjusting weight coefficients which may expand the practicality and promote the standardization of this model the era framework aims to establish the safe concentrations for the protection of wildlife populations aquatic ecosystem structure and function cyanobacteria which have been used as model organisms in the current regulatory era guidance were the most sensitive taxa of those currently recommended in the era framework of human pharmaceuticals european medicines agency 2018 cyanobacteria are important primary producer of oxygen and carbohydrates and photosynthetic organisms in the aquatic food web huisman et al 2018 as the largest group of gram negative photosynthetic prokaryotes cyanobacteria are structurally similar to bacteria and are equally sensitive as other bacteria clinically relevant bacteria and v fischeri and more sensitive than macrophytes microalgae and metazoans fishes and invertebrates le page et al 2017 cyanobacteria are exposed to antibiotic pollution and in straight contact with native bacteria harbouring multiple args and related mges dias et al 2019 our previous study demonstrated that cyanobacteria which are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems acted as a significant reservoir and source for the acquisition and dissemination of args between aquatic biotic elements wang et al 2020 it has been revealed that cyanobacterial blooms are a crucial driver of arg diffusion and enrichment in freshwater providing a hazardous reference of environmental resistome for the ecology and evolution of args and arbs in aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2020a since potential bias might be introduced in our era analysis due to variation of taxa sensitivity to antibiotics the inclusion of a wider range of environmentally relevant bacterial species and their resistance profile in other environmental matrices was recommended to improve the novel era framework for resistance development in future works 4 2 effect of antibiotic load on environmental risk for resistance development and its hydrological impacts our study revealed that the effect of antibiotic mass loadings on environmental risk for resistance development should be deciphered in terms of both temperature and antibiotic category the complex and inconsistent nature of their relationship could be attributed to different environmental fates related to args and antibiotics themselves in different environmental settings bacterial selection responses to antibiotics may not occur in a concentration dependent manner in bacterial communities presumably due to a cross protective effect that resistant bacteria may break down extracellular antibiotics to the benefit of nearby susceptible bacteria murray et al 2018 several processes were reported to contribute to the observed decrease of resistance determinants during flood season including dilution by additional water inflows via tributary inputs biological deterioration e g cell metabolism accompanied with cyanobacterial bloom predation etc and cell sedimentation lee et al 2021 although resistance persistence could be facilitated by low water temperature during dry season bacterial assimilation of args was likely to be simultaneously hampered due to the limited conjugative transfer ability of mges wang et al 2020 on the other hand the greatest risk for resistance development of quinolones should not only be attributed to their highest load our approach using the currently available data suggested that quinolones originated from sewage effluents of wwtps and pharmaceuticals table s17 posed a relatively higher risk level for resistance development than other antibiotics i e sulfamethoxazoles mainly originated from aquaculture livestock and poultry breeding wastewater at the same level of antibiotic load fig s14a as shown in fig s14b quinolones presented a higher risk factor than other classes of antibiotics exhibiting their greater ability to facilitate the resistance development quinolones which are broad spectrum antibiotics available for both veterinary and medical use can be purchased without prescription from community pharmacies drug stores healthcare facilities in the study area or online table s10 the high load of quinolones such as norfloxacin and ofloxacin could be attributed to their extensive application as oral medication injection and clinical medicine for external use in the treatment or prevention of a variety of bacterial infections previous studies found quinolones to be the most prescribed antibiotics for human epidemic prevention aldred et al 2013 and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants to be prevalent in the taihu basin zhang et al 2015b although there was significant removal of quinolones through some advanced water treatment technologies ozone disinfection nanofiltration biodegradation activated carbon filtration etc in wwtps dorival garcía et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the medical wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and domestic sewage from hospitals and households draining into wwtps contributed a large amount of quinolone load through the effluent and dewatered sludge plasmid encoded and highly transferrable quinolone resistance qnr genes were the most common and significant form of resistance associated with the use of quinolones in non clinical environments hernández et al 2011 low level quinolone resistance has been found to more facilitate the emergence and stability of higher level resistance in the presence of quinolones at therapeutic levels than other sort of antibiotics aldred et al 2014 robicsek et al 2006 pnecr values of quinolones were generally comparable to other classes of antibiotics even higher than tetracyclines and β lactams demonstrating that overprotection against selection should not be claimed for pnecr of quinolones fig s14c the effect of antibiotic load on risk for resistance development was exploited based on the assumption that antibiotics within the same class would have additive effects on risk of resistance selection among the target antibiotics quinolones are bactericidal antibiotics which refer to killing the bacteria directly while the others are bacteriostatic antibiotics which refer to slowing down the reproduction of bacteria and allowing host defenses to kill them table s9 antibiotics within the same classes have the same mode of action and their corresponding resistance mechanism are similar tables s9 and s12 gullberg et al 2014 supported this assumption that combination of various concentrations of antibiotics with same mechanism of action resulted in additive effect or less than additive effect while those with different mechanisms of action could interfere with the other and therefore result in either greater or lesser combination effects stanton et al 2020 also assumed that antibiotics within the same class would have an additive effect although this assumption has not been tested and should be considered in future studies based on this assumption singer et al 2019 explored risk based targets for prescription reduction of macrolides and quinolones to alleviate the hazard of resistance selection however the threshold for resistance selection might still be over or underestimated with synergistic and antagonistic interactions increasing in frequency with the number of antibiotics tekin et al 2018 brochado et al 2018 demonstrated that some antibiotic combinations within the same class could target the same cellular process and exhibit a synergistic effect while the others were less inhibitory than expected non additive because one s cellular response helped to buffer the effects from another notably cyanobacteria in the aquatic environment are most likely to be exposed to antibiotic mixtures rather than single substances which may show a synergistic effect and further lower the mscs gullberg et al 2014 although extensive studies have been conducted on the combined effect of antibiotic mixtures on cyanobacterial growth gonzález pleiter et al 2013 wang et al 2017b wang et al 2019a the understanding of such effect on resistance selection in cyanobacterial species is limited roemhild et al 2022 summarized that synergistic and antagonistic antibiotic interactions hysteresis in temporal interactions between antibiotics that arise from microbial physiology and interactions between antibiotics and resistance mutations can cause collateral sensitivity or cross resistance combination effect of antibiotics with different action mechanisms interfering with each other could be an important contributing factor to the transfer and persistence of multidrug resistance plasmids even with each individual antibiotic present below msc gullberg et al 2014 which might lead to underestimation of ar risk in a complex system furthermore mixture effects with potentially relevant chemicals in the aquatic environments such as biocides metals herbicides pesticides and other classes of pharmaceuticals might have synergistic or antagonistic impacts on resistance selection singer et al 2019 or co select for resistance genes in bacterial communities murray et al 2019 hence the relationship between single exposure laboratory testing and mixture effects with antibiotics other co selecting chemical compounds on msc is unknown and requires further efforts as part of a holistic era for resistance development temporal spatial variation in volumetric inflow pattern of river network and hydraulic residence time of different lake zones exerted a significant effect on antibiotic load in this river lake system the increasing antibiotic load from upstream to downstream in the river network of huxi region indicated that local diffusive antibiotic inputs along the transfer route were more influential than diverted water from the yangtze river comparing total antibiotic concentration and mass loadings we demonstrate that reduced rainfall and surface runoff during dry season resulted in increased antibiotic concentration in the inflowing rivers of zhushan bay and meiliang bay while antibiotic influx did not vary across seasons with the exception of summer fig s15 considering the combination of their relatively lower antibiotic concentrations and riverine influx during flood season of taihu basin increased rainfall and or cleaner tributaries was likely to dilute the inflow water with antibiotics degrading and or settling to sediment intensified by high temperature and clumping of fine particles respectively ott et al 2021 xu et al 2018 our previous study has pointed out that more pollution loadings derived from local sources were flushed toward downstream through the great canal during flood season causing less impact on the water quality of taihu lake yi et al 2017 despite a short retention time and high water exchange frequency zhushan bay directly received 64 8 of total antibiotic influx of taihu lake explaining its high antibiotic inventory accordingly we found that meiliang bay dominated by antibiotic outflux possessed the highest antibiotic inventories in both water and sediment phase due to limited attenuation caused by degradation and resuspension as a result of longer hrt and weaker disturbance than other lake zones tang et al 2020 4 3 source identification and risk oriented reduction strategy of antibiotic load in the present study a systematic methodology taking account of compartment dependent aspects between antibiotic load and dynamic risk response on the basis of experimental and modeling approaches was proposed to provide antibiotic reduction strategy targeting for environmental risk control of ar development for the purpose of effectively decreasing high level risk for resistance development in certain lake zones dense populated clustering urban area causing massive sewage wastewater and large consumption of antibiotics for human medicine and agricultural therapy and promoters for ensuring meat supply were identified as hotspots in the river network of huxi region which called for achievable load reduction by full scale advanced water treatment e g ozone disinfection and biological activated carbon filtration with stricter standard and higher cost wang et al 2019b river lake complex systems are tightly connected terrestrial ecosystems jointly impacted by natural and anthropogenic conditions gao et al 2014 where inflowing rivers are important aisles in the migration of terrigenous pollutants into lakes and largely exert a fundamental control over the ecological risk status of lakes zhang et al 2019 especially source identification of antibiotic loads in lake river complex still remained challenging due to the interaction of contamination sources and the complexity of transportation and fate process involved with physical chemical and biological dynamic mechanisms although several attempts have been made for source tracking of args in interconnected river lake system chen et al 2020 lee et al 2021 few data have been available to support the limit of antibiotic discharges against ar development le page et al 2017 here we combined statistical analysis with fate and transport modeling to apportion contribution of load transport from potential sources in lake river complex system and to predict the responses of riverine influx and antibiotic inventories of taihu lake under load reduction scenarios our previous studies have applied multimedia fugacity based fate modeling and mass balance analysis to simulate emission and migration of tetracyclines in river catchments chen et al 2017 wang et al 2019b verifying the applicability of this approach however when tracking source contribution to antibiotic influx antibiotic mass loadings in reclamation runoffs and untreated rural sewage were not taken into consideration since the required precise data is severely limited meanwhile bioaccumulation potential of other aquatic biota in the food web zhou et al 2020 leading to underestimation of antibiotic load needed to be further clarified these uncertainties together enhanced the inference that environmental risk for resistance development in taihu lake was possibly underestimated and huxi region might have contributed a larger proportion of antibiotic influx than our estimation 5 conclusions our work is one of the first to establish a novel era methodology for resistance development and proposed a risk oriented antibiotic load reduction strategy in lake river basin systems we conclude that environmental risk for resistance development and antibiotic load are interlinked phenomena which should be deciphered by both hydrological regime and environmental fate of antibiotics the novel era methodology for resistance development draws a more holistic understanding of ecological impact of antibiotic load than the conventional eco toxicological effect adopted by current era guidelines which is not always protective against potential resistance selection despite multiple sources of uncertainty that exist in fate and transport modeling this risk targeted strategy of load reduction is expected to provide a coherent implication for basin scale antibiotic stewardship and to form targeted policies for ar mitigation in a wider range of applications author contributions z y w q w c and j y z designed the study and methodology z y w z a x d d y t l and c l performed the
