22230,marine risers are subject to vortex induced vibration viv caused by a combination of various external and internal excitations the external excitations include the current induced hydrodynamic forces and the wave induced motions of the floating platform while the internal excitation refers to the effect of internal flow with significant increase of the riser aspect ratio the viv becomes much more complicated resulting in more frequent fatigue damages to the risers hence viv is an important research area in marine engineering this review surveys the latest progress on the viv research including the multi mode response viv response at high reynolds numbers flow induced vibrations between multiple marine risers viv of inclined risers and intermittent viv in oscillatory flow particularly the impacts of the floating platform and internal flow that have not been widely considered in previous studies are discussed to comprehensively understand the viv of marine risers moreover typical experimental and numerical investigations on the viv of marine risers are also introduced keywords marine risers vortex induced vibration multi mode response floating platform internal flow 1 introduction a marine riser system is a key part in the offshore oil and gas production system to connect the floating platform and underwater equipment however due to harsh operating environments such as varying waves and flows the marine riser is vulnerable to fatigue failures viv generated by the interactions between the platform current and riser is the main cause of riser failures fig 1 portrays the viv of a riser system under internal and external excitations as a typical fluid structure coupling phenomenon the viv is involved with the response of complex multi frequency and multi degree of freedom vibrations for instance the simplest form of the viv is generated by the interaction between an elastically mounted rigid cylinder and the surrounding uniform flow when the flow passes over a cylinder an unsteady wake will be generated in the form of shedding vortices the vortices alternately fall off from both sides of the cylinder producing a periodically varying lift force along the cross flow and in line directions the viv is then raised by the lift force violette et al 2007 because the viv is a quite complicated nonlinear and asymmetrical phenomenon bernitsas et al 2008 2009 its developing and behaving mechanisms are still not clear in the past decades abundant scientific studies have investigated the mechanisms of the viv some comprehensive reviews can be found in sumer and freds√∏e 1997 and williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 furthermore the viv problem in the marine riser system has attracted extensive attention in recent years innovative designs have been applied to developing different types of marine risers in order to enable their survival in complex ocean environments there are four basic riser types the top tension risers steel catenary risers hybrid risers and flexible risers among these four types the steel catenary risers and flexible risers have been adopted in the exploitation of marine oil and gas resources from offshore to deep sea because of their availability to deep sea environment sun et al 2012 many studies have been performed to investigate the complex characteristics of the viv in the flexible and steel catenary risers where the riser models are usually simplified in the form of a long flexible circular cylinder immersed in the unsteady flow due to large scale of marine risers in practice it is difficult to directly measure the viv of the risers to this avail laboratory experimental test is an effective tool to inspect the viv of marine risers biermann and herrnstein 1934 conducted experimental research on two circular cylinders in the tandem and side by side configurations the results showed that the proximity interference may have a significant effect on the viv in 1955 based on the relationship between the strouhal number and reynolds number roshko 1955 studied the flow field around the cylinder and defined the regime of the flow field feng 1968 conducted typical free vibration experiments and measured the stress and viv response of a flexibly mounted cylinder in 1975 in order to study the effect of axial tension on the viv of marine risers hsu 1975 investigated the response of a suspended slender cylinder subjected to the parametric excitation followed research focused on the vortex characteristics in order to reveal the root mechanism of the viv of marine risers in 1993 brika and laneville 1993 studied the vortex wake pattern of the free vibration by testing vibration cables in a wind tunnel gu et al 1994 investigated the vorticity dynamics using the particle image velocimetry piv to control the motion at a cylinder then govardhan and williamson 2000 found that the upper and lower branches of the amplitude curve corresponded to the two single and two pair vortex wake patterns respectively to compare the effects of cross flow and in line vibrations on the fatigue damage of marine risers trim et al 2005 conducted an experimental study to check the viv response in a uniform and shear flow and found that the degree of fatigue damage along the in line direction was the same as the cross flow direction in order to predict the viv semi empirical models and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods have been used in terms of semi empirical model based predictions birkhoff and zarantonello 1957 used the van der pol oscillator equation to simulate the wake motion then bishop and hassan 1964 and hartlen and curie 1970 proposed the wake oscillator model that used the van der pol oscillator equation to simulate the hydrodynamic force of the wake acting on the cylinder recently nonlinear fluid models have been developed by considering the effects of multi mode interactions srinil 2010 proposed a low order fluid structure coupling model to evaluate the multi mode viv response of flexible cylinders as well as the multimodal characteristics of flexible risers in the cfd models the computing approaches that handle the turbulent flows can be categorized into direct numerical simulation dns reynolds averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and discrete vortex methods because the axial scale of marine risers is very large the calculation effort is quite heavy when performing three dimensional cfd simulation liu et al 2019a an alternative solution is the strip method herfjord et al 1999 used the strip method to simulate the viv in deep water risers based on the strip theory duan et al 2018 and fu et al 2018 recently developed a new cfd solver viv foam sjtu to predict the viv in marine risers furthermore in order to pursue a better understanding of the viv in marine risers new findings have been obtained in recent years compared to the previous results recent studies show the following changes 1 the viv models have progressed from one dimension to two dimension and then to three dimension viz from one dimensional cross flow direction to two dimensional cross flow and in line directions and then towards three dimensional cross flow in line and axial directions at arbitrary flow velocities the amplitude in the cross flow direction is greater than that in the in line direction but the vibration frequency of the in line direction is nearly twice that of the cross flow direction thus the fatigue damage along the in line and cross flow directions is at the same level and it is necessary to propose a reliable in line and cross flow coupled viv prediction method song et al 2011 duanmu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 in addition considering the influence of viscoelasticity on the dynamic response of marine risers a fully coupled three dimensional viv model is essentially required yang et al 2018 2 the flow field around the risers has been investigated from the uniform flow to the shear flow and the oscillatory flow when the riser is active the relative incoming flow speed is usually unstable due to the unstable current and the movement of the floating platform hence the viv of marine risers often presents complicated features 3 nonlinear simulation models in the time domain have been found suitable for the calculation of the riser viv in several cases including the cross flow and in line directions and various current conditions thorsen et al 2017 xue et al 2015 wang et al 2015 lu et al 2019 4 with the widespread use of the long flexible cylinder the prediction of the riser force and response is an important topic in the viv research a unique feature to make the prediction of deep water risers different from other applications is that the aspect ratio of marine riser is very large at least 103 this review summaries the recent new discoveries on the viv research the reminders are organized as follows in section 2 recent progress on viv of marine risers is introduced section 3 surveys the viv analysis techniques section 4 draws the conclusions 2 viv of marine risers 2 1 viv induced by current viv of marine risers has been extensively investigated in the past decades the viv dynamics of a marine riser are irregularly affected by the non perpendicular current srinil 2010 leading to multi mode and high order harmonic characteristics this irregularity feature of the viv is particularly important for investigating real offshore oil and gas production systems because the factors such as the configuration and inclination of the risers the movement of the floating platform and the internal flow of the risers may intensify the uncertainty of the current as a result considerable efforts have been made to understand the viv in different current conditions 2 1 1 multi mode response multi mode vibration characteristics have been observed in long flexible risers in previous studies and the multi mode characteristics are the main difference between long flexible risers and rigid cylinders the viv of the latter exhibits single mode lock in vibration due to large aspect ratio the riser may vibrate at high frequencies and multi mode conditions even in the simplest case where the vertical riser is placed in a uniform flow field the multi mode viv is still possibly generated wang and xiao 2016 fig 2 a shows the orbital trajectories at different riser positions and fig 2 b shows the vortex shedding in the uniform flow useful attempts have been made to address the multi mode and multi frequency viv of a long flexible cylinder that is mounted in different forms such as curved inclined and straight and immersed in different flows such as uniform flow linear shear flow exponential shear flow and stepped flow trim et al 2005 carried out a series of riser model tests in uniform and shear flows to investigate the viv of marine risers multi mode viv response was observed in the experimental tests and the number of dominating modes in both uniform and shear flows increased with the increase of the flow velocity similarly lie and kaasen 2006 carried out a large scale riser model test in a shear flow to investigate the modes of the viv response the experimental results showed an irregular viv response and the mode number increased with the flow velocity moreover the single mode viv response was not observed in the experimental test i e the lock in viv response did not occur in the shear flow chaplin et al 2005a investigated the viv of a marine riser in stepped flow and found that the viv response of the riser mainly occurred at the frequency corresponding to the dominating mode more recently srinil 2010 2011 pavlovskaia et al 2016 song et al 2016 and duanmu et al 2018 have drawn similar conclusions by numerical simulations the viv response of a long flexible riser shows multi mode characteristics no matter how it is placed in the flow field only except when the angle between the axial direction of the riser and the flow direction of the flow field is very small and the higher the flow velocity the stronger the multi mode response moreover behara et al 2011 studied the viv of the elastically mounted sphere and discovered the spiral vortices the viv amplitude caused hysteresis at the beginning of the lock in state in the spiral vortex shedding mode srinil 2010 2011 investigated the multi mode response of a geometrically nonlinear flexible cylinder and observed the nonlinear characteristics of the viv such as multi mode lock in shifting sharing and interaction characteristics besides the multi modal dynamic response of the tensioned beam was highly aperiodic and the effect of reynolds number on the viv prediction was reduced as shown in fig 3 similar results were found by vandiver et al 2009 and duanmu et al 2018 accordingly the oncoming flow profile may affect the cylinder mode characteristics resulting in different mode response in different flows for instance the number of modes of a cylinder in a uniform flow is generally lower than that in a shear flow bourguet et al 2012 2013b and duanmu et al 2017 song et al 2011 and wang and xiao 2016 also observed that the dominant mode and the vibration frequencies of excited modes increased with the flow velocity the multi mode viv response was generally controlled by traveling waves which was positively proportional to the flow velocity zhu et al 2019 chen and rhee 2019 furthermore as the aspect ratio increased the vibration mode of the cylinder transitioned from a single mode to multiple modes duanmu et al 2017 in addition the reynolds number and the axial tension of a marine riser affected the multi mode vibration of the viv chaos is a generic feature of the multi mode viv response in flexible risers the dominant frequency of the multi mode viv is consistent with the strouhal frequency which refers to the vortex shedding frequency calculated based on the strouhal number song et al 2011 the multi mode viv of a riser is more difficult to predict due to its complex chaotic characteristics in 2010 violette et al 2010 studied the mode conversion and simultaneity of the cylinder viv using a linear stability method however the linear method cannot accurately predict the amplitude due to nonlinear characteristics of the viv it is well known that the vibration amplitude of a riser in the primary mode is mainly determined by the relationship between the vortex shedding frequency and the riser natural frequency duanmu et al 2018 if these two frequencies are too close the resonance will happen to significantly increase the vibration amplitude duanmu et al 2018 moreover factors such as the drag amplification asymmetry and higher harmonics also contribute to the nonlinear characteristics of the viv for instance the drag amplification may increase the deflection of a riser and the loading at both ends of a riser huang et al 2011b song et al 2011 all these factors will enhance the multi mode characteristics in the viv response of long flexible risers 2 1 2 response at high reynolds numbers experimental studies on the viv at high reynolds numbers are quite scarce due to huge difficulties in performing experimental investigations early in 1997 kalro and tezduyar 1997 investigated the viv characteristics of a cylinder immersed in the uniform flow and the results presented weak three dimensional features at the reynolds number of 300 once the reynolds number reached up to 1 l05 and even higher its influence on the synchronization and amplitude of the viv is much clearer raghavan and bernitsas 2011 in order to obtain aquatic clean energy from the viv the model tests in a wide reynolds number range were conducted by raghavan and bernitsas 2011 and modir and goudarzi 2019 the results showed that high reynolds numbers in the range of 8 00 l03 to 1 50 l05 impacted the viv amplitude greater than the mass ratio and the viv amplitude highly depended on the natural frequency and lock in as a result a high reynolds number flow will increase the vortex shedding frequency and the hydrodynamic force on marine risers and generally increase the amplitude and frequency of the riser viv traditional method for predicting the viv amplitude is the griffin curve griffin 1980 recently williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 and raghavan and bernitsas 2011 found that the viv amplitude at high reynolds numbers was as twice as that predicted by the modified griffin curve in the upper branch of the amplitude curve the synchronization range and amplitude ratio were positively correlated with the reynolds number similarly behara et al 2016 investigated the effects of reynolds number and reduced velocity on the viv and found that the riser maintained a synchronous vibration at a reynolds number between 300 and 1000 wanderley and soares 2015 found that the reynolds number greatly influenced the amplitude frequency and phase angle of the low mass damping system the numerical results showed that the wider the reynolds number range the higher the amplitude ratio and the closer the response frequency in the lock in area to the riser natural frequency as shown in fig 4 similar results can be found in nguyen and nguyen 2016 with the reynolds number ranging from 3 l03 to 3 l04 and in gao et al 2015 with the reynolds number ranging from 2 5 104 to 1 8 105 as a result the reynolds number is an important parameter that must be considered in viv simulations the influence of high reynolds numbers on the viv of flexible risers needs to be further studied 2 1 3 flow induced vibration of multiple marine risers the configuration of multiple marine risers is of great significance for marine oil and gas production systems the viv response of multiple marine risers is more complex than that in a single riser for instance the two cylinder system can be configured as tandem side by side and staggered configurations see fig 5 the characteristics of flow fields around these three configurations are quite complicated in terms of flow patterns fluid forces vortices wake and so on sumner 2010 reviewed in details the research on two cylinders in the stable cross flow following many new research has been conducted to address the viv response in multiple marine risers the flow field around two tandem cylinders is influenced by the reynolds number and spacing ratio l d and the vortex interaction mechanism of two tandem circular cylinders is very complicated in order to study the effect of the reynolds number and spacing ratio on the flow field around the cylinder and the cylinder vibration armina et al 2018 conducted a series of experimental studies on the tandem configured multiple risers and found that the vibration frequencies of the upstream and downstream risers were different this observation is contrary to the previous conclusions on the fixed risers carmo et al 2010a 2010b divided the flow patterns of the tandem cylinders under low reynolds numbers into three basic types 1 symmetric at l d 1 5 2 alternating at l d 1 8 and 2 3 and 3 wake at l d 5 sewatkar et al 2012 conducted a comprehensive study of flow fields around six square cylinders in the tandem configuration by investigating the power spectrum and the influence of the secondary frequency on the lift coefficient they proposed four primary flow regimes with different spacing ratios at the reynolds number of 100 including the synchronous 0 5 l d 1 1 quasi periodic i 1 2 l d 13 quasi periodic ii 1 4 l d 5 0 and chaotic 6 0 l d 10 0 regimes they further discussed the underlying mechanisms of these four flow regimes the flow is synchronized when a single wake is formed behind all cylinders while the flow transitions to the quasi periodic i quasi periodic ii or chaotic regimes when the vortices are generated and shed in the gap of the cylinders the observations from huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte et al 2016 showed that when the spacing ratio was from 2 to 6 the response of the cylinders displayed classical viv resonance moreover the upstream cylinder underwent larger vibrations than the downstream cylinder and the viv amplitude of the upstream cylinder was negatively proportional to the spacing ratio to investigate the vortex interaction mechanism of the tandem circular cylinders borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 carried out numerical simulations to study the viv of two identical elastically mounted cylinders at the reynolds number of 200 and found that when the reduced velocity was slow the initial dynamic of the cylinder vibration generated the shedding vortex when the vertical distance between the two cylinders caused by the initial viv exceeded the diameter of the cylinder the gap flow was generated to dominate the vibration of the riser and greatly increase the viv amplitude assi et al 2010 2013 stated that the wake induced vibration of the multiple cylinders cannot be predicted by the classical galloping theory and hence introduced the wake stiffness to explain the vibration of the downstream cylinder while most of existing research has focused on two cylinders very limited work considered three or more cylinders wang et al 2019a b c carried out an experimental study on three and four long flexible cylinders with tandem configuration and found that the downstream riser produced a small effect on the amplitude of the upstream riser and the wake induced vibration of the downstream cylinders occurred at a high reduced velocity besides the last downstream cylinder in the three cylinders presented the same in line and cross flow main frequency and the response of the other two cylinders was of dual resonance ding et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders with rough strips the results showed that the vortex of the downstream riser was disturbed by the upstream riser leading to a lower amplitude in the downstream riser in the galloping branch of the amplitude curve the shear layer motion was consistent with the riser motion and the amplitude of the first upstream riser is largest among the three risers in the side by side configuration the flow pattern between the two risers dominates the riser vibration there are four flow patterns in the side by side configuration sumner 2010 chen et al 2015a i e 1 single wake vortex street without vortex shedding at small spacing ratio l d 1 1 1 2 2 biased flow pattern at intermediate spacing ratio 1 1 1 2 l d 2 0 2 5 3 two parallel wake vortex streets at high spacing ratio 2 0 2 5 l d 4 and 4 large spacing ratio l d 4 and re 100 at which the viv between the two cylinders does not interact with each other and is similar to that of a single cylinder zhao 2013a chen et al 2015b moreover the flow pattern of the viv in the side by side configuration in a uniform flow with low reynolds numbers can be divided into six near wake patterns namely the irregular pattern the in phase flip flopping pattern the out of phase flip flopping pattern the in phase synchronized pattern the anti phase synchronized pattern and the biased anti phase synchronized pattern chen et al 2015a 2015b carini et al 2014 bao et al 2013 huera huarte and gharib 2011 fig 6 portrays these six flow patterns for the near wake patterns chen et al 2015a further analyzed the asymmetric vibration and symmetry hysteresis phenomena of two side by side risers they found that the asymmetric vibration was related to the stable biased flow and the near wake mode around the cylinder and the symmetry hysteresis was induced by the combination of the in phase synchronized pattern and the biased anti phase synchronized pattern for the flow field between multiple risers sewatkar et al 2012a b investigated the energy transfer in the flow around six side by side cylinders and found that the energy conversion was more intense in the resonance region of the cylinder xu et al 2018 performed the flow induced vibration experiments of three and four side by side cylinders and compared the flow induced vibration with different number of cylinders the comparison demonstrated that the dominant frequencies and mode numbers of the three and four cylinder systems were the same as those of the isolated and two cylinder systems but the response amplitude and multi mode response characteristics between the three and four cylinder systems were significantly different due to different wake actions in reality the staggered configuration is commonly used in multiple marine risers however comprehensive studies on the staggered configuration are relatively few in literature the relative position of two staggered cylinders can be characterized by non dimensional center to center spacing ratio l d and incident angle Œ± sumner et al 2010 the interaction of the free shear layer and the two k√°rm√°n vortex streets in a staggered configuration may induce different flow patterns based on the strouhal number and the flow form hu and zhou 2008 divided the wake patterns into two single street modes s i and s ii and two double street modes t i and t ii recently many new achievements have been made on flow induced vibration analysis of more than two risers in the staggered arrangement han et al 2018 numerically investigated the flow induced vibration characteristics of three cylinders in the equilateral triangular arrangement at different flow incident angles and reduced velocities as shown in fig 7 the results showed that the flow induced vibration response and the vortex shedding mode were greatly affected by the flow incident angle and the reduced velocity and the flow induced vibration reached a minimum amplitude at an incident angle Œ± 30 gao et al 2019a b simulated the fluid induced vibration of four cylinders arranged in a square with different inflow angles and reduced velocities they found that the flow incident angle had great influence on the orbital trajectory and shedding mode of the four cylinders as well as the amplitude and lift coefficient of the downstream risers in addition the drag coefficient of all cylinders increased first and then decreased with the reduced velocity more details with respect to the vibration response of the staggered configuration can refer to sumner et al 2005 2010 and lee et al 2009 2 1 4 viv of inclined risers marine risers are usually inclined to the direction of the incoming current which makes the viv more complex than that in the vertical risers in order to simplify the mathematical model of inclined risers the independence principle has been proposed to calculate the viv of an inclined cylinder analogously as that of a vertical cylinder by projecting the inclined cylinder onto a plane perpendicular to the direction of the incoming flow the viv response can be calculated using the excitation of the normal component of the incoming flow relative to the inclined riser the independence principle has been proven effective for predicting the viv response and hydrodynamic forces with an inclined angle Œ± 65 however there are also some shortcomings such as that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder is overestimated and the conversion process cannot be measured from a single frequency to multi frequency response franzini et al 2013 jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 bourguet et al 2015 zhao 2015 recently bourguet and triantafyllou 2015 investigated the viv response of a flexible cylinder with different inclined angles see fig 8 the results showed that the vibration and fluid force of the inclined flexible cylinder deviated from the independence principle while the independence principle greatly underestimated the frequency of the viv and failed to capture the asymmetry of the riser vibration in addition bourguet et al 2015 confirmed that the effectiveness of the independence principle can be affected by the bending of the cylinder along the in line direction as a result the independence principle reduces the calculating cost but decreases the prediction accuracy of the viv of inclined risers the viv frequency ratio of in line and cross flow directions in the inclined riser is approximately equal to 2 which is similar to that of the vertical riser bourguet et al 2012 2015a in order to study the intensity of the viv response for the inclined risers franzini et al 2009 and seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 carried out inclined cylinder experiments and observed that the oscillation amplitude hydrodynamic forces and added mass of the inclined cylinder were smaller than that of the vertical cylinder han et al 2017 conducted an experimental test to investigate the dynamic characteristics of an inclined flexible cylinder with the inclined angle Œ± 45 they observed that the viv response presented obvious multi mode characteristics the dominating modes ranged from 1 to 3 in the cross flow direction and 1 to 5 in the in line direction see fig 9 and the dominating frequency was linearly correlated with the flow velocity see fig 10 moreover the results also showed that the drag coefficient was between 0 9 and 2 6 rather than being dispersed like in a vertical cylinder 2 1 5 intermittent viv in oscillatory flow due to large amplitude motions of the floating platform caused by the ocean wave and current an oscillatory flow around the marine risers may take place leading to vortex shedding and intermittent viv a basic feature of the viv response in an oscillating flow is that the response is strongly dependent on the keulegan carpenter kc number and reduced velocity the dominant vibration frequency of the intermittent viv is positively correlated with kc number and negatively correlated with the reduced velocity in general in the lock in situation when the kc number increases the lock in area will reach a stable point and expand with the increase of the maximum shedding frequency when the maximum reduced velocity increases the lock in area widens with the same reduced velocity large amplitude of the viv appears at a low kc number zhao 2013b fu et al 2013 thorsen et al 2016 2017 and yuan et al 2018 furthermore wang et al 2015a revealed that both the kc number and maximum reduced velocity produced a profound influence on the riser fatigue damage which is a unique characteristic of intermittent viv caused by the oscillatory flow with the same maximum reduced velocity the viv amplitude and fatigue damage were negatively correlated to the kc number there are numerous different characteristics between the oscillating flow and the steady flow on the viv of marine risers including the amplitude modulation and high order harmonics as shown in fig 11 the phenomena of the amplitude modulation and high order harmonics appear in the intermittent viv under the oscillatory flow wang et al 2015 the amplitude modulation would become inconspicuous at a large reduced velocity and the high order harmonics was approximately three times of the maximum vortex shedding frequency hysteresis and mode conversion as observed in a steady flow in fig 11 occurred in the oscillating flow the mode conversion occurred if the reduced velocity was large enough fu et al 2013 2018 wang et al 2015a carried out an experimental test to study the fatigue failure of flexible risers caused by the intermittent viv and found that the amplitude modulation and mode conversion had a significant impact on the riser fatigue damage furthermore a sharp increase about two orders of magnitude in fatigue damage was discovered in the region of high order harmonics and the damage increased by nearly 50 compared to that caused by a single harmonic stress zheng et al 2014 2 2 viv affected by floating platform and internal flow 2 2 1 viv affected by floating platform as marine oil mining activities extend to deep sea areas liu et al 2019b the form of the riser system is quite different from the traditional fixed platform the movement of the floating platform becomes complicated and the dynamic coupling between the platform and underwater risers is strengthened causing new problems such as additional lock in regions parameter excitation and nonlinear amplification garrett 2005 yang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 fan et al 2017 the platform motions can cause the viv of marine risers with high order modes and large vibration amplitude recently yin et al 2019 studied the influence of the platform motions on the vibration of the riser interestingly they found that the in line vibration caused by the platform motions was stronger than that of the cross flow viv caused by the oscillatory flow furthermore the dynamics and vibration response of the viv affected by the floating platform are very different from that without considering the movement of the floating platform because of horizontal and vertical platform motions chen et al 2015 the horizontal movement of the platform such as sway and surge would spread along the riser toward to the bottom and interact with the viv of the riser then further cause the nonlinear coupling on the motion boundary chen et al 2014 in addition the vertical heave motion mainly affects the dynamic tension of the riser which periodically changes the structure parameters of the riser resulting in the problem of parameter excitation moreover compared with the horizontal movement of the platform the vertical motion can cause dangerously dynamic response on the riser for the horizontal motion the floating platform may suffer from wave induced motions the phenomena such as the oscillation flow and top end sway would cause the intermittent viv of marine risers when the floating platform sways the displacement of the riser will be enlarged chen et al 2015 observed the nonlinear response amplification phenomenon which indicated that the platform motion could be amplified during the motion spreading along the riser moreover the displacement of the riser would increase with the swaying amplitude both the displacement and response amplification would increase with the drop of the sway frequency wang et al 2016 also found obvious drag amplification caused by the horizontal motion under small kc number and the experiment results showed that the platform motion induced viv presented strong time consistency in terms of both amplitude and frequency as shown in fig 12 as for the vertical movement heave of the platform the foremost problem is the fluctuation in the axial tension of the riser which can cause varies of the geometric stiffness although the fluctuation is greatly suppressed by the heave compensators the linear balance of the riser may be broken down resulting in intensified viv moreover when the vibration amplitude of the platform is sufficiently large the tension may be transformed into pressure at a certain part of the riser to produce dangerous dynamic stresses kuiper et al 2008 varying structural parameters can also significantly affect the modal properties of the viv focusing on the viv of a flexible cylinder with axially varying structural parameters sanaati and kato 2012 found that the fluctuating tension ratio and lock in bandwidth of the viv increased with the axial stiffness while decreased with the pre tension in addition high pre tension can greatly enlarge the lift force coefficient and reduce the vibration amplitude in their experimental investigation when the pre tension increased by four times the lift coefficient increased by about 57 while the vibration amplitude reduced by about 30 yang and xiao 2014 further discovered that the pre tension was effective in suppressing the instability of marine risers and preventing extreme vibrations in order to completely understand the effect of the floating platform motion on the viv of marine risers wang et al 2014 2015b 2016 carried out a lot of experimental investigations the analysis results showed good agreement with earlier observations on flexible risers in oscillatory flow and the viv caused by the movement of the floating platform was strongly associated with the kc number wang et al 2015b stated that due to extensive changes in kc number and the tension the time varying characteristics of the system dynamics were more obvious with larger movement of the platform in addition the fatigue damage caused by the viv in the cross flow direction was significantly influenced by both the amplitude and period of the platform movement the most severe damages occurred in the touchdown point the upper bend point and the top of the riser recently in order to predict the viv induced by the floating platform for a free hanging riser under low kc number wang et al 2019a b c proposed a new numerical method this new method was implemented in vivana and validated by experimental tests to show good performance in predicting the frequency stress and amplitude of the viv generally the horizontal and vertical movements of the platform never occur independently if take both movements into consideration not only a time varying moving boundary and periodically parametric excitation but also a nonlinear dynamic response would be imposed to a marine riser consequently a small platform movement may result in a large response of the riser accompanied by complex viv 2 2 2 viv affected by internal flow in addition to the external excitation loads such as the hydrodynamics forces and floating platform motions caused by the wind wave and current most of the viv studies neglect the effect of the internal flow within the marine risers due to large aspect ratio and flexibility of marine risers the effect of the internal flow cannot be neglected in the viv analysis wu and lou 1991 lee et al 1995 guo and lou 2008 when the fluid flows within the riser the centrifugal and coriolis forces are generated by the relative movement between the fluid and the riser in the past decade the influence of the centrifugal and coriolis forces has been explored in the viv analysis meng et al 2018 chatjigeorgiou 2010a montoya hern√°ndez et al 2014 on the one hand the effect of the centrifugal force is manifested as a pressure load which can reduce the tension and natural frequency of the riser the centrifugal force also can amplify the viv in unstable regions where more complex flow patterns would be induced meng et al 2018 on the other hand the coriolis force introduces an extra damping component to narrow the resonance regions of the riser but it also complicates the coupling resonance as a result the viv in the cross flow direction may be affected while the in line dynamics remain because of the damping effect of the coriolis force meng et al 2017a 2017b the internal flow may greatly influence the dynamic response of marine risers in the forms of the centrifugal and coriolis forces because the internal flow consists of water oil and gas the fluid density changes rapidly hence the flow velocity and volume ratio between different fluid phases can cause fluctuations in mass momentum and pressure to increase the complexity to the viv montoya hern√°ndez et al 2014 in order to simplify the investigation of the impact of the internal flow on the viv the plug flow concept was proposed to assume a single phase of the internal flow such that the flow velocity can be fixed chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b meng et al 2017b under this assumption the viv analysis is significantly simplified for two phase see fig 13 or multi phase internal flow the flow inside the riser can be divided into plug flow with bubbles slug flow churn flow annular flow and wispy annular flow ortega et al 2013 the influence of the slug flow was assessed by chatjigeorgiou 2017 the slug flow did not change the vibration patterns but it can greatly enlarge the vibration intensity moreover montoya hern√°ndez et al 2014 treated the multi phase internal flow as a pseudo single phase flow and developed a homogenous model for multi phase flow to investigate the natural frequency of marine risers the results showed that the velocity and density of the internal flow greatly affected the riser response thorsen et al 2019 numerically studied the influence of the internal flow density on the viv of the offshore risers the research results showed that when the wave length of the internal flow was close to the ratio of the riser length to the number of the viv dominant modes the fatigue damage of the riser was greatly worsened as internal flow velocity increases the strain value of cross flow and in line response increases while the frequency decreases guo and lou 2008 dai et al 2013 and meng et al 2017a 2017b investigated the viv of marine risers when the internal flow rate increased from subcritical to supercritical regions it was found that 1 at low flow speed the internal flow absorbed the energy from the riser resulting in significant reduction of the viv 2 in the subcritical region the increase of the flow velocity may reduce the riser natural frequency increase the vibration amplitude and switch the vibration modes 3 in the supercritical region the riser may lose stability and experience various motions including chaotic motion recent studies have found that when the inflow velocity is below the critical velocity the riser response is dominated by the external currents when the inflow velocity exceeds the critical value three dimensional quasi periodic and chaotic response are generated in both the cross flow and in line directions liu et al 2019 duan et al 2018 in addition it should emphasize that compared to previous work in the steady flow the dynamic response are larger in the fluctuating flow dai et al 2014a 2014b in addition the internal flow effect in the riser systems varies with different support modes such as the cantilevered riser meng et al 2017a 2017b chatjigeorgiou 2010a the pinned pinned riser guo and lou 2008 the hinged hinged riser dai et al 2013 and the clamped clamped inclined risers alfosail et al 2016 hence the influence of boundary conditions on the internal flow effect is worth investigating besides the floating platform and internal flow the effect of the surface roughness gao et al 2015 the materials of structures xue et al 2014 and the riser soil interaction at touchdown zone wang et al 2015 are also exciting research points 3 viv analysis approaches the research approaches for the viv analysis of marine risers can be divided into experimental investigation and numerical simulation groups these two groups have been widely used to investigate the viv in recent years 3 1 experimental investigation the experimental investigation is the most important tool to study marine risers due to the complexity of the environment and the chaotic response of marine risers the experimental tests can directly provide the viv response of real marine risers in the sea environments modarres sadeghi et al 2011 however limited to the experimental equipment a very few experimental tests have been conducted in real seas while most of existing experiments have been performed in the laboratory the experimental investigation on the marine risers generally includes the full scale tests and scale tests 3 1 1 full scale test in the real ocean environment full scale experiment tests were carried out using long riser models in the real seas in 2005 vandiver et al 2005 conducted a riser viv test with an aspect ratio up to 3673 at seneca lake in new york the aspect ratio of the riser model was close to an actual marine riser since the boundary conditions of the test riser model were not completely controllable and the relative flow fields outside the riser was very complicated the viv was difficult to analyze using the experimental data srivilairit et al 2009 monitored the riser acceleration and ocean current velocity at a depth of 1000 m in the deep sea drilling and analyzed the full scale measurement data to calculate the viv of the riser to our best knowledge the full scale experiment tests have not reported much in literature 3 1 2 scale test in the laboratory the costs of the full scale experiment tests are often very high and the experimental conditions are uncontrollable to overcome these shortcomings the scale tests in the laboratory are widely employed in the scale tests an elastically mounted rigid riser is often restricted to the transverse flow in the towing tank or water tunnel chaplin et al 2005a table 1 summarizes the scale tests in recent years it can be seen that no one has taken all factors such as the large aspect ratio low mass ratio and high reynolds numbers into account in a single scale test as chaplin et al 2005a suggested that in order to maintain a representative ratio of the high mode wavelength to its diameter the aspect ratio of the riser model should not be less than 500 this aspect ratio is actually too large to be achieved using existing experimental equipment and only a few tests can reach this standard such as 4198 in vandiver et al 2009 1750 in song et al 2011 and 940 in morooka et al 2013 in the scale tests the material and structure of the riser model and the reynolds number of the flow are the key factors that influence the viv characteristics xue et al 2014 found that the material of the riser affected the viv response and fatigue damage in many ways for example despite vibrating in high order modes aluminum risers may have low natural frequencies and fatigue stress than these of the conventional steel risers in order to obtain the large aspect ratio the length of the cylinder is usually much larger than the diameter however this cylinder design requires high bending stiffness and tow speed which is difficult to realize to solve this problem various riser models have been designed e g the cylinder models made of plexiglass franzini et al 2009 and fiber glass vandiver et al 2009 aluminum metal raghavan et al 2011 and steel song et al 2011 a protective layer such as foam or pvc polyvinyl chloride layer is wrapped to seal the cylinder model and to eliminate the protrusions of the riser model huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 and huera huarte et al 2014 similarly because of the limitation of equipment the reynolds number in the laboratory experiments is not as close to the actual value as in practice recently raghavan et al 2011 and gao et al 2015 achieved a reynolds number in laboratory experiments as high as 1 50 l05 and 1 80 l05 respectively in laboratory the uniform flow and oscillatory flow are easily prepared by changing the velocity of the current in the water tunnel and the motion of the model in the towing tank e g fu et al 2013 in the uniform flow the riser model is usually placed transversely and completely submerged in the water recently capell et al 2019 studied the viv characteristics of a cylinder near the water surface and found a vibration region with two vibration modes i e the lock in vibration and non zero vibration to get the shear flow trim et al 2005 used a crane to tow the rig in one direction to make a linear shear current as shown in fig 14 a lie et al 2006 connected the riser model to a floating vessel and pulled the device using a rope system a buoyancy device was used to maintain constant tension for the riser model as shown in fig 14 b the riser was exposed to a triangular current distribution by moving the vessel at a constant velocity chen et al 2015 generated the shear flow in a wind tunnel using spires that were mounted in front of the cylinder model as for the stepped flow it is achieved by immersing the lower part of the cylinder in the uniform flow while keeping the upper part in still water chaplin et al 2005a huera huarte et al 2014 as shown in fig 14 c 3 2 numerical simulation there is no doubt that the viv has a great impact on the fatigue damage in the marine risers therefore it is necessary to establish a model that can accurately predict the viv nevertheless the viv prediction of deep water risers is difficult because of the unsteady flow and extremely complicated fluid structure interaction there are two main ways to predict the viv i e the semi empirical approach and cfd based on the structure of marine risers and empirical hydrodynamic parameters obtained from experiments the semi empirical approach is able to establish a mathematical model to predict the viv cfd can calculate the hydrodynamic force distributed along the structure to predict the viv of the riser thorsen et al 2017 the key parameters that are essential to calculate the viv are given in table 2 in 2005 chaplin et al 2005b compared the viv predicted results of eleven different numerical models with the experimental measurements in the stepped flow the results showed that the empirical models were more accurate than the cfd in predicting the cross flow displacement and curvature the in line curvature induced by the vortices cannot be accurately predicted by neither empirical nor cfd models wanderley et al 2008 obtained the similar conclusion that cfd was ineffective in predicting the viv amplitude at the low mass ratio condition due to the diffusive characteristics of the numerical approaches with rapid development of numerical calculation techniques in recent years the numerical simulation results nowadays can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively predict typical viv characteristics of marine risers 3 2 1 the semi empirical approach the semi empirical approaches mainly include the wake oscillator model and semi empirical model since bishop and hassan 1964 presented the idea that using a wake oscillator to simulate the wake motion around a cylinder and hartlen and currie 1970 established the wake oscillator model a large amount of wake oscillator models based on the van der pol oscillator equation have been proposed the oscillator models possess good properties such as self excited self limiting and natural frequency that satisfy the strouhal relationship gu et al 2012 while for semi empirical models because they are based on the data acquired from forced oscillation experiments these models can reliably predict a certain characteristics of the riser viv furthermore because semi empirical models are able to address the three dimensional flow field conditions they can be applied in practice srinil 2010 based on the semi empirical method abundant nonlinear fluid models have been developed in recent years to solve the overestimation issue of the viv amplitude that exists in the linear models and to consider the effect of the multi mode interactions srinil 2010 proposed a low order fluid structure coupling model to evaluate the nonlinear multi mode viv response of flexible curved and linear cylinders and then srinil 2011 developed a time domain analysis model focusing on the viv prediction of the cross flow direction for the variable tensioned risers in the linear shear flow aiming to study the viv of marine risers under nonlinear conditions thorsen et al 2015 2017 combined a semi empirical model with a nonlinear finite element model to simulate the dynamic response of a marine riser in the oscillatory flow recently gao et al 2019a b proposed a viv prediction method for a deep sea long flexible riser based on a wake oscillator model and found that the vibrations at the end and middle of the riser in the shear flow were dominated by the standing and traveling waves relying on experimental data the time domain analysis method has been used to develop the viv prediction models by comparing with previous experimental studies the time domain analysis method can accurately predict the viv in the steady flow and unstable flow wang et al 2015 lu et al 2019 according to the theory of energy equilibrium xue et al 2014 2015 put forward a time domain prediction model for cross flow and in line vibrations of a marine riser under stepped and shear currents the influence of the maximum shear current velocity top tension internal fluid density and structural material on the riser fatigue damage was discussed pang et al 2019 and lu et al 2019 also proposed different time domain prediction methods to fit the experimental data and predicted the vibration response and modal characteristics of the viv at different flow rates for an elastically fixed cylinder as shown in fig 15 a the structural oscillation model of the riser was modeled by the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis e g pavlovskaia et al 2016 low and srinil 2016 1 m 2 x t 2 c x t e i 4 x z 4 t 2 x z 2 f x 2 m 2 y t 2 c y t e i 4 y z 4 t 2 y z 2 f y where e i denotes the flexural stiffness m c and t are the mass damping and effective axial tension respectively f x and f y are the viv excitation forces in the in line and cross flow direction respectively eqs 1 and 2 can be discretized as xue et al 2014 gu et al 2012 2013 yuan et al 2018 3 m x c x k x f where k is the stiffness furthermore based on empirical parameters obtained from the forced oscillation experiments thorsen et al 2015 2016 improved the model by making the right side of the formula with the excitation damping and added mass then the drag and lift forces see fig 15 b can be expressed as ge et al 2009 4 f x f d f d cos Œ∏ f l sin Œ∏ 5 f y f l cos Œ∏ f d sin Œ∏ where f d is the average drag force f d and f l are respectively the drag and lift force and Œ∏ is the angle between the cylinder speed and the x axis moreover teixeira and morooka 2017 proposed a time domain analysis method for hydrodynamic force calculation based on the concept of energy balance the mathematical equations of the nonlinear system of the riser viv can be solved by the newmark beta method duanmu et al 2017 the viv response of marine risers generally has two degrees of freedom the vibration response in the in line direction has always been ignored to simplify the calculation model recent studies have shown that the response in the in line direction is very important for long flexible risers bai et al 2014 bai et al 2014 established a reduced order model based on the discrete point vortex to simulate the two dimensional viv of the cylinder and the in line and cross flow fluid forces were quantified by the eddy current intensity in actual applications the marine risers are usually inclined thus meng and chen 2012 presented a model to analyze the three dimensional vibration of an inclined extensible steel catenary riser yang et al 2018 investigated the viv by a fully coupled three dimensional nonlinear dynamic model with kelvin voigt viscoelasticity properties to pursue a suitable viscoelastic coefficient till now there are numerous semi empirical approaches to predict the riser viv but a generic model still remains srinil 2010 3 2 2 cfd simulation the complex fluid structure interaction problem of marine risers can be solved by the cfd method as for turbulent flows the cfd based turbulent solvers can be categorized into direct numerical simulation dns reynolds averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and discrete vortex method the dns method can predict the viv response of long flexible structures by directly solving the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations violette et al 2007 the dns approach requires very fine grids to resolve small turbulent scales which has high demand on computing resource currently the dns method can only calculate simple turbulent flows at low reynolds numbers and it is difficult to predict complex turbulent flows at high reynolds numbers the rans method averages the navier stokes equation in the time domain and models the reynolds stress term due to the fluctuating velocity field using a suitable turbulence model the most commonly used turbulence model is the eddy viscosity model in which the reynolds stress generated in the time averaged process is modeled by the eddy viscosity coefficient the rans method can be applied to complex turbulent flows at high reynolds numbers however the accuracy of rans is lower than that of dns the les method divides turbulent eddies into large scale and small scale eddies and simulates them respectively the large scale eddies are directly calculated by solving the navier stokes equation and the small scale eddies are modeled by establishing sub grid scale models matin nikoo et al 2018 in the les calculation process only the large eddies are resolved while the sub grid scale eddies are modeled hence the computational efficiency of les is much higher than that of dns but lower than that of rans besides the reynolds number of the flow field that les can calculate is much higher than that of the dns method the discrete vortex method uses a finite number of discrete vortex elements to represent the concentrated or continuous vortices in the flow field and the lagrange method is used to simulate the motion of the discrete vortex elements yamamoto et al 2004 the discrete vortex method does not need to resolve the turbulence moreover the discrete vortex method ignores the viscosity of the flow field based on the dns method bourguet et al 2011 2013a studied the in line and cross flow viv of a long tensioned beam immersed in the linear shear flow with a reynolds number range from 110 to 1100 and an aspect ratio of 200 khan et al 2017 used the rans equation to simulate the viv of the cylinder with high reynolds number re 104 and low mass ratio and verified the effectiveness of this method by comparing the numerical simulation results with experimental results wang and xiao 2016 calculated the viv of a marine riser under the action of the uniform flow and linear shear flow the cfd simulation results agreed well with the experimental results and show that the dominant frequency the dominant mode number and the root mean square amplitude are proportional to the flow speed nguyen and nguyen 2016 improved the cfd model by combining rans and les to simulate the flow induced vibration of the incompressible navier stokes flow at high reynolds numbers jung et al 2014 and guo et al 2019 numerically simulated the viv of twisted and wavy cylinders at subcritical reynolds numbers and found that the viv was significantly weakened if comparing with the smooth cylinders guo et al 2015 and wang et al 2019a b c used the les method to study the effect of different design parameters on the viv of the fiber reinforced composite riser they found that the maximum equivalent stress of the riser occurs at both ends of the riser and the amplitude of the simply supported riser is larger than that of the fixed support riser due to limitation of the computing techniques direct three dimensional simulation of a marine riser with high aspect ratio and complex flow field is quite difficult a feasible method is to use the strip theory for quasi three dimensional simulation based on the strip theory duanmu et al 2018 and fu et al 2018 developed the viv foam sjtu solver to simulate the viv of marine risers sun et al 2012 presented a stripwise discrete vortex method to study the viv of flexible risers in which each strip was calculated by the discrete vortex method and the three dimensional dynamics was calculated by the finite volume and the incremental method similarly lin and wang 2019 proposed a quasi three dimensional strip method based on the discrete vortex method and finite element method to predict the viv of long flexible risers and the numerical simulation results agree well with the experiment results although the numerical simulations based on the strip theory produce high prediction accuracy for the viv the three dimensional effect of the flow field is always ignored to investigate the effect of the three dimensional flow field labbe and wilson 2007 developed a parallel three dimensional incompressible navier stokes solver huang et al 2011a presented a finite difference scheme and an effective riser motion solver for three dimensional viv simulation with an aspect ratio of 3350 wang et al 2017 used the three dimensional cfd method to study the effect of different in line to cross flow natural frequency ratios on the viv of the cylinder at the reynolds number of 500 the results showed that as the natural frequency ratio increased from 1 to 2 the viv amplitude of the cylinder increased significantly while the maximum amplitude moved toward the high reduced velocity in order to study the vibration suppression effect of a pipe in pipe model matin nikoo et al 2018 conducted the three dimensional simulations using the bidirectional fluid solid coupling cfd model they found that the pipe in pipe model presented a good vibration suppression effect and the suppression effect reached maximum at the strongest viv response following that matin nikoo et al 2019 proposed a method for predicting the three dimensional viv of a marine riser using an improved rans method at low reynolds numbers high prediction accuracy in the upper branch was obtained martins et al 2019a 2019b conducted three dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the impact of the reynolds number and damping on the viv response the rigid body motion equation was used to deal with the moving mesh which could not only reduce the computation cost but also ensure the quality of the mesh in addition the commercial software package ansys mfx multi field solver was developed to solve the three dimensional fluid structure interaction problem chen and kim 2010 wang and xiao 2016 compared with the semi empirical approach the cfd method has been developed more rapidly in recent years with fast development of computer and parallel computing technologies the cfd simulation can be gradually applied to the viv prediction under various practical ocean conditions 4 conclusion the viv of marine risers is a strong nonlinear self exciting self limiting and asymmetrical flow structure coupling phenomenon this review summarizes the recent basic research results of the viv of marine risers including the progress on the viv of the multiple risers and the inclined risers intermittent viv caused by the oscillating flow and so forth different configurations of the multiple risers can result in different wake patterns which significantly impact the viv of the downstream risers in general the spacing between the risers and the reynolds number of the incoming flow impact the viv response of the risers furthermore according to the independence principle the viv of the inclined riser can be analogous to the vertical riser although the calculation accuracy needs improvement the response amplitude of the inclined riser is smaller than that of the vertical riser but the multi mode characteristics of former are stronger the intermittent viv response characteristics are restricted by the keulegan carpenter number and reduced velocity the increase of the keulegan carpenter number will increase the frequency of the viv response while reduce the response amplitude when the reduced velocity increases high order harmonics and mode conversion will appear moreover the effects of the platform motion and internal multiphase flow on the viv are also surveyed the movement of the floating platform can cause the intermittent viv under the oscillatory flow and increase the viv amplitude the internal flow can reduce the natural frequencies of the riser which will make the riser more susceptible to the lock in vibration the internal flow is a heterogeneous multiphase flow that will cause the fluctuations in the parameters of the riser system thereby increasing the complexity and uncertainty of the viv furthermore various research approaches are reviewed in this paper on the one hand experimental research is performed in a real marine environment or a large scale test pool with continuous improvement of the experimental equipment the experimental evaluation of large aspect ratio over 4000 and high reynolds numbers over 105 is able to achieve on the other hand numerical simulation methods such as the semi empirical method and cfd are developed to predict the viv characteristics of marine risers till now the semi empirical method shows higher prediction accuracy than the cfd method however with fast development of the parallel computing technologies the cfd method will show better application prospects in the past decades a lot of efforts have been made to improve the understanding of the riser viv for the purpose of decreasing the operation cost and enhancing the reliability of the riser system however the complexity of external and internal excitations makes the viv around a marine riser still an unsolved problem potential future research directions are discussed as follows 1 the prediction of the viv for risers with large aspect ratio is still an open research field in previous research the dominant parameters such as the reynolds number aspect ratio and mass ratio have been investigated however the combination effect of multiple factors is rarely reported for example the reynolds number is individually studied without considering the aspect ratio raghavan and bernitsas 2011 hence it is crucial to establish a generic viv analysis model that is capable for different applications 2 the discrepancies between the model and actual marine riser system deserve further study it is always difficult costly to implement experimental tests in the conditions that are close to reality simplified testing models are often adopted however the effects of the model materials often plastic and structures i e the simplified models often miss the mechanical joints have not been deeply investigated meng and chen 2012 he et al 2017 furthermore horizontally positioned pipes are used in many studies but the effect of the oil gas fluid gravity is not considered 3 the viv suppression is an important research area at the beginning of transporting the oil and gas production from deep sea the viv of marine risers tends to be more and more complex the viv suppression solution can fundamentally reduce prevent the fatigue damages to marine risers however an accurate viv prediction model is required before performing viv suppression as a result the viv suppression remains a challenging task assia et al 2009 huang 2011 lou et al 2016 with the improvement and development of experimental and simulation methods the viv mechanism for marine risers will become clear in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this work is

22230,marine risers are subject to vortex induced vibration viv caused by a combination of various external and internal excitations the external excitations include the current induced hydrodynamic forces and the wave induced motions of the floating platform while the internal excitation refers to the effect of internal flow with significant increase of the riser aspect ratio the viv becomes much more complicated resulting in more frequent fatigue damages to the risers hence viv is an important research area in marine engineering this review surveys the latest progress on the viv research including the multi mode response viv response at high reynolds numbers flow induced vibrations between multiple marine risers viv of inclined risers and intermittent viv in oscillatory flow particularly the impacts of the floating platform and internal flow that have not been widely considered in previous studies are discussed to comprehensively understand the viv of marine risers moreover typical experimental and numerical investigations on the viv of marine risers are also introduced keywords marine risers vortex induced vibration multi mode response floating platform internal flow 1 introduction a marine riser system is a key part in the offshore oil and gas production system to connect the floating platform and underwater equipment however due to harsh operating environments such as varying waves and flows the marine riser is vulnerable to fatigue failures viv generated by the interactions between the platform current and riser is the main cause of riser failures fig 1 portrays the viv of a riser system under internal and external excitations as a typical fluid structure coupling phenomenon the viv is involved with the response of complex multi frequency and multi degree of freedom vibrations for instance the simplest form of the viv is generated by the interaction between an elastically mounted rigid cylinder and the surrounding uniform flow when the flow passes over a cylinder an unsteady wake will be generated in the form of shedding vortices the vortices alternately fall off from both sides of the cylinder producing a periodically varying lift force along the cross flow and in line directions the viv is then raised by the lift force violette et al 2007 because the viv is a quite complicated nonlinear and asymmetrical phenomenon bernitsas et al 2008 2009 its developing and behaving mechanisms are still not clear in the past decades abundant scientific studies have investigated the mechanisms of the viv some comprehensive reviews can be found in sumer and freds√∏e 1997 and williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 furthermore the viv problem in the marine riser system has attracted extensive attention in recent years innovative designs have been applied to developing different types of marine risers in order to enable their survival in complex ocean environments there are four basic riser types the top tension risers steel catenary risers hybrid risers and flexible risers among these four types the steel catenary risers and flexible risers have been adopted in the exploitation of marine oil and gas resources from offshore to deep sea because of their availability to deep sea environment sun et al 2012 many studies have been performed to investigate the complex characteristics of the viv in the flexible and steel catenary risers where the riser models are usually simplified in the form of a long flexible circular cylinder immersed in the unsteady flow due to large scale of marine risers in practice it is difficult to directly measure the viv of the risers to this avail laboratory experimental test is an effective tool to inspect the viv of marine risers biermann and herrnstein 1934 conducted experimental research on two circular cylinders in the tandem and side by side configurations the results showed that the proximity interference may have a significant effect on the viv in 1955 based on the relationship between the strouhal number and reynolds number roshko 1955 studied the flow field around the cylinder and defined the regime of the flow field feng 1968 conducted typical free vibration experiments and measured the stress and viv response of a flexibly mounted cylinder in 1975 in order to study the effect of axial tension on the viv of marine risers hsu 1975 investigated the response of a suspended slender cylinder subjected to the parametric excitation followed research focused on the vortex characteristics in order to reveal the root mechanism of the viv of marine risers in 1993 brika and laneville 1993 studied the vortex wake pattern of the free vibration by testing vibration cables in a wind tunnel gu et al 1994 investigated the vorticity dynamics using the particle image velocimetry piv to control the motion at a cylinder then govardhan and williamson 2000 found that the upper and lower branches of the amplitude curve corresponded to the two single and two pair vortex wake patterns respectively to compare the effects of cross flow and in line vibrations on the fatigue damage of marine risers trim et al 2005 conducted an experimental study to check the viv response in a uniform and shear flow and found that the degree of fatigue damage along the in line direction was the same as the cross flow direction in order to predict the viv semi empirical models and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods have been used in terms of semi empirical model based predictions birkhoff and zarantonello 1957 used the van der pol oscillator equation to simulate the wake motion then bishop and hassan 1964 and hartlen and curie 1970 proposed the wake oscillator model that used the van der pol oscillator equation to simulate the hydrodynamic force of the wake acting on the cylinder recently nonlinear fluid models have been developed by considering the effects of multi mode interactions srinil 2010 proposed a low order fluid structure coupling model to evaluate the multi mode viv response of flexible cylinders as well as the multimodal characteristics of flexible risers in the cfd models the computing approaches that handle the turbulent flows can be categorized into direct numerical simulation dns reynolds averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and discrete vortex methods because the axial scale of marine risers is very large the calculation effort is quite heavy when performing three dimensional cfd simulation liu et al 2019a an alternative solution is the strip method herfjord et al 1999 used the strip method to simulate the viv in deep water risers based on the strip theory duan et al 2018 and fu et al 2018 recently developed a new cfd solver viv foam sjtu to predict the viv in marine risers furthermore in order to pursue a better understanding of the viv in marine risers new findings have been obtained in recent years compared to the previous results recent studies show the following changes 1 the viv models have progressed from one dimension to two dimension and then to three dimension viz from one dimensional cross flow direction to two dimensional cross flow and in line directions and then towards three dimensional cross flow in line and axial directions at arbitrary flow velocities the amplitude in the cross flow direction is greater than that in the in line direction but the vibration frequency of the in line direction is nearly twice that of the cross flow direction thus the fatigue damage along the in line and cross flow directions is at the same level and it is necessary to propose a reliable in line and cross flow coupled viv prediction method song et al 2011 duanmu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 in addition considering the influence of viscoelasticity on the dynamic response of marine risers a fully coupled three dimensional viv model is essentially required yang et al 2018 2 the flow field around the risers has been investigated from the uniform flow to the shear flow and the oscillatory flow when the riser is active the relative incoming flow speed is usually unstable due to the unstable current and the movement of the floating platform hence the viv of marine risers often presents complicated features 3 nonlinear simulation models in the time domain have been found suitable for the calculation of the riser viv in several cases including the cross flow and in line directions and various current conditions thorsen et al 2017 xue et al 2015 wang et al 2015 lu et al 2019 4 with the widespread use of the long flexible cylinder the prediction of the riser force and response is an important topic in the viv research a unique feature to make the prediction of deep water risers different from other applications is that the aspect ratio of marine riser is very large at least 103 this review summaries the recent new discoveries on the viv research the reminders are organized as follows in section 2 recent progress on viv of marine risers is introduced section 3 surveys the viv analysis techniques section 4 draws the conclusions 2 viv of marine risers 2 1 viv induced by current viv of marine risers has been extensively investigated in the past decades the viv dynamics of a marine riser are irregularly affected by the non perpendicular current srinil 2010 leading to multi mode and high order harmonic characteristics this irregularity feature of the viv is particularly important for investigating real offshore oil and gas production systems because the factors such as the configuration and inclination of the risers the movement of the floating platform and the internal flow of the risers may intensify the uncertainty of the current as a result considerable efforts have been made to understand the viv in different current conditions 2 1 1 multi mode response multi mode vibration characteristics have been observed in long flexible risers in previous studies and the multi mode characteristics are the main difference between long flexible risers and rigid cylinders the viv of the latter exhibits single mode lock in vibration due to large aspect ratio the riser may vibrate at high frequencies and multi mode conditions even in the simplest case where the vertical riser is placed in a uniform flow field the multi mode viv is still possibly generated wang and xiao 2016 fig 2 a shows the orbital trajectories at different riser positions and fig 2 b shows the vortex shedding in the uniform flow useful attempts have been made to address the multi mode and multi frequency viv of a long flexible cylinder that is mounted in different forms such as curved inclined and straight and immersed in different flows such as uniform flow linear shear flow exponential shear flow and stepped flow trim et al 2005 carried out a series of riser model tests in uniform and shear flows to investigate the viv of marine risers multi mode viv response was observed in the experimental tests and the number of dominating modes in both uniform and shear flows increased with the increase of the flow velocity similarly lie and kaasen 2006 carried out a large scale riser model test in a shear flow to investigate the modes of the viv response the experimental results showed an irregular viv response and the mode number increased with the flow velocity moreover the single mode viv response was not observed in the experimental test i e the lock in viv response did not occur in the shear flow chaplin et al 2005a investigated the viv of a marine riser in stepped flow and found that the viv response of the riser mainly occurred at the frequency corresponding to the dominating mode more recently srinil 2010 2011 pavlovskaia et al 2016 song et al 2016 and duanmu et al 2018 have drawn similar conclusions by numerical simulations the viv response of a long flexible riser shows multi mode characteristics no matter how it is placed in the flow field only except when the angle between the axial direction of the riser and the flow direction of the flow field is very small and the higher the flow velocity the stronger the multi mode response moreover behara et al 2011 studied the viv of the elastically mounted sphere and discovered the spiral vortices the viv amplitude caused hysteresis at the beginning of the lock in state in the spiral vortex shedding mode srinil 2010 2011 investigated the multi mode response of a geometrically nonlinear flexible cylinder and observed the nonlinear characteristics of the viv such as multi mode lock in shifting sharing and interaction characteristics besides the multi modal dynamic response of the tensioned beam was highly aperiodic and the effect of reynolds number on the viv prediction was reduced as shown in fig 3 similar results were found by vandiver et al 2009 and duanmu et al 2018 accordingly the oncoming flow profile may affect the cylinder mode characteristics resulting in different mode response in different flows for instance the number of modes of a cylinder in a uniform flow is generally lower than that in a shear flow bourguet et al 2012 2013b and duanmu et al 2017 song et al 2011 and wang and xiao 2016 also observed that the dominant mode and the vibration frequencies of excited modes increased with the flow velocity the multi mode viv response was generally controlled by traveling waves which was positively proportional to the flow velocity zhu et al 2019 chen and rhee 2019 furthermore as the aspect ratio increased the vibration mode of the cylinder transitioned from a single mode to multiple modes duanmu et al 2017 in addition the reynolds number and the axial tension of a marine riser affected the multi mode vibration of the viv chaos is a generic feature of the multi mode viv response in flexible risers the dominant frequency of the multi mode viv is consistent with the strouhal frequency which refers to the vortex shedding frequency calculated based on the strouhal number song et al 2011 the multi mode viv of a riser is more difficult to predict due to its complex chaotic characteristics in 2010 violette et al 2010 studied the mode conversion and simultaneity of the cylinder viv using a linear stability method however the linear method cannot accurately predict the amplitude due to nonlinear characteristics of the viv it is well known that the vibration amplitude of a riser in the primary mode is mainly determined by the relationship between the vortex shedding frequency and the riser natural frequency duanmu et al 2018 if these two frequencies are too close the resonance will happen to significantly increase the vibration amplitude duanmu et al 2018 moreover factors such as the drag amplification asymmetry and higher harmonics also contribute to the nonlinear characteristics of the viv for instance the drag amplification may increase the deflection of a riser and the loading at both ends of a riser huang et al 2011b song et al 2011 all these factors will enhance the multi mode characteristics in the viv response of long flexible risers 2 1 2 response at high reynolds numbers experimental studies on the viv at high reynolds numbers are quite scarce due to huge difficulties in performing experimental investigations early in 1997 kalro and tezduyar 1997 investigated the viv characteristics of a cylinder immersed in the uniform flow and the results presented weak three dimensional features at the reynolds number of 300 once the reynolds number reached up to 1 l05 and even higher its influence on the synchronization and amplitude of the viv is much clearer raghavan and bernitsas 2011 in order to obtain aquatic clean energy from the viv the model tests in a wide reynolds number range were conducted by raghavan and bernitsas 2011 and modir and goudarzi 2019 the results showed that high reynolds numbers in the range of 8 00 l03 to 1 50 l05 impacted the viv amplitude greater than the mass ratio and the viv amplitude highly depended on the natural frequency and lock in as a result a high reynolds number flow will increase the vortex shedding frequency and the hydrodynamic force on marine risers and generally increase the amplitude and frequency of the riser viv traditional method for predicting the viv amplitude is the griffin curve griffin 1980 recently williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 and raghavan and bernitsas 2011 found that the viv amplitude at high reynolds numbers was as twice as that predicted by the modified griffin curve in the upper branch of the amplitude curve the synchronization range and amplitude ratio were positively correlated with the reynolds number similarly behara et al 2016 investigated the effects of reynolds number and reduced velocity on the viv and found that the riser maintained a synchronous vibration at a reynolds number between 300 and 1000 wanderley and soares 2015 found that the reynolds number greatly influenced the amplitude frequency and phase angle of the low mass damping system the numerical results showed that the wider the reynolds number range the higher the amplitude ratio and the closer the response frequency in the lock in area to the riser natural frequency as shown in fig 4 similar results can be found in nguyen and nguyen 2016 with the reynolds number ranging from 3 l03 to 3 l04 and in gao et al 2015 with the reynolds number ranging from 2 5 104 to 1 8 105 as a result the reynolds number is an important parameter that must be considered in viv simulations the influence of high reynolds numbers on the viv of flexible risers needs to be further studied 2 1 3 flow induced vibration of multiple marine risers the configuration of multiple marine risers is of great significance for marine oil and gas production systems the viv response of multiple marine risers is more complex than that in a single riser for instance the two cylinder system can be configured as tandem side by side and staggered configurations see fig 5 the characteristics of flow fields around these three configurations are quite complicated in terms of flow patterns fluid forces vortices wake and so on sumner 2010 reviewed in details the research on two cylinders in the stable cross flow following many new research has been conducted to address the viv response in multiple marine risers the flow field around two tandem cylinders is influenced by the reynolds number and spacing ratio l d and the vortex interaction mechanism of two tandem circular cylinders is very complicated in order to study the effect of the reynolds number and spacing ratio on the flow field around the cylinder and the cylinder vibration armina et al 2018 conducted a series of experimental studies on the tandem configured multiple risers and found that the vibration frequencies of the upstream and downstream risers were different this observation is contrary to the previous conclusions on the fixed risers carmo et al 2010a 2010b divided the flow patterns of the tandem cylinders under low reynolds numbers into three basic types 1 symmetric at l d 1 5 2 alternating at l d 1 8 and 2 3 and 3 wake at l d 5 sewatkar et al 2012 conducted a comprehensive study of flow fields around six square cylinders in the tandem configuration by investigating the power spectrum and the influence of the secondary frequency on the lift coefficient they proposed four primary flow regimes with different spacing ratios at the reynolds number of 100 including the synchronous 0 5 l d 1 1 quasi periodic i 1 2 l d 13 quasi periodic ii 1 4 l d 5 0 and chaotic 6 0 l d 10 0 regimes they further discussed the underlying mechanisms of these four flow regimes the flow is synchronized when a single wake is formed behind all cylinders while the flow transitions to the quasi periodic i quasi periodic ii or chaotic regimes when the vortices are generated and shed in the gap of the cylinders the observations from huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte et al 2016 showed that when the spacing ratio was from 2 to 6 the response of the cylinders displayed classical viv resonance moreover the upstream cylinder underwent larger vibrations than the downstream cylinder and the viv amplitude of the upstream cylinder was negatively proportional to the spacing ratio to investigate the vortex interaction mechanism of the tandem circular cylinders borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 carried out numerical simulations to study the viv of two identical elastically mounted cylinders at the reynolds number of 200 and found that when the reduced velocity was slow the initial dynamic of the cylinder vibration generated the shedding vortex when the vertical distance between the two cylinders caused by the initial viv exceeded the diameter of the cylinder the gap flow was generated to dominate the vibration of the riser and greatly increase the viv amplitude assi et al 2010 2013 stated that the wake induced vibration of the multiple cylinders cannot be predicted by the classical galloping theory and hence introduced the wake stiffness to explain the vibration of the downstream cylinder while most of existing research has focused on two cylinders very limited work considered three or more cylinders wang et al 2019a b c carried out an experimental study on three and four long flexible cylinders with tandem configuration and found that the downstream riser produced a small effect on the amplitude of the upstream riser and the wake induced vibration of the downstream cylinders occurred at a high reduced velocity besides the last downstream cylinder in the three cylinders presented the same in line and cross flow main frequency and the response of the other two cylinders was of dual resonance ding et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders with rough strips the results showed that the vortex of the downstream riser was disturbed by the upstream riser leading to a lower amplitude in the downstream riser in the galloping branch of the amplitude curve the shear layer motion was consistent with the riser motion and the amplitude of the first upstream riser is largest among the three risers in the side by side configuration the flow pattern between the two risers dominates the riser vibration there are four flow patterns in the side by side configuration sumner 2010 chen et al 2015a i e 1 single wake vortex street without vortex shedding at small spacing ratio l d 1 1 1 2 2 biased flow pattern at intermediate spacing ratio 1 1 1 2 l d 2 0 2 5 3 two parallel wake vortex streets at high spacing ratio 2 0 2 5 l d 4 and 4 large spacing ratio l d 4 and re 100 at which the viv between the two cylinders does not interact with each other and is similar to that of a single cylinder zhao 2013a chen et al 2015b moreover the flow pattern of the viv in the side by side configuration in a uniform flow with low reynolds numbers can be divided into six near wake patterns namely the irregular pattern the in phase flip flopping pattern the out of phase flip flopping pattern the in phase synchronized pattern the anti phase synchronized pattern and the biased anti phase synchronized pattern chen et al 2015a 2015b carini et al 2014 bao et al 2013 huera huarte and gharib 2011 fig 6 portrays these six flow patterns for the near wake patterns chen et al 2015a further analyzed the asymmetric vibration and symmetry hysteresis phenomena of two side by side risers they found that the asymmetric vibration was related to the stable biased flow and the near wake mode around the cylinder and the symmetry hysteresis was induced by the combination of the in phase synchronized pattern and the biased anti phase synchronized pattern for the flow field between multiple risers sewatkar et al 2012a b investigated the energy transfer in the flow around six side by side cylinders and found that the energy conversion was more intense in the resonance region of the cylinder xu et al 2018 performed the flow induced vibration experiments of three and four side by side cylinders and compared the flow induced vibration with different number of cylinders the comparison demonstrated that the dominant frequencies and mode numbers of the three and four cylinder systems were the same as those of the isolated and two cylinder systems but the response amplitude and multi mode response characteristics between the three and four cylinder systems were significantly different due to different wake actions in reality the staggered configuration is commonly used in multiple marine risers however comprehensive studies on the staggered configuration are relatively few in literature the relative position of two staggered cylinders can be characterized by non dimensional center to center spacing ratio l d and incident angle Œ± sumner et al 2010 the interaction of the free shear layer and the two k√°rm√°n vortex streets in a staggered configuration may induce different flow patterns based on the strouhal number and the flow form hu and zhou 2008 divided the wake patterns into two single street modes s i and s ii and two double street modes t i and t ii recently many new achievements have been made on flow induced vibration analysis of more than two risers in the staggered arrangement han et al 2018 numerically investigated the flow induced vibration characteristics of three cylinders in the equilateral triangular arrangement at different flow incident angles and reduced velocities as shown in fig 7 the results showed that the flow induced vibration response and the vortex shedding mode were greatly affected by the flow incident angle and the reduced velocity and the flow induced vibration reached a minimum amplitude at an incident angle Œ± 30 gao et al 2019a b simulated the fluid induced vibration of four cylinders arranged in a square with different inflow angles and reduced velocities they found that the flow incident angle had great influence on the orbital trajectory and shedding mode of the four cylinders as well as the amplitude and lift coefficient of the downstream risers in addition the drag coefficient of all cylinders increased first and then decreased with the reduced velocity more details with respect to the vibration response of the staggered configuration can refer to sumner et al 2005 2010 and lee et al 2009 2 1 4 viv of inclined risers marine risers are usually inclined to the direction of the incoming current which makes the viv more complex than that in the vertical risers in order to simplify the mathematical model of inclined risers the independence principle has been proposed to calculate the viv of an inclined cylinder analogously as that of a vertical cylinder by projecting the inclined cylinder onto a plane perpendicular to the direction of the incoming flow the viv response can be calculated using the excitation of the normal component of the incoming flow relative to the inclined riser the independence principle has been proven effective for predicting the viv response and hydrodynamic forces with an inclined angle Œ± 65 however there are also some shortcomings such as that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder is overestimated and the conversion process cannot be measured from a single frequency to multi frequency response franzini et al 2013 jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 bourguet et al 2015 zhao 2015 recently bourguet and triantafyllou 2015 investigated the viv response of a flexible cylinder with different inclined angles see fig 8 the results showed that the vibration and fluid force of the inclined flexible cylinder deviated from the independence principle while the independence principle greatly underestimated the frequency of the viv and failed to capture the asymmetry of the riser vibration in addition bourguet et al 2015 confirmed that the effectiveness of the independence principle can be affected by the bending of the cylinder along the in line direction as a result the independence principle reduces the calculating cost but decreases the prediction accuracy of the viv of inclined risers the viv frequency ratio of in line and cross flow directions in the inclined riser is approximately equal to 2 which is similar to that of the vertical riser bourguet et al 2012 2015a in order to study the intensity of the viv response for the inclined risers franzini et al 2009 and seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 carried out inclined cylinder experiments and observed that the oscillation amplitude hydrodynamic forces and added mass of the inclined cylinder were smaller than that of the vertical cylinder han et al 2017 conducted an experimental test to investigate the dynamic characteristics of an inclined flexible cylinder with the inclined angle Œ± 45 they observed that the viv response presented obvious multi mode characteristics the dominating modes ranged from 1 to 3 in the cross flow direction and 1 to 5 in the in line direction see fig 9 and the dominating frequency was linearly correlated with the flow velocity see fig 10 moreover the results also showed that the drag coefficient was between 0 9 and 2 6 rather than being dispersed like in a vertical cylinder 2 1 5 intermittent viv in oscillatory flow due to large amplitude motions of the floating platform caused by the ocean wave and current an oscillatory flow around the marine risers may take place leading to vortex shedding and intermittent viv a basic feature of the viv response in an oscillating flow is that the response is strongly dependent on the keulegan carpenter kc number and reduced velocity the dominant vibration frequency of the intermittent viv is positively correlated with kc number and negatively correlated with the reduced velocity in general in the lock in situation when the kc number increases the lock in area will reach a stable point and expand with the increase of the maximum shedding frequency when the maximum reduced velocity increases the lock in area widens with the same reduced velocity large amplitude of the viv appears at a low kc number zhao 2013b fu et al 2013 thorsen et al 2016 2017 and yuan et al 2018 furthermore wang et al 2015a revealed that both the kc number and maximum reduced velocity produced a profound influence on the riser fatigue damage which is a unique characteristic of intermittent viv caused by the oscillatory flow with the same maximum reduced velocity the viv amplitude and fatigue damage were negatively correlated to the kc number there are numerous different characteristics between the oscillating flow and the steady flow on the viv of marine risers including the amplitude modulation and high order harmonics as shown in fig 11 the phenomena of the amplitude modulation and high order harmonics appear in the intermittent viv under the oscillatory flow wang et al 2015 the amplitude modulation would become inconspicuous at a large reduced velocity and the high order harmonics was approximately three times of the maximum vortex shedding frequency hysteresis and mode conversion as observed in a steady flow in fig 11 occurred in the oscillating flow the mode conversion occurred if the reduced velocity was large enough fu et al 2013 2018 wang et al 2015a carried out an experimental test to study the fatigue failure of flexible risers caused by the intermittent viv and found that the amplitude modulation and mode conversion had a significant impact on the riser fatigue damage furthermore a sharp increase about two orders of magnitude in fatigue damage was discovered in the region of high order harmonics and the damage increased by nearly 50 compared to that caused by a single harmonic stress zheng et al 2014 2 2 viv affected by floating platform and internal flow 2 2 1 viv affected by floating platform as marine oil mining activities extend to deep sea areas liu et al 2019b the form of the riser system is quite different from the traditional fixed platform the movement of the floating platform becomes complicated and the dynamic coupling between the platform and underwater risers is strengthened causing new problems such as additional lock in regions parameter excitation and nonlinear amplification garrett 2005 yang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 fan et al 2017 the platform motions can cause the viv of marine risers with high order modes and large vibration amplitude recently yin et al 2019 studied the influence of the platform motions on the vibration of the riser interestingly they found that the in line vibration caused by the platform motions was stronger than that of the cross flow viv caused by the oscillatory flow furthermore the dynamics and vibration response of the viv affected by the floating platform are very different from that without considering the movement of the floating platform because of horizontal and vertical platform motions chen et al 2015 the horizontal movement of the platform such as sway and surge would spread along the riser toward to the bottom and interact with the viv of the riser then further cause the nonlinear coupling on the motion boundary chen et al 2014 in addition the vertical heave motion mainly affects the dynamic tension of the riser which periodically changes the structure parameters of the riser resulting in the problem of parameter excitation moreover compared with the horizontal movement of the platform the vertical motion can cause dangerously dynamic response on the riser for the horizontal motion the floating platform may suffer from wave induced motions the phenomena such as the oscillation flow and top end sway would cause the intermittent viv of marine risers when the floating platform sways the displacement of the riser will be enlarged chen et al 2015 observed the nonlinear response amplification phenomenon which indicated that the platform motion could be amplified during the motion spreading along the riser moreover the displacement of the riser would increase with the swaying amplitude both the displacement and response amplification would increase with the drop of the sway frequency wang et al 2016 also found obvious drag amplification caused by the horizontal motion under small kc number and the experiment results showed that the platform motion induced viv presented strong time consistency in terms of both amplitude and frequency as shown in fig 12 as for the vertical movement heave of the platform the foremost problem is the fluctuation in the axial tension of the riser which can cause varies of the geometric stiffness although the fluctuation is greatly suppressed by the heave compensators the linear balance of the riser may be broken down resulting in intensified viv moreover when the vibration amplitude of the platform is sufficiently large the tension may be transformed into pressure at a certain part of the riser to produce dangerous dynamic stresses kuiper et al 2008 varying structural parameters can also significantly affect the modal properties of the viv focusing on the viv of a flexible cylinder with axially varying structural parameters sanaati and kato 2012 found that the fluctuating tension ratio and lock in bandwidth of the viv increased with the axial stiffness while decreased with the pre tension in addition high pre tension can greatly enlarge the lift force coefficient and reduce the vibration amplitude in their experimental investigation when the pre tension increased by four times the lift coefficient increased by about 57 while the vibration amplitude reduced by about 30 yang and xiao 2014 further discovered that the pre tension was effective in suppressing the instability of marine risers and preventing extreme vibrations in order to completely understand the effect of the floating platform motion on the viv of marine risers wang et al 2014 2015b 2016 carried out a lot of experimental investigations the analysis results showed good agreement with earlier observations on flexible risers in oscillatory flow and the viv caused by the movement of the floating platform was strongly associated with the kc number wang et al 2015b stated that due to extensive changes in kc number and the tension the time varying characteristics of the system dynamics were more obvious with larger movement of the platform in addition the fatigue damage caused by the viv in the cross flow direction was significantly influenced by both the amplitude and period of the platform movement the most severe damages occurred in the touchdown point the upper bend point and the top of the riser recently in order to predict the viv induced by the floating platform for a free hanging riser under low kc number wang et al 2019a b c proposed a new numerical method this new method was implemented in vivana and validated by experimental tests to show good performance in predicting the frequency stress and amplitude of the viv generally the horizontal and vertical movements of the platform never occur independently if take both movements into consideration not only a time varying moving boundary and periodically parametric excitation but also a nonlinear dynamic response would be imposed to a marine riser consequently a small platform movement may result in a large response of the riser accompanied by complex viv 2 2 2 viv affected by internal flow in addition to the external excitation loads such as the hydrodynamics forces and floating platform motions caused by the wind wave and current most of the viv studies neglect the effect of the internal flow within the marine risers due to large aspect ratio and flexibility of marine risers the effect of the internal flow cannot be neglected in the viv analysis wu and lou 1991 lee et al 1995 guo and lou 2008 when the fluid flows within the riser the centrifugal and coriolis forces are generated by the relative movement between the fluid and the riser in the past decade the influence of the centrifugal and coriolis forces has been explored in the viv analysis meng et al 2018 chatjigeorgiou 2010a montoya hern√°ndez et al 2014 on the one hand the effect of the centrifugal force is manifested as a pressure load which can reduce the tension and natural frequency of the riser the centrifugal force also can amplify the viv in unstable regions where more complex flow patterns would be induced meng et al 2018 on the other hand the coriolis force introduces an extra damping component to narrow the resonance regions of the riser but it also complicates the coupling resonance as a result the viv in the cross flow direction may be affected while the in line dynamics remain because of the damping effect of the coriolis force meng et al 2017a 2017b the internal flow may greatly influence the dynamic response of marine risers in the forms of the centrifugal and coriolis forces because the internal flow consists of water oil and gas the fluid density changes rapidly hence the flow velocity and volume ratio between different fluid phases can cause fluctuations in mass momentum and pressure to increase the complexity to the viv montoya hern√°ndez et al 2014 in order to simplify the investigation of the impact of the internal flow on the viv the plug flow concept was proposed to assume a single phase of the internal flow such that the flow velocity can be fixed chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b meng et al 2017b under this assumption the viv analysis is significantly simplified for two phase see fig 13 or multi phase internal flow the flow inside the riser can be divided into plug flow with bubbles slug flow churn flow annular flow and wispy annular flow ortega et al 2013 the influence of the slug flow was assessed by chatjigeorgiou 2017 the slug flow did not change the vibration patterns but it can greatly enlarge the vibration intensity moreover montoya hern√°ndez et al 2014 treated the multi phase internal flow as a pseudo single phase flow and developed a homogenous model for multi phase flow to investigate the natural frequency of marine risers the results showed that the velocity and density of the internal flow greatly affected the riser response thorsen et al 2019 numerically studied the influence of the internal flow density on the viv of the offshore risers the research results showed that when the wave length of the internal flow was close to the ratio of the riser length to the number of the viv dominant modes the fatigue damage of the riser was greatly worsened as internal flow velocity increases the strain value of cross flow and in line response increases while the frequency decreases guo and lou 2008 dai et al 2013 and meng et al 2017a 2017b investigated the viv of marine risers when the internal flow rate increased from subcritical to supercritical regions it was found that 1 at low flow speed the internal flow absorbed the energy from the riser resulting in significant reduction of the viv 2 in the subcritical region the increase of the flow velocity may reduce the riser natural frequency increase the vibration amplitude and switch the vibration modes 3 in the supercritical region the riser may lose stability and experience various motions including chaotic motion recent studies have found that when the inflow velocity is below the critical velocity the riser response is dominated by the external currents when the inflow velocity exceeds the critical value three dimensional quasi periodic and chaotic response are generated in both the cross flow and in line directions liu et al 2019 duan et al 2018 in addition it should emphasize that compared to previous work in the steady flow the dynamic response are larger in the fluctuating flow dai et al 2014a 2014b in addition the internal flow effect in the riser systems varies with different support modes such as the cantilevered riser meng et al 2017a 2017b chatjigeorgiou 2010a the pinned pinned riser guo and lou 2008 the hinged hinged riser dai et al 2013 and the clamped clamped inclined risers alfosail et al 2016 hence the influence of boundary conditions on the internal flow effect is worth investigating besides the floating platform and internal flow the effect of the surface roughness gao et al 2015 the materials of structures xue et al 2014 and the riser soil interaction at touchdown zone wang et al 2015 are also exciting research points 3 viv analysis approaches the research approaches for the viv analysis of marine risers can be divided into experimental investigation and numerical simulation groups these two groups have been widely used to investigate the viv in recent years 3 1 experimental investigation the experimental investigation is the most important tool to study marine risers due to the complexity of the environment and the chaotic response of marine risers the experimental tests can directly provide the viv response of real marine risers in the sea environments modarres sadeghi et al 2011 however limited to the experimental equipment a very few experimental tests have been conducted in real seas while most of existing experiments have been performed in the laboratory the experimental investigation on the marine risers generally includes the full scale tests and scale tests 3 1 1 full scale test in the real ocean environment full scale experiment tests were carried out using long riser models in the real seas in 2005 vandiver et al 2005 conducted a riser viv test with an aspect ratio up to 3673 at seneca lake in new york the aspect ratio of the riser model was close to an actual marine riser since the boundary conditions of the test riser model were not completely controllable and the relative flow fields outside the riser was very complicated the viv was difficult to analyze using the experimental data srivilairit et al 2009 monitored the riser acceleration and ocean current velocity at a depth of 1000 m in the deep sea drilling and analyzed the full scale measurement data to calculate the viv of the riser to our best knowledge the full scale experiment tests have not reported much in literature 3 1 2 scale test in the laboratory the costs of the full scale experiment tests are often very high and the experimental conditions are uncontrollable to overcome these shortcomings the scale tests in the laboratory are widely employed in the scale tests an elastically mounted rigid riser is often restricted to the transverse flow in the towing tank or water tunnel chaplin et al 2005a table 1 summarizes the scale tests in recent years it can be seen that no one has taken all factors such as the large aspect ratio low mass ratio and high reynolds numbers into account in a single scale test as chaplin et al 2005a suggested that in order to maintain a representative ratio of the high mode wavelength to its diameter the aspect ratio of the riser model should not be less than 500 this aspect ratio is actually too large to be achieved using existing experimental equipment and only a few tests can reach this standard such as 4198 in vandiver et al 2009 1750 in song et al 2011 and 940 in morooka et al 2013 in the scale tests the material and structure of the riser model and the reynolds number of the flow are the key factors that influence the viv characteristics xue et al 2014 found that the material of the riser affected the viv response and fatigue damage in many ways for example despite vibrating in high order modes aluminum risers may have low natural frequencies and fatigue stress than these of the conventional steel risers in order to obtain the large aspect ratio the length of the cylinder is usually much larger than the diameter however this cylinder design requires high bending stiffness and tow speed which is difficult to realize to solve this problem various riser models have been designed e g the cylinder models made of plexiglass franzini et al 2009 and fiber glass vandiver et al 2009 aluminum metal raghavan et al 2011 and steel song et al 2011 a protective layer such as foam or pvc polyvinyl chloride layer is wrapped to seal the cylinder model and to eliminate the protrusions of the riser model huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 and huera huarte et al 2014 similarly because of the limitation of equipment the reynolds number in the laboratory experiments is not as close to the actual value as in practice recently raghavan et al 2011 and gao et al 2015 achieved a reynolds number in laboratory experiments as high as 1 50 l05 and 1 80 l05 respectively in laboratory the uniform flow and oscillatory flow are easily prepared by changing the velocity of the current in the water tunnel and the motion of the model in the towing tank e g fu et al 2013 in the uniform flow the riser model is usually placed transversely and completely submerged in the water recently capell et al 2019 studied the viv characteristics of a cylinder near the water surface and found a vibration region with two vibration modes i e the lock in vibration and non zero vibration to get the shear flow trim et al 2005 used a crane to tow the rig in one direction to make a linear shear current as shown in fig 14 a lie et al 2006 connected the riser model to a floating vessel and pulled the device using a rope system a buoyancy device was used to maintain constant tension for the riser model as shown in fig 14 b the riser was exposed to a triangular current distribution by moving the vessel at a constant velocity chen et al 2015 generated the shear flow in a wind tunnel using spires that were mounted in front of the cylinder model as for the stepped flow it is achieved by immersing the lower part of the cylinder in the uniform flow while keeping the upper part in still water chaplin et al 2005a huera huarte et al 2014 as shown in fig 14 c 3 2 numerical simulation there is no doubt that the viv has a great impact on the fatigue damage in the marine risers therefore it is necessary to establish a model that can accurately predict the viv nevertheless the viv prediction of deep water risers is difficult because of the unsteady flow and extremely complicated fluid structure interaction there are two main ways to predict the viv i e the semi empirical approach and cfd based on the structure of marine risers and empirical hydrodynamic parameters obtained from experiments the semi empirical approach is able to establish a mathematical model to predict the viv cfd can calculate the hydrodynamic force distributed along the structure to predict the viv of the riser thorsen et al 2017 the key parameters that are essential to calculate the viv are given in table 2 in 2005 chaplin et al 2005b compared the viv predicted results of eleven different numerical models with the experimental measurements in the stepped flow the results showed that the empirical models were more accurate than the cfd in predicting the cross flow displacement and curvature the in line curvature induced by the vortices cannot be accurately predicted by neither empirical nor cfd models wanderley et al 2008 obtained the similar conclusion that cfd was ineffective in predicting the viv amplitude at the low mass ratio condition due to the diffusive characteristics of the numerical approaches with rapid development of numerical calculation techniques in recent years the numerical simulation results nowadays can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively predict typical viv characteristics of marine risers 3 2 1 the semi empirical approach the semi empirical approaches mainly include the wake oscillator model and semi empirical model since bishop and hassan 1964 presented the idea that using a wake oscillator to simulate the wake motion around a cylinder and hartlen and currie 1970 established the wake oscillator model a large amount of wake oscillator models based on the van der pol oscillator equation have been proposed the oscillator models possess good properties such as self excited self limiting and natural frequency that satisfy the strouhal relationship gu et al 2012 while for semi empirical models because they are based on the data acquired from forced oscillation experiments these models can reliably predict a certain characteristics of the riser viv furthermore because semi empirical models are able to address the three dimensional flow field conditions they can be applied in practice srinil 2010 based on the semi empirical method abundant nonlinear fluid models have been developed in recent years to solve the overestimation issue of the viv amplitude that exists in the linear models and to consider the effect of the multi mode interactions srinil 2010 proposed a low order fluid structure coupling model to evaluate the nonlinear multi mode viv response of flexible curved and linear cylinders and then srinil 2011 developed a time domain analysis model focusing on the viv prediction of the cross flow direction for the variable tensioned risers in the linear shear flow aiming to study the viv of marine risers under nonlinear conditions thorsen et al 2015 2017 combined a semi empirical model with a nonlinear finite element model to simulate the dynamic response of a marine riser in the oscillatory flow recently gao et al 2019a b proposed a viv prediction method for a deep sea long flexible riser based on a wake oscillator model and found that the vibrations at the end and middle of the riser in the shear flow were dominated by the standing and traveling waves relying on experimental data the time domain analysis method has been used to develop the viv prediction models by comparing with previous experimental studies the time domain analysis method can accurately predict the viv in the steady flow and unstable flow wang et al 2015 lu et al 2019 according to the theory of energy equilibrium xue et al 2014 2015 put forward a time domain prediction model for cross flow and in line vibrations of a marine riser under stepped and shear currents the influence of the maximum shear current velocity top tension internal fluid density and structural material on the riser fatigue damage was discussed pang et al 2019 and lu et al 2019 also proposed different time domain prediction methods to fit the experimental data and predicted the vibration response and modal characteristics of the viv at different flow rates for an elastically fixed cylinder as shown in fig 15 a the structural oscillation model of the riser was modeled by the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis e g pavlovskaia et al 2016 low and srinil 2016 1 m 2 x t 2 c x t e i 4 x z 4 t 2 x z 2 f x 2 m 2 y t 2 c y t e i 4 y z 4 t 2 y z 2 f y where e i denotes the flexural stiffness m c and t are the mass damping and effective axial tension respectively f x and f y are the viv excitation forces in the in line and cross flow direction respectively eqs 1 and 2 can be discretized as xue et al 2014 gu et al 2012 2013 yuan et al 2018 3 m x c x k x f where k is the stiffness furthermore based on empirical parameters obtained from the forced oscillation experiments thorsen et al 2015 2016 improved the model by making the right side of the formula with the excitation damping and added mass then the drag and lift forces see fig 15 b can be expressed as ge et al 2009 4 f x f d f d cos Œ∏ f l sin Œ∏ 5 f y f l cos Œ∏ f d sin Œ∏ where f d is the average drag force f d and f l are respectively the drag and lift force and Œ∏ is the angle between the cylinder speed and the x axis moreover teixeira and morooka 2017 proposed a time domain analysis method for hydrodynamic force calculation based on the concept of energy balance the mathematical equations of the nonlinear system of the riser viv can be solved by the newmark beta method duanmu et al 2017 the viv response of marine risers generally has two degrees of freedom the vibration response in the in line direction has always been ignored to simplify the calculation model recent studies have shown that the response in the in line direction is very important for long flexible risers bai et al 2014 bai et al 2014 established a reduced order model based on the discrete point vortex to simulate the two dimensional viv of the cylinder and the in line and cross flow fluid forces were quantified by the eddy current intensity in actual applications the marine risers are usually inclined thus meng and chen 2012 presented a model to analyze the three dimensional vibration of an inclined extensible steel catenary riser yang et al 2018 investigated the viv by a fully coupled three dimensional nonlinear dynamic model with kelvin voigt viscoelasticity properties to pursue a suitable viscoelastic coefficient till now there are numerous semi empirical approaches to predict the riser viv but a generic model still remains srinil 2010 3 2 2 cfd simulation the complex fluid structure interaction problem of marine risers can be solved by the cfd method as for turbulent flows the cfd based turbulent solvers can be categorized into direct numerical simulation dns reynolds averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and discrete vortex method the dns method can predict the viv response of long flexible structures by directly solving the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations violette et al 2007 the dns approach requires very fine grids to resolve small turbulent scales which has high demand on computing resource currently the dns method can only calculate simple turbulent flows at low reynolds numbers and it is difficult to predict complex turbulent flows at high reynolds numbers the rans method averages the navier stokes equation in the time domain and models the reynolds stress term due to the fluctuating velocity field using a suitable turbulence model the most commonly used turbulence model is the eddy viscosity model in which the reynolds stress generated in the time averaged process is modeled by the eddy viscosity coefficient the rans method can be applied to complex turbulent flows at high reynolds numbers however the accuracy of rans is lower than that of dns the les method divides turbulent eddies into large scale and small scale eddies and simulates them respectively the large scale eddies are directly calculated by solving the navier stokes equation and the small scale eddies are modeled by establishing sub grid scale models matin nikoo et al 2018 in the les calculation process only the large eddies are resolved while the sub grid scale eddies are modeled hence the computational efficiency of les is much higher than that of dns but lower than that of rans besides the reynolds number of the flow field that les can calculate is much higher than that of the dns method the discrete vortex method uses a finite number of discrete vortex elements to represent the concentrated or continuous vortices in the flow field and the lagrange method is used to simulate the motion of the discrete vortex elements yamamoto et al 2004 the discrete vortex method does not need to resolve the turbulence moreover the discrete vortex method ignores the viscosity of the flow field based on the dns method bourguet et al 2011 2013a studied the in line and cross flow viv of a long tensioned beam immersed in the linear shear flow with a reynolds number range from 110 to 1100 and an aspect ratio of 200 khan et al 2017 used the rans equation to simulate the viv of the cylinder with high reynolds number re 104 and low mass ratio and verified the effectiveness of this method by comparing the numerical simulation results with experimental results wang and xiao 2016 calculated the viv of a marine riser under the action of the uniform flow and linear shear flow the cfd simulation results agreed well with the experimental results and show that the dominant frequency the dominant mode number and the root mean square amplitude are proportional to the flow speed nguyen and nguyen 2016 improved the cfd model by combining rans and les to simulate the flow induced vibration of the incompressible navier stokes flow at high reynolds numbers jung et al 2014 and guo et al 2019 numerically simulated the viv of twisted and wavy cylinders at subcritical reynolds numbers and found that the viv was significantly weakened if comparing with the smooth cylinders guo et al 2015 and wang et al 2019a b c used the les method to study the effect of different design parameters on the viv of the fiber reinforced composite riser they found that the maximum equivalent stress of the riser occurs at both ends of the riser and the amplitude of the simply supported riser is larger than that of the fixed support riser due to limitation of the computing techniques direct three dimensional simulation of a marine riser with high aspect ratio and complex flow field is quite difficult a feasible method is to use the strip theory for quasi three dimensional simulation based on the strip theory duanmu et al 2018 and fu et al 2018 developed the viv foam sjtu solver to simulate the viv of marine risers sun et al 2012 presented a stripwise discrete vortex method to study the viv of flexible risers in which each strip was calculated by the discrete vortex method and the three dimensional dynamics was calculated by the finite volume and the incremental method similarly lin and wang 2019 proposed a quasi three dimensional strip method based on the discrete vortex method and finite element method to predict the viv of long flexible risers and the numerical simulation results agree well with the experiment results although the numerical simulations based on the strip theory produce high prediction accuracy for the viv the three dimensional effect of the flow field is always ignored to investigate the effect of the three dimensional flow field labbe and wilson 2007 developed a parallel three dimensional incompressible navier stokes solver huang et al 2011a presented a finite difference scheme and an effective riser motion solver for three dimensional viv simulation with an aspect ratio of 3350 wang et al 2017 used the three dimensional cfd method to study the effect of different in line to cross flow natural frequency ratios on the viv of the cylinder at the reynolds number of 500 the results showed that as the natural frequency ratio increased from 1 to 2 the viv amplitude of the cylinder increased significantly while the maximum amplitude moved toward the high reduced velocity in order to study the vibration suppression effect of a pipe in pipe model matin nikoo et al 2018 conducted the three dimensional simulations using the bidirectional fluid solid coupling cfd model they found that the pipe in pipe model presented a good vibration suppression effect and the suppression effect reached maximum at the strongest viv response following that matin nikoo et al 2019 proposed a method for predicting the three dimensional viv of a marine riser using an improved rans method at low reynolds numbers high prediction accuracy in the upper branch was obtained martins et al 2019a 2019b conducted three dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the impact of the reynolds number and damping on the viv response the rigid body motion equation was used to deal with the moving mesh which could not only reduce the computation cost but also ensure the quality of the mesh in addition the commercial software package ansys mfx multi field solver was developed to solve the three dimensional fluid structure interaction problem chen and kim 2010 wang and xiao 2016 compared with the semi empirical approach the cfd method has been developed more rapidly in recent years with fast development of computer and parallel computing technologies the cfd simulation can be gradually applied to the viv prediction under various practical ocean conditions 4 conclusion the viv of marine risers is a strong nonlinear self exciting self limiting and asymmetrical flow structure coupling phenomenon this review summarizes the recent basic research results of the viv of marine risers including the progress on the viv of the multiple risers and the inclined risers intermittent viv caused by the oscillating flow and so forth different configurations of the multiple risers can result in different wake patterns which significantly impact the viv of the downstream risers in general the spacing between the risers and the reynolds number of the incoming flow impact the viv response of the risers furthermore according to the independence principle the viv of the inclined riser can be analogous to the vertical riser although the calculation accuracy needs improvement the response amplitude of the inclined riser is smaller than that of the vertical riser but the multi mode characteristics of former are stronger the intermittent viv response characteristics are restricted by the keulegan carpenter number and reduced velocity the increase of the keulegan carpenter number will increase the frequency of the viv response while reduce the response amplitude when the reduced velocity increases high order harmonics and mode conversion will appear moreover the effects of the platform motion and internal multiphase flow on the viv are also surveyed the movement of the floating platform can cause the intermittent viv under the oscillatory flow and increase the viv amplitude the internal flow can reduce the natural frequencies of the riser which will make the riser more susceptible to the lock in vibration the internal flow is a heterogeneous multiphase flow that will cause the fluctuations in the parameters of the riser system thereby increasing the complexity and uncertainty of the viv furthermore various research approaches are reviewed in this paper on the one hand experimental research is performed in a real marine environment or a large scale test pool with continuous improvement of the experimental equipment the experimental evaluation of large aspect ratio over 4000 and high reynolds numbers over 105 is able to achieve on the other hand numerical simulation methods such as the semi empirical method and cfd are developed to predict the viv characteristics of marine risers till now the semi empirical method shows higher prediction accuracy than the cfd method however with fast development of the parallel computing technologies the cfd method will show better application prospects in the past decades a lot of efforts have been made to improve the understanding of the riser viv for the purpose of decreasing the operation cost and enhancing the reliability of the riser system however the complexity of external and internal excitations makes the viv around a marine riser still an unsolved problem potential future research directions are discussed as follows 1 the prediction of the viv for risers with large aspect ratio is still an open research field in previous research the dominant parameters such as the reynolds number aspect ratio and mass ratio have been investigated however the combination effect of multiple factors is rarely reported for example the reynolds number is individually studied without considering the aspect ratio raghavan and bernitsas 2011 hence it is crucial to establish a generic viv analysis model that is capable for different applications 2 the discrepancies between the model and actual marine riser system deserve further study it is always difficult costly to implement experimental tests in the conditions that are close to reality simplified testing models are often adopted however the effects of the model materials often plastic and structures i e the simplified models often miss the mechanical joints have not been deeply investigated meng and chen 2012 he et al 2017 furthermore horizontally positioned pipes are used in many studies but the effect of the oil gas fluid gravity is not considered 3 the viv suppression is an important research area at the beginning of transporting the oil and gas production from deep sea the viv of marine risers tends to be more and more complex the viv suppression solution can fundamentally reduce prevent the fatigue damages to marine risers however an accurate viv prediction model is required before performing viv suppression as a result the viv suppression remains a challenging task assia et al 2009 huang 2011 lou et al 2016 with the improvement and development of experimental and simulation methods the viv mechanism for marine risers will become clear in the future declaration of competing interest the

22231,the fluid dynamics of flapping foils are reviewed in this article a very wide range of researches are conducted for the two dimensional flapping foil which has a relatively simple geometry however for a three dimensional foil the aspect ratio and shape take effects and completely distinct fluid dynamics are revealed compared with the two dimensional one this review gives a summary on the experimental techniques and numerical methods used in the researches on the fluid dynamics of flapping foils the effects of some key parameters including reynolds number reduced frequency flapping amplitude and three dimensional effect on the fluid dynamics of flapping foils are reviewed the researches focusing on the wake structures aero hydrodynamic characteristics and energy harvesting efficiency are discussed finally some conclusions are drawn and potential future research directions are recommended keywords flapping foil aerodynamics hydrodynamics the law of parameter 1 introduction oscillating foils are very common in nature and human activities for instance birds need to flap their wings to produce lift and thrust so that they can hover and locomote in the air fishes take advantage of the flapping motion of their pectoral and caudal fins to achieve optimal propulsion these aquatic and flying animals acquire highly effective fluid dynamic performance via their own oscillatory motion of fins or wings through taking an insight into these curious phenomena many experts and scholars have grasped some crucial principles which can be applied into engineering area by performing a variety of experiments and numerical simulations firstly birnbaum 1924a b reported that a flapping wing could be used as a novel propeller since then various types of device which utilize the flapping motion of foils or wings for different purposes have been proposed such as wave gliders whose propulsion force is provided by tandem hydrofoils in unsteady flows wang et al 2019 and ocean energy harvesting device which makes use of flapping foils to extract energy from wind wave or current xu and sun 2016 chen et al 2017 while rotary wind and water turbines are still dominant in renewable energy area guo et al 2017a b 2018a b wen et al 2017a b 2018a b as one of the hot topics in the field of fluid mechanics the fluid dynamics of flapping foil has been investigated over several decades and hundreds of papers were published fig 1 summarizes almost 400 papers with relatively high citation frequency on flapping foils published since 1970 it is obvious that the number of papers before 2000 was small while a dramatic increase happened after that which reveals the heat of studies on flapping foils are unprecedentedly high in recent years the research activities about the flapping foil distribute widely around the world and come from more than 20 countries across different continents fig 2 reveals that the numbers of articles from usa and china take up a proportion of 40 21 and 16 49 respectively the major sources of papers are from massachusetts institute of technology naval postgraduate school princeton university and new york university in usa while chinese papers mainly come from xi an jiao tong university zhejiang university chinese academy of sciences nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics and university of science and technology of china etc the proportion taken up by australia uk and france is between 5 and 10 and the rest of countries are no more than 5 it is noteworthy that a portion of papers are authored or collaborated by people from two or more countries some efforts have also been taken on utilizing flapping foils as ship propulsion the researchers from national technical university of athens ntua carried out many numerical works on this issue belibassakis et al 1997 belibassakis 2011 belibassakis and politis 2013 belibassakis and filippas 2015 filippas et al 2018 politis 2004 politis and tsarsitalidis 2009 2013 2014 politis and politis 2014 tsarsitalidis and politis 2015 they numerically investigated the hydrodynamic performance of flapping foils for ship propulsion under different conditions using the unsteady boundary element modeling code ubem politis 2009 2011 almost all results show that compared to conventional propellers flapping foils can be a promising system with better propulsion efficiency and energy extraction from ship motion furthermore b√∏ckmann and steen from norwegian university of science and technology ntnu performed experimental investigation on the effect of fixed wavefoils on ship motion and propulsion b√∏ckmann and steen 2013 2016 and the effect of control methods of oscillating motion on performance of foils b√∏ckmann and steen 2014 they concluded that both ship resistance and motion were reduced by the wavefoils and oscillating foils can be acted as a major or auxiliary driving force of ship in addition thaweewat et al 2018 studied the performance of semi active flapping foil for ship propulsion similar investigations were also conducted by liu et al 2019 b√∏ckmann and steen 2014 belibassakis and filippas 2015 and filippas et al 2018 floc h et al 2012 performed a comparison between a porpoising foil as propulsion and a conventional propeller results indicated that the two propulsion systems had the similar hydrodynamic performance despite their different nature based on these numerical and experimental work some practical applications have been realized in the realm of ocean engineering marin has built the first inland ship with o foil oscillating foil propulsion resulting in 50 better efficiency and a cut in fuel consumption by 33 till 50 in comparison with the screw propeller the project of unmanned surface vessel usv called autonaut developed a novel vessel propelled forward by four keel mounted foils converting energy from the pitch and roll of the waves biomimetic propulsors has many advantages with aspect of economy environment and efficiency etc and thus they need to be investigated intensively so that ship propulsion based on flapping foils can be used more widely the model of oscillating foil can be simplified into a two dimensional object with an airfoil section oscillating in the fluid as a result early researches were conducted on the two dimensional problems both theoretically and experimentally focusing on the force drag lift and thrust moment and propulsion generated by oscillating foils knoller 1909 betz 1912 katzmayr 1922 giauert 1929 garrick 1936 koochesfahani 1989 dohring et al 1996 knoller 1909 and betz 1912 firstly adopted a flapping wing to explain the mechanism of thrust generation which represents the beginning of the researches on flapping foils subsequently katzmayr 1922 verified the knoller betz effect and this is the first time to validate this phenomenon with experimental method onset of the two dimensional flow visualization structure arising from flapping motion was addressed early from the experiments in the 20th century von k√°rm√°n and burgers 1943 bratt 1950 wood and kirmani 1970 freymuth 1988 1990 koochesfahani 1989 von k√°rm√°n and burgers 1943 firstly explained the production of drag and thrust theoretically by observing the wake structure bratt 1950 confirmed von k√°rm√°n and burgers s explanation through flow visualization experiments freymuth 1988 presented the visualization on the propulsive vortical signature of two dimensional airfoils with pure plunging and pure pitching motion koochesfahani 1989 performed the flow visualization on vortical patterns of a pitching airfoil with nonsinusoidal oscillations soap film tunnels are the simple and efficient flow visualization tools to observe various vortex flows couder and basdevant 1986 gharib and derango 1989 rivera et al 1998 zhang et al 2000 schnipper et al 2009 andersen et al 2017 further vortex formation is found to be different under different flow conditions it is mainly dependent on the parameters including amplitude and frequency which also influence thrust and lift generation of a flapping foil until recently the issues of a two dimensional foil are still being studied andersen et al 2017 and schnipper et al 2009 performed numerical simulation with experimental verification of a two dimensional foil with pure heaving and pure pitching respectively they concluded that these two modes of motion are essentially the same from their wake map smits team mainly focus on the scaling law between geometric kinematic and environmental parameters and thrust power and energy consumption of an oscillating foil dewey et al 2011 2013 moored et al 2012 quinn et al 2015 buren et al 2017 2018 floryan et al 2017 2018 peng et al 2018a b studied the collective locomotion of two and multiple self propelled plates two dimensional in different configurations and they found four typical locomotion states and two schooling states respectively although an oscillating foil can be simplified into a two dimensional foil and studied for such a long time the physical mechanism involved is still unclear in some aspects the real foil always has a limited aspect ratio and thus the three dimensional flow structure can be generated due to the end effect taira and colonius 2009 used direct numerical simulations dns to study the wake structures of rectangular plates with different aspect ratios and non rectangular plates under the state of inclination soria s team performed experiments to discuss the effect of amplitude and frequency of an oscillating finite span wing on three dimensional vortex structure at low reynolds number von ellenrieder et al 2001 von ellenrieder et al 2002 von ellenrieder et al 2003 parker et al 2007 except for rectangular plate there are many researches on oscillating plates of other shapes such as the circular disk yang et al 2014 tian et al 2017a b the elliptic disk dong et al 2006 yilmaz and rockwell 2012 harbig et al 2013 wang et al 2016a and the trapezoidal plate green et al 2011 however zhang 2017 specially pointed out that the problems on how to make an oscillating foil generate maximum thrust and have energy harvesting efficiency up to the optimal state are still unclear hence two main conundrums are presented i how to systematically and accurately understand the complex flow mechanism around the three dimensional oscillating aero hydro foil ii how to achieve the high efficient control of the three dimensional oscillating aero hydro foil to optimize propulsion and energy harvesting performance once both of them are solved application of the oscillating foil will be promoted in the field of propulsion and current wind energy harvesting devices it is the reason that the studies of flow structure and aero hydrodynamic performance and the researches on how to enhance propulsive efficiency and energy harvesting efficiency have always been the research hotspots and continue to increase recently as indicated in fig 3 b the improvements from these researches are important for some engineering applications based on the in depth study of flapping foils it is found that the effects of reynolds number three dimensional effect foil flexibility and other parameters on aero hydro dynamic performances including thrust lift and propulsion efficiency are not an easy issue this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the researches about the aero hydro dynamics of flapping foils and then give some directions for the future work on this topic the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a brief description for the problem of the foil is given in section 2 including parameter description motion mode and research contents experimental techniques used to record the force and flow structure in experiments and various numerical simulation methods adopted in numerical studies are summarized in section 3 some key results arising from the change of some significant parameters which are the most crucial portion and of a considerable practical significance are addressed in section 4 finally summary and outlook are drawn in section 5 2 problem description 2 1 governing parameters it is easy to have the false impression that a flapping foil in fluid is a simple problem however it is true that more than 10 governing parameters have been mentioned in the articles reviewed here these parameters can be divided into four types environmental parameter describing the fluid properties geometric parameter describing the shape of foils kinematic parameter describing the motion of foils and performance parameter describing propulsion and energy harvesting performance of foils the number of parameters involved in a single paper is normally not limited to one schematics of some parameters are described in figs 4 and 5 2 1 1 environmental parameters there are many parameters about fluid properties but only a few of them are normally considered when it comes to the flapping foils freestream velocity u kinematic viscosity ŒΩ of the fluid as well as reynolds number re defined by both of them are the dominant parameters considered in the researches of flapping foils the reynolds number is defined as 1 r e u l 0 ŒΩ where l 0 is the characteristic length which may be represented by the chord length c the maximum thickness d or span length l aiming at three dimensional issues of the flapping foil the corresponding reynolds number re is defined respectively as 2 r e c u c ŒΩ r e d u d ŒΩ r e l u l ŒΩ specially shinde and arakeri 2013 investigated the jet generated by a naca0015 foil pitching in quiescent fluid where u is zero re is defined as 3 r e t e v t e max c ŒΩ where v t e max is the maximum velocity of trailing edge te although mach number ma is another key parameter in the high speed air flow its effect on flapping foils is rarely mentioned 2 1 2 geometric parameters the parameters determining the shape of a foil include the chord length c the maximum thickness d the span length l the cross section shape and the planform as shown in fig 4 for the so called two dimensional 2d foil only c d and the cross section shape are considered the cross section shape is normally rectangle ellipse and teardrop among which teardrop is the most studied one generally some teardrop shaped foils are defined as a proprietary name such as naca series sd series eppler series and sg series based on the two dimensional foil l is added to describe a foil but its value is infinite which is so called the pseudo three dimensional foil in fact such issues still focus on two dimensions and do not take three dimensional effect into consideration however when the value of l is finite the foil is the so called true three dimensional 3d foil the planform is mainly circle ellipse triangle trapezoid and rectangle among which rectangle is the most studied one hence aspect ratio ar is introduced and defined as 4 a r l c the effects of ar on the three dimensional flapping foil have been presented briefly in section 1 in addition another parameter that should be introduced is the flexibility of foil the shape of foil will change constantly with its flapping motion researches on flexible foils both 2d and 3d account for almost 15 as shown in fig 3 a dewey et al 2013 pointed out that the thrust of the flexible oscillating foil can be increased by 1 2 times and the propulsion efficiency can be doubled cleaver et al 2016 demonstrated that the flexibility of the oscillating foil enlarges the motion amplitude which increases the lift force significantly moreover investigations on energy harvesting devices based on flexible foils were conducted numerically zhu et al 2009 griffith et al 2016 liu et al 2016 it is necessary and important to give an accurate description of foil geometry which is the basis of all researches most studies are conducted on the 2d foil including the infinite foil because they have the advantages of simple problem clear physics easy mathematical description simple numerical simulation and so on a large number of researches mainly concentrate on a 2d foil which take up almost 78 nevertheless three dimensional effect is unavoidable in nature and the 2d foil cannot reflect its true physical mechanism in many conditions as a result more and more issues have been investigated based on 3d 2 1 3 kinematic parameters the oscillation motion of a foil is characterized by several parameters firstly the strouhal number st describing the externally imposed frequency is defined as 5 s t f l 0 u where f is the frequency of the oscillation similar to the definition of re st can be defined as 6 s t c f c u s t d f d u s t a f a u where a is peak to peak amplitude as shown in fig 5 st c st d and st a are the chord based the maximum thickness based and amplitude based strouhal number respectively when the flapping amplitude is defined in length as a or h 0 heave or plunge amplitude respectively the dimensionless amplitude can be often defined as 7 a d a d a c a c 8 h h 0 c particularly st a is equal to the product of st d and a d it can be treated as the ratio between the oscillation velocity of the foil trailing edge and the freestream velocity st a is often used as a criterion for describing drag thrust transition triantafyllou et al 1991 as we know the fish like swimming and flapping flight in nature occur for st a 0 2 0 4 the specific reason of which is still unclear reduced frequency is another frequently used non dimensional form of oscillating frequency defined as 9 k œâ c u 2 œÄ f c 2 u flapping foil motion is designed to couple two sinusoidal motions with the same frequency in the most literatures which are respectively defined by 10 h t h 0 sin 2 œÄ f t 11 Œ∏ t Œ∏ 0 sin 2 œÄ f t œï where Œ∏ 0 is the pitch amplitude h t is the instantaneous vertical position of the foil axis Œ∏ t is the instantaneous angle between the freestream velocity u and the foil chord and œï is the phase angle between pitch and heave noteworthily effective instantaneous angle of attack Œ± eff is calculated with three terms as following 12 Œ± e f f Œ± m Œ∏ 0 sin 2 œÄ f t œï tan 1 h 0 2 œÄ f cos 2 œÄ f t u where Œ± m is the mean angle of attack or geometric angle of attack when reaching the maximum angle Œ± eff is the so called nominal effective angle of attack Œ± 0 specially with œï 90 the maximum nominal angle of attack becomes 13 Œ± max e f f Œ± 0 Œ± m Œ∏ 0 tan 1 h 0 2 œÄ f u in some literatures pitch amplitude Œ∏ 0 is not given but nominal angle of attack Œ± 0 is used as an alternative parameter pivot location of the foil is based on the chord length c as shown in fig 4 the leading edge of chordwise and the root of spanwise are special location moreover angle of attack profile selected in most experiments and simulations is sinusoidal which means that both of pitch and heave motion are sinusoidal similarly variable pivot location and non sinusoidal motion can also change the motion of the foil and influence the flow structures and hydrodynamic forces of the foil 2 1 4 performance parameters the parameters describing the propulsion performance of an oscillating foil includes thrust coefficient c t input power coefficient c p and propulsion efficiency Œ∑ the mean thrust coefficient is defined as 14 c t f x 0 5 œÅ u 2 c l where œÅ is the fluid density and f x is the time averaged force in x direction defined as 15 f x 1 œÑ 0 œÑ f x t d t where f x t is the instantaneous force component in x direction and œÑ is the oscillation period the mean input power coefficient c p is defined as 16 c p p 0 5 œÅ u 3 c l where p is mean input power calculated by 17 p 1 œÑ 0 œÑ f y t d h t d t d t 0 œÑ m Œ∏ t d Œ∏ t d t d t where f y t is the instantaneous force component in y direction m Œ∏ t is the instantaneous pitching moment and dh dt and dŒ∏ dt are derivatives of heave and pitch motion respectively the final propulsion efficiency is expressed as 18 Œ∑ c t c p the key parameters describing the energy harvesting efficiency of an oscillating foil are output power coefficient c op and the energy harvesting efficiency Œ∑ op the mean output power coefficient is defined as 19 c o p p o 0 5 œÅ u 3 c l c o p y c o p Œ∏ 1 œÑ 0 œÑ c y d h t d t d t 0 œÑ c c m d Œ∏ t d t d t where p o is the mean output power c o p y is the mean power coefficient of heaving motion and c o p Œ∏ is the mean power coefficient of pitching motion c y is the instantaneous heave force coefficient and c m is the instantaneous pitching moment coefficient defined as 20 c y f y 0 5 œÅ u 2 c l 21 c m m Œ∏ 0 5 œÅ u 2 c 2 l the energy harvesting efficiency is expressed as 22 Œ∑ o p p o 0 5 œÅ u 3 d l c o p c d where d is the maximum vertical displacement of the trailing edge of the flapping foil it must be noted that the parameters related to propulsion efficiency are under the condition of an oscillating foil with combined pitching and heaving motion and the parameters related to energy harvesting efficiency are under the condition of a harvest device with forced pitching and heaving motion moreover xiao and zhu 2014 have made a thorough review on the energy harvesters based on foils and the definitions for energy harvesting efficiency of three types of flapping foil flow energy harvesters have been introduced in detail 2 2 motion mode of the foil the motion mode of a foil has a crucial effect on the wake structure and aero hydrodynamic performance of a flapping foil the motion mode can be classified into three categories plunging or heaving pitching and flapping among which flapping is the combination of plunging and pitching these motion can also be of full active motion semi active motion or full passive motion the schematics of them are shown in figs 5 and 6 full active motion means that both pitching motion Œ∏ t and heaving motion h t are prescribed and it is widely considered for oscillating foils the systems with forced pitching and induced heaving motions and self sustained pitching and heaving motions are called semi activated systems and full passive systems respectively both are the typical models for issues on flow energy harvesters based on flapping foils for semi active semi passive system it also can be composed of forced heaving and induced pitching motion boudreau et al 2019a b numerically proved that the novel semi passive flapping foil turbine with a prescribed heave motion and a passive pitch motion can achieve the similar performance with fully active flapping foil turbine moreover b√∏ckmann and steen 2014 experimentally concluded that a passive pitching and forced heaving foil can produce higher thrust than that of the fully constrained foil however tsarsitalidis and politis 2015 found that the contributions of a heaving wing pitching passively spring loaded as energy harvester is more than that as main propulsion device these results show that the foil with semi passive motion have a great potential in terms of energy harvesting boudreau et al 2018 2020 and duarte et al 2019 discussed the dynamic behavior of the full passive flapping foil turbine numerically and experimentally respectively fig 3 c reveals the proportional distribution of three mentioned motion modes compared to pure heaving and pure pitching motion research on flapping motion attracts more attentions whose proportion is almost 54 2 3 research contents researches on flapping foil began in the 20th century the content of which includes four main aspects namely aero hydro dynamic performance energy harvesting flow structure and bionics the proportion of them are presented in fig 3 b the researches on aero hydrodynamic performance and flow structure whose proportion are 44 89 and 45 26 respectively far more than the other two aero hydro dynamic performance mainly focuses on the lift drag thrust generation and propulsion efficiency thereby achieving optimal performance how to improve performance is still a key issue until now because great performance contributes to the engineering applications the flow structures around the foil have been investigated and help to explain the complex flow mechanism actually flow structure directly determines the aero hydro dynamic force so researchers normally explain force generation of the oscillating foil through the analysis of flow structures the issues of energy harvesting efficiency arise from anxious desires and needs for renewable energy its basic principle is that energy harvester extracts energy from the flow and converts it into the electricity for human therefore how to design and control the energy harvester devices is a crucial direction that needs to be continuously broken through so the recent investigations and attention of energy harvesting based on flapping foils present a gradually increasing trend bionics based on the oscillating foil is a study on the locomotion of aquatic and flying animals through numerical and experimental methods the model of the caudal fin of fish and the wing of birds are designed for researches to imitate fish like swimming and flapping like flying gursul and ho 1992 found that unsteady motion of the foil creates very high lift coefficient esfahani et al 2013 concluded that the propulsive efficiency could be enhanced in fish like swimming which is more efficient than that of flapping wing flying although the study of bio inspired motion takes up the least number with respect to the rest three aspects it seeks to draw accurate conclusion about condition of generating optimal thrust lift or propulsion efficiency from the locomotion of aquatic and flying animals to apply to engineering area biomimetic propulsors are gradually developed for marine propulsion due to its friendliness to environment and considerable efficiency the applications of horizontal and vertical foils and wings mounted on different locations of the ship are benefit for ship stabilization and additional thrust and energy can be obtained owing to the pitching and heaving motion of foils induced by the ship responses b√∏ckmann and steen 2013 2016 belibassakis and filippas 2015 belibassakis and politis 2013 politis and tsarsitalidis 2014 tsarsitalidis and politis 2015 the principles of vorticity control mechanism for the interaction between oncoming flow and fish body fin and tail play a core role in understanding fish swimming and maneuvering 3 review on research methods 3 1 experimental methods the researches on flapping or oscillating foils done by a variety of scholars or teams from different countries adopt many kinds of experimental methods a summary of past experimental studies of flapping foils or flat plates are presented in chronological order in table 1 the range of each parameter and equipment used in experiments have more or less differences to obtain desired results for different objectives besides flow visualization velocity measurement angle of attack profile the cross section and flexibility of a foil are also addressed in table 1 3 1 1 environmental simulation in experiments the flow condition that a foil experiences is normally generated using a water or wind tunnel the water tunnel has some common features such as closed circuit free surface low speed large scale and low reynolds number and their design principles do not bear too much difference a re circulating water channel used by lua et al 2016 and dash et al 2018 is shown in fig 7 a the flapping mechanism mounted on the top of test section can perform pitching with a resolution of 0 018 and heaving with a resolution of 0 005 mm the greatest advantage of this system is that the vibration generated by linear motion heaving can be reduced to a minimum so that it has an unconsidered influence on the flow field lua et al 2011 most of water channels used before did not take this vibration into consideration generally the water tunnels are horizontally placed with the flow going from one side to the other side the exceptions are that schnipper et al 2009 and andersen et al 2017 innovatively used the vertically placed gravity driven soap film tunnel to investigated the issues of oscillating foils as shown in fig 7 c the soap film tunnel not only has a good simulation of two dimensional environment but is extremely advantageous to extend the area of wake downstream so that the far wake evolution can be visualized clearly the development of flowing soap films has been reviewed by schnipper et al 2009 the characteristics of wind tunnel is generally similar to the water tunnel but the transmission medium is different sadeghi and mani 2009 2011 and 2015 investigated the effect of motion amplitude and mean angle of attack on the wake of an oscillating airfoil in a subsonic wind tunnel shown in fig 7 b because the wind speed of wind tunnel is high and the size of the airfoil is normally large the corresponding reynolds number has a relatively high order of magnitude compared with that in water tunnels in ocean engineering field a still water tank equipped with a towing carriage is normally used to simulate the relative motion between the fluid and obstacles the study on propulsive efficiency of oscillating foils was conducted in the ocean engineering testing tank in mit anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 hover et al 2004 schouveiler et al 2005 as shown in fig 7 d the limitation of a still water tank is that the distance the foil can drive is short and the system vibration may have an effect on force measurement 3 1 2 flow visualization velocity and force measurement when we analyze the flow structure of the oscillating foil the visualization and measurement of the flow are necessary some traditional methods including dye hydrogen bubbles soap film and smoke wire flow visualization play an important role in qualitative observation of the wake structures dye and smoke wire are mostly used for hydrodynamics and aerodynamics respectively it requires a good control of these medium so that the visualization can be up to the optimal fig 8 shows a reverse k√°rm√°n vortex street generated by a pitching foil using dye flow visualization srigrarom and vincent 2008 fig 9 shows that smoke wire visualize the boundary layers of the airfoil kim and chang 2010 the flow velocity is measured mainly via hot wire film anemometer hwfa in early days but it is still being used now chang and yoon 2002 sadeghi and mani 2009 sadeghi et al 2011 2015 the biggest disadvantage of this technique is the contact type measurement which interferes with the flow field greatly furthermore laser doppler velocimetry ldv achieves the non contact 3d velocity measurement koochesfahani 1989 jones et al 1998 1999 lai and platzer 1999 kuo and hsieh 2001 however both methods are only single point measurement techniques and cannot obtain full field and instantaneous measurement of the flow at present particle image velocimetry piv shown in fig 10 is the most popular method used in experiments reviewed in table 1 it can both display the physical form of flow field and provide quantitative information of instantaneous whole field flow which makes the research of flow visualization leap from qualitative to quantitative it also includes digital particle image velocimetry dpiv and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv two more methods that need to be pointed out are the volumetric velocimetry calderon et al 2014 cleaver et al 2016 and molecular tagging velocimetry mtv respectively mtv is used to measure the vortical field of a foil oscillating at different reduced frequencies by bohl and koochesfahani 2009 which is considered as the molecular counterpart of piv the force measurement has been improved from using the strain gauge before to using high precision multi directional force sensor now their measurement principle is not explained in detail here 3 1 3 experimental foil models the physical properties of the research model are chosen based on the objective of the research and its geometric parameters have been introduced briefly in section 2 naca 4 digit foils among which mainly naca0012 are the most studied cross sectional shape in addition flat plates which do not have the teardrop are also a research focus both of them have been reviewed in table 1 more recently a new concept of foil as shown in fig 11 a which combines a rigid naca 4 digit foil in head location and a flat plate of variable flexibility in tail receives a certain amount of attention from some researchers heathcote et al 2004 heathcote and gursul 2007 monnier et al 2015 similarly kumar and shin 2019 experimentally investigated the thrust estimation of a naca0015 hydrofoil attached to an elastic plate with various lengths and breadths whose construction is opposite to the previous foil as shown in fig 11 b its wake vortex pattern and hydrodynamic performance due to flapping motion were discussed for studies of a finite span flapping foil or flat plate the three dimensionality of the foil shape has a significant effect on aero hydro dynamic problems torres and mueller 2004 studied the aerodynamics of four distinct geometries flapping wing planform rectangular zimmerman inverse zimmerman and elliptical with seven aspect ratios varying from 0 50 to 2 00 at various reynolds numbers flow structures generated by variable planform rectangular semicircular delta circular ring et al plates at different angles of attack freymuth et al 1987 taira and colonius 2009 yilmaz and rockwell 2012 are also investigated the flexibility of foil may affect the formation of leading edge vortex trailing edge vortex and tip vortex and has been frequently considered in both spanwise s heathcote et al 2008 cleaver et al 2016 and chordwise prempraneerach et al 2003 bansmer et al 2010 alben et al 2012 barannyk et al 2012 dai et al 2012 marais et al 2012 dewey et al 2013 tian et al 2013 directions in addition other properties including the chord length lai and platzer 1999 alben et al 2012 thickness numerical method ashraf et al 2011a yu et al 2013 sain et al 2016 wang et al 2016c and camber ashraf et al 2011a chang et al 2015 can also affect the dynamic performance of a foil thus the geometry of the research model needs to be paid more attention so that the expected experimental results can be achieved 3 1 4 brief discussion of experimental parameters in the reported experiments the statistic characteristics for the foil are considered based on various parameters such as strouhal number st reynolds number re reduced frequency k aspect ratio ar dimensionless plunge heave amplitude h h 0 c phase angle between pitching and heaving motions œï pitch motion amplitude Œ∏ 0 or nominal effective angle of attack Œ± 0 mean angle of attack Œ± m pivot location x c and all of them have been described in detail in section 2 the different definitions of the kinematic parameter strouhal number have been presented due to the different physical meanings and definitions the range of st is normally between 0 1 and 0 8 while the range of k is normally within 20 excepting that lai and platzer 1999 and jones et al 1998 studied wake structure of flapping foils at a high value of k up to 100 similarly environmental parameter reynolds number also has many definition methods shown in section 2 re has a very wide range from 164 to 1 5 106 seen from table 1 due to the different sizes of foils incoming velocity and different definitions also viscosity is another parameter that determines the reynolds number re the fluid viscosity is determined by temperature and type of medium for experiments fluid viscosity is always taken as the value of water or air at 20 c in addition re is seldom altered by changing fluid viscosity for the researches on oscillating foil the magnitude of re determines the flow state which may be in laminar transient or turbulent states different value of re may result in completely distinct experimental results plunge heave amplitude and pitch amplitude are inevitable basic parameters for the researches of flapping foils there are three kinds of motion mode including pure pitching pure heaving and combined pitching and heaving as shown in section 2 to some extent flapping motion is equivalent to combined pitching and heaving plunging motion heave amplitude is generally no more than one chord length and pitch amplitude does not exceed 45 in table 1 œï is generally fixed as 90 in the literature but the effect of phase angle on performance of the foil is also investigated anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 von ellenrieder et al 2002 2003 the range of œï presented is from 30 to 120 similarly Œ± m is always fixed as 0 but the effect of mean angle of attack on foils is also discussed ohmi et al 1990 1991 jones et al 1999 lee et al 2000 schouveiler et al 2005 srigrarom and vincent 2008 sadeghi and mani 2009 2011 cleaver et al 2012 hu et al 2013 the range of Œ± m is from 0 to 45 but most of them focus on small angle of attack moreover variable pivot location granlund et al 2013 tian et al 2016 mackowski and williamson 2017 and non sinusoidal motion hover et al 2004 fenercioglu et al 2015 karakas and fenercioglu 2016 van buren et al 2017 dash et al 2018 also influence the flow structures and hydrodynamic forces of the foil the specific effect of reynolds number reduced frequency three dimensional effect ar and motion amplitude will be discussed in section 4 3 2 numerical works the statistics whose classification criteria is almost the same as experimental works are also done for numerical works as shown in table 2 3 2 1 numerical approach nowadays computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is the main method used for researches on the dynamics of flapping foils or plates but the method of non cfd develops early and is still used today panel method is one of the widely used methods in early days jones and platzer 1997 jones et al 1999 guglielmini and blondeaux 2004 solved governing equations of an oscillating foil using a stream function vorticity formulation for a two dimensional problem this method is also adopted recently zhu et al 2009 zhu 2011 2012 particularly andersen et al 2017 performed the numerical simulations of wake structure of a flapping foil in 2d flow using the particle vortex method pvm this method has been described and validated by walther and larsen 1997 larsen and walther 1997 rasmussen et al 2010 and hejlesen et al 2015 however with the maturity of computer technology cfd has become the main method to investigate fluid problems the implementation of cfd frequently depends on some commercial or open source codes such as fluent cfx starccm and openfoam most of which are based on finite volume method fvm and a few of which are based on finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm yu et al 2017 investigated the effect of kinematic parameters on the propulsion performance of an oscillating foil at re from 103 to 1 6 106 using fvm with the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model and they concluded three different combinations of kinematic parameters for optimal propulsion efficiency lua et al 2016 use fluent based on fvm to study the thrust performance of a flapping 2d elliptic airfoil in forward flight numerically and their results show that high rotation rate of the foil causes an adverse suction effect which can suppress the thrust of the foil boiron et al 2012 used the fem to solve the flow around the foil and they compared the hydrodynamics of a flapping foil through experimental and numerical methods meanwhile spectral method sm and lattice boltzmann method lbm are non grid based approaches yu et al 2012 2013 adopted an unsteady compressible navier stokes n s solver using high order spectral difference sd method to investigate the wake structure and the effects of foil thickness and kinematics on flapping foil propulsion medjroubi et al 2011 2012 simulated the 2d unsteady flow around a heaving naca0012 airfoil using the spectral element method sem and well reproduced the wake flow behind the heaving foil wu et al 2014 2015a b c used the immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm to simulate the flow over the foil so that the energy extraction performance can be obtained the numerical results obtained from direct cfd simulations make significant contributions to improving the thrust and propulsive efficiency of a flapping foil and provides a theoretical basis for follow up researches besides the methods mentioned above immersed boundary fractional step method ibfs choi et al 2015 a high fidelity implicit large eddy simulation iles visbal 2009 2013 etc are also used in numerical simulations moving mesh method is an essential issue for the numerical study of an oscillating foil there are many moving mesh methods elastic scaling method and mesh reconstruction method are commonly used to simulate pitching and heaving motions 3 2 2 turbulence models there are three kinds of methods to simulate the turbulence flow of flapping foils namely direct numerical simulation dns large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans base on the literature review rans is the early method used to solve the issues of turbulence it has been used for a wide range of re for studies on flapping foils however rans cannot obtain satisfactory results for the turbulent flow structures dns can accurately get all information of turbulence and do not consider the closeness of the equations but it is limited to low re and simple boundary problems due to its high demand on computational resources actually les is superior to rans in terms of model construction and is computationally more efficient than dns although its computational cost is still high but its development is not yet mature and is only for simple shear and tube flow turbulence models are used to close the governing equation several models such as single equation spalart allmaras s a turbulence model two equations shear stress transport sst turbulence model k œâ two equations sst turbulence model and zero equation baldwin lomax b l algebraic turbulence model are listed in table 2 zhu et al 2015 used the s a turbulence model to close rans and found that the energy harvesting efficiency of a new adaptive deformation oscillating foil they proposed can be 16 1 higher than the conventional one without deformation kinsey and dumas 2012 carried out a numerical research based on 2d unsteady rans simulations using s a model and analyzed the different tandem configuration for two oscillating foils within a hydrokinetic turbine to maximize the energy harvesting efficiency liu et al 2013 utilized a bio inspired flexible flapping foil to discuss the energy harvesting performance using k œâ turbulence model for unsteady rans closure they concluded that the flexible structure or the parallel configuration of the foil all can enhance energy efficiency m√ºnch et al 2010 proposed a method using sst k œâ and k Œµ turbulence model that can predict fluid structure coupling for a rigid hydrofoil with forced and free pitching motions kang et al 2009 studied the effects of chord length based reynolds number on the dynamics of the oscillating sd7003 airfoil by solving 2d rans based on sst model which is compared with experimental results lu et al 2013a b used sst k œâ model for simulations to investigate the effects of asymmetric sinusoidal motion on pitching airfoil aerodynamics tuncer and kaya 2005 2007 adopted the b l algebraic turbulence model to optimize the thrust and propulsion efficiency of flapping foils through different methods in addition there are other turbulence models such as zero equation cebeci smith c s single equation baldwin barth b b and reynolds stress model rsm but most of them are not suitable for the issues related to the oscillating foil 3 2 3 brief discussion of numerical parameters columns 6 to 17 in table 2 are based on the same classification of the physical properties and kinematic parameters of the flapping foil or plate as in the experimental work the specific content also has more or less similarity naca series are frequently chosen to be the research object of which mainly naca0012 the stiffness of the foil are mostly rigid although the effect of chordwise miao and ho 2006 shin et al 2009 eldredge et al 2010 tay and lim 2010 ysasi et al 2011 zhu et al 2014a b liu et al 2016 olivier and dumas 2016a b jeanmonod and olivier 2017 and spanwise zhu 2007 kang et al 2011 flexibility of the foil is also studied in numerical approaches noteworthily the range of re is a little different from that in the experiments in table 1 the smallest reynolds number is 100 and the highest up to 9 38 106 the discussions on three dimensional effect are always unavoidable the effect of ar has been studied dong et al 2006 shao et al 2010 li and lu 2012 harbig et al 2013 deng et al 2015 the range of which summarized in table 2 is from 0 2 to 8 the range of pitching amplitude Œ∏ 0 or maximum angle of attack Œ± 0 considered in numerical simulations is wider than that in the experiments similar with the experimental studies the effect of phase angle œï jones and platzer 1997 ramamurti and sandberg 2001 pedro et al 2003 tuncer and kaya 2005 eldredge et al 2010 platzer et al 2010 sarkar and singasani 2009 xiao and liao 2010 ashraf et al 2011b mean angle of attack Œ± m visbal and shang 1989 ohmi et al 1991 jones et al 1999 visbal 2009 sarkar and singasani 2009 medjroubi et al 2011 liu et al 2013 mart√≠n alc√°ntara et al 2015 non sinusoidal motion kaya and tuncer 2007 xiao and liao 2010 xiao et al 2012 esfahani et al 2013 lu et al 2013a b young and lai 2014 lu et al 2014 teng et al 2016 and pivot location zhu et al 2009 eldredge et al 2010 zhu 2011 2012 wang et al 2017a have also been investigated numerically particularly the effect of the relative position between an upstream bluff body and a heaving and pitching hydrofoil on energy harvesting performance has been investigated by lahooti and kim 2019 they found that the presence of the upstream body can change flow structure around the hydrofoil thus improve the efficiency significantly 4 review on the law of several significant parameters as aforementioned the dynamic characteristics of the flapping foil are dependent on various factors which have been introduced in section 2 2 in this section the related conclusions of four major parameters including reynolds number re reduced frequency k pitch or heave amplitude and three dimensional effect are reviewed from three aspects flow structures hydrodynamic coefficient and energy harvesting efficiency 4 1 reynolds number reynolds number is the fundamental parameter determining the flow status and has been considered in a wide range from 102 to 107 for the flapping foil it is a significant conclusion that the variation of reynolds number has no apparent effect on the formation of the periodic vortex and establishment of the subsequent wake behind an oscillating foil in the range of 1500 re 104 ohmi et al 1990 ashraf et al 2009 and medjroubi et al 2011 performed simulations on a pure plunging foil and found that flow structure was almost independent of reynolds number for re 200 2 105 and re 800 8000 respectively baik and bernal 2012 carried out experiments on a pitching and plunging foil came to the same results with ashraf et al and medjroubi et al for re between 104 and 6 104 fenercioglu and cetiner 2012 also made a similar conclusion that five flow structure categories generated by a combined pitching and plunging foil are independent of increasing reynolds number from 825 to 1 37 104 and even the production of thrust is independent on the reynolds number for re 1 5 104 leading edge vortex lev and trailing edge vortex tev are frequently seen from wake structures behind a flapping foil both of them are sensitive to the variation of reynolds number lu et al 2013a b and ol et al 2008 investigated the trapezoidal pitch sd7003 airfoil at different re and they clearly observed that the attenuation of the lev decreased when re increased from 300 to 1200 resulting in a stronger interaction between the lev and tev kang et al 2009 concluded that leading edge vortex formed at lower re re 104 and more attached flow is observed at higher re re 3 104 6 104 for combined pitching and plunging case however for pure plunging case the leading edge vortex occurred at all investigated re which became stronger with increasing re amiralaei et al 2010 observed the vortical patterns around a naca0012 pitching airfoil as shown in fig 12 the tev and the lower surface vortex became larger and stronger with re increasing from 555 to 1000 further increasing to 2000 lower surface vortex started to separate but tev had not yet in contrast to re 2000 tev was separated and downstream convected but the lower and upper surface vortices attached on the foil at re 5000 varied reynolds number is the root cause to the existence of this phenomenon of unsteady boundary layer separation and reattachment the increase of reynolds number gives rise to the promotion delay of the reattachment and unsteady laminar separation during the upstroke downstroke of the pitching foil which is obtained by kim and chang 2010 generally the wake behind a pitching or heaving foil is symmetric about the middle position of the foil periodic motion however when a foil pitches or plunges at relatively high frequency and large amplitude symmetry breaking occurs in the vortical wake leading to a deflection angle which is related to reynolds number liang et al 2011 were the first to find that the deflection angle increases with reynolds number increasing for a fast plunging airfoil as shown in fig 13 subsequently zheng and wei 2012 conducted further researches on mechanism of this phenomenon for a finite foil the effect of reynolds number on its three dimensional vortex structure was also investigated numerically and experimentally by visbal et al 2013 they found that spanwise fine scale transitional features from no evidence to becoming more obvious when reynolds number increases from 103 to 5 103 ol 2007 proved that the strength of spanwise flow increases with increasing re from 104 to 6 104 the influence of reynolds number on hydrodynamic aerodynamic coefficient of a pitching plunging or oscillating foil including the coefficient of lift thrust drag and power is also discussed here miao and ho 2006 simulated the power coefficient of a flapping flexible airfoil at different reynolds number 102 103 104 which is found to have no effect on both thrust and input power coefficient as shown in fig 14 the same results were obtained for a spanwise flexible flapping wing and a rigid pitching foil by heathcote et al 2008 and das et al 2016 respectively similarly reynolds number hardly affects force generation for a flapping foil lua et al 2010 studied the reynolds number from 7800 to 1 17 104 and found reynolds number has a very small effect on the force generation medjroubi et al 2011 baik et al 2012 and baik and bernal 2012 made similar conclusions that the influence of reynolds number on aerodynamic force generation is weak in addition heathcote et al 2008 provided a result that the thrust coefficient is a very weak function of reynolds number and lua et al 2008 obtained that the mean drag coefficient has nothing to do with the reynolds number however the law of reynolds number is not true for all cases ashraf et al 2009 investigated the naca0015 plunging airfoil at re 2 105 which generates 40 more thrust than that at re 2 104 time averaged thrust coefficient increases with increasing reynolds number re 72 144 and 360 based on the flapping airfoil thickness in the simulation performed by yu et al 2013 das et al 2016 also obtained the same result for a pitching foil at different re from 10 to 2000 furthermore visbal 2009 and liang et al 2011 found that the drag coefficient decreases evidently as the reynolds number increases for a pure plunging foil and a plunging and pitching foil respectively reynolds number has a relatively uniform influence on propulsive or energy harvesting efficiency generally the efficiency increases with reynolds number miao and ho 2006 observed that the propulsive efficiency increases with increasing reynolds number at lower reduced frequency for a chordwise flexible flapping airfoil and heathcote et al 2008 also concluded that the efficiency increases slightly with reynolds number for a spanwise flexible flapping foil in addition ashraf et al 2009 investigated the reynolds number on a pure plunging naca0015 airfoil propulsive at reduced frequency k 2 non dimensional plunge amplitude h 0 5 and results revealed that propulsive efficiency increases with re increasing from 20 to 2 105 as shown in fig 15 a fig 15 b shows that the propulsion efficiency rises significantly as re increase after that only slight change can be observed lin et al 2019 optimal energy harvesting efficiency is found to be enhanced by increasing reynolds number by zhu 2011 4 2 reduced frequency reduced frequency is a type of non dimensionalized expression of frequency defined as k 2 œÄ f c 2 u identified as the major parameter controlling flow development the flow structure changes apparently as the reduced frequency varies bohl and koochesfahani 2009 presented an experiment on vortical structure in the wake of a pitching naca0012 airfoil using molecular tagging velocimetry mtv observing that a k√°rm√°n street with alternating sign vortices clockwise vortices at the top of the centerline counter clockwise at the bottom of the centerline at k 5 2 a neutral wake alternating sign vortices nearly aligned along the wake at k 5 7 and a reverse or inverted k√°rm√°n street with alternating sign vortices counter clockwise vortices at the top of the centerline clockwise at the bottom of the centerline at k 11 5 the similar phenomenon was revealed by medjroubi et al 2012 for a heaving naca0012 airfoil using the spectral hp element method at k 0 k 4 52 and k 7 85 respectively recently moubogha et al 2017 obtained similar results for a pitching plate at k 1 5 5 via the comparison of experimental and numerical method as shown in fig 16 all of aforementioned results are well consistent with the previous ones observed in koochesfahani 1989 some detailed changes of vortices leading and trailing edge vortices around a foil with varied reduced frequency are further investigated ol 2007 used dye visualization to display the vortex shedding behind the trailing edge of a pure plunging airfoil he observed that the wake adjacent to trailing edge varies from a planar and uniform flow into a starting vortex with increasing reduced frequency and larger reduced frequency leads to greater persistence of the starting vortex baik et al 2012 noticed that increasing reduced frequency causes slower lev and tev growth rate through piv measurements for a flapping airfoil moreover panah and buchholz 2014 observed four categories of wake patterns which are mainly dependent on reduced frequency within the range of 0 39 k 4 7 for a 2d plunging plate i lev merges with like signed tev ii lev interacts with the following stronger opposite signed tev iii lev arrived at trailing edge one full period latter than the opposite signed tev generation and iv lev remains on the surface of airfoil for more than three strokes the strength of lev is reduced when it sheds into wake with increasing reduced frequency k see fig 17 the effect of reduced frequency on hydro aerodynamic coefficient studied by many researchers has no qualitative difference generally the mean thrust coefficient tends to increase with reduced frequency garrick 1936 koochesfahani 1989 and ramamurti and sandberg 2001 firstly used the theoretical experimental and numerical methods to reach this result respectively mackowski and williamson 2015 reviewed some relatively early studies on mean thrust of a pure pitching foil from theory garrick 1936 jones and platzer 1997 ramamurti and sandberg 2001 simulation ramamurti and sandberg 2001 young and lai 2004 and experiment koochesfahani 1989 bohl and koochesfahani 2009 compared with their own direct force measurements of thrust shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 all of them has the same increasing trend with reduced frequency although their results exist a quantitative difference due to the distinct conditions however the change of other parameters appears having very limited influences on the trend of mean thrust coefficient for instance the experiments or simulations for a plunging airfoil ashraf et al 2012 elarbi 2013 a non sinusoidal pitching airfoil lu et al 2013a b zaman et al 2014 a flexible pitching panel dewey et al 2013 and a combined pitching and plunging airfoil esfahani et al 2015 all show that the increase of reduced frequency causes a noticeable increase in mean thrust coefficient and thus suggests that the motion modes motion profile and flexibility of a foil do not alter this conclusion it should be pointed out that there is a maximum thrust coefficient after which it starts to decrease slightly with further increasing reduced frequency k for a flexible pitching plates obtained by dewey et al 2013 and this change is also clearly observed within the range of 1 82 k 10 92 for a pitching airfoil by ashraf et al 2015 the power coefficient showed similar trends as those of mean thrust coefficient for a flexible pitching plate the power coefficient increases to a maximum and then levels off dewey et al 2013 the reduced frequency is a key parameter in analysis of propulsion and power extraction by flapping foil the reduced frequency determines the magnitude of energy that the flapping foil can extract from free stream the variation trend of propulsive efficiency of a flapping foil propeller with reduced frequency is similar to a reverse parabola displaying that propulsive efficiency increases monotonically with reduced frequency k at first and then it decreases gradually with further increasing k when other parameters are fixed ashraf et al 2012 lu et al 2013a b elarbi 2013 dewey et al 2013 esfahani et al 2015 the magnitude of efficiency is not fixed owing to a variety of other parameter combinations such as pitching or heaving amplitude the flexibility of the foil and phase angle between pitching and heaving however there is a truth that the maximum propulsive efficiency always occur at relatively low k moreover at the same k the flexible foil can further enhance the efficiency even resulting a doubled efficiency the qualitative trend of power extraction efficiency of a flapping foil energy harvester with forced pitching and heaving motions almost has no difference in propulsive efficiency liu et al 2013 xie et al 2014 karbasian et al 2015 lu et al 2015 wu et al 2016 xu and sun 2016 as shown in fig 18 similarly the global optimal energy extraction efficiency also appears at low k within the range between 0 1 and 0 15 which has been summarized specifically by xiao and zhu 2014 and explained physically by zhu 2011 for the semi active flapping foil the energy extraction efficiency is different from that of the fully active flapping foil wu et al 2014 2015a c simulated the power extraction of a semi active flapping foil with the auxiliary foil the flexible tail and different spring constant respectively all of which come to the same conclusion that energy extraction efficiency monotonically decreases with increasing reduced frequency as shown in fig 19 4 3 pitching or heaving amplitude the influences of pitching or heaving amplitude on the flow structures are globally similar with that of the reduced frequency this can be sketched that when flapping frequency and other parameters are fixed as the flapping amplitude increases the flow structure initially transits from k√°rm√°n street to aligned vortices and then becomes reverse k√°rm√°n street and finally become deflected reverse k√°rm√°n street with symmetry breaking essentially the global flow structure of a single general flapping foil mainly depends on frequency and amplitude godoy diana et al 2008 uses the experimental method to investigate the transitions in the wake of a pitching foil with different amplitude and frequency combination and obtained aforementioned transition process of the flow structure he et al 2012 also proved this process via a numerical method schnipper et al 2009 and andersen et al 2017 compared numerical and experimental investigations for the flapping foil and measured the phase diagram in the st a a d space as shown in fig 20 where st a and a d are another form of non dimensional frequency and amplitude respectively in addition the distribution of flow patterns of a pitching foil and a heaving foil is almost same qualitatively leading edge vortex is also affected by the variation of amplitude the convection of leading edge vortex along the chord becomes faster and the strength of the vorticity increases with increasing plunging amplitude panah and buchholz 2012 besides the leading edge vortex becomes severer and the scale becomes larger with pitching amplitude increasing from 5 to 40 as investigated by xie et al 2014 the pitching or heaving plunging amplitude are also the crucial parameters affecting the hydrodynamic coefficients here we mainly focus on the thrust power coefficient and propulsive efficiency when other parameters are fixed the power imparted to oscillating a foil increases with pitching or heaving amplitude resulting a monotonic increase of the power coefficient the increase of pitching and heaving amplitudes cause to the thrust coefficient increasing to a maximum and then it begins to decrease because the thrust enhancement becomes negative for large amplitude cases the propulsive efficiency represents the ratio of the thrust power to the power input to the foil consequently the propulsive efficiency presents two different variation trends if the enhancement of thrust coefficient is more than that of power coefficient at low amplitudes the trend of propulsive efficiency is similar to that of thrust coefficient otherwise the propulsive efficiency decreases monotonically with increasing amplitudes however these general conclusions from the previous studies amiralaei et al 2010 lu et al 2013a b zaman et al 2014 das et al 2016 yu et al 2017 are not always true for thrust coefficient power coefficient and propulsive efficiency for instance small values of pitching amplitude Œ∏0 10 has small effect on propulsive efficiency mackowski and williamson 2015 thrust coefficient could continuously increase with heaving amplitude within a relatively large range h 0 c 1 5 ashraf et al 2012 power coefficient also can increase firstly and then decrease gradually with increasing pitching amplitude srigrarom and vincent 2008 the influence of pitching and heaving amplitudes on power extraction performance is very complex and there is no universal law therefore here we can only give some general rules based on the relevant studies if we want to reach the power extraction state a condition needs to be satisfied that the angle of attack induced by heaving motion must be smaller than the pitching angle which has been investigated by jones and platzer 1997 generally no matter for forced pitching and heaving or forced pitching and induced heaving motions the energy extraction efficiency contribution from pitching motion is quite limited and much smaller than that from heaving motion for forced pitching and heaving motion when other parameters are fixed the energy extraction efficiency increases with heaving amplitude at low range h 0 c 1 0 this law has been summarized by xiao and zhu 2014 for forced pitching and induced heaving motion when other parameters are fixed the energy extraction efficiency firstly increases monotonically with pitching amplitude and then reaches a peak after which it decreases with further increasing pitching amplitude particularly if reduced frequency k does not exceed 0 5 the pitching amplitude of the maximum efficiency should generally be located between 60 and 80 as shown in fig 21 a besides the optimal pitching amplitude decreases with gradually increasing k as shown in fig 21 b these rules can also be applied to forced pitching and heaving motions 4 4 three dimensional effect since the aero hydro foil in nature is always finite in spanwise length the results concluded under the assumption of infinite spanwise length or two dimensions are no longer applicable the hydrodynamic characteristics of an oscillating foil are significantly affected by the shape at its ends von ellenrieder et al 2003 and parker et al 2007 soria s team discussed the effect of amplitude and frequency of the oscillating foils with a finite aspect ratio on the structure of 3d vortices at low reynolds number re 164 through dye visualization and piv they concluded that due to the tip vortices of the foil the global vortices structure takes a great change which is completely different from that generated by the 2d foil as shown in fig 22 jardin et al 2012 studied the three dimensional effect of flow around a naca0012 airfoil with combined pitching and heaving motion and it revealed that the interaction between leading edge vortices and spanwise vortices were very strong green et al 2011 smits team used piv to analyze the 3d flow structure of the trapezoid with pure pitching motion this trapezoid foil was inspired by fish caudal fin the experiment suggested that inclined diversion edge can generate more complex tip vortices actually the generation of spanwise vortices and tip vortices are the main reason for making the flow structure of the 3d foil more complex compared with the 2d foil buchholz and smits 2008 found that thrust coefficient of the foil depends on both st and aspect ratio and the propulsion efficiency is sensitive to aspect ratio less than 0 83 in nature the reason why tuna can swim at a high speed for a long time in water is associated with its body structure zhu et al 2002 its body has low aspect ratio and good flexibility the interaction between vortices generated by the body of tuna and the fin results in two different propulsion modes high thrust mode and high propulsion efficiency mode simpson et al 2008 conducted experiments on a flapping foil with aspect ratios from 4 1 to 7 9 and found that the energy harvesting efficiency increases with increasing aspect ratio the maximum efficiency is 43 at an aspect ratio of 7 9 deng et al 2014 investigated the effect of aspect ratios from 1 to 8 on the energy harvesting efficiency of an oscillating foil using dns they pointed out that the three dimensional effect arises at aspect ratios less than 4 and too small aspect ratio can reduce energy harvesting efficiency kim et al 2017 used an oscillating hydrofoil with a rectangular cross section to carry out the experiment on energy harvesting performance at three different aspect ratios ar 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 they found that the total efficiency increases with aspect ratio over the parameter domain considered in their study which is similarly to the previous numerical work of kinsey and dumas 2012 and experimental work of simpson et al 2008 5 concluding remarks since the first observation of lift and thrust generated by a flapping winging by knoller 1909 and betz 1912 more and more attentions have been paid to the researches on the fluid dynamics of a flapping foil this paper performs a comprehensive review of the state of the art of aero hydrodynamics of the flapping foil firstly a brief description of the flapping foil is presented in terms of relevant parameters motion modes and research contents the contents of all the researches are roughly categorized into four different aspects flow structure hydrodynamic characteristics energy harvesting and bionics problems this section aims to promote an overall understanding of the flapping foil in this review bionics problems based on the flapping foils are not introduced too much but detailed summaries on fish swimming and birds flying are reviewed by rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 wu 2010 eloy 2012 and wang et al 2016b furthermore the papers in recent decades using experimental or numerical methods are reviewed environment and kinematic parameters and other geometric parameters of this part help clarify the settings of the research contents through the analysis of data a rough range of some influencing parameters involved in the flapping foil are also summarized and the results of experimental and numerical studies are compared with each other at last the common laws of reynolds number reduced frequency amplitude of foil motion and three dimensional effect are summarized respectively however there is no apparent law for these parameters on some problems such as the influence of motion amplitude on hydrodynamic coefficient and energy extraction efficiency it is worth noting that the relevant researches on energy extraction based on the flapping foil have been reviewed by peng and chen 2012 xiao and zhu 2014 young et al 2014 and rostami and armandei 2017 based on the review of a large amount of researches it seems that the researches on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the oscillating hydrofoil have been very thorough however many problems are still not completely understood such as how the flapping foil reversing k√°rm√°n street how drag becoming thrust and how to generate the optimal thrust propulsive efficiency and energy extraction efficiency from flow field this reminds us that we need to have an insight into these seemingly simple questions recently smits team found that the wake structures of swimmers have no connection with the integrated swimming performance floryan et al 2019 smits 2019 smits also summarized other five main conclusions from aspects of flexibility combined motions viscous effects aspect ratio and motion profiles which can improve our understanding of undulatory and oscillatory swimming smits 2019 hence the following directions are recommended for future research activities i due to the complexities of three dimensional flow the studies of foils are still focused on two dimensional structures at low or moderate reynolds number this has been far from the real applications where the effects of three dimensionality free stream turbulence and high reynolds numbers should be considered the foil always has limited aspect ratio so its flow mechanism could be more complex and its end effect may influence the performance of propulsion and energy extraction therefore a focus should be put on the study of flow characteristics of three dimensional oscillating foils and the simulations based on real environment parameters in future ii compared with rotary turbines the flapping foil designs have some advantages environment friendly and less noise simple structure and easy manufacture suitable for shallow water area eco friendly and less biological damage etc however a systematic comparison between the rotary systems and the flapping foil systems has not yet been investigated the apparently different wake structures may cause the differences in propulsion efficiency and energy harvesting efficiency the further researches can perform specific quantitative analysis between the two systems iii the majority of studies are concentrated on single foil devices a few works discussed the multiple foils in tandem or parallel configuration the energy harvesting efficiency of oscillating foils in tandem or parallel configuration has been investigated by kinsey and dumas 2012 and karbasian et al 2015 the propulsive performance of tandem flapping wings has been studied by akhtar et al 2007 gong et al 2015 gravish et al 2015 pan et al 2016 and muscutt et al 2017 in addition kumar and hu 2010 investigates flow structures in wakes of tandem flapping wings peng et al 2018a b studies the propulsion efficiency of two or more self propelled flapping flexible wings however all of above simulations are two dimensional models actually the idea of turbine farms can also be used on flapping foils designs moreover non sinusoidal oscillating motion structural flexibility and multiple foils can improve the efficiency the future researches can focus on the behavior of flapping flexible foil systems in non sinusoidal oscillating motion in large arrays iv the flapping foil designs are mostly inspired by flying birds and swimming fishes but there are still some secrets about them to be discovered for instance how birds drive their wings and how fishes flap their fins to generate high efficient thrust are not fully clear this requires more knowledge of three dimensional flow control mechanisms fluid structure interaction and the vortex structures the further researches can find out more specific explanations and resources from these animals for real applications v machine learning is one of the hottest topics at present and many fluid issues are solved in this advanced way ling et al 2016 use deep neural networks to develop reynolds stress closures for rans turbulence models wan and sapsis 2018 predict the trajectory of spherical particles in fluid flows through machine learning raissi et al 2019 use deep learning method to discuss the problems of vortex induced vibrations the further researches can attempt to use deep machine learning to make predictions for aero hydrodynamic force and wake structure of flapping foils in different flow environments with so many questions about flapping foils to be answered and explained the task can be imagined to be very arduous nevertheless an improved understanding of any aspect of the oscillating foil may have important implications for flow structure aero hydrodynamic performance and energy harvesting efficiency based on the foil acknowledgement

22231,the fluid dynamics of flapping foils are reviewed in this article a very wide range of researches are conducted for the two dimensional flapping foil which has a relatively simple geometry however for a three dimensional foil the aspect ratio and shape take effects and completely distinct fluid dynamics are revealed compared with the two dimensional one this review gives a summary on the experimental techniques and numerical methods used in the researches on the fluid dynamics of flapping foils the effects of some key parameters including reynolds number reduced frequency flapping amplitude and three dimensional effect on the fluid dynamics of flapping foils are reviewed the researches focusing on the wake structures aero hydrodynamic characteristics and energy harvesting efficiency are discussed finally some conclusions are drawn and potential future research directions are recommended keywords flapping foil aerodynamics hydrodynamics the law of parameter 1 introduction oscillating foils are very common in nature and human activities for instance birds need to flap their wings to produce lift and thrust so that they can hover and locomote in the air fishes take advantage of the flapping motion of their pectoral and caudal fins to achieve optimal propulsion these aquatic and flying animals acquire highly effective fluid dynamic performance via their own oscillatory motion of fins or wings through taking an insight into these curious phenomena many experts and scholars have grasped some crucial principles which can be applied into engineering area by performing a variety of experiments and numerical simulations firstly birnbaum 1924a b reported that a flapping wing could be used as a novel propeller since then various types of device which utilize the flapping motion of foils or wings for different purposes have been proposed such as wave gliders whose propulsion force is provided by tandem hydrofoils in unsteady flows wang et al 2019 and ocean energy harvesting device which makes use of flapping foils to extract energy from wind wave or current xu and sun 2016 chen et al 2017 while rotary wind and water turbines are still dominant in renewable energy area guo et al 2017a b 2018a b wen et al 2017a b 2018a b as one of the hot topics in the field of fluid mechanics the fluid dynamics of flapping foil has been investigated over several decades and hundreds of papers were published fig 1 summarizes almost 400 papers with relatively high citation frequency on flapping foils published since 1970 it is obvious that the number of papers before 2000 was small while a dramatic increase happened after that which reveals the heat of studies on flapping foils are unprecedentedly high in recent years the research activities about the flapping foil distribute widely around the world and come from more than 20 countries across different continents fig 2 reveals that the numbers of articles from usa and china take up a proportion of 40 21 and 16 49 respectively the major sources of papers are from massachusetts institute of technology naval postgraduate school princeton university and new york university in usa while chinese papers mainly come from xi an jiao tong university zhejiang university chinese academy of sciences nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics and university of science and technology of china etc the proportion taken up by australia uk and france is between 5 and 10 and the rest of countries are no more than 5 it is noteworthy that a portion of papers are authored or collaborated by people from two or more countries some efforts have also been taken on utilizing flapping foils as ship propulsion the researchers from national technical university of athens ntua carried out many numerical works on this issue belibassakis et al 1997 belibassakis 2011 belibassakis and politis 2013 belibassakis and filippas 2015 filippas et al 2018 politis 2004 politis and tsarsitalidis 2009 2013 2014 politis and politis 2014 tsarsitalidis and politis 2015 they numerically investigated the hydrodynamic performance of flapping foils for ship propulsion under different conditions using the unsteady boundary element modeling code ubem politis 2009 2011 almost all results show that compared to conventional propellers flapping foils can be a promising system with better propulsion efficiency and energy extraction from ship motion furthermore b√∏ckmann and steen from norwegian university of science and technology ntnu performed experimental investigation on the effect of fixed wavefoils on ship motion and propulsion b√∏ckmann and steen 2013 2016 and the effect of control methods of oscillating motion on performance of foils b√∏ckmann and steen 2014 they concluded that both ship resistance and motion were reduced by the wavefoils and oscillating foils can be acted as a major or auxiliary driving force of ship in addition thaweewat et al 2018 studied the performance of semi active flapping foil for ship propulsion similar investigations were also conducted by liu et al 2019 b√∏ckmann and steen 2014 belibassakis and filippas 2015 and filippas et al 2018 floc h et al 2012 performed a comparison between a porpoising foil as propulsion and a conventional propeller results indicated that the two propulsion systems had the similar hydrodynamic performance despite their different nature based on these numerical and experimental work some practical applications have been realized in the realm of ocean engineering marin has built the first inland ship with o foil oscillating foil propulsion resulting in 50 better efficiency and a cut in fuel consumption by 33 till 50 in comparison with the screw propeller the project of unmanned surface vessel usv called autonaut developed a novel vessel propelled forward by four keel mounted foils converting energy from the pitch and roll of the waves biomimetic propulsors has many advantages with aspect of economy environment and efficiency etc and thus they need to be investigated intensively so that ship propulsion based on flapping foils can be used more widely the model of oscillating foil can be simplified into a two dimensional object with an airfoil section oscillating in the fluid as a result early researches were conducted on the two dimensional problems both theoretically and experimentally focusing on the force drag lift and thrust moment and propulsion generated by oscillating foils knoller 1909 betz 1912 katzmayr 1922 giauert 1929 garrick 1936 koochesfahani 1989 dohring et al 1996 knoller 1909 and betz 1912 firstly adopted a flapping wing to explain the mechanism of thrust generation which represents the beginning of the researches on flapping foils subsequently katzmayr 1922 verified the knoller betz effect and this is the first time to validate this phenomenon with experimental method onset of the two dimensional flow visualization structure arising from flapping motion was addressed early from the experiments in the 20th century von k√°rm√°n and burgers 1943 bratt 1950 wood and kirmani 1970 freymuth 1988 1990 koochesfahani 1989 von k√°rm√°n and burgers 1943 firstly explained the production of drag and thrust theoretically by observing the wake structure bratt 1950 confirmed von k√°rm√°n and burgers s explanation through flow visualization experiments freymuth 1988 presented the visualization on the propulsive vortical signature of two dimensional airfoils with pure plunging and pure pitching motion koochesfahani 1989 performed the flow visualization on vortical patterns of a pitching airfoil with nonsinusoidal oscillations soap film tunnels are the simple and efficient flow visualization tools to observe various vortex flows couder and basdevant 1986 gharib and derango 1989 rivera et al 1998 zhang et al 2000 schnipper et al 2009 andersen et al 2017 further vortex formation is found to be different under different flow conditions it is mainly dependent on the parameters including amplitude and frequency which also influence thrust and lift generation of a flapping foil until recently the issues of a two dimensional foil are still being studied andersen et al 2017 and schnipper et al 2009 performed numerical simulation with experimental verification of a two dimensional foil with pure heaving and pure pitching respectively they concluded that these two modes of motion are essentially the same from their wake map smits team mainly focus on the scaling law between geometric kinematic and environmental parameters and thrust power and energy consumption of an oscillating foil dewey et al 2011 2013 moored et al 2012 quinn et al 2015 buren et al 2017 2018 floryan et al 2017 2018 peng et al 2018a b studied the collective locomotion of two and multiple self propelled plates two dimensional in different configurations and they found four typical locomotion states and two schooling states respectively although an oscillating foil can be simplified into a two dimensional foil and studied for such a long time the physical mechanism involved is still unclear in some aspects the real foil always has a limited aspect ratio and thus the three dimensional flow structure can be generated due to the end effect taira and colonius 2009 used direct numerical simulations dns to study the wake structures of rectangular plates with different aspect ratios and non rectangular plates under the state of inclination soria s team performed experiments to discuss the effect of amplitude and frequency of an oscillating finite span wing on three dimensional vortex structure at low reynolds number von ellenrieder et al 2001 von ellenrieder et al 2002 von ellenrieder et al 2003 parker et al 2007 except for rectangular plate there are many researches on oscillating plates of other shapes such as the circular disk yang et al 2014 tian et al 2017a b the elliptic disk dong et al 2006 yilmaz and rockwell 2012 harbig et al 2013 wang et al 2016a and the trapezoidal plate green et al 2011 however zhang 2017 specially pointed out that the problems on how to make an oscillating foil generate maximum thrust and have energy harvesting efficiency up to the optimal state are still unclear hence two main conundrums are presented i how to systematically and accurately understand the complex flow mechanism around the three dimensional oscillating aero hydro foil ii how to achieve the high efficient control of the three dimensional oscillating aero hydro foil to optimize propulsion and energy harvesting performance once both of them are solved application of the oscillating foil will be promoted in the field of propulsion and current wind energy harvesting devices it is the reason that the studies of flow structure and aero hydrodynamic performance and the researches on how to enhance propulsive efficiency and energy harvesting efficiency have always been the research hotspots and continue to increase recently as indicated in fig 3 b the improvements from these researches are important for some engineering applications based on the in depth study of flapping foils it is found that the effects of reynolds number three dimensional effect foil flexibility and other parameters on aero hydro dynamic performances including thrust lift and propulsion efficiency are not an easy issue this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the researches about the aero hydro dynamics of flapping foils and then give some directions for the future work on this topic the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a brief description for the problem of the foil is given in section 2 including parameter description motion mode and research contents experimental techniques used to record the force and flow structure in experiments and various numerical simulation methods adopted in numerical studies are summarized in section 3 some key results arising from the change of some significant parameters which are the most crucial portion and of a considerable practical significance are addressed in section 4 finally summary and outlook are drawn in section 5 2 problem description 2 1 governing parameters it is easy to have the false impression that a flapping foil in fluid is a simple problem however it is true that more than 10 governing parameters have been mentioned in the articles reviewed here these parameters can be divided into four types environmental parameter describing the fluid properties geometric parameter describing the shape of foils kinematic parameter describing the motion of foils and performance parameter describing propulsion and energy harvesting performance of foils the number of parameters involved in a single paper is normally not limited to one schematics of some parameters are described in figs 4 and 5 2 1 1 environmental parameters there are many parameters about fluid properties but only a few of them are normally considered when it comes to the flapping foils freestream velocity u kinematic viscosity ŒΩ of the fluid as well as reynolds number re defined by both of them are the dominant parameters considered in the researches of flapping foils the reynolds number is defined as 1 r e u l 0 ŒΩ where l 0 is the characteristic length which may be represented by the chord length c the maximum thickness d or span length l aiming at three dimensional issues of the flapping foil the corresponding reynolds number re is defined respectively as 2 r e c u c ŒΩ r e d u d ŒΩ r e l u l ŒΩ specially shinde and arakeri 2013 investigated the jet generated by a naca0015 foil pitching in quiescent fluid where u is zero re is defined as 3 r e t e v t e max c ŒΩ where v t e max is the maximum velocity of trailing edge te although mach number ma is another key parameter in the high speed air flow its effect on flapping foils is rarely mentioned 2 1 2 geometric parameters the parameters determining the shape of a foil include the chord length c the maximum thickness d the span length l the cross section shape and the planform as shown in fig 4 for the so called two dimensional 2d foil only c d and the cross section shape are considered the cross section shape is normally rectangle ellipse and teardrop among which teardrop is the most studied one generally some teardrop shaped foils are defined as a proprietary name such as naca series sd series eppler series and sg series based on the two dimensional foil l is added to describe a foil but its value is infinite which is so called the pseudo three dimensional foil in fact such issues still focus on two dimensions and do not take three dimensional effect into consideration however when the value of l is finite the foil is the so called true three dimensional 3d foil the planform is mainly circle ellipse triangle trapezoid and rectangle among which rectangle is the most studied one hence aspect ratio ar is introduced and defined as 4 a r l c the effects of ar on the three dimensional flapping foil have been presented briefly in section 1 in addition another parameter that should be introduced is the flexibility of foil the shape of foil will change constantly with its flapping motion researches on flexible foils both 2d and 3d account for almost 15 as shown in fig 3 a dewey et al 2013 pointed out that the thrust of the flexible oscillating foil can be increased by 1 2 times and the propulsion efficiency can be doubled cleaver et al 2016 demonstrated that the flexibility of the oscillating foil enlarges the motion amplitude which increases the lift force significantly moreover investigations on energy harvesting devices based on flexible foils were conducted numerically zhu et al 2009 griffith et al 2016 liu et al 2016 it is necessary and important to give an accurate description of foil geometry which is the basis of all researches most studies are conducted on the 2d foil including the infinite foil because they have the advantages of simple problem clear physics easy mathematical description simple numerical simulation and so on a large number of researches mainly concentrate on a 2d foil which take up almost 78 nevertheless three dimensional effect is unavoidable in nature and the 2d foil cannot reflect its true physical mechanism in many conditions as a result more and more issues have been investigated based on 3d 2 1 3 kinematic parameters the oscillation motion of a foil is characterized by several parameters firstly the strouhal number st describing the externally imposed frequency is defined as 5 s t f l 0 u where f is the frequency of the oscillation similar to the definition of re st can be defined as 6 s t c f c u s t d f d u s t a f a u where a is peak to peak amplitude as shown in fig 5 st c st d and st a are the chord based the maximum thickness based and amplitude based strouhal number respectively when the flapping amplitude is defined in length as a or h 0 heave or plunge amplitude respectively the dimensionless amplitude can be often defined as 7 a d a d a c a c 8 h h 0 c particularly st a is equal to the product of st d and a d it can be treated as the ratio between the oscillation velocity of the foil trailing edge and the freestream velocity st a is often used as a criterion for describing drag thrust transition triantafyllou et al 1991 as we know the fish like swimming and flapping flight in nature occur for st a 0 2 0 4 the specific reason of which is still unclear reduced frequency is another frequently used non dimensional form of oscillating frequency defined as 9 k œâ c u 2 œÄ f c 2 u flapping foil motion is designed to couple two sinusoidal motions with the same frequency in the most literatures which are respectively defined by 10 h t h 0 sin 2 œÄ f t 11 Œ∏ t Œ∏ 0 sin 2 œÄ f t œï where Œ∏ 0 is the pitch amplitude h t is the instantaneous vertical position of the foil axis Œ∏ t is the instantaneous angle between the freestream velocity u and the foil chord and œï is the phase angle between pitch and heave noteworthily effective instantaneous angle of attack Œ± eff is calculated with three terms as following 12 Œ± e f f Œ± m Œ∏ 0 sin 2 œÄ f t œï tan 1 h 0 2 œÄ f cos 2 œÄ f t u where Œ± m is the mean angle of attack or geometric angle of attack when reaching the maximum angle Œ± eff is the so called nominal effective angle of attack Œ± 0 specially with œï 90 the maximum nominal angle of attack becomes 13 Œ± max e f f Œ± 0 Œ± m Œ∏ 0 tan 1 h 0 2 œÄ f u in some literatures pitch amplitude Œ∏ 0 is not given but nominal angle of attack Œ± 0 is used as an alternative parameter pivot location of the foil is based on the chord length c as shown in fig 4 the leading edge of chordwise and the root of spanwise are special location moreover angle of attack profile selected in most experiments and simulations is sinusoidal which means that both of pitch and heave motion are sinusoidal similarly variable pivot location and non sinusoidal motion can also change the motion of the foil and influence the flow structures and hydrodynamic forces of the foil 2 1 4 performance parameters the parameters describing the propulsion performance of an oscillating foil includes thrust coefficient c t input power coefficient c p and propulsion efficiency Œ∑ the mean thrust coefficient is defined as 14 c t f x 0 5 œÅ u 2 c l where œÅ is the fluid density and f x is the time averaged force in x direction defined as 15 f x 1 œÑ 0 œÑ f x t d t where f x t is the instantaneous force component in x direction and œÑ is the oscillation period the mean input power coefficient c p is defined as 16 c p p 0 5 œÅ u 3 c l where p is mean input power calculated by 17 p 1 œÑ 0 œÑ f y t d h t d t d t 0 œÑ m Œ∏ t d Œ∏ t d t d t where f y t is the instantaneous force component in y direction m Œ∏ t is the instantaneous pitching moment and dh dt and dŒ∏ dt are derivatives of heave and pitch motion respectively the final propulsion efficiency is expressed as 18 Œ∑ c t c p the key parameters describing the energy harvesting efficiency of an oscillating foil are output power coefficient c op and the energy harvesting efficiency Œ∑ op the mean output power coefficient is defined as 19 c o p p o 0 5 œÅ u 3 c l c o p y c o p Œ∏ 1 œÑ 0 œÑ c y d h t d t d t 0 œÑ c c m d Œ∏ t d t d t where p o is

the instantaneous pitching moment coefficient defined as 20 c y f y 0 5 œÅ u 2 c l 21 c m m Œ∏ 0 5 œÅ u 2 c 2 l the energy harvesting efficiency is expressed as 22 Œ∑ o p p o 0 5 œÅ u 3 d l c o p c d where d is the maximum vertical displacement of the trailing edge of the flapping foil it must be noted that the parameters related to propulsion efficiency are under the condition of an oscillating foil with combined pitching and heaving motion and the parameters related to energy harvesting efficiency are under the condition of a harvest device with forced pitching and heaving motion moreover xiao and zhu 2014 have made a thorough review on the energy harvesters based on foils and the definitions for energy harvesting efficiency of three types of flapping foil flow energy harvesters have been introduced in detail 2 2 motion mode of the foil the motion mode of a foil has a crucial effect on the wake structure and aero hydrodynamic performance of a flapping foil the motion mode can be classified into three categories plunging or heaving pitching and flapping among which flapping is the combination of plunging and pitching these motion can also be of full active motion semi active motion or full passive motion the schematics of them are shown in figs 5 and 6 full active motion means that both pitching motion Œ∏ t and heaving motion h t are prescribed and it is widely considered for oscillating foils the systems with forced pitching and induced heaving motions and self sustained pitching and heaving motions are called semi activated systems and full passive systems respectively both are the typical models for issues on flow energy harvesters based on flapping foils for semi active semi passive system it also can be composed of forced heaving and induced pitching motion boudreau et al 2019a b numerically proved that the novel semi passive flapping foil turbine with a prescribed heave motion and a passive pitch motion can achieve the similar performance with fully active flapping foil turbine moreover b√∏ckmann and steen 2014 experimentally concluded that a passive pitching and forced heaving foil can produce higher thrust than that of the fully constrained foil however tsarsitalidis and politis 2015 found that the contributions of a heaving wing pitching passively spring loaded as energy harvester is more than that as main propulsion device these results show that the foil with semi passive motion have a great potential in terms of energy harvesting boudreau et al 2018 2020 and duarte et al 2019 discussed the dynamic behavior of the full passive flapping foil turbine numerically and experimentally respectively fig 3 c reveals the proportional distribution of three mentioned motion modes compared to pure heaving and pure pitching motion research on flapping motion attracts more attentions whose proportion is almost 54 2 3 research contents researches on flapping foil began in the 20th century the content of which includes four main aspects namely aero hydro dynamic performance energy harvesting flow structure and bionics the proportion of them are presented in fig 3 b the researches on aero hydrodynamic performance and flow structure whose proportion are 44 89 and 45 26 respectively far more than the other two aero hydro dynamic performance mainly focuses on the lift drag thrust generation and propulsion efficiency thereby achieving optimal performance how to improve performance is still a key issue until now because great performance contributes to the engineering applications the flow structures around the foil have been investigated and help to explain the complex flow mechanism actually flow structure directly determines the aero hydro dynamic force so researchers normally explain force generation of the oscillating foil through the analysis of flow structures the issues of energy harvesting efficiency arise from anxious desires and needs for renewable energy its basic principle is that energy harvester extracts energy from the flow and converts it into the electricity for human therefore how to design and control the energy harvester devices is a crucial direction that needs to be continuously broken through so the recent investigations and attention of energy harvesting based on flapping foils present a gradually increasing trend bionics based on the oscillating foil is a study on the locomotion of aquatic and flying animals through numerical and experimental methods the model of the caudal fin of fish and the wing of birds are designed for researches to imitate fish like swimming and flapping like flying gursul and ho 1992 found that unsteady motion of the foil creates very high lift coefficient esfahani et al 2013 concluded that the propulsive efficiency could be enhanced in fish like swimming which is more efficient than that of flapping wing flying although the study of bio inspired motion takes up the least number with respect to the rest three aspects it seeks to draw accurate conclusion about condition of generating optimal thrust lift or propulsion efficiency from the locomotion of aquatic and flying animals to apply to engineering area biomimetic propulsors are gradually developed for marine propulsion due to its friendliness to environment and considerable efficiency the applications of horizontal and vertical foils and wings mounted on different locations of the ship are benefit for ship stabilization and additional thrust and energy can be obtained owing to the pitching and heaving motion of foils induced by the ship responses b√∏ckmann and steen 2013 2016 belibassakis and filippas 2015 belibassakis and politis 2013 politis and tsarsitalidis 2014 tsarsitalidis and politis 2015 the principles of vorticity control mechanism for the interaction between oncoming flow and fish body fin and tail play a core role in understanding fish swimming and maneuvering 3 review on research methods 3 1 experimental methods the researches on flapping or oscillating foils done by a variety of scholars or teams from different countries adopt many kinds of experimental methods a summary of past experimental studies of flapping foils or flat plates are presented in chronological order in table 1 the range of each parameter and equipment used in experiments have more or less differences to obtain desired results for different objectives besides flow visualization velocity measurement angle of attack profile the cross section and flexibility of a foil are also addressed in table 1 3 1 1 environmental simulation in experiments the flow condition that a foil experiences is normally generated using a water or wind tunnel the water tunnel has some common features such as closed circuit free surface low speed large scale and low reynolds number and their design principles do not bear too much difference a re circulating water channel used by lua et al 2016 and dash et al 2018 is shown in fig 7 a the flapping mechanism mounted on the top of test section can perform pitching with a resolution of 0 018 and heaving with a resolution of 0 005 mm the greatest advantage of this system is that the vibration generated by linear motion heaving can be reduced to a minimum so that it has an unconsidered influence on the flow field lua et al 2011 most of water channels used before did not take this vibration into consideration generally the water tunnels are horizontally placed with the flow going from one side to the other side the exceptions are that schnipper et al 2009 and andersen et al 2017 innovatively used the vertically placed gravity driven soap film tunnel to investigated the issues of oscillating foils as shown in fig 7 c the soap film tunnel not only has a good simulation of two dimensional environment but is extremely advantageous to extend the area of wake downstream so that the far wake evolution can be visualized clearly the development of flowing soap films has been reviewed by schnipper et al 2009 the characteristics of wind tunnel is generally similar to the water tunnel but the transmission medium is different sadeghi and mani 2009 2011 and 2015 investigated the effect of motion amplitude and mean angle of attack on the wake of an oscillating airfoil in a subsonic wind tunnel shown in fig 7 b because the wind speed of wind tunnel is high and the size of the airfoil is normally large the corresponding reynolds number has a relatively high order of magnitude compared with that in water tunnels in ocean engineering field a still water tank equipped with a towing carriage is normally used to simulate the relative motion between the fluid and obstacles the study on propulsive efficiency of oscillating foils was conducted in the ocean engineering testing tank in mit anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 hover et al 2004 schouveiler et al 2005 as shown in fig 7 d the limitation of a still water tank is that the distance the foil can drive is short and the system vibration may have an effect on force measurement 3 1 2 flow visualization velocity and force measurement when we analyze the flow structure of the oscillating foil the visualization and measurement of the flow are necessary some traditional methods including dye hydrogen bubbles soap film and smoke wire flow visualization play an important role in qualitative observation of the wake structures dye and smoke wire are mostly used for hydrodynamics and aerodynamics respectively it requires a good control of these medium so that the visualization can be up to the optimal fig 8 shows a reverse k√°rm√°n vortex street generated by a pitching foil using dye flow visualization srigrarom and vincent 2008 fig 9 shows that smoke wire visualize the boundary layers of the airfoil kim and chang 2010 the flow velocity is measured mainly via hot wire film anemometer hwfa in early days but it is still being used now chang and yoon 2002 sadeghi and mani 2009 sadeghi et al 2011 2015 the biggest disadvantage of this technique is the contact type measurement which interferes with the flow field greatly furthermore laser doppler velocimetry ldv achieves the non contact 3d velocity measurement koochesfahani 1989 jones et al 1998 1999 lai and platzer 1999 kuo and hsieh 2001 however both methods are only single point measurement techniques and cannot obtain full field and instantaneous measurement of the flow at present particle image velocimetry piv shown in fig 10 is the most popular method used in experiments reviewed in table 1 it can both display the physical form of flow field and provide quantitative information of instantaneous whole field flow which makes the research of flow visualization leap from qualitative to quantitative it also includes digital particle image velocimetry dpiv and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv two more methods that need to be pointed out are the volumetric velocimetry calderon et al 2014 cleaver et al 2016 and molecular tagging velocimetry mtv respectively mtv is used to measure the vortical field of a foil oscillating at different reduced frequencies by bohl and koochesfahani 2009 which is considered as the molecular counterpart of piv the force measurement has been improved from using the strain gauge before to using high precision multi directional force sensor now their measurement principle is not explained in detail here 3 1 3 experimental foil models the physical properties of the research model are chosen based on the objective of the research and its geometric parameters have been introduced briefly in section 2 naca 4 digit foils among which mainly naca0012 are the most studied cross sectional shape in addition flat plates which do not have the teardrop are also a research focus both of them have been reviewed in table 1 more recently a new concept of foil as shown in fig 11 a which combines a rigid naca 4 digit foil in head location and a flat plate of variable flexibility in tail receives a certain amount of attention from some researchers heathcote et al 2004 heathcote and gursul 2007 monnier et al 2015 similarly kumar and shin 2019 experimentally investigated the thrust estimation of a naca0015 hydrofoil attached to an elastic plate with various lengths and breadths whose construction is opposite to the previous foil as shown in fig 11 b its wake vortex pattern and hydrodynamic performance due to flapping motion were discussed for studies of a finite span flapping foil or flat plate the three dimensionality of the foil shape has a significant effect on aero hydro dynamic problems torres and mueller 2004 studied the aerodynamics of four distinct geometries flapping wing planform rectangular zimmerman inverse zimmerman and elliptical with seven aspect ratios varying from 0 50 to 2 00 at various reynolds numbers flow structures generated by variable planform rectangular semicircular delta circular ring et al plates at different angles of attack freymuth et al 1987 taira and colonius 2009 yilmaz and rockwell 2012 are also investigated the flexibility of foil may affect the formation of leading edge vortex trailing edge vortex and tip vortex and has been frequently considered in both spanwise s heathcote et al 2008 cleaver et al 2016 and chordwise prempraneerach et al 2003 bansmer et al 2010 alben et al 2012 barannyk et al 2012 dai et al 2012 marais et al 2012 dewey et al 2013 tian et al 2013 directions in addition other properties including the chord length lai and platzer 1999 alben et al 2012 thickness numerical method ashraf et al 2011a yu et al 2013 sain et al 2016 wang et al 2016c and camber ashraf et al 2011a chang et al 2015 can also affect the dynamic performance of a foil thus the geometry of the research model needs to be paid more attention so that the expected experimental results can be achieved 3 1 4 brief discussion of experimental parameters in the reported experiments the statistic characteristics for the foil are considered based on various parameters such as strouhal number st reynolds number re reduced frequency k aspect ratio ar dimensionless plunge heave amplitude h h 0 c phase angle between pitching and heaving motions œï pitch motion amplitude Œ∏ 0 or nominal effective angle of attack Œ± 0 mean angle of attack Œ± m pivot location x c and all of them have been described in detail in section 2 the different definitions of the kinematic parameter strouhal number have been presented due to the different physical meanings and definitions the range of st is normally between 0 1 and 0 8 while the range of k is normally within 20 excepting that lai and platzer 1999 and jones et al 1998 studied wake structure of flapping foils at a high value of k up to 100 similarly environmental parameter reynolds number also has many definition methods shown in section 2 re has a very wide range from 164 to 1 5 106 seen from table 1 due to the different sizes of foils incoming velocity and different definitions also viscosity is another parameter that determines the reynolds number re the fluid viscosity is determined by temperature and type of medium for experiments fluid viscosity is always taken as the value of water or air at 20 c in addition re is seldom altered by changing fluid viscosity for the researches on oscillating foil the magnitude of re determines the flow state which may be in laminar transient or turbulent states different value of re may result in completely distinct experimental results plunge heave amplitude and pitch amplitude are inevitable basic parameters for the researches of flapping foils there are three kinds of motion mode including pure pitching pure heaving and combined pitching and heaving as shown in section 2 to some extent flapping motion is equivalent to combined pitching and heaving plunging motion heave amplitude is generally no more than one chord length and pitch amplitude does not exceed 45 in table 1 œï is generally fixed as 90 in the literature but the effect of phase angle on performance of the foil is also investigated anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 von ellenrieder et al 2002 2003 the range of œï presented is from 30 to 120 similarly Œ± m is always fixed as 0 but the effect of mean angle of attack on foils is also discussed ohmi et al 1990 1991 jones et al 1999 lee et al 2000 schouveiler et al 2005 srigrarom and vincent 2008 sadeghi and mani 2009 2011 cleaver et al 2012 hu et al 2013 the range of Œ± m is from 0 to 45 but most of them focus on small angle of attack moreover variable pivot location granlund et al 2013 tian et al 2016 mackowski and williamson 2017 and non sinusoidal motion hover et al 2004 fenercioglu et al 2015 karakas and fenercioglu 2016 van buren et al 2017 dash et al 2018 also influence the flow structures and hydrodynamic forces of the foil the specific effect of reynolds number reduced frequency three dimensional effect ar and motion amplitude will be discussed in section 4 3 2 numerical works the statistics whose classification criteria is almost the same as experimental works are also done for numerical works as shown in table 2 3 2 1 numerical approach nowadays computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is the main method used for researches on the dynamics of flapping foils or plates but the method of non cfd develops early and is still used today panel method is one of the widely used methods in early days jones and platzer 1997 jones et al 1999 guglielmini and blondeaux 2004 solved governing equations of an oscillating foil using a stream function vorticity formulation for a two dimensional problem this method is also adopted recently zhu et al 2009 zhu 2011 2012 particularly andersen et al 2017 performed the numerical simulations of wake structure of a flapping foil in 2d flow using the particle vortex method pvm this method has been described and validated by walther and larsen 1997 larsen and walther 1997 rasmussen et al 2010 and hejlesen et al 2015 however with the maturity of computer technology cfd has become the main method to investigate fluid problems the implementation of cfd frequently depends on some commercial or open source codes such as fluent cfx starccm and openfoam most of which are based on finite volume method fvm and a few of which are based on finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm yu et al 2017 investigated the effect of kinematic parameters on the propulsion performance of an oscillating foil at re from 103 to 1 6 106 using fvm with the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model and they concluded three different combinations of kinematic parameters for optimal propulsion efficiency lua et al 2016 use fluent based on fvm to study the thrust performance of a flapping 2d elliptic airfoil in forward flight numerically and their results show that high rotation rate of the foil causes an adverse suction effect which can suppress the thrust of the foil boiron et al 2012 used the fem to solve the flow around the foil and they compared the hydrodynamics of a flapping foil through experimental and numerical methods meanwhile spectral method sm and lattice boltzmann method lbm are non grid based approaches yu et al 2012 2013 adopted an unsteady compressible navier stokes n s solver using high order spectral difference sd method to investigate the wake structure and the effects of foil thickness and kinematics on flapping foil propulsion medjroubi et al 2011 2012 simulated the 2d unsteady flow around a heaving naca0012 airfoil using the spectral element method sem and well reproduced the wake flow behind the heaving foil wu et al 2014 2015a b c used the immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm to simulate the flow over the foil so that the energy extraction performance can be obtained the numerical results obtained from direct cfd simulations make significant contributions to improving the thrust and propulsive efficiency of a flapping foil and provides a theoretical basis for follow up researches besides the methods mentioned above immersed boundary fractional step method ibfs choi et al 2015 a high fidelity implicit large eddy simulation iles visbal 2009 2013 etc are also used in numerical simulations moving mesh method is an essential issue for the numerical study of an oscillating foil there are many moving mesh methods elastic scaling method and mesh reconstruction method are commonly used to simulate pitching and heaving motions 3 2 2 turbulence models there are three kinds of methods to simulate the turbulence flow of flapping foils namely direct numerical simulation dns large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans base on the literature review rans is the early method used to solve the issues of turbulence it has been used for a wide range of re for studies on flapping foils however rans cannot obtain satisfactory results for the turbulent flow structures dns can accurately get all information of turbulence and do not consider the closeness of the equations but it is limited to low re and simple boundary problems due to its high demand on computational resources actually les is superior to rans in terms of model construction and is computationally more efficient than dns although its computational cost is still high but its development is not yet mature and is only for simple shear and tube flow turbulence models are used to close the governing equation several models such as single equation spalart allmaras s a turbulence model two equations shear stress transport sst turbulence model k œâ two equations sst turbulence model and zero equation baldwin lomax b l algebraic turbulence model are listed in table 2 zhu et al 2015 used the s a turbulence model to close rans and found that the energy harvesting efficiency of a new adaptive deformation oscillating foil they proposed can be 16 1 higher than the conventional one without deformation kinsey and dumas 2012 carried out a numerical research based on 2d unsteady rans simulations using s a model and analyzed the different tandem configuration for two oscillating foils within a hydrokinetic turbine to maximize the energy harvesting efficiency liu et al 2013 utilized a bio inspired flexible flapping foil to discuss the energy harvesting performance using k œâ turbulence model for unsteady rans closure they concluded that the flexible structure or the parallel configuration of the foil all can enhance energy efficiency m√ºnch et al 2010 proposed a method using sst k œâ and k Œµ turbulence model that can predict fluid structure coupling for a rigid hydrofoil with forced and free pitching motions kang et al 2009 studied the effects of chord length based reynolds number on the dynamics of the oscillating sd7003 airfoil by solving 2d rans based on sst model which is compared with experimental results lu et al 2013a b used sst k œâ model for simulations to investigate the effects of asymmetric sinusoidal motion on pitching airfoil aerodynamics tuncer and kaya 2005 2007 adopted the b l algebraic turbulence model to optimize the thrust and propulsion efficiency of flapping foils through different methods in addition there are other turbulence models such as zero equation cebeci smith c s single equation baldwin barth b b and reynolds stress model rsm but most of them are not suitable for the issues related to the oscillating foil 3 2 3 brief discussion of numerical parameters columns 6 to 17 in table 2 are based on the same classification of the physical properties and kinematic parameters of the flapping foil or plate as in the experimental work the specific content also has more or less similarity naca series are frequently chosen to be the research object of which mainly naca0012 the stiffness of the foil are mostly rigid although the effect of chordwise miao and ho 2006 shin et al 2009 eldredge et al 2010 tay and lim 2010 ysasi et al 2011 zhu et al 2014a b liu et al 2016 olivier and dumas 2016a b jeanmonod and olivier 2017 and spanwise zhu 2007 kang et al 2011 flexibility of the foil is also studied in numerical approaches noteworthily the range of re is a little different from that in the experiments in table 1 the smallest reynolds number is 100 and the highest up to 9 38 106 the discussions on three dimensional effect are always unavoidable the effect of ar has been studied dong et al 2006 shao et al 2010 li and lu 2012 harbig et al 2013 deng et al 2015 the range of which summarized in table 2 is from 0 2 to 8 the range of pitching amplitude Œ∏ 0 or maximum angle of attack Œ± 0 considered in numerical simulations is wider than that in the experiments similar with the experimental studies the effect of phase angle œï jones and platzer 1997 ramamurti and sandberg 2001 pedro et al 2003 tuncer and kaya 2005 eldredge et al 2010 platzer et al 2010 sarkar and singasani 2009 xiao and liao 2010 ashraf et al 2011b mean angle of attack Œ± m visbal and shang 1989 ohmi et al 1991 jones et al 1999 visbal 2009 sarkar and singasani 2009 medjroubi et al 2011 liu et al 2013 mart√≠n alc√°ntara et al 2015 non sinusoidal motion kaya and tuncer 2007 xiao and liao 2010 xiao et al 2012 esfahani et al 2013 lu et al 2013a b young and lai 2014 lu et al 2014 teng et al 2016 and pivot location zhu et al 2009 eldredge et al 2010 zhu 2011 2012 wang et al 2017a have also been investigated numerically particularly the effect of the relative position between an upstream bluff body and a heaving and pitching hydrofoil on energy harvesting performance has been investigated by lahooti and kim 2019 they found that the presence of the upstream body can change flow structure around the hydrofoil thus improve the efficiency significantly 4 review on the law of several significant parameters as aforementioned the dynamic characteristics of the flapping foil are dependent on various factors which have been introduced in section 2 2 in this section the related conclusions of four major parameters including reynolds number re reduced frequency k pitch or heave amplitude and three dimensional effect are reviewed from three aspects flow structures hydrodynamic coefficient and energy harvesting efficiency 4 1 reynolds number reynolds number is the fundamental parameter determining the flow status and has been considered in a wide range from 102 to 107 for the flapping foil it is a significant conclusion that the variation of reynolds number has no apparent effect on the formation of the periodic vortex and establishment of the subsequent wake behind an oscillating foil in the range of 1500 re 104 ohmi et al 1990 ashraf et al 2009 and medjroubi et al 2011 performed simulations on a pure plunging foil and found that flow structure was almost independent of reynolds number for re 200 2 105 and re 800 8000 respectively baik and bernal 2012 carried out experiments on a pitching and plunging foil came to the same results with ashraf et al and medjroubi et al for re between 104 and 6 104 fenercioglu and cetiner 2012 also made a similar conclusion that five flow structure categories generated by a combined pitching and plunging foil are independent of increasing reynolds number from 825 to 1 37 104 and even the production of thrust is independent on the reynolds number for re 1 5 104 leading edge vortex lev and trailing edge vortex tev are frequently seen from wake structures behind a flapping foil both of them are sensitive to the variation of reynolds number lu et al 2013a b and ol et al 2008 investigated the trapezoidal pitch sd7003 airfoil at different re and they clearly observed that the attenuation of the lev decreased when re increased from 300 to 1200 resulting in a stronger interaction between the lev and tev kang et al 2009 concluded that leading edge vortex formed at lower re re 104 and more attached flow is observed at higher re re 3 104 6 104 for combined pitching and plunging case however for pure plunging case the leading edge vortex occurred at all investigated re which became stronger with increasing re amiralaei et al 2010 observed the vortical patterns around a naca0012 pitching airfoil as shown in fig 12 the tev and the lower surface vortex became larger and stronger with re increasing from 555 to 1000 further increasing to 2000 lower surface vortex started to separate but tev had not yet in contrast to re 2000 tev was separated and downstream convected but the lower and upper surface vortices attached on the foil at re 5000 varied reynolds number is the root cause to the existence of this phenomenon of unsteady boundary layer separation and reattachment the increase of reynolds number gives rise to the promotion delay of the reattachment and unsteady laminar separation during the upstroke downstroke of the pitching foil which is obtained by kim and chang 2010 generally the wake behind a pitching or heaving foil is symmetric about the middle position of the foil periodic motion however when a foil pitches or plunges at relatively high frequency and large amplitude symmetry breaking occurs in the vortical wake leading to a deflection angle which is related to reynolds number liang et al 2011 were the first to find that the deflection angle increases with reynolds number increasing for a fast plunging airfoil as shown in fig 13 subsequently zheng and wei 2012 conducted further researches on mechanism of this phenomenon for a finite foil the effect of reynolds number on its three dimensional vortex structure was also investigated numerically and experimentally by visbal et al 2013 they found that spanwise fine scale transitional features from no evidence to becoming more obvious when reynolds number increases from 103 to 5 103 ol 2007 proved that the strength of spanwise flow increases with increasing re from 104 to 6 104 the influence of reynolds number on hydrodynamic aerodynamic coefficient of a pitching plunging or oscillating foil including the coefficient of lift thrust drag and power is also discussed here miao and ho 2006 simulated the power coefficient of a flapping flexible airfoil at different reynolds number 102 103 104 which is found to have no effect on both thrust and input power coefficient as shown in fig 14 the same results were obtained for a spanwise flexible flapping wing and a rigid pitching foil by heathcote et al 2008 and das et al 2016 respectively similarly reynolds number hardly affects force generation for a flapping foil lua et al 2010 studied the reynolds number from 7800 to 1 17 104 and found reynolds number has a very small effect on the force generation medjroubi et al 2011 baik et al 2012 and baik and bernal 2012 made similar conclusions that the influence of reynolds number on aerodynamic force generation is weak in addition heathcote et al 2008 provided a result that the thrust coefficient is a very weak function of reynolds number and lua et al 2008 obtained that the mean drag coefficient has nothing to do with the reynolds number however the law of reynolds number is not true for all cases ashraf et al 2009 investigated the naca0015 plunging airfoil at re 2 105 which generates 40 more thrust than that at re 2 104 time averaged thrust coefficient increases with increasing reynolds number re 72 144 and 360 based on the flapping airfoil thickness in the simulation performed by yu et al 2013 das et al 2016 also obtained the same result for a pitching foil at different re from 10 to 2000 furthermore visbal 2009 and liang et al 2011 found that the drag coefficient decreases evidently as the reynolds number increases for a pure plunging foil and a plunging and pitching foil respectively reynolds number has a relatively uniform influence on propulsive or energy harvesting efficiency generally the efficiency increases with reynolds number miao and ho 2006 observed that the propulsive efficiency increases with increasing reynolds number at lower reduced frequency for a chordwise flexible flapping airfoil and heathcote et al 2008 also concluded that the efficiency increases slightly with reynolds number for a spanwise flexible flapping foil in addition ashraf et al 2009 investigated the reynolds number on a pure plunging naca0015 airfoil propulsive at reduced frequency k 2 non dimensional plunge amplitude h 0 5 and results revealed that propulsive efficiency increases with re increasing from 20 to 2 105 as shown in fig 15 a fig 15 b shows that the propulsion efficiency rises significantly as re increase after that only slight change can be observed lin et al 2019 optimal energy harvesting efficiency is found to be enhanced by increasing reynolds number by zhu 2011 4 2 reduced frequency reduced frequency is a type of non dimensionalized expression of frequency defined as k 2 œÄ f c 2 u identified as the major parameter controlling flow development the flow structure changes apparently as the reduced frequency varies bohl and koochesfahani 2009 presented an experiment on vortical structure in the wake of a pitching naca0012 airfoil using molecular tagging velocimetry mtv observing that a k√°rm√°n street with alternating sign vortices clockwise vortices at the top of the centerline counter clockwise at the bottom of the centerline at k 5 2 a neutral wake alternating sign vortices nearly aligned along the wake at k 5 7 and a reverse or inverted k√°rm√°n street with alternating sign vortices counter clockwise vortices at the top of the centerline clockwise at the bottom of the centerline at k 11 5 the similar phenomenon was revealed by medjroubi et al 2012 for a heaving naca0012 airfoil using the spectral hp element method at k 0 k 4 52 and k 7 85 respectively recently moubogha et al 2017 obtained similar results for a pitching plate at k 1 5 5 via the comparison of experimental and numerical method as shown in fig 16 all of aforementioned results are well consistent with the previous ones observed in koochesfahani 1989 some detailed changes of vortices leading and trailing edge vortices around a foil with varied reduced frequency are further investigated ol 2007 used dye visualization to display the vortex shedding behind the trailing edge of a pure plunging airfoil he observed that the wake adjacent to trailing edge varies from a planar and uniform flow into a starting vortex with increasing reduced frequency and larger reduced frequency leads to greater persistence of the starting vortex baik et al 2012 noticed that increasing reduced frequency causes slower lev and tev growth rate through piv measurements for a flapping airfoil moreover panah and buchholz 2014 observed four categories of wake patterns which are mainly dependent on reduced frequency within the range of 0 39 k 4 7 for a 2d plunging plate i lev merges with like signed tev ii lev interacts with the following stronger opposite signed tev iii lev arrived at trailing edge one full period latter than the opposite signed tev generation and iv lev remains on the surface of airfoil for more than three strokes the strength of lev is reduced when it sheds into wake with increasing reduced frequency k see fig 17 the effect of reduced frequency on hydro aerodynamic coefficient studied by many researchers has no qualitative difference generally the mean thrust coefficient tends to increase with reduced frequency garrick 1936 koochesfahani 1989 and ramamurti and sandberg 2001 firstly used the theoretical experimental and numerical methods to reach this result respectively mackowski and williamson 2015 reviewed some relatively early studies on mean thrust of a pure pitching foil from theory garrick 1936 jones and platzer 1997 ramamurti and sandberg 2001 simulation ramamurti and sandberg 2001 young and lai 2004 and experiment koochesfahani 1989 bohl and koochesfahani 2009 compared with their own direct force measurements of thrust shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 all of them has the same increasing trend with reduced frequency although their results exist a quantitative difference due to the distinct conditions however the change of other parameters appears having very limited influences on the trend of mean thrust coefficient for instance the experiments or simulations for a plunging airfoil ashraf et al 2012 elarbi 2013 a non sinusoidal pitching airfoil lu et al 2013a b zaman et al 2014 a flexible pitching panel dewey et al 2013 and a combined pitching and plunging airfoil esfahani et al 2015 all show that the increase of reduced frequency causes a noticeable increase in mean thrust coefficient and thus suggests that the motion modes motion profile and flexibility of a foil do not alter this conclusion it should be pointed out that there is a maximum thrust coefficient after which it starts to decrease slightly with further increasing reduced frequency k for a flexible pitching plates obtained by dewey et al 2013 and this change is also clearly observed within the range of 1 82 k 10 92 for a pitching airfoil by ashraf et al 2015 the power coefficient showed similar trends as those of mean thrust coefficient for a flexible pitching plate the power coefficient increases to a maximum and then levels off dewey et al 2013 the reduced frequency is a key parameter in analysis of propulsion and power extraction by flapping foil the reduced frequency determines the magnitude of energy that the flapping foil can extract from free stream the variation trend of propulsive efficiency of a flapping foil propeller with reduced frequency is similar to a reverse parabola displaying that propulsive efficiency increases monotonically with reduced frequency k at first and then it decreases gradually with further increasing k when other parameters are fixed ashraf et al 2012 lu et al 2013a b elarbi 2013 dewey et al 2013 esfahani et al 2015 the magnitude of efficiency is not fixed owing to a variety of other parameter combinations such as pitching or heaving amplitude the flexibility of the foil and phase angle between pitching and heaving however there is a truth that the maximum propulsive efficiency always occur at relatively low k moreover at the same k the flexible foil can further enhance the efficiency even resulting a doubled efficiency the qualitative trend of power extraction efficiency of a flapping foil energy harvester with forced pitching and heaving motions almost has no difference in propulsive efficiency liu et al 2013 xie et al 2014 karbasian et al 2015 lu et al 2015 wu et al 2016 xu and sun 2016 as shown in fig 18 similarly the global optimal energy extraction efficiency also appears at low k within the range between 0 1 and 0 15 which has been summarized specifically by xiao and zhu 2014 and explained physically by zhu 2011 for the semi active flapping foil the energy extraction efficiency is different from that of the fully active flapping foil wu et al 2014 2015a c simulated the power extraction of a semi active flapping foil with the auxiliary foil the flexible tail and different spring constant respectively all of which come to the same conclusion that energy extraction efficiency monotonically decreases with increasing reduced frequency as shown in fig 19 4 3 pitching or heaving amplitude the influences of pitching or heaving amplitude on the flow structures are globally similar with that of the reduced frequency this can be sketched that when flapping frequency and other parameters are fixed as the flapping amplitude increases the flow structure initially transits from k√°rm√°n street to aligned vortices and then becomes reverse k√°rm√°n street and finally become deflected reverse k√°rm√°n street with symmetry breaking essentially the global flow structure of a single general flapping foil mainly depends on frequency and amplitude godoy diana et al 2008 uses the experimental method to investigate the transitions in the wake of a pitching foil with different amplitude and frequency combination and obtained aforementioned transition process of the flow structure he et al 2012 also proved this process via a numerical method schnipper et al 2009 and andersen et al 2017 compared numerical and experimental investigations for the flapping foil and measured the phase diagram in the st a a d space as shown in fig 20 where st a and a d are another form of non dimensional frequency and amplitude respectively in addition the distribution of flow patterns of a pitching foil and a heaving foil is almost same qualitatively leading edge vortex is also affected by the variation of amplitude the convection of leading edge vortex along the chord becomes faster and the strength of the vorticity increases with increasing plunging amplitude panah and buchholz 2012 besides the leading edge vortex becomes severer and the scale becomes larger with pitching amplitude increasing from 5 to 40 as investigated by xie et al 2014 the pitching or heaving plunging amplitude are also the crucial parameters affecting the hydrodynamic coefficients here we mainly focus on the thrust power coefficient and propulsive efficiency when other parameters are fixed the power imparted to oscillating a foil increases with pitching or heaving amplitude resulting a monotonic increase of the power coefficient the increase of pitching and heaving amplitudes cause to the thrust coefficient increasing to a maximum and then it begins to decrease because the thrust enhancement becomes negative for large amplitude cases the propulsive efficiency represents the ratio of the thrust power to the power input to the foil consequently the propulsive efficiency presents two different variation trends if the enhancement of thrust coefficient is more than that of power coefficient at low amplitudes the trend of propulsive efficiency is similar to that of thrust coefficient otherwise the propulsive efficiency decreases monotonically with increasing amplitudes however these general conclusions from the previous studies amiralaei et al 2010 lu et al 2013a b zaman et al 2014 das et al 2016 yu et al 2017 are not always true for thrust coefficient power coefficient and propulsive efficiency for instance small values of pitching amplitude Œ∏0 10 has small effect on propulsive efficiency mackowski and williamson 2015 thrust coefficient could continuously increase with heaving amplitude within a relatively large range h 0 c 1 5 ashraf et al 2012 power coefficient also can increase firstly and then decrease gradually with increasing pitching amplitude srigrarom and vincent 2008 the influence of pitching and heaving amplitudes on power extraction performance is very complex and there is no universal law therefore here we can only give some general rules based on the relevant studies if we want to reach the power extraction state a condition needs to be satisfied that the angle of attack induced by heaving motion must be smaller than the pitching angle which has been investigated by jones and platzer 1997 generally no matter for forced pitching and heaving or forced pitching and induced heaving motions the energy extraction efficiency contribution from pitching motion is quite limited and much smaller than that from heaving motion for forced pitching and heaving motion when other parameters are fixed the energy extraction efficiency increases with heaving amplitude at low range h 0 c 1 0 this law has been summarized by xiao and zhu 2014 for forced pitching and induced heaving motion when other parameters are fixed the energy extraction efficiency firstly increases monotonically with pitching amplitude and then reaches a peak after which it decreases with further increasing pitching amplitude particularly if reduced frequency k does not exceed 0 5 the pitching amplitude of the maximum efficiency should generally be located between 60 and 80 as shown in fig 21 a besides the optimal pitching amplitude decreases with gradually increasing k as shown in fig 21 b these rules can also be applied to forced pitching and heaving motions 4 4 three dimensional effect since the aero hydro foil in nature is always finite in spanwise length the results concluded under the assumption of infinite spanwise length or two dimensions are no longer applicable the hydrodynamic characteristics of an oscillating foil are significantly affected by the shape at its ends von ellenrieder et al 2003 and parker et al 2007 soria s team discussed the effect of amplitude and frequency of the oscillating foils with a finite aspect ratio on the structure of 3d vortices at low reynolds number re 164 through dye visualization and piv they concluded that due to the tip vortices of the foil the global vortices structure takes a great change which is completely different from that generated by the 2d foil as shown in fig 22 jardin et al 2012 studied the three dimensional effect of flow around a naca0012 airfoil with combined pitching and heaving motion and it revealed that the interaction between leading edge vortices and spanwise vortices were very strong green et al 2011 smits team used piv to analyze the 3d flow structure of the trapezoid with pure pitching motion this trapezoid foil was inspired by fish caudal fin the experiment suggested that inclined diversion edge can generate more complex tip vortices actually the generation of spanwise vortices and tip vortices are the main reason for making the flow structure of the 3d foil more complex compared with the 2d foil buchholz and smits 2008 found that thrust coefficient of the foil depends on both st and aspect ratio and the propulsion efficiency is sensitive to aspect ratio less than 0 83 in nature the reason why tuna can swim at a high speed for a long time in water is associated with its body structure zhu et al 2002 its body has low aspect ratio and good flexibility the interaction between vortices generated by the body of tuna and the fin results in two different propulsion modes high thrust mode and high propulsion efficiency mode simpson et al 2008 conducted experiments on a flapping foil with aspect ratios from 4 1 to 7 9 and found that the energy harvesting efficiency increases with increasing aspect ratio the maximum efficiency is 43 at an aspect ratio of 7 9 deng et al 2014 investigated the effect of aspect ratios from 1 to 8 on the energy harvesting efficiency of an oscillating foil using dns they pointed out that the three dimensional effect arises at aspect ratios less than 4 and too small aspect ratio can reduce energy harvesting efficiency kim et al 2017 used an oscillating hydrofoil with a rectangular cross section to carry out the experiment on energy harvesting performance at three different aspect ratios ar 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 they found that the total efficiency increases with aspect ratio over the parameter domain considered in their study which is similarly to the previous numerical work of kinsey and dumas 2012 and experimental work of simpson et al 2008 5 concluding remarks since the first observation of lift and thrust generated by a flapping winging by knoller 1909 and betz 1912 more and more attentions have been paid to the researches on the fluid dynamics of a flapping foil this paper performs a comprehensive review of the state of the art of aero hydrodynamics of the flapping foil firstly a brief description of the flapping foil is presented in terms of relevant parameters motion modes and research contents the contents of all the researches are roughly categorized into four different aspects flow structure hydrodynamic characteristics energy harvesting and bionics problems this section aims to promote an overall understanding of the flapping foil in this review bionics problems based on the flapping foils are not introduced too much but detailed summaries on fish swimming and birds flying are reviewed by rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 wu 2010 eloy 2012 and wang et al 2016b furthermore the papers in recent decades using experimental or numerical methods are reviewed environment and kinematic parameters and other geometric parameters of this part help clarify the settings of the research contents through the analysis of data a rough range of some influencing parameters involved in the flapping foil are also summarized and the results of experimental and numerical studies are compared with each other at last the common laws of reynolds number reduced frequency amplitude of foil motion and three dimensional effect are summarized respectively however there is no apparent law for these parameters on some problems such as the influence of motion amplitude on hydrodynamic coefficient and energy extraction efficiency it is worth noting that the relevant researches on energy extraction based on the flapping foil have been reviewed by peng and chen 2012 xiao and zhu 2014 young et al 2014 and rostami and armandei 2017 based on the review of a large amount of researches it seems that the researches on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the oscillating hydrofoil have been very thorough however many problems are still not completely understood such as how the flapping foil reversing k√°rm√°n street how drag becoming thrust and how to generate the optimal thrust propulsive efficiency and energy extraction efficiency from flow field this reminds us that we need to have an insight into these seemingly simple questions recently smits team found that the wake structures of swimmers have no connection with the integrated swimming performance floryan et al 2019 smits 2019 smits also summarized other five main conclusions from aspects of flexibility combined motions viscous effects aspect ratio and motion profiles which can improve our understanding of undulatory and oscillatory swimming smits 2019 hence the following directions are recommended for future research activities i due to the complexities of three dimensional flow the studies of foils are still focused on two dimensional structures at low or moderate reynolds number this has been far from the real applications where the effects of three dimensionality free stream turbulence and high reynolds numbers should be considered the foil always has limited aspect ratio so its flow mechanism could be more complex and its end effect may influence the performance of propulsion and energy extraction therefore a focus should be put on the study of flow characteristics of three dimensional oscillating foils and the simulations based on real environment parameters in future ii compared with rotary turbines the flapping foil designs have some advantages environment friendly and less noise simple structure and easy manufacture suitable for shallow water area eco friendly and less biological damage etc however a systematic comparison between the rotary systems and the flapping foil systems has not yet been investigated the apparently different wake structures may cause the differences in propulsion efficiency and energy harvesting efficiency the further researches can perform specific quantitative analysis between the two systems iii the majority of studies are concentrated on single foil devices a few works discussed the multiple foils in tandem or parallel configuration the energy harvesting efficiency of oscillating foils in tandem or parallel configuration has been investigated by kinsey and dumas 2012 and karbasian et al 2015 the propulsive performance of tandem flapping wings has been studied by akhtar et al 2007 gong et al 2015 gravish et al 2015 pan et al 2016 and muscutt et al 2017 in addition kumar and hu 2010 investigates flow structures in wakes of tandem flapping wings peng et al 2018a b studies the propulsion efficiency of two or more self propelled flapping flexible wings however all of above simulations are two dimensional models actually the idea of turbine farms can also be used on flapping foils designs moreover non sinusoidal oscillating motion structural flexibility and multiple foils can improve the efficiency the future researches can focus on the behavior of flapping flexible foil systems in non sinusoidal oscillating motion in large arrays iv the flapping foil designs are mostly inspired by flying birds and swimming fishes but there are still some secrets about them to be discovered for instance how birds drive their wings and how fishes flap their fins to generate high efficient thrust are not fully clear this requires more knowledge of three dimensional flow control mechanisms fluid structure interaction and the vortex structures the further researches can find out more specific explanations and resources from these animals for real applications v machine learning is one of the hottest topics at present and many fluid issues are solved in this advanced way ling et al 2016 use deep neural networks to develop reynolds stress closures for rans turbulence models wan and sapsis 2018 predict the trajectory of spherical particles in fluid flows through machine learning raissi et al 2019 use deep learning method to discuss the problems of vortex induced vibrations the further researches can attempt to use deep machine learning to make predictions for aero hydrodynamic force and wake structure of flapping foils in different flow environments with so many questions about flapping foils to be answered and explained the task can be imagined to be very arduous nevertheless an improved understanding of any aspect of the oscillating foil may have important implications for flow structure aero hydrodynamic performance and energy harvesting efficiency based on the foil acknowledgement

22232,collision between adjacent risers has become an important issue as the oil and gas industry moves to deeper waters in order to estimate the clearance between two marine risers a static analysis which is mainly concerned with the wake effects is performed in this paper a new wake model which is used to predict the wake flow around the downstream riser is developed based on prandtl s shearing stress hypothesis the wake effects with respect to riser interference in uniform current flow are then investigated in this work the two risers are both simplified as circular cylinders top tensioned and pinned at the bottom a procedure for iteratively predicting the wake velocity distribution and estimating the clearance between two risers is introduced to find the final convergent result by combining the new wake model with the global riser analysis software riflex the effects of different factors like riser spacing top tension force and current velocity are also studied the results indicate that these factors significantly influence the riser interference since the current velocity cannot in general be controlled for a specific site the riser spacing and the top tension force become the primary design parameters that can be chosen by the operator keywords top tensioned riser wake interference static analysis riser collision riser clearance nomenclature Œµ o c constants x

and production activities due to economical and practical considerations drilling and production risers on offshore platforms are commonly arranged in clusters with relatively close spacing riser collision is therefore more likely to occur for such compact arrangements than for more sparse system layouts this is illustrated in fig 1 a specifically wake interference plays an important role for assessment of the potential for collision between two risers which takes place when a downstream riser is located in the wake field of an upstream riser pipe the wake interference will change the flow around the downstream riser i e reducing the local flow velocity and consequently reduce the associated drag force this will also induce an additional lift force if the risers are arranged in a staggered configuration this effect in turn decreases the clearance between the adjacent risers and will accordingly imply a potential for collision between them this is illustrated by fig 1 b commonly there are two different design strategies for riser collision assessment according to dnv rp f203 2009 one is called no collision allowed which means that riser collision is not allowed under normal extreme or survival conditions another one is collision allowed which allow infrequent riser collision in some extreme conditions for the latter strategy although riser collision is unlikely to lead to a sudden failure one potential risk is that it can initiate the onset of fatigue failure from a long term point of view fu et al 2017 so for the present study a static analysis and clearance assessment based on the former strategy is considered in order to avoid riser collision and to prolong the operational lifetime of the risers this work is motivated by the industry need for effective toolkit to support design analysis of top tensioned risers ttrs which represent a crucial part of offshore facilities accurate prediction of wake interference can help to produce more robust structural design and lead to substantial savings in relation to offshore applications the problem of wake effects is addressed by different approaches which roughly can be categorized into one of three major groups experiments computational fluid dynamics cfd and analytical models during the last three decades significant advances have been made with respect to cfd and experimental studies assi et al 2006 kang 2003 sagatun et al 2002 sumner et al 1999 zdravkovich 1987 in relation to wake interference between risers a comprehensive literature review of these studies can be found in sumner 2010 in contrast substantially less efforts have been made in order to investigate analytical wake models which are of great significance to offshore engineering analytical wake models are represented by numerous approaches in order to model the wake field with some of them incorporating the boundary layer equation as the governing analysis component with respect to theoretical analysis tollmien and miner 1931 considered the problem of finding the first approximation to the asymptotic form of the two dimensional wake field far behind a flat plate goldstein 1933 found the next approximation to the far wake solution of tollmien based on the ossen approximation the nature of two dimensional wakes behind circular cylinder were first studied by schlichting and gersten 1979 who solved the equations of motion in a wake by use of different mixing theories after l prandtl by assuming two dimensional motion neglecting viscous stress and holding the pressure constant through the fluid schlichting set up an expression to describe the wake behind a cylinder the expression is found to be in good agreement with experimental data however this solution just constituted an approximation which is only valid for very large distances behind the cylinder i e x c d d 50 close to the upstream cylinder the expression will give a wake peak which is quite high and narrow and will lead to erroneous results when trying to calculate the force acting on a second body placed in the wake another analytical model proposed by reichardt 1941 expresses the deficit velocity behind a circular cylinder as a function of the distance from the center which also gives good agreement with the experimental data in the far field wake schlichting and gersten 1979 it is noticed that the analytical model respectively presented by schlichting and reichardt is tailored to circular cylinder and only valid for far wake investigation huse and muren 1987 first applied the wake model to the problem of marine riser interaction later the semi empirical approach to wake effect was further studied by huse 1992 who modified reichardt s model by assuming that the wake field behind a circular cylinder is generated by a virtual source which is located at the upstream of the first cylinder this is known as the huse wake model blevins 2005 developed a method by introduction of mean drag and lift force on the downstream riser as a function of the relative distance between two risers the reichardt s expression of deficit velocity at the cylinder center is directly used in the blevins model with the assumption that the drag force on the downstream cylinder in the wake is proportional to the local dynamic pressure evaluated at its center the blevins model can be regarded as a transformation of reichardt s model but with different constants which are obtained by correlating price s 1975 price and paidoussis 1984 experimental data within the framework of reichardt s model currently the huse model and the blevins model are the most commonly used wake model for analysis in relation to riser interference wu et al 2002 investigated the mean lift and drag forces on a cylinder placed in the wake of another upstream cylinder as well as the influence of these forces on the stability of the downstream cylinder and the huse model was used to determine the wake field huang 2010 studied the instability of a vertical riser in the wake of an upstream vertical riser by using the huse model to estimate the mean wake flow velocity at the downstream riser in the works by fu et al 2017 and fu et al 2018 the huse model and the blevins model were both used to investigate the collision probability for flexible risers subjected to current and waves existing tools for riser analysis like orcaflex and flexcom are still using the huse model and the blevins model as the major analytical models to support riser interference analysis in spite of these significant research efforts in relation to analytical wake models more work is still required within this area the virtual source position introduced in the huse model is basically given based on engineering experiences but with an insufficient theoretical foundation which leads to the estimated results being amplified in the near wake as the blevins model is directly derived from the reichardt model the deficit of reichardt model is not eliminated moreover the parameters in the blevins model are obtained by fitting the reichardt s formula only with price s published data this makes the blevins model possibly invalid when the temporal conditions are significantly different from the price s experimental data therefore in this paper we propose a new effective wake model which is intended to fill this gap the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section the traditional models are briefly introduced and compared subsequently the new wake model is developed here it is shown how the mean wake velocity is deduced from the boundary layer equations by using tollmien s first approximation method and goldstein s second approximation method the model is then calibrated using different published experimental data and cfd results in the subsequent section a detailed procedure for predicting the wake velocity distribution and estimating the clearance between two marine risers iteratively is introduced in order to find the final static displacement of the two risers the fluid forces are calculated using the morison equation the lift force acting on the downstream riser is neglected due to the risers being arranged in tandem a case study is performed by incorporating the new wake model into the global riser analysis software riflex sintef 2017 special attention is paid to the effect of wake models on the static analysis results and the sensitivity factors with respect to riser systems are also investigated finally some concluding remarks are given 2 wake interference 2 1 the huse model according to reichardt 1941 the local flow velocity behind a cylinder can be expressed as 1 u x y u 1 0 95 c d u d u x e x p y 2 0 08888 c d u d u x where u x y is the time averaged local flow velocity in the wake field u is the free stream velocity c d u is the drag coefficient based on free stream velocity d u is the diameter of the upstream cylinder the origin of the local coordinate system is located at the center of the cylinder with the x axis pointing the incoming flow direction and the y axis in the transverse direction huse 1992 proposed a concept of vitural source to improve reichardt s formula in huse s opinion the wake field generated by a circular cylinder can approximately be replaced by a virtual cylinder located at somewhere upstream of the real cylinder the center of the virtual cylinder namely the virtual source is located at x v away in front of the center of the real cylinder where x v 4 d u c d u this definition make sure that the wake width at the real cylinder center is exactly equal to the cylinder diameter hence the local flow velocity u x y can be determined by using the modified distance x s x x v instead of x in eq 1 which can be expressed as 2 u x y u 1 c d u d u x 4 d u c d u e x p 11 26 y 2 c d u d u x 4 d u c d u it should be noticed that some constants are changed compared with eq 1 2 2 the blevins model blevins 2005 pointed out that the drag force on a cylinder in a wake is proportional to the local dynamic pressure evaluated at its center therefore the variation of the local flow velocity behind a cylinder can be translated to the variation of the drag coefficient of the downstream riser which can be expressed as 3 f d d 1 2 œÅ d d c d d o u x y 2 1 2 œÅ d d c d d o u 2 u x y u 2 1 2 œÅ d d u 2 c d d x y so 4 c d d x y c d d o u x y u 2 where c d d o is the reference drag coefficient for the downstream cylinder in the free stream velocity u c d d x y is the downstream cylinder drag coefficient based on its local flow velocity u x y inserting eq 1 into eq 4 this becomes 5 c d d x y c d d o 1 a 1 c d u d d x e x p a 2 y 2 c d u d d x 2 where a 1 1 a 2 4 5 are determined by fitting method as mentioned in the previous section the blevins model also contains the expression of the inward lift force on the downstream cylinder see eq 6 towards the wake center line which is proportional to the transverse gradient of the drag force in the present study the downstream riser is placed at the wake center line then the lift force on the downstream riser can be neglected since the lift force is equal to zero when inserting y 0 into eq 6 6 c l d x y a 3 y c d d o d d x c d u d u c d u d u x 1 a 1 c d u d u x e x p a 2 y 2 c d u d u x e x p a 2 y 2 c d u d u x where a 3 10 6 c l d x y is the lift coefficient based on its local flow velocity u x y 2 3 second approximation based wake model all wake models described so far are deduced through blasiu method which only gives a first approximation solution for large x in this subsection a new wake model is developed by a second approximation method aims at improving the prediction of the wake in the intermediate field between the very near wake and the far wake a schematic layout of the two dimensional wake flow downstream of a riser with outside diameter d is shown in fig 2 the free stream velocity of the steady flow u is assumed to be expressed as 7 u u x y u x y where u x y and u x y are the time averaged wake velocity and the deficit velocity at any point p x y in the downstream wake area respectively as stated by schlichting and gersten 1979 in the case of steady flow the prandtl s boundary layer equations can be simplified into 8 u x v y 0 u u x œÖ 2 u y 2 u u x v u y with the following boundary conditions 9 y 0 u v 0 y u u where v is the time averaged transverse wake velocity œÖ is the laminar kinematic viscosity of the fluid the pressure distribution is assumed to be constant in the downstream flow according to tollmien s 1931 first approximation method and goldstein s 1933 second approximation method an iteration scheme is then set up in which the n th term is related to the n 1 th approximation by the equations 10 u n x v n y 0 u u n x œÖ 2 u n y 2 u n 1 u n 1 x v n 1 u n 1 y where the velocity components are given by u u 1 u 2 u n v v 1 v 2 v n u 0 v 0 0 by keeping the terms up to the second order the following is obtained 11 u u 1 u 2 eq 10 can be written as eq 12 when n 1 12 u 1 x v 1 y 0 u u 1 x œÖ 2 u 1 y 2 with the boundary conditions 13 y 0 u 1 y 0 y u 1 0 the expression for the first term of the deficit velocity u 1 can then be expressed as in eq 14 by solving eq 12 with more details of the solution process being shown in appendix a 14 u 1 u Œ± c d 1 2 x d 1 2 e x p 4 œÄ Œ± 2 c d

velocity u 2 can be expressed by eq 16 which is obtained by solving eq 15 more details of the solution process is shown in appendix b 16 u 2 u Œ± 2 2 c d x d 1 e x p 4 œÄ Œ± 2 Œ≤ c d 1 x d 1 y d 2 the expression for the time averaged streamwise wake velocity is then given on the following form by combining eq 7 11 14 16 17 u u 1 u 1 u u 2 u 1 Œ± c d 1 2 x d 1 2 e x p 4 œÄ Œ± 2 c d 1 x d 1 y d 2 Œ±

the results are Œ± 0 55 Œ≤ 8 3 at large distances this applied second order approximation method does not make much difference when calculating the wake field however it makes a significant difference for the wake field in the proximity of the upstream riser 2 4 calibration and discussion in order to validate the presented model comparison is made with published results that are obtained by means of both numerical breuer 2000 kravchenko and moin 2000 richter et al 2012 prsic et al 2014 and experimental cantwell and coles 1983 lyn et al 1995 lourenco and shih 1993 methods marine risers are subjected to current which implies that the corresponding reynolds numbers typically are in the range from 103 to 107 this is precisely the range which is covered by the published data sets which are selected the non dimensional time averaged velocity at different reynolds number r e 3 9 10 3 1 31 10 4 2 2 10 4 1 4 10 5 along the center line of the wake is shown in fig 3 the non dimensional time averaged stream wise velocity profiles predicted by different models at various x d for r e 3 9 10 3 and r e 1 4 10 5 are illustrated in fig 4 in addition the corresponding reference drag coefficients used in the wake models for different reynolds number are shown in table 1 fig 3 shows the non dimensional center line wake velocity u u calculated by the three models versus the horizontal distance x for y 0 from fig 3 a to fig 3 d it appears that the models tend to have the same asymptotic behavior in the far wake field the difference is that the blevins model gives a smaller wake velocity compared with the measured data this is not unexpected due to that the blevins model being directly derived from the reichard model which already has this kind of limitation in the near wake field unlike the blevins model the prediction results calculated by the huse model are slightly larger than those for the blevins model this is because the origin in the huse model is not the same as in the other two models which assumed that the wake profile is generated by another virtual cylinder in front of the one at the origin to some degree this will induce the prediction of the huse model closer to the physical reality actually the huse model would inevitably exaggerate the predictions in the near wake domain approximately when x 2d as indicated in fig 3 which would then reduce the model sensitivity during the static riser analysis as discussed in section 4 2 1 below in contrast the results calculated by our proposed model shows a good agreement with the published data although there is a small deviation for the very near wake domain when re is comparatively low e g re 3900 as shown in fig 3 a the reason is that at distances less than 2 3 times the diameter of the upstream cylinder the wake interference becomes complex with negative suction force involved which may reduce the accuracy of the model prediction fig 4 illustrates the non dimensional stream wise wake velocity predicted by the three models versus perpendicular distance y d for different combinations of x d from fig 4 compared with the cfd results the huse model gives a wider wake and larger wake velocity in the near wake field e g x d 1 0 2 02 but a wider wake and smaller u u when x d increase to 3 10 which exactly coincide with the feature of the huse model as illustrated in fig 3 similarly the blevins model gives a wider wake and a much smaller local flow velocity it could be found that the model developed in this study also shows a good agreement with the published cfd data except in the very near wake domain for r e 3 9 10 3 in general it can be observed from figs 3 and 4 that the wake model proposed in this work is more compatible with the experimental and numerical data compared with the huse model and the blevins model this conclusion particularly applies to the moderate near wake field 2 d x 10 d 3 application of the model 3 1 force on the downstream riser the wake velocity distribution can be computed more accurately by using the wake model which was developed in the previous section however the problem is that the properties of the wake field vary over the area occupied by the downstream riser in order to solve this problem huse 1992 the root mean square rms value i e u r m s x y averaged over the cross section area of the riser is used for calculating the drag force the lift force is ignored since the downstream riser is located at the centerline of the wake this implies that 18 u r m s x y 1 œÄ r 2 r r r 2 x 2 r 2 x 2 u 2 x y d x d y 1 2 where r is the radius of the downstream riser therefore the current force i e the drag force acting on the unit length of downstream riser can be calculated by the morison equation as 19 f d 1 2 œÅ d c d u r m s 2 the presented model could also be applied to analysis of the entire riser array analysis by summing the wake contributions from all the upstream risers 3 2 the mathematical calculation procedure the static performance of a system comprising two adjacent risers subjected to an uniform current is studied by combining the global riser analysis software riflex sintef 2017 with the presented wake model riflex is particularly designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of risers and other slender marine structures but without considering wake effect as part of the flow field representation which is particularly relevant for analysis of riser interferences it is clearly seen from eq 19 that the drag force acting on the downstream riser depends strongly on the rms wake velocity which however is a function of the distance between the two risers hence the drag force will vary along the downstream riser due to the deformation of the upstream riser and the corresponding altered wake profile in order to study this effect the two risers are divided into numerous segments the downstream wake profile is first established by calculating the relative distance between each pair of riser segments for the purpose of determining the static equilibrium configuration of the double riser system a modified iteration procedure fu et al 2017 is hence introduced as follows 1 calculate the vertical downstream wake profile u d i based on the initial configuration of the double riser system 2 perform a static analysis by updating the downstream wake profile in riflex and calculated the average distance between each pair of riser segments i e x i 3 calculate u d i 1 according to the new x i 4 repeat steps 2 3 until a convergent result is obtained the entire framework for static analysis is summarized in fig 5 the flow field around the upstream riser is assumed to be steady which implies that it will not be influenced by the deflection of the downstream riser in addition the drag coefficients for both risers are taken to be constant in time due to their stable values except for conditions where reynolds number changes significantly 4 case study 4 1 description of riser system in order to illustrate the analysis procedure an actual deep water drilling and producing platform is taken as an example a system of two adjacent top tensioned risers is considered in the present section and these are shown in fig 6 each riser is top tensioned by six tensioners the water depth is h 300 m the fluid density and the fluid kinematic viscosity is 1025 g c m 3 and 1 188 10 6 m 2 s respectively a uniform current profile is applied as basis for the analysis this profile corresponds to a constant velocity throughout the water depth of h 100 m which is acting in the direction of x axis for simplicity no additional auxiliary components such as attached lines or buoyancy elements are included in the model accordingly both of the risers are modeled as circular steel pipes with constant diameter both risers are fixed in translation at both the top and the bottom ends detailed properties of each riser are given in table 2 sensitivity analyses of the riser displacements are performed with respect to key parameters such as current velocity u riser spacing l and riser top tension coefficient t which is defined as t r i s e r t o p t e n s i o n r i s e r t o t a l s u b m e r g e d w e i g h t 4 2 results and discussion the static equilibrium configurations of the two risers are illustrated in fig 7 by using different wake models with varying current velocity u 0 7 1 25 m s varying top tension coefficients t 1 2 1 8 and varying initial riser spacing l 3 5 6 2m comparing to the deformed configuration of the upstream riser it is seen that the deflection of the downstream riser is significantly decreased due to the effect of the wake interference hence a more accurate and efficient wake prediction model is very important in relation to assessment of riser interference 4 2 1 assessment of wake models fig 7 a provides a brief comparison of static displacement shapes obtained by using different wake models which includes the huse model the blevins model and the wake model presented in the present study the spacing between two risers which both are top tensioned at a level corresponding to a coefficient of 1 5 is set to be 6 2 m the environmental current velocity is 1 2 m s which corresponds to a quite extreme condition the results calculated by application of blevins model indicate that this particular combination of riser spacing of l 6 2m and top tension coefficient of t 1 5 is not safe when subjected to a uniform current of magnitude u 1 2 m s however there is still a sufficiently large distance between the risers when using the other two wake models even at the most critical water depth of about h 100 m thus it appears that blevins model is much more conservative than the other two wake models the huse model performs well when the spacing between the risers has a high value or when the magnitude of the current velocity is low this is due to its particular correction method nevertheless as shown in fig 3 the velocities calculated by application of the huse model are always high even in the very near wake domain where it should have a low value this implies that the huse model is more insensitive in the case of extreme conditions during which collision is about to take place this poses a potential risk if the design parameters are based on the huse model on the contrary fig 3 illustrates that the results calculated by present model are lower than those for the huse model in the very near domain while they are a little bit higher when the distance is large this is exactly what is required which implies that the present model is more sensitive with respect to finding the critical conditions for riser collision consequently the following three main influencing factors are all studied based on the model presented in the present work 4 2 2 current velocity when the riser spacing and other properties are kept constant then the risk of collision will increase with increasing current velocity as shown in fig 7 b the riser spacing and top tension coefficient is set to be l 5m t 1 5 respectively the current profile is simplified to a uniform current which increases in magnitude from u 0 7 m s to u 1 25 m s in spite of the static equilibrium deflection for both risers are gradually increasing for increasing current velocity the increasing amplitude of the upstream riser is evidently larger than the downstream one this will continuously reduce the minimum clearance between two risers until contact between the risers takes place the critical current velocity is approximately equal to 1 25 m s with this particular combination of riser spacing and top tension coefficient the current velocity has a great impact on the riser clearance but this is a parameter which is given by the environment and as basically beyond the control of the designers or operators once a particular site has been selected 4 2 3 riser top tension in order to find the critical top tension coefficient the current velocity and the initial riser spacing are kept constant with u 1 0 m s and l 4 5m the top tension coefficient is then reduced from 1 8 to 1 2 step by step and the results from the calculations are shown in fig 7 c generally it appears that the top tension has a great influence on the upstream riser the clearance between the two risers is evidently decreasing when reducing the top tension coefficient finally the collision may occur when top tension coefficient goes down to 1 2 the top tension coefficient is a more flexible design parameter than riser spacing and it can be changed manually during the process of drilling or production however a too high top tension may overload the tensioner system as well as the riser itself due to the associated high stresses 4 2 4 riser spacing in order to find the critical riser spacing the current velocity and the top tension coefficient are kept constant with u 1 0 m s and t 1 5 while the riser spacing is reduced from 5 0 m step by step the results of the calculations are shown in fig 7 d it can be observed that the deformation of the downstream riser decreases significantly when the riser spacing is reduced of course the corresponding clearance variation clearly exhibits the same trend for the present conditions the critical riser spacing is found to be closer to 3 5 m riser spacing is one of the most important design parameters for drilling or producing platform systems riser collision can be efficiently prevented by increasing the riser spacing nevertheless it should be noticed that increasing the riser spacing directly means increasing the size of the wellbay which will result in significant cost penalties 5 conclusions consideration of wake interference is of great significance for the static analysis of riser interaction and potential for collision in the present work static deflections of two top tensioned marine risers arranged in tandem are investigated a new effective wake model for circular cylinders is developed based on solving prandtl s boundary layer equations by using the tollmien s first approximation method and the goldstein s second approximation method comparison of the results among the three models indicates that the local flow velocity in the near wake domain will be over estimated by the huse model but underestimated by the blevins model hence the huse model is relatively insensitive in this domain and blevins model tend to be conservative it is demonstrated that the new model proposed in this work has a good stability and reliability when predicting the wake profile in the critical reynolds region this applies in particular when it is applied to calculate the critical conditions associated with riser collision problems for the no collision allowed strategy a calculation procedure is presented which enables determination of the pairwise static equilibrium configuration of risers by combining the global riser analysis software riflex and the new wake model our analysis through a case study shows that the both the riser spacing and the top tension coefficient have a significant influence on the likelihood of riser interference therefore optimal combination of these two parameters should primarily be considered in order to avoid riser collision it should be noted here that although an improved analytical wake model is proposed on this study in the future a development of some type of optimization procedure for the very near wake domain x 2d would be beneficial an accurate estimation of the transverse flow velocity for predicting the lift force on the staggered arranged downstream riser has to be provided and is also planned as part of future work acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the

22232,collision between adjacent risers has become an important issue as the oil and gas industry moves to deeper waters in order to estimate the clearance between two marine risers a static analysis which is mainly concerned with the wake effects is performed in this paper a new wake model which is used to predict the wake flow around the downstream riser is developed based on prandtl s shearing stress hypothesis the wake effects with respect to riser interference in uniform current flow are then investigated in this work the two risers are both simplified as circular cylinders top tensioned and pinned at the bottom a procedure for iteratively predicting the wake velocity distribution and estimating the clearance between two risers is introduced to find the final convergent result by combining the new wake model with the global riser analysis software riflex the effects of different factors like riser spacing top tension force and current velocity are also studied the results indicate that these factors significantly influence the riser interference since the current velocity cannot in general be controlled for a specific site the riser spacing and the top tension force

and production activities due to economical and practical considerations drilling and production risers on offshore platforms are commonly arranged in clusters with relatively close spacing riser collision is therefore more likely to occur for such compact arrangements than for more sparse system layouts this is illustrated in fig 1 a specifically wake interference plays an important role for assessment of the potential for collision between two risers which takes place when a downstream riser is located in the wake field of an upstream riser pipe the wake interference will change the flow around the downstream riser i e reducing the local flow velocity and consequently reduce the associated drag force this will also induce an additional lift force if the risers are arranged in a staggered configuration this effect in turn decreases the clearance between the adjacent risers and will accordingly imply a potential for collision between them this is illustrated by fig 1 b commonly there are two different design strategies for riser collision assessment according to dnv rp f203 2009 one is called no collision allowed which means that riser collision is not allowed under normal extreme or survival conditions another one is collision allowed which allow infrequent riser collision in some extreme conditions for the latter strategy although riser collision is unlikely to lead to a sudden failure one potential risk is that it can initiate the onset of fatigue failure from a long term point of view fu et al 2017 so for the present study a static analysis and clearance assessment based on the former strategy is considered in order to avoid riser collision and to prolong the operational lifetime of the risers this work is motivated by the industry need for effective toolkit to support design analysis of top tensioned risers ttrs which represent a crucial part of offshore facilities accurate prediction of wake interference can help to produce more robust structural design and lead to substantial savings in relation to offshore applications the problem of wake effects is addressed by different approaches which roughly can be categorized into one of three major groups experiments computational fluid dynamics cfd and analytical models during the last three decades significant advances have been made with respect to cfd and experimental studies assi et al 2006 kang 2003 sagatun et al 2002 sumner et al 1999 zdravkovich 1987 in relation to wake interference between risers a comprehensive literature review of these studies can be found in sumner 2010 in contrast substantially less efforts have been made in order to investigate analytical wake models which are of great significance to offshore engineering analytical wake models are represented by numerous approaches in order to model the wake field with some of them incorporating the boundary layer equation as the governing analysis component with respect to theoretical analysis tollmien and miner 1931 considered the problem of finding the first approximation to the asymptotic form of the two dimensional wake field far behind a flat plate goldstein 1933 found the next approximation to the far wake solution of tollmien based on the ossen approximation the nature of two dimensional wakes behind circular cylinder were first studied by schlichting and gersten 1979 who solved the equations of motion in a wake by use of different mixing theories after l prandtl by assuming two dimensional motion neglecting viscous stress and holding the pressure constant through the fluid schlichting set up an expression to describe the wake behind a cylinder the expression is found to be in good agreement with experimental data however this solution just constituted an approximation which is only valid for very large distances behind the cylinder i e x c d d 50 close to the upstream cylinder the expression will give a wake peak which is quite high and narrow and will lead to erroneous results when trying to calculate the force acting on a second body placed in the wake another analytical model proposed by reichardt 1941 expresses the deficit velocity behind a circular cylinder as a function of the distance from the center which also gives good agreement with the experimental data in the far field wake schlichting and gersten 1979 it is noticed that the analytical model respectively presented by schlichting and reichardt is tailored to circular cylinder and only valid for far wake investigation huse and muren 1987 first applied the wake model to the problem of marine riser interaction later the semi empirical approach to wake effect was further studied by huse 1992 who modified reichardt s model by assuming that the wake field behind a circular cylinder is generated by a virtual source which is located at the upstream of the first cylinder this is known as the huse wake model blevins 2005 developed a method by introduction of mean drag and lift force on the downstream riser as a function of the relative distance between two risers the reichardt s expression of deficit velocity at the cylinder center is directly used in the blevins model with the assumption that the drag force on the downstream cylinder in the wake is proportional to the local dynamic pressure evaluated at its center the blevins model can be regarded as a transformation of reichardt s model but with different constants which are obtained by correlating price s 1975 price and paidoussis 1984 experimental data within the framework of reichardt s model currently the huse model and the blevins model are the most commonly used wake model for analysis in relation to riser interference wu et al 2002 investigated the mean lift and drag forces on a cylinder placed in the wake of another upstream cylinder as well as the influence of these forces on the stability of the downstream cylinder and the huse model was used to determine the wake field huang 2010 studied the instability of a vertical riser in the wake of an upstream vertical riser by using the huse model to estimate the mean wake flow velocity at the downstream riser in the works by fu et al 2017 and fu et al 2018 the huse model and the blevins model were both used to investigate the collision probability for flexible risers subjected to current and waves existing tools for riser analysis like orcaflex and flexcom are still using the huse model and the blevins model as the major analytical models to support riser interference analysis in spite of these significant research efforts in relation to analytical wake models more work is still required within this area the virtual source position introduced in the huse model is basically given based on engineering experiences but with an insufficient theoretical foundation which leads to the estimated results being amplified in the near wake as the blevins model is directly derived from the reichardt model the deficit of reichardt model is not eliminated moreover the parameters in the blevins model are obtained by fitting the reichardt s formula only with price s published data this makes the blevins model possibly invalid when the temporal conditions are significantly different from the price s experimental data therefore in this paper we propose a new effective wake model which is intended to fill this gap the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section the traditional models are briefly introduced and compared subsequently the new wake model is developed here it is shown how the mean wake velocity is deduced from the boundary layer equations by using tollmien s first approximation method and goldstein s second approximation method the model is then calibrated using different published experimental data and cfd results in the subsequent section a detailed procedure for predicting the wake velocity distribution and estimating the clearance between two marine risers iteratively is introduced in order to find the final static displacement of the two risers the fluid forces are calculated using the morison equation the lift force acting on the downstream riser is neglected due to the risers being arranged in tandem a case study is performed by incorporating the new wake model into the global riser analysis software riflex sintef 2017 special attention is paid to the effect of wake models on the static analysis results and the sensitivity factors with respect to riser systems are also investigated finally some concluding remarks are given 2 wake interference 2 1 the huse model according to reichardt 1941 the local flow velocity behind a cylinder can be expressed as 1 u x y u 1 0 95 c d u d u x e x p y 2 0 08888 c d u d u x where u x y is the time averaged local flow velocity in the wake field u is the free stream velocity c d u is the drag coefficient based on free stream velocity d u is the diameter of the upstream cylinder the origin of the local coordinate system is located at the center of the cylinder with the x axis pointing the incoming flow direction and the y axis in the transverse direction huse 1992 proposed a concept of vitural source to improve reichardt s formula in huse s opinion the wake field generated by a circular cylinder can approximately be replaced by a virtual cylinder located at somewhere upstream of the real cylinder the center of the virtual cylinder namely the virtual source is located at x v away in front of the center of the real cylinder where x v 4 d u c d u this definition make sure that the wake width at the real cylinder center is exactly equal to the cylinder diameter hence the local flow velocity u x y can be determined by using the modified distance x s x x v instead of x in eq 1 which can be expressed as 2 u x y u 1 c d u d u x 4 d u c d u e x p 11 26 y 2 c d u d u x 4 d u c d u it should be noticed that some constants are changed compared with eq 1 2 2 the blevins model blevins 2005 pointed out that the drag force on a cylinder in a wake is proportional to the local dynamic pressure evaluated at its center therefore the variation of the local flow velocity behind a cylinder can be translated to the variation of the drag coefficient of the downstream riser which can be expressed as 3 f d d 1 2 œÅ d d c d d o u x y 2 1 2 œÅ d d c d d o u 2 u x y u 2 1 2 œÅ d d u 2 c d d x y so 4 c d d x y c d d o u x y u 2 where c d d o is the reference drag coefficient for the downstream cylinder in the free stream velocity u c d d x y is the downstream cylinder drag coefficient based on its local flow velocity u x y inserting eq 1 into eq 4 this becomes 5 c d d x y c d d o 1 a 1 c d u d d x e x p a 2 y 2 c d u d d x 2 where a 1 1 a 2 4 5 are determined by fitting method as mentioned in the previous section the blevins model also contains the expression of the inward lift force on the downstream cylinder see eq 6 towards the wake center line which is proportional to the transverse gradient of the drag force in the present study the downstream riser is placed at the wake center line then the lift force on the downstream riser can be neglected since the lift force is equal to zero when inserting y 0 into eq 6 6 c l d x y a 3 y c d d o d d x c d u d u c d u d u x 1 a 1 c d u d u x e x p a 2 y 2 c d u d u x e x p a 2 y 2 c d u d u x where a 3 10 6 c l d x y is the lift coefficient based on its local flow velocity u x y 2 3 second approximation based wake model all wake models described so far are deduced through blasiu method which only gives a first approximation solution for large x in this subsection a new wake model is developed by a second approximation method aims at improving the prediction of the wake in the intermediate field between the very near wake and the far wake a schematic layout of the two dimensional wake flow downstream of a riser with outside diameter d is shown in fig 2 the free stream velocity of the steady flow u is assumed to be expressed as 7 u u x y u x y where u x y and u x y are the time averaged wake velocity and the deficit velocity at any point p x y in the downstream wake area respectively as stated by schlichting and gersten 1979 in the case of steady flow the prandtl s boundary layer equations can be simplified into 8 u x v y 0 u u x œÖ 2 u y 2 u u x v u y with the following boundary conditions 9 y 0 u v 0 y u u where v is the time averaged transverse wake velocity œÖ is the laminar kinematic viscosity of the fluid the pressure distribution is assumed to be constant in the downstream flow according to tollmien s 1931 first approximation method and goldstein s 1933 second approximation method an iteration scheme is then set up in which the n th term is related to the n 1 th approximation by the equations 10 u n x v n y 0 u u n x œÖ 2 u n y 2 u n 1 u n 1 x v n 1 u n 1 y where the velocity components are given by u u 1 u 2 u n v v 1 v 2 v n u 0 v 0 0 by keeping the terms up to the second order the following is obtained 11 u u 1 u 2 eq 10 can be written as eq 12 when n 1 12 u 1 x v 1 y 0 u u 1 x œÖ 2 u 1 y 2 with the boundary conditions 13 y 0 u 1 y 0 y u 1 0 the expression for the first term of the deficit velocity u 1 can then be expressed as in eq 14 by solving eq 12 with more details of the solution process being shown in appendix a 14 u 1 u Œ± c d 1 2 x d 1 2 e x p 4 œÄ Œ± 2 c d

velocity u 2 can be expressed by eq 16 which is obtained by solving eq 15 more details of the solution process is shown in appendix b 16 u 2 u Œ± 2 2 c d x d 1 e x p 4 œÄ Œ± 2 Œ≤ c d 1 x d 1 y d 2 the expression for the time averaged streamwise wake velocity is then given on the following form by combining eq 7 11 14 16 17 u u 1 u 1 u u 2 u 1 Œ± c d 1 2 x d 1 2 e x p 4 œÄ Œ± 2 c d 1 x d 1 y d 2 Œ±

the results are Œ± 0 55 Œ≤ 8 3 at large distances this applied second order approximation method does not make much difference when calculating the wake field however it makes a significant difference for the wake field in the proximity of the upstream riser 2 4 calibration and discussion in order to validate the presented model comparison is made with published results that are obtained by means of both numerical breuer 2000 kravchenko and moin 2000 richter et al 2012 prsic et al 2014 and experimental cantwell and coles 1983 lyn et al 1995 lourenco and shih 1993 methods marine risers are subjected to current which implies that the corresponding reynolds numbers typically are in the range from 103 to 107 this is precisely the range which is covered by the published data sets which are selected the non dimensional time averaged velocity at different reynolds number r e 3 9 10 3 1 31 10 4 2 2 10 4 1 4 10 5 along the center line of the wake is shown in fig 3 the non dimensional time averaged stream wise velocity profiles predicted by different models at various x d for r e 3 9 10 3 and r e 1 4 10 5 are illustrated in fig 4 in addition the corresponding reference drag coefficients used in the wake models for different reynolds number are shown in table 1 fig 3 shows the non dimensional center line wake velocity u u calculated by the three models versus the horizontal distance x for y 0 from fig 3 a to fig 3 d it appears that the models tend to have the same asymptotic behavior in the far wake field the difference is that the blevins model gives a smaller wake velocity compared with the measured data this is not unexpected due to that the blevins model being directly derived from the reichard model which already has this kind of limitation in the near wake field unlike the blevins model the prediction results calculated by the huse model are slightly larger than those for the blevins model this is because the origin in the huse model is not the same as in the other two models which assumed that the wake profile is generated by another virtual cylinder in front of the one at the origin to some degree this will induce the prediction of the huse model closer to the physical reality actually the huse model would inevitably exaggerate the predictions in the near wake domain approximately when x 2d as indicated in fig 3 which would then reduce the model sensitivity during the static riser analysis as discussed in section 4 2 1 below in contrast the results calculated by our proposed model shows a good agreement with the published data although there is a small deviation for the very near wake domain when re is comparatively low e g re 3900 as shown in fig 3 a the reason is that at distances less than 2 3 times the diameter of the upstream cylinder the wake interference becomes complex with negative suction force involved which may reduce the accuracy of the model prediction fig 4 illustrates the non dimensional stream wise wake velocity predicted by the three models versus perpendicular distance y d for different combinations of x d from fig 4 compared with the cfd results the huse model gives a wider wake and larger wake velocity in the near wake field e g x d 1 0 2 02 but a wider wake and smaller u u when x d increase to 3 10 which exactly coincide with the feature of the huse model as illustrated in fig 3 similarly the blevins model gives a wider wake and a much smaller local flow velocity it could be found that the model developed in this study also shows a good agreement with the published cfd data except in the very near wake domain for r e 3 9 10 3 in general it can be observed from figs 3 and 4 that the wake model proposed in this work is more compatible with the experimental and numerical data compared with the huse model and the blevins model this conclusion particularly applies to the moderate near wake field 2 d x 10 d 3 application of the model 3 1 force on the downstream riser the wake velocity distribution can be computed more accurately by using the wake model which was developed in the previous section however the problem is that the properties of the wake field vary over the area occupied by the downstream riser in order to solve this problem huse 1992 the root mean square rms value i e u r m s x y averaged over the cross section area of the riser is used for calculating the drag force the lift force is ignored since the downstream riser is located at the centerline of the wake this implies that 18 u r m s x y 1 œÄ r 2 r r r 2 x 2 r 2 x 2 u 2 x y d x d y 1 2 where r is the radius of the downstream riser therefore the current force i e the drag force acting on the unit length of downstream riser can be calculated by the morison equation as 19 f d 1 2 œÅ d c d u r m s 2 the presented model could also be applied to analysis of the entire riser array analysis by summing the wake contributions from all the upstream risers 3 2 the mathematical calculation procedure the static performance of a system comprising two adjacent risers subjected to an uniform current is studied by combining the global riser analysis software riflex sintef 2017 with the presented wake model riflex is particularly designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of risers and other slender marine structures but without considering wake effect as part of the flow field representation which is particularly relevant for analysis of riser interferences it is clearly seen from eq 19 that the drag force acting on the downstream riser depends strongly on the rms wake velocity which however is a function of the distance between the two risers hence the drag force will vary along the downstream riser due to the deformation of the upstream riser and the corresponding altered wake profile in order to study this effect the two risers are divided into numerous segments the downstream wake profile is first established by calculating the relative distance between each pair of riser segments for the purpose of determining the static equilibrium configuration of the double riser system a modified iteration procedure fu et al 2017 is hence introduced as follows 1 calculate the vertical downstream wake profile u d i based on the initial configuration of the double riser system 2 perform a static analysis by updating the downstream wake profile in riflex and calculated the average distance between each pair of riser segments i e x i 3 calculate u d i 1 according to the new x i 4 repeat steps 2 3 until a convergent result is obtained the entire framework for static analysis is summarized in fig 5 the flow field around the upstream riser is assumed to be steady which implies that it will not be influenced by the deflection of the downstream riser in addition the drag coefficients for both risers are taken to be constant in time due to their stable values except for conditions where reynolds number changes significantly 4 case study 4 1 description of riser system in order to illustrate the analysis procedure an actual deep water drilling and producing platform is taken as an example a system of two adjacent top tensioned risers is considered in the present section and these are shown in fig 6 each riser is top tensioned by six tensioners the water depth is h 300 m the fluid density and the fluid kinematic viscosity is 1025 g c m 3 and 1 188 10 6 m 2 s respectively a uniform current profile is applied as basis for the analysis this profile corresponds to a constant velocity throughout the water depth of h 100 m which is acting in the direction of x axis for simplicity no additional auxiliary components such as attached lines or buoyancy elements are included in the model accordingly both of the risers are modeled as circular steel pipes with constant diameter both risers are fixed in translation at both the top and the bottom ends detailed properties of each riser are given in table 2 sensitivity analyses of the riser displacements are performed with respect to key parameters such as current velocity u riser spacing l and riser top tension coefficient t which is defined as t r i s e r t o p t e n s i o n r i s e r t o t a l s u b m e r g e d w e i g h t 4 2 results and discussion the static equilibrium configurations of the two risers are illustrated in fig 7 by using different wake models with varying current velocity u 0 7 1 25 m s varying top tension coefficients t 1 2 1 8 and varying initial riser spacing l 3 5 6 2m comparing to the deformed configuration of the upstream riser it is seen that the deflection of the downstream riser is significantly decreased due to the effect of the wake interference hence a more accurate and efficient wake prediction model is very important in relation to assessment of riser interference 4 2 1 assessment of wake models fig 7 a provides a brief comparison of static displacement shapes obtained by using different wake models which includes the huse model the blevins model and the wake model presented in the present study the spacing between two risers which both are top tensioned at a level corresponding to a coefficient of 1 5 is set to be 6 2 m the environmental current velocity is 1 2 m s which corresponds to a quite extreme condition the results calculated by application of blevins model indicate that this particular combination of riser spacing of l 6 2m and top tension coefficient of t 1 5 is not safe when subjected to a uniform current of magnitude u 1 2 m s however there is still a sufficiently large distance between the risers when using the other two wake models even at the most critical water depth of about h 100 m thus it appears that blevins model is much more conservative than the other two wake models the huse model performs well when the spacing between the risers has a high value or when the magnitude of the current velocity is low this is due to its particular correction method nevertheless as shown in fig 3 the velocities calculated by application of the huse model are always high even in the very near wake domain where it should have a low value this implies that the huse model is more insensitive in the case of extreme conditions during which collision is about to take place this poses a potential risk if the design parameters are based on the huse model on the contrary fig 3 illustrates that the results calculated by present model are lower than those for the huse model in the very near domain while they are a little bit higher when the distance is large this is exactly what is required which implies that the present model is more sensitive with respect to finding the critical conditions for riser collision consequently the following three main influencing factors are all studied based on the model presented in the present work 4 2 2 current velocity when the riser spacing and other properties are kept constant then the risk of collision will increase with increasing current velocity as shown in fig 7 b the riser spacing and top tension coefficient is set to be l 5m t 1 5 respectively the current profile is simplified to a uniform current which increases in magnitude from u 0 7 m s to u 1 25 m s in spite of the static equilibrium deflection for both risers are gradually increasing for increasing current velocity the increasing amplitude of the upstream riser is evidently larger than the downstream one this will continuously reduce the minimum clearance between two risers until contact between the risers takes place the critical current velocity is approximately equal to 1 25 m s with this particular combination of riser spacing and top tension coefficient the current velocity has a great impact on the riser clearance but this is a parameter which is given by the environment and as basically beyond the control of the designers or operators once a particular site has been selected 4 2 3 riser top tension in order to find the critical top tension coefficient the current velocity and the initial riser spacing are kept constant with u 1 0 m s and l 4 5m the top tension coefficient is then reduced from 1 8 to 1 2 step by step and the results from the calculations are shown in fig 7 c generally it appears that the top tension has a great influence on the upstream riser the clearance between the two risers is evidently decreasing when reducing the top tension coefficient finally the collision may occur when top tension coefficient goes down to 1 2 the top tension coefficient is a more flexible design parameter than riser spacing and it can be changed manually during the process of drilling or production however a too high top tension may overload the tensioner system as well as the riser itself due to the associated high stresses 4 2 4 riser spacing in order to find the critical riser spacing the current velocity and the top tension coefficient are kept constant with u 1 0 m s and t 1 5 while the riser spacing is reduced from 5 0 m step by step the results of the calculations are shown in fig 7 d it can be observed that the deformation of the downstream riser decreases significantly when the riser spacing is reduced of course the corresponding clearance variation clearly exhibits the same trend for the present conditions the critical riser spacing is found to be closer to 3 5 m riser spacing is one of the most important design parameters for drilling or producing platform systems riser collision can be efficiently prevented by increasing the riser spacing nevertheless it should be noticed that increasing the riser spacing directly means increasing the size of the wellbay which will result in significant cost penalties 5 conclusions consideration of wake interference is of great significance for the static analysis of riser interaction and potential for collision in the present work static deflections of two top tensioned marine risers arranged in tandem are investigated a new effective wake model for circular cylinders is developed based on solving prandtl s boundary layer equations by using the tollmien s first approximation method and the goldstein s second approximation method comparison of the results among the three models indicates that the local flow velocity in the near wake domain will be over estimated by the huse model but underestimated by the blevins model hence the huse model is relatively insensitive in this domain and blevins model tend to be conservative it is demonstrated that the new model proposed in this work has a good stability and reliability when predicting the wake profile in the critical reynolds region this applies in particular when it is applied to calculate the critical conditions associated with riser collision problems for the no collision allowed strategy a calculation procedure is presented which enables determination of the pairwise static equilibrium configuration of risers by combining the global riser analysis software riflex and the new wake model our analysis through a case study shows that the both the riser spacing and the top tension coefficient have a significant influence on the likelihood of riser interference therefore optimal combination of these two parameters should primarily be considered in order to avoid riser collision it should be noted here that although an improved analytical wake model is proposed on this study in the future a development of some type of optimization procedure for the very near wake domain x 2d would be beneficial an accurate estimation of the transverse flow velocity for predicting the lift force on the staggered arranged downstream riser has to be provided and is also planned as part of future work acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the

22233,in this paper we derive a state space model restricted to heave motion of a full scale array of floating oscillating water column owc wave energy converters with nonlinear power take off dynamics taking hydrodynamic interactions between all bodies into account the resulting state space model is intended as a basis for accelerated development of advanced control approaches to maximize power generation the kinetic and potential energy transferred to the air chamber causes a pressure difference inducing unidirectional motion of a novel bi radial turbine this can be accurately modeled using pressure dependent turbine characteristics taking into account the nonlinearity of the gas compressibility the analytical model of the floating owc is based on linear hydrodynamic coefficients obtained using the boundary element solver ansys aqwa of an equilateral triangle array of axis symmetric floating owcs of the marmok a 5 type finally the system s model time domain equations are simulated in different wave climates and an ideal active controller is applied to maximize energy conversion for the specific implemented separation distance the resulting cross body interactions are found to be negligible in irregular compared to regular wave scenarios the turbine rotational speed suggests investigations on discontinues nonlinear control methods before semi global approaches are used to optimize power generation keywords wave energy converter arrays hydrodynamic interactions oscillating water column bi radial turbine state space 1 introduction wave energy is a promising renewable energy source and potentially contributes significantly to the future energy mix aderinto and li 2018 thus research in this field has increased substantially over the last decade falc√£o 2010 and in the recent past more single prototypes and operational sites have been deployed rusu and onea 2017 however significant costs associated with development and maintenance have so far impeded the implementation of commercially viable projects andrews and jelley 2017 to achieve commercial power generation in the future wave energy converters wecs will be deployed in large wec farms chowdhury et al 2015 the spacing between single devices is on the one hand determined by a trade off between safe maintenance operation and cost reduction due to shorter cables for power transmission and on the other hand by the benefits for power generation depending on the configuration of the array the produced power can be higher or lower compared to the same amount of isolated devices due to hydrodynamic interactions between the ocean waves and those radiated by the wecs chowdhury et al 2015 budal 1977 falc√£o 2002 nader et al 2014 bodies immersed in water will experience additional effects apart from buoyancy if surrounded by an unsteady flow due to the pressure the water acts on them this can set the body into motion resulting in a subsequent motion of the surrounding water thus some of the bodies kinetic energy is radiated away however a second body in the array configuration can experience this radiated wave as an additional incident wave falnes 2002 those interactions vary for differently shaped devices locations and incident wave directions consequently those interactions are non trivial to derive analytically sabuncu and calisal 1981 or to test experimentally for scaled prototypes in wave tanks nader et al 2017 today it is common practice to assess the main hydrodynamic coefficients using the boundary element method bem to solve the velocity potential of the flow followed by a transformation in the time domain which is necessary if nonlinear effects want to be considered in the model sheng et al 2014 additionally the power generated in a scaled physical model does not scale linearly to its size henriques et al 2016b hence it is advantageous to use a detailed full scale mathematical model to predict the power generation capabilities as done in forehand et al 2016 with a single body point absorber array furthermore the model can be used to design control strategies at an early stage in bacelli and ringwood 2015 the authors present an optimal control approach of wec array for single and multibody devices with linear velocity power take off pto relation and linear dynamics a strategy taking into account hydrodynamic interactions while solving the control problem is introduced in nambiar et al 2015 for three hemispherical floats connected to a fixed support with a rigid arm to this date the authors do not know of any studies addressing optimal control of multibody systems with nonlinear pto taking the hydrodynamics into account consequently our current work addresses the necessary modeling aspects validated based on a given control law and our future work will address new control strategies in order to optimize the energy conversion of large parks of wecs this paper deals with wave energy converters of the floating oscillating water column type owc illustrated in fig 1 the basics of the principle is an off shore device open to the sea water at the bottom and a trapped air chamber in general owcs are considered as one of the simplest wecs since they have few moving mechanical parts and the pto has no water contact sealing the air chamber to the atmosphere falc√£o and henriques 2016 the oscillating motion of the water column with the waves induces an alternating air flow thus so called self rectifying turbines are installed in owcs to achieve a unidirectional rotation apart from the well studied well s turbine impulse turbines are another class of axial flow machines a new impulse turbine the bi radial turbine see fig 2 is a good choice in terms of performance with a peak efficiency of 79 falc√£o and henriques 2016 thus we use the dynamic model of this turbine from henriques et al 2017a and henriques et al 2017 for the implementation of an owc array in this work the air flow into the rotor is directed through so called guide vanes there are two distinct connected rows of guide vanes illustrated in blue by sliding the complete guide vanes set axially it will be inserted into or removed from the flow to ensure that the downstream guide vanes do not obstruct the flow out of the rotor additionally a high speed stop valve hssv is installed at the bottom of the turbine to prevent water contact in extreme sea states by stopping the entire air flow the description of these analytical relationships is followed by a numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic coefficients for the specifically used geometries with the aid of the boundary element method solver ansys aqwa subsequently the implementation that puts together the analytical and numerical parts is presented and the resulting simulation model is validated based on regular and irregular sea states this work is concluded with a discussion of possible control approaches to improve power generation 2 system modeling the following model is based on linear water wave theory assuming small wave amplitudes and body motions compared to the wave length Œª additionally the diameter of the inner tube is d p Œª justifying the internal free surface representation by an imaginary rigid piston enabling the application of oscillating body theory between the owc indicated by d p and the floater indicated by d b from buoy this will be called a two body heaving system falnes 2002 the terms piston and owc are used interchangeably throughout the paper the main axis of motion useful for power generation of the floating owc is the heave axis thus our research focuses on the dynamics of the vertical displacement z t positive in the upwards direction 2 1 equations of motion let us assume we have an array on n wec devices leading to 2 n coupled bodies the equations of motion eom for a body i oscillating in heave in the ocean after cummins approach cummins 1962 are given by 1 m i z i t f i h t f i m t f i pto t f i ex t

falnes 2002 2 2 air chamber and turbine model the main assumptions to model the air chamber of wec i are an isentropic compression extension of the air no heat transfer in the chamber walls and small variations in the temperature of the chamber due to continuous in and outflow as in henriques et al 2017a we restate the derivation for completeness and begin with mass balance of the chamber 8 œÅ c i v c i t œÅ c i v c i t m t i t where v c i t denotes the current chamber volume as a function of the relative position between the piston and the buoy with the air density œÅ c i and m t i t the mass

19 m t i œâ i 1 p hssv i œÜ i œÅ in i œâ i d t 3 where p hssv i denotes the position of the stop valve and is open for p hssv i 0 and completely closed for p hssv i 1 respectively finally with eqs 17

which would otherwise act on a single body namely 25 f x f 1 h x 1 f 1 m x 1 f 1 pto x 4 n 1 f 1 r x vel f 1 ex f n h x n f n m x n f n pto x 5 n f n r x vel f n ex f 2 n h x 2 n 0 f n pto x 5 n f 2 n r x vel f 2 n ex additionally it has to be noted that the velocity component of the radiation force f i r x vel not only does it depend on the states belonging to its own wec system but on the velocities of all other bodies x vel leading to further interactions between all bodies this component has to be regarded as a separate input output system which will be approximated with superposition of linear time invariant state space representations of the form 26a f i j r a i j r f r b i j r z j t 26b f i j r c i j r f i j r d i j r z j t using the same impulse response function as in 7 the sum over the outputs 26b of body i affected by body j results in the desired radiation component on body i 27 f i r j f i j r the system matrices can be of arbitrary dimension but are chosen as a trade off between accuracy and computational effort due to additional states as described in the next section along with the method used to approximate the impulse response functions in starrett et al 2015 the model 26 is directly included in the eom for a single wec system but due to the higher dimensions in this work we have to present the components separately the time rate of changes 28 x pres i f z i z n i z i z n i p i œâ i p hssv i and 29 x kin i f p i œâ i t gen i follow eqs 12 and 13 but are chosen to illustrate the dependencies on the other states in 23 in this model we define our inputs as the generator torque and the position of the hssv i e 30 u gen t gen 1 t gen n and u hssv p hssv 1 p hssv n 3 parameter identification the derived model allows time domain simulations for arbitrary geometries and configurations of floating owcs assuming the main hydrodynamic parameters are available in this work we test the analytic equations based on three floating owcs of the marmok a 5 type developed by oceantec energias marinas weller et al 2017 which is illustrated in a scaled sketch in fig 1 the cross sections of the bodies for 2 follow from 31 s b œÄ d b 2 2 d p 2 2 and s p œÄ d p 2 2 the wecs are arranged in an equilateral triangular array configuration which is found to be optimal for multi directional waves in de andr√©s et al 2014 with each buoy moored independently by three mooring cables building a tripod with an angle Œ≤ with the calm sea surface as illustrated in fig 4 we assume Œ≤ to be constant since the off shore water depth d w is much greater compared to the bodies motion together with choosing the inertia and damping of the cables to be negligible the mooring force on the buoys becomes a linear function of the vertical position greater than the calm sea surface namely 32 f b i m t 3 k m sin 2 Œ≤ z b i t for z b i t 0 and equals zero if the body is immersed below the equilibrium point k m denotes the mooring stiffness of the deployed cables future work will incorporate more detailed non linear mooring models and investigate the differences resulting from varying configurations e g inter body moored or slack mooring in this work we present the effects of different numerical values of k m to illustrate the importance of the mooring force for the power generation instead of using one big turbine two smaller identical biradial turbines with diameter d t and moment of inertia i t are used in the first full scale marmok a 5 prototype with a total rated power of 30 kw in our example this is implemented by multiplying the instantaneous mass flow by two to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients necessary for the forces we model the geometry of the array in the bem solver ansys aqwa release 19 1 with separation d s between each wec system the buoy dimensions are as illustrated in fig 1 and relevant to the actual parameters of the prototype the owc is modeled as a physical body inside the bem modeler with a diameter d p bem d p 0 02 m as pictured by the red dashed box surrounding the piston in fig 1 instead of using a weightless thin plate to represent the water surface inside the chamber as done in the beginning of this study we choose a full column representation of the piston since it reduces numerical instabilities in the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients which agrees with the results of sheng et al 2014 and bosma et al 2017 furthermore the calculated overall mass approaches the actual one which is of importance for the natural frequency of the piston in the time domain simulations the incident wave angle Œ∏ ranges from 60 to 60 in an interval of 8 and from 180 to 180 in an interval of 40 the wave frequency is also divided into multiple ranges f 1 f 2 and f 3 to better cover the areas of interest which require a finer resolution for low frequencies and long wave periods respectively see table 1 the approximation of the infinite frequency for a i j is done with the high frequency œâ hf 100 0 rad s in aqwa 19 1 3 1 hydrodynamic coefficients for a more detailed discussion of the hydrodynamic results the reader is referred to gaebele 2018 the symmetry in the array layout reflects in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the single bodies and can be best presented on the basis of the matrix of the added mass components in 24 since the interactions are reduced to a single value we choose to arrange our matrix so that the first n bodies are represented by the buoys followed by the corresponding pistons in increasing enumeration additionally we display all hydrodynamic coefficients with their physical units the normalization could yield to confusion originating from the different masses of the bodies in fig 5 this matrix is to be read such that the body in front of a row experiences an added mass due to the acceleration of the corresponding body above a column for example element 3 6 expresses the added mass of 15 998 kg on b 3 due to p 3 on the main diagonals we find the effects the individual body experiences based on his own motion surrounded by the solid lines the diagonals of the other blocks represent interactions inside the same wec system namely between buoy and piston the remaining elements represent the cross coupling between spatially distinct wecs and are except for numerical variations equal in between the combinations since the wec are separated with the same distance from the others furthermore the symmetry of the example array configuration allows us to state the hydrodynamic radiation damping coefficients b œâ as eight wave frequency œâ dependent functions instead of 36 as illustrated in fig 6 we continue to use the same color and line style notation as used for the added mass in fig 5 and the results are again given with their physical unit since the choice for a normalization mass would distort the magnitudes while comparing buoys and pistons the radiation damping characteristics induced by a buoy on itself b b i b i and its corresponding piston b p i b i have the largest amplitude of all the combinations and are illustrated in solid darkblue darkblue solid line width 7 and dash dotted crimson crimson dashdotted line width 7 respectively the subscripts b i b i p i b i indicate the equivalence for all wecs i 1 2 3 again we observe symmetry namely four pairs of characteristics each induced by a different body acting on the two bodies from the same wec in other words the buoy and the corresponding piston will always experience similar effects caused by the radiation of any specific body it has to be noted that the radiation damping coefficients due to cross coupling change their sign multiple times over œâ best seen at the dashed blue and red line royalblue dashed line width 0 7 red dashed line width 0 7 representing the effects from a buoy on both bodies in different wecs b b i b j b p i b j i j 1 2 3 i j to obtain the radiation force we would have to solve the convolution integral in 6 with the impulse response function irf of b œâ in eq 7 although we are presenting eight distinct values in our case the radiation forces are still dependent on all other body velocities consequently we would need to solve 2 n 2 convolution integrals at every time step this computational effort can be reduced by approximating f i r with the state space representation 26 after approximating the kernel function with a sum of complex exponentials as discussed in sheng et al 2015 namely 33 k n m t k 1 n k n m Œ± n m k e Œ≤ n m k t n m b i p i i 1 2 3 since all irfs will converge towards zero as time increases here n k n m denotes the order of the approximation and thus the dimension of the intended virtual state vectors we use prony s method to obtain the coefficients Œ± n m k and Œ≤ n m k which arise in pairs of complex conjugates values however as the result of the sum over the pairs we receive a real value using the relation exp z exp x cos y i sin y for z x i y if we choose an even order for the body combinations within the same wec system we choose an order n k n n 4 n b i p i i 1 2 3 the change of the sign in b œâ for the cross coupling combinations requires a higher order of approximation n k n m i e n k n m 8 n m b i p i i 1 2 3 n m since the resulting irf has its peak not at t 0 but shifted in time due to the wave propagation from one wec to another pictured in right plot in fig 7 with the dotted black line black dotted line width 0 7 we choose the example of the buoys for illustration purposes since in this case we observe the worst fit of all body combinations to show the limitations of this method for the cross coupling however the characteristic behavior is mapped with the right amplitude illustrated in dashed blue blue dashed line width 1 2 thus we conclude that the results are reasonable for first investigations the causal discrete transfer functions obtained with prony s method are converted from discrete to continuous time with the used sampling frequency of f samp 25 hz and subsequently converted to the state space form 26 the hydrodynamic excitation force coefficients and the corresponding phase coefficient complete the necessary parameters for the time domain simulation of 23 in fig 8 the combination of Œ≥ b 1 œâ Œ∏ and œÜ b 1 œâ Œ∏ top row see eq 5 and the pair of the corresponding piston Œ≥ p 1 œâ Œ∏ œÜ p 1 œâ Œ∏ bottom is illustrated as an example we observe the result for buoy 2 if we mirror the current plot at Œ∏ 0 due to the symmetry how the incident waves hit the array the plot for buoy 3 is symmetric with respect to the Œ∏ 0 axis due to its position on the x axis which corresponds to the Œ∏ 0 axis for the pistons we find Œ≥ p i œâ Œ∏ to be independent of Œ∏ however the associated œÜ p i œâ Œ∏ do vary in the manner described for the buoy to compute f ex t for the irregular wave case we use a significant wave height h s and dominant period t p to characterize a pierson moskowitz pm wave energy spectrum with the parameters given in falnes 2002 and define an incident wave angle Œ∏ the pm spectrum is sampled at n w 200 wave frequencies œâ k equally distributed over 0 2 rad s 1 to 2 4 rad s 1 during the summation over the wave frequencies Œ≥ i œâ k Œ∏ and œÜ i œâ k Œ∏ are interpolated for constant Œ∏ and the corresponding œâ k on the basis of the illustrated coefficients for the corresponding body finally the shift around the random phase components œï k gives us our six wave excitation force time series regular waves are linearly scaled with Œ≥ i œâ Œ∏ to obtain the excitation force signals for regular wave scenarios 3 2 stabilizing control law henriques et al develop an optimal feedback control law for a practical implementation in henriques et al 2017a based on the maximization of the aerodynamic efficiency of a fixed owc equipped with the same biradial turbine namely 34 u gen a gen œâ b gen 1 the authors compute the time averaged turbine output power for several sea states as a function of the rotational speed to find an optimal set of angular velocities and determine the constants a gen and b gen with a least squares fitting in this work we set the coefficients to a gen 0 0001 and b gen 3 6 following henriques et al 2017a for the same order and we cannot guarantee optimal values for the simulated sea state however they are suitable to achieve realistic results for initial evaluation the exponent of the rotational speed in eq 34 is chosen so that the power of an ideal generator is given by 35 p gen a gen œâ b gen in this baseline model an ideal generator is assumed by means of the electromagnetic torque applied to the turbine will directly result in an energy conversion for future work several generator types will be incorporated into the simulation environment to assess performance using practical devices 4 time domain simulation numerical simulations of the derived state space model 23 are conducted with matlab simulink in the time domain taking into account the nonlinear effects of a compressible fluid in the air chamber and the specific turbine model 4 1 regular waves the first results of the generated power of the three wecs and the corresponding array interaction factor 36 q Œ∏ t p arr 3 p single presented in fig 9 are obtained using regular stokes waves of 3rd order stokes 1847 with wave height of h s 1 m from varying incident wave angles Œ∏ and varying wave periods t the concept of the interaction factor is widely used in the literature on wec arrays and restated in terms of the averaged power of the array p arr Œ∏ t and the averaged power of a single isolated devise p single Œ∏ t in the same wave scenario after sufficiently long simulation time the dynamics reach an asymptotic behavior for every Œ∏ t combination and the last three entire periods of the transient oscillation of each wec are used to compute p arr Œ∏ t which is illustrated in fig 9 on the left to reduce the simulation time around five times we use the terminal state of the previous simulation run as initial condition for the next simulation run with varied incident wave angle of Œ¥ Œ∏ 4 thus reach the transient motion in less time we observe two peaks in the generated power for a varying wave period where the peak at the lower period t 7 3 s results from a decreased oscillation amplitude of the water column and an increased amplitude of the buoy respectively the opposite is the case for the second peak around t 11 2 s where the amplitude of the pistons motions is higher compared to the buoy in both cases the relative motion between the two bodies is locally maximized which is typical for floating two body heaving systems likewise observed for linear frequency domain simulations in gomes et al 2012 the energetic long periodic waves t 14 s result in a motion of both buoy and piston following the water surface elevation hence the relative motion in the floating owc tends towards zero likewise the generated power for short wave periods the excitation force converges towards zero compare Œ≥ i in fig 8 resulting in minimal body motion which also does not yield power generation for t 6 s consequently the peaks in the q factor at the boundaries of the wave period range are not of importance since the significance is lost when dividing a numerically small number by a small number in eq 36 the area of the highest q 1 15 around t 9 25 s 11 2 s implies that the power generation inside the array is increased due to an increase of the pistons motion which can be explained by the hydrodynamic interactions affecting the water columns more relative to the buoys 4 2 irregular waves for more realistic sea states we choose a wave which is irregular in the amplitude but otherwise propagating as a plane wave to be able to distinguish possible interaction effects from the approximation of the diffraction and radiation problem inside the array with the evaluation of the generated power compared to the power generated for the same wave in an isolated device and in terms of differences in the motion of the bodies a wave characterized with the pm spectrum based on h s 2 m and different peak periods t p 6 s 7 s 13 s is the foundation for the excitation force the incident wave angle is chosen to be Œ∏ 15 0 15 30 a further parameter we vary is the mooring stiffness k m 60 kn m 80 kn m 140 kn m to investigate its relevance to the output the generated power p arr is averaged over the time window between 60 and 660 s since we start the simulation from the initial equilibrium and wait for steady state motion in fig 10 p arr is illustrated versus k m and t p in each subplot for a different Œ∏ it has to be noted that the subplots are rotated to enable visualization of each bar but consequently the abscissa and ordinate are decreasing furthermore although unity remains the same color as in fig 9 the colormap has different limits enabling the identification of the maximum and minimum simulated q factor for the irregular waves scenarios in terms of the color of the bars due to symmetry the scenarios for Œ∏ 15 and Œ∏ 15 are equal ignoring minor numerical variations except for t p 6 s decrease in excitation compared to regular waves in fig 9 a decreasing k m yields an increase in p arr since the buoys are less restricted in motion for the irregular waves scenarios we do not observe the two peaks in power as in the regular waves case in fig 9 over the peak wave period but a more evenly distributed power generation generally q 1 for t p 9 s while the highest interaction factor is achieved for Œ∏ 0 t p 12 s and k m 140 kn m however the difference in q is small compared to the regular wave scenario information about the time evolution of the states can be characterized by a single simulation run we set h s 2 m and t p 10 s to emulate a wave which is typically observed in the us pacific northwest lenee bluhm et al 2011 the mooring stiffness is set to k m 80 kn m equal to the regular wave scenario and an incident wave angle Œ∏ 30 results in different arrival times at each wec such that the peaks of the bodies positions are shifted in time in fig 11 we show the heave positions between 460 and 520 s since characteristic effects can be observed during this time window the solid and dashed lines represent the positions of the buoys while the dash dotted and dotted lines of the same color and marker represents the corresponding piston in the sketch of the array in fig 4 the first buoy with heave position x 1 is the furthermost one thus it is reached first by the wave since Œ∏ 0 given in orange solar flare solid line width 1 2pt with circled marker followed by the second wec system illustrated with the blue green dashed line rogue wave dashed line width 1 2pt with square markers the black dashed plot black dashed line width 1 2pt with cross markers shows the motion of the third buoy which is always reached last for the used Œ∏ the differences between a local extrema for different wecs are hard to notice with the naked eye but e g the peak of x 1 before t 490 s is 0 025 m higher than those of the two other buoys generally it can be observed that the motion of the piston is shifted from the buoys motion therefore a varying relative motion inside the two body heaving system results leading to the pressure change in the air chamber this pressure p 1 is illustrated for the first wec with the same orange in fig 12 as dotted line solar flare dotted line width 1 2pt with triangle markers and oscillates about the atmospheric pressure a turbine is accelerated for an inflow as well as an outflow thus the high frequency oscillation on the rotational speed graph in solid orange solar flare solid line width 1 2pt has half of the wave and bodies period we notice high variations in œâ for example from 480 to 490 s since it follows the peaks in the chamber pressure reflecting the varying oscillation amplitudes of our wec systems during this period wec 1 picks up on motion amplitude in addition to a higher difference to the change in the relative position with the corresponding owc this behavior results in an unsteady power output because in this case we do not control the rotational speed based on any other information apart from itself 5 discussion as illustrated by the motions in fig 11 the differences between distinct systems are small compared to the total range of motion in irregular waves additionally in more realistic sea states the computed interaction factor q only varies by 5 this implies that the radiation and diffraction problem inside the investigated array has no greater impact for this specific example which can be explained with the geometry of the marmok a 5 devices the ratio of the diameter d b to the draft is small about 0 14 which is connected to weak radiation properties furthermore the separation distance compared to diameter the has to be mentioned with d s 8 d b the buoys are far apart however d s is chosen this way to guarantee that maintenance ships can navigate between the wec devices without colliding with them since the roll and pitch motion is not yet evaluated in appendix an outlook to include other degrees of freedom and the phenomenon of parametric resonance is given the simulation results herein presented after inspecting the hydrodynamic coefficients of our case study appear to be reasonable the added mass and especially its inverse has the largest entries on its diagonal which implies a high dependency on its own component in the composite force for every wec body additionally the magnitudes of the irfs are small compared to the mass dimensions of the bodies with the cross coupling terms being even smaller by at least an order of magnitude the diffraction inside the array reflected by the differences between the excitation force coefficients is as well marginal and the excitation is much more related to the wave frequency compared to anything else nevertheless the simulation results in regular wave suggest that the employment of this specific floating owcs in an array can widen the range of regular waves frequencies desirable for energy conversion which agrees with q 1 for t p 9 s for the irregular case however we also observe q below unity for some wave periods implying destructive interference which suggest future investigations of different array configurations to be able to optimize the layout and separation for different wave climates for the floating owcs and compare the results to existing approaches on different two body heaving systems de andr√©s et al 2014 or fixed owcs sharp et al 2017 2018 the differences resulting from varying incident wave angle Œ∏ are again marginal due to the symmetry of the array but cannot be generalized for non symmetric configurations subsequent work will also consider the effects of viscous drag forces to obtain a more practical representation the pto and the air chamber model are highly nonlinear and the strong changes in simulated rotational speed in fig 12 suggest further investigations of a sliding mode controller which with its discontinuous nature should perform well in maintaining a constant œâ this rotational speed will be set to a value resulting in an improved efficiency of the turbine to this date the authors do not know of any studies addressing optimal control of floating owc parks with nonlinear pto future research will aim for semi global control of sub array off several devices followed by decentralized supervising control for entire wec parks large arrays of wec devices will need different methodologies to model the hydrodynamic interactions this work can serve as basis for the comparison of results when methods to derive the diffraction and radiation capabilities based on the hydrodynamics of an single device like mcnatt et al 2015 are adapted to floating owcs 6 conclusion we derived a methodology to efficiently model full scale arrays of floating owcs taking hydrodynamic interactions between all distinct bodies into account without making simplification in the devices geometries as well as connected them to a nonlinear air chamber turbine model the approach is neither limited to an symmetric array nor to identical devices but to the availability of the linear hydrodynamic coefficients simulated for the entire configuration the case study of the marmok a 5 is used since it is one kind of device that has actually been deployed and tested in the ocean we found that for the assumed separation between the single devices we could neglect the cross coupling between the wecs in irregular waves but not in regular waves however different mooring configurations or further insights in the real world constraints of the array placement could justify a smaller separation and consequently higher hydrodynamic interactions nevertheless the analytic model can be used to design more advanced control strategies like nonlinear sliding mode control to maintain a constant rotational speed or methods aiming to optimize the power generation for example by means of smoothing the power output the next step in our research will consider semi global control approaches for sub arrays followed by supervisory control for entire wec parks acknowledgment this research was kindly sponsored by the national science foundation usa award number 1711859 appendix multiple degrees of freedom increasing the number of the degrees of freedom dof in the presented coupled model can be achieved by expanding the system equations namely by adding more spatial states to the sub state vectors x pos and consequently to x vel the procedure is illustrated with help of the roll angle œï as an example the time derivative of the bodies velocities from 23 evolves to 37 x vel z œï a 1 a z œï 1 a œï z 1 a œï œï 1 f x t œï x here a i j 1 r 2 n 2 n is defined in the same manner as a 1 is defined in section and the subscripts denote the interaction from the dof j to i the accumulated torques on the roll axis are represented by t œï x and would not act on the pistons the second part of radiation problem eq 6 can be obtained as described in section 3 1 however the necessary interaction terms increase quadratically with the number of dofs n dof namely 2 n n dof 2 therefore a trade off between accuracy and computational effort has to be obtained by neglecting the non significant interactions the coupling of at least two dofs enables the phenomenon of parametric resonance to occur under the condition that the incident wave frequency is approximately twice the pitch or roll natural frequency rodr√≠guez and neves 2016 rho et al 2005 this dynamic instability is commonly found in spar type oscillating water columns extracting energy in heave direction gomes et al 2017 the state equations are further coupled by the metacentric height gm in t œï x which varies with instantaneous heave position of the device directly affecting the center of buoyancy of the spar if the gm becomes negative the motion becomes unstable decreasing the extracted power since kinetic energy is transferred from the heave mode to the pitch mode rho et al 2005 those phenomena have to noted if more detailed studies of the motion of wec farms are desired 
22233,in this paper we derive a state space model restricted to heave motion of a full scale array of floating oscillating water column owc wave energy converters with nonlinear power take off dynamics taking hydrodynamic interactions between all bodies into account the resulting state space model is intended as a basis for accelerated development of advanced control approaches to maximize power generation the kinetic and potential energy transferred to the air chamber causes a pressure difference inducing unidirectional motion of a novel bi radial turbine this can be accurately modeled using pressure dependent turbine characteristics taking into account the nonlinearity of the gas compressibility the analytical model of the floating owc is based on linear hydrodynamic coefficients obtained using the boundary element solver ansys aqwa of an equilateral triangle array of axis symmetric floating owcs of the marmok a 5 type finally the system s model time domain equations are simulated in different wave climates and an ideal active controller is applied to maximize energy conversion for the specific implemented separation distance the resulting cross body interactions are found to be negligible in irregular compared to regular wave scenarios the turbine rotational speed suggests investigations on discontinues nonlinear control methods before semi global approaches are used to optimize power generation keywords wave energy converter arrays hydrodynamic interactions oscillating water column bi radial turbine state space 1 introduction wave energy is a promising renewable energy source and potentially contributes significantly to the future energy mix aderinto and li 2018 thus research in this field has increased substantially over the last decade falc√£o 2010 and in the recent past more single prototypes and operational sites have been deployed rusu and onea 2017 however significant costs associated with development and maintenance have so far impeded the implementation of commercially viable projects andrews and jelley 2017 to achieve commercial power generation in the future wave energy converters wecs will be deployed in large wec farms chowdhury et al 2015 the spacing between single devices is on the one hand determined by a trade off between safe maintenance operation and cost reduction due to shorter cables for power transmission and on the other hand by the benefits for power generation depending on the configuration of the array the produced power can be higher or lower compared to the same amount of isolated devices due to hydrodynamic interactions between the ocean waves and those radiated by the wecs chowdhury et al 2015 budal 1977 falc√£o 2002 nader et al 2014 bodies immersed in water will experience additional effects apart from buoyancy if surrounded by an unsteady flow due to the pressure the water acts on them this can set the body into motion resulting in a subsequent motion of the surrounding water thus some of the bodies kinetic energy is radiated away however a second body in the array configuration can experience this radiated wave as an additional incident wave falnes 2002 those interactions vary for differently shaped devices locations and incident wave directions consequently those interactions are non trivial to derive analytically sabuncu and calisal 1981 or to test experimentally for scaled prototypes in wave tanks nader et al 2017 today it is common practice to assess the main hydrodynamic coefficients using the boundary element method bem to solve the velocity potential of the flow followed by a transformation in the time domain which is necessary if nonlinear effects want to be considered in the model sheng et al 2014 additionally the power generated in a scaled physical model does not scale linearly to its size henriques et al 2016b hence it is advantageous to use a detailed full scale mathematical model to predict the power generation capabilities as done in forehand et al 2016 with a single body point absorber array furthermore the model can be used to design control strategies at an early stage in bacelli and ringwood 2015 the authors present an optimal control approach of wec array for single and multibody devices with linear velocity power take off pto relation and linear dynamics a strategy taking into account hydrodynamic interactions while solving the control problem is introduced in nambiar et al 2015 for three hemispherical floats connected to a fixed support with a rigid arm to this date the authors do not know of any studies addressing optimal control of multibody systems with nonlinear pto taking the hydrodynamics into account consequently our current work addresses the necessary modeling aspects validated based on a given control law and our future work will address new control strategies in order to optimize the energy conversion of large parks of wecs this paper deals with wave energy converters of the floating oscillating water column type owc illustrated in fig 1 the basics of the principle is an off shore device open to the sea water at the bottom and a trapped air chamber in general owcs are considered as one of the simplest wecs since they have few moving mechanical parts and the pto has no water contact sealing the air chamber to the atmosphere falc√£o and henriques 2016 the oscillating motion of the water column with the waves induces an alternating air flow thus so called self rectifying turbines are installed in owcs to achieve a unidirectional rotation apart from the well studied well s turbine impulse turbines are another class of axial flow machines a new impulse turbine the bi radial turbine see fig 2 is a good choice in terms of performance with a peak efficiency of 79 falc√£o and henriques 2016 thus we use the dynamic model of this turbine from henriques et al 2017a and henriques et al 2017 for the implementation of an owc array in this work the air flow into the rotor is directed through so called guide vanes there are two distinct connected rows of guide vanes illustrated in blue by sliding the complete guide vanes set axially it will be inserted into or removed from the flow to ensure that the downstream guide vanes do not obstruct the flow out of the rotor additionally a high speed stop valve hssv is installed at the bottom of the turbine to prevent water contact in extreme sea states by stopping the entire air flow the description of these analytical relationships is followed by a numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic coefficients for the specifically used geometries with the aid of the boundary element method solver ansys aqwa subsequently the implementation that puts together the analytical and numerical parts is presented and the resulting simulation model is validated based on regular and irregular sea states this work is concluded with a discussion of possible control approaches to improve power generation 2 system modeling the following model is based on linear water wave theory assuming small wave amplitudes and body motions compared to the wave length Œª additionally the diameter of the inner tube is d p Œª justifying the internal free surface representation by an imaginary rigid piston enabling the application of oscillating body theory between the owc indicated by d p and the floater indicated by d b from buoy this will be called a two body heaving system falnes 2002 the terms piston and owc are used interchangeably throughout the paper the main axis of motion useful for power generation of the floating owc is the heave axis thus our research focuses on the dynamics of the vertical displacement z t positive in the upwards direction 2 1 equations of motion let us assume we have an array on n wec devices leading to 2 n coupled bodies the equations of motion eom for a body i oscillating in heave in the ocean after cummins approach cummins 1962 are given by 1 m i z i t f i h t f i m t f i pto t f i ex t f i r t here m i denotes the mass of the individual body the hydro static restoring force 2 f i h t œÅ g s b z i t for a buoy œÅ g s p z i t for a piston due to the displaced water is zero at equilibrium z i t 0 and else adds a spring like effect to the system s b s p are the constant cross sections of a buoy or a piston œÅ the sea water density and g the earth acceleration the mooring force f i m is subject to the used mooring configuration which will be attached to the buoys and will be simplified to a function of the heave position hence 3 f i m t f z i t for a buoy 0 for a piston in the equation of the hypothetical piston f m does not appear since the owc is not affected by the mooring the forced induced by the relative motion in the two body heaving system results in a varying pressure inside the air chamber p i t the pressure difference to the atmosphere p i t p at acts as a force in opposite direction on the buoy and piston henriques et al 2017a namely 4 f i pto t p i t p at s p for a buoy p i t p at s p for a piston additionally the change rate of the pressure is determined by the power take off pto dynamics by means of the air flow through the turbine and consequently the generator torque our control inputs will act over this force to our system see 2 2 the local wave induced excitation force is obtained as a superposition of n w wave components

friction effects since the bottom of buoy is shaped like a vertically cut ring torus reducing viscous losses however the time domain formulation enables the practical correction to add those terms falnes 2002 2 2 air chamber and turbine model the main assumptions to model the air chamber of wec i are an isentropic compression extension of the air no heat transfer in the chamber walls and small variations in the temperature of the chamber due to continuous in and outflow as in henriques et al 2017a we restate the derivation for completeness and begin with mass balance of the chamber 8 œÅ c i v c i t œÅ c i v c i t m t i t where v c i t denotes the current chamber volume as a function of the relative position between the piston and the buoy with the air density œÅ c i and m t i t the mass flow through the turbine defined positive for an exhalation let us define the dimensionless relative pressure inside the chamber with the atmospheric pressure p at i e 9 p i t p i t p at p at the isentropic process of air compression expansion and considering air as a perfect gas yields 10 œÅ c i t œÅ at p i t 1 1 Œ≥ where Œ≥ 1 4 denotes the specific heat ratio of air is constant under the assumptions taking the logarithmic derivative l f f f of 10 yields 11 Œ≥ œÅ c i t œÅ c i t p i t p i t 1 substituting 10 and 11 into 8 results in 12 p i t Œ≥ m t i t œÅ at v c i t p i t 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ Œ≥ v c i t v c i t p i t 1 now the time rate of change 12 of the dimensionless pressure p i which will be used as a state for the state space representation connects the heave states of the bodies with the turbine and generator dynamics via the mass flow m t i t the modeling of a bi radial turbine has been previously presented in henriques et al 2016b 2017a and henriques et al 2017 the time rate of change of the rotational speed œâ i of the turbine is given by 13 œâ i 1 i t t t i t gen i where i t i is the moment of inertia moi of the i th turbine generator set t t i t gen i are instantaneous torques of the i th turbine and the generator respectively to identify the torque of the turbine it is necessary to regard its performance characteristics which are presented in dimensionless form to normalize those values the rotational speed œâ the turbine diameter d t and the reference air density œÅ in are needed œÅ in is defined under stagnation conditions at the turbine entrance and dependent on the flow direction hence a function of the pressure difference between the chamber and the atmosphere i e 14 œÅ in i œÅ at p i 1 1 Œ≥ if p i 0 exhalation œÅ at if p i 0 inhalation the dimensionless pressure head can now be computed as 15 œà i p at p i œÅ in i œâ i 2 d t 2 with the diameter d t of the turbine in the normalization factor the dimensionless mass flow rate coefficient of a turbine is defined by 16 œÜ i m t i œÅ in i œâ i d t 3 finally the dimensionless power coefficient is given by 17 œÄ i p t i œÅ in i œâ i 3 d t 5 those three characteristic coefficients are related through the turbine efficiency as follows 18 Œ∑ t i œÄ i œÜ i œà i in henriques et al 2016b œÜ i darkred dashdotted line width 1 2pt and Œ∑ t i darkblue dashed line width 1 2 pt are given as

flow rate m t i can be determined from 16 and is a function of the rotational speed which will become important regarding the controllability as stated before an additional high speed stop valve is installed before the biradial turbine to realize for example latching or storm protection henriques et al 2017 2016a assuming the hssv can stop the entire mass flow the mass flow rate can be stated as 19 m t i œâ i 1 p hssv i œÜ i œÅ in i œâ i d t 3 where p hssv i denotes the position of the stop valve and is open for p hssv i 0 and completely closed for p hssv i 1 respectively finally with eqs 17 and 18 all necessary quantities to compute the turbine torque are known i e 20 t t i œÅ in i œâ i 2 d t 5 Œ∑ t i œÜ i œà i the generator power torque t gen i is the commonly used control input to the wec hence the dynamics of the generator turbine set 13 will be included in the state space representation additionally the position of the hssv provides further influence on the pressure change inside the air chamber 2 3 state space representation to obtain a state space model for our array of n wecs we rewrite the equations of motion and introduce the state vector 21 x x pos t x vel t x press t x kin t t which consists of the vectors for heave positions x pos and velocities x vel of the bodies i 2 n the vector for the relative pressure differences inside the air chamber x press of wec i n and the vector of the rotational speeds of the turbines x kin of system i n respectively 22 x pos z 1 z n z 2 n x 1 x n x 2 n x vel z 1 z n z 2 n x 2 n 1 x 3 n x 4 n x pres p 1 p n x 4 n 1 x 5 n x kin œâ

i r in 6 while isolating the highest derivatives on the left hand sight of the equations of motion a 1 is responsible for an interaction between all bodies due to the dependency on the composite force which would otherwise act on a single body namely 25 f x f 1 h x 1 f 1 m x 1 f 1 pto x 4 n 1 f 1 r x vel f 1 ex f n h x n f n m x n f n pto x 5 n f n r x vel f n ex f 2 n h x 2 n 0 f n pto x 5 n f 2 n r x vel f 2 n ex additionally it has to be noted that the velocity component of the radiation force f i r x vel not only does it depend on the states belonging to its own wec system but on the velocities of all other bodies x vel leading to further interactions between all bodies this component has to be regarded as a separate input output system which will be approximated with superposition of linear time invariant state space representations of the form 26a f i j r a i j r f r b i j r z j t 26b f i j r c i j r f i j r d i j r z j t using the same impulse response function as in 7 the sum over the outputs 26b of body i affected by body j results in the desired radiation component on body i 27 f i r j f i j r the system matrices can be of arbitrary dimension but are chosen as a trade off between accuracy and computational effort due to additional states as described in the next section along with the method used to approximate the impulse response functions in starrett et al 2015 the model 26 is directly included in the eom for a single wec system but due to the higher dimensions in this work we have to present the components separately the time rate of changes 28 x pres i f z i z n i z i z n i p i œâ i p hssv i and 29 x kin i f p i œâ i t gen i follow eqs 12 and 13 but are chosen to illustrate the dependencies on the other states in 23 in this model we define our inputs as the generator torque and the position of the hssv i e 30 u gen t gen 1 t gen n and u hssv p hssv 1 p hssv n 3 parameter identification the derived model allows time domain simulations for arbitrary geometries and configurations of floating owcs assuming the main hydrodynamic parameters are available in this work we test the analytic equations based on three floating owcs of the marmok a 5 type developed by oceantec energias marinas weller et al 2017 which is illustrated in a scaled sketch in fig 1 the cross sections of the bodies for 2 follow from 31 s b œÄ d b 2 2 d p 2 2 and s p œÄ d p 2 2 the wecs are arranged in an equilateral triangular array configuration which is found to be optimal for multi directional waves in de andr√©s et al 2014 with each buoy moored independently by three mooring cables building a tripod with an angle Œ≤ with the calm sea surface as illustrated in fig 4 we assume Œ≤ to be constant since the off shore water depth d w is much greater compared to the bodies motion together with choosing the inertia and damping of the cables to be negligible the mooring force on the buoys becomes a linear function of the vertical position greater than the calm sea surface namely 32 f b i m t 3 k m sin 2 Œ≤ z b i t for z b i t 0 and equals zero if the body is immersed below the equilibrium point k m denotes the mooring stiffness of the deployed cables future work will incorporate more detailed non linear mooring models and investigate the differences resulting from varying configurations e g inter body moored or slack mooring in this work we present the effects of different numerical values of k m to illustrate the importance of the mooring force for the power generation instead of using one big turbine two smaller identical biradial turbines with diameter d t and moment of inertia i t are used in the first full scale marmok a 5 prototype with a total rated power of 30 kw in our example this is implemented by multiplying the instantaneous mass flow by two to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients necessary for the forces we model the geometry of the array in the bem solver ansys aqwa release 19 1 with separation d s between each wec system the buoy dimensions are as illustrated in fig 1 and relevant to the actual parameters of the prototype the owc is modeled as a physical body inside the bem modeler with a diameter d p bem d p 0 02 m as pictured by the red dashed box surrounding the piston in fig 1 instead of using a weightless thin plate to represent the water surface inside the chamber as done in the beginning of this study we choose a full column representation of the piston since it reduces numerical instabilities in the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients which agrees with the results of sheng et al 2014 and bosma et al 2017 furthermore the calculated overall mass approaches the actual one which is of importance for the natural frequency of the piston in the time domain simulations the incident wave angle Œ∏ ranges from 60 to 60 in an interval of 8 and from 180 to 180 in an interval of 40 the wave frequency is also divided into multiple ranges f 1 f 2 and f 3 to better cover the areas of interest which require a finer resolution for low frequencies and long wave periods respectively see table 1 the approximation of the infinite frequency for a i j is done with the high frequency œâ hf 100 0 rad s in aqwa 19 1 3 1 hydrodynamic coefficients for a more detailed discussion of the hydrodynamic results the reader is referred to gaebele 2018 the symmetry in the array layout reflects in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the single bodies and can be best presented on the basis of the matrix of the added mass components in 24 since the interactions are reduced to a single value we choose to arrange our matrix so that the first n bodies are represented by the buoys followed by the corresponding pistons in increasing enumeration additionally we display all hydrodynamic coefficients with their physical units the normalization could yield to confusion originating from the different masses of the bodies in fig 5 this matrix is to be read such that the body in front of a row experiences an added mass due to the acceleration of the corresponding body above a column for example element 3 6 expresses the added mass of 15 998 kg on b 3 due to p 3 on the main diagonals we find the effects the individual body experiences based on his own motion surrounded by the solid lines the diagonals of the other blocks represent interactions inside the same wec system namely between buoy and piston the remaining elements represent the cross coupling between spatially distinct wecs and are except for numerical variations equal in between the combinations since the wec are separated with the same distance from the others furthermore the symmetry of the example array configuration allows us to state the hydrodynamic radiation damping coefficients b œâ as eight wave frequency œâ dependent functions instead of 36 as illustrated in fig 6 we continue to use the same color and line style notation as used for the added mass in fig 5 and the results are again given with their physical unit since the choice for a normalization mass would distort the magnitudes while comparing buoys and pistons the radiation damping characteristics induced by a buoy on itself b b i b i and its corresponding piston b p i b i have the largest amplitude of all the combinations and are illustrated in solid darkblue darkblue solid line width 7 and dash dotted crimson crimson dashdotted line width 7 respectively the subscripts b i b i p i b i indicate the equivalence for all wecs i 1 2 3 again we observe symmetry namely four pairs of characteristics each induced by a different body acting on the two bodies from the same wec in other words the buoy and the corresponding piston will always experience similar effects caused by the radiation of any specific body it has to be noted that the radiation damping coefficients due to cross coupling change their sign multiple times over œâ best seen at the dashed blue and red line royalblue dashed line width 0 7 red dashed line width 0 7 representing the effects from a buoy on both bodies in different wecs b b i b j b p i b j i j 1 2 3 i j to obtain the radiation force we would have to solve the convolution integral in 6 with the impulse response function irf of b œâ in eq 7 although we are presenting eight distinct values in our case the radiation forces are still dependent on all other body velocities consequently we would need to solve 2 n 2 convolution integrals at every time step this computational effort can be reduced by approximating f i r with the state space representation 26 after approximating the kernel function with a sum of complex exponentials as discussed in sheng et al 2015 namely 33 k n m t k 1 n k n m Œ± n m k e Œ≤ n m k t n m b i p i i 1 2 3 since all irfs will converge towards zero as time increases here n k n m denotes the order of the approximation and thus the dimension of the intended virtual state vectors we use prony s method to obtain the coefficients Œ± n m k and Œ≤ n m k which arise in pairs of complex conjugates values however as the result of the sum over the pairs we receive a real value using the relation exp z exp x cos y i sin y for z x i y if we choose an even order for the body combinations within the same wec system we choose an order n k n n 4 n b i p i i 1 2 3 the change of the sign in b œâ for the cross coupling combinations requires a higher order of approximation n k n m i e n k n m 8 n m b i p i i 1 2 3 n m since the resulting irf has its peak not at t 0 but shifted in time due to the wave propagation from one wec to another pictured in right plot in fig 7 with the dotted black line black dotted line width 0 7 we choose the example of the buoys for illustration purposes since in this case we observe the worst fit of all body combinations to show the limitations of this method for the cross coupling however the characteristic behavior is mapped with the right amplitude illustrated in dashed blue blue dashed line width 1 2 thus we conclude that the results are reasonable for first investigations the causal discrete transfer functions obtained with prony s method are converted from discrete to continuous time with the used sampling frequency of f samp 25 hz and subsequently converted to the state space form 26 the hydrodynamic excitation force coefficients and the corresponding phase coefficient complete the necessary parameters for the time domain simulation of 23 in fig 8 the combination of Œ≥ b 1 œâ Œ∏ and œÜ b 1 œâ Œ∏ top row see eq 5 and the pair of the corresponding piston Œ≥ p 1 œâ Œ∏ œÜ p 1 œâ Œ∏ bottom is illustrated as an example we observe the result for buoy 2 if we mirror the current plot at Œ∏ 0 due to the symmetry how the incident waves hit the array the plot for buoy 3 is symmetric with respect to the Œ∏ 0 axis due to its position on the x axis which corresponds to the Œ∏ 0 axis for the pistons we find Œ≥ p i œâ Œ∏ to be independent of Œ∏ however the associated œÜ p i œâ Œ∏ do vary in the manner described for the buoy to compute f ex t for the irregular wave case we use a significant wave height h s and dominant period t p to characterize a pierson moskowitz pm wave energy spectrum with the parameters given in falnes 2002 and define an incident wave angle Œ∏ the pm spectrum is sampled at n w 200 wave frequencies œâ k equally distributed over 0 2 rad s 1 to 2 4 rad s 1 during the summation over the wave frequencies Œ≥ i œâ k Œ∏ and œÜ i œâ k Œ∏ are interpolated for constant Œ∏ and the corresponding œâ k on the basis of the illustrated coefficients for the corresponding body finally the shift around the random phase components œï k gives us our six wave excitation force time series regular waves are linearly scaled with Œ≥ i œâ Œ∏ to obtain the excitation force signals for regular wave scenarios 3 2 stabilizing control law henriques et al develop an optimal feedback control law for a practical implementation in henriques et al 2017a based on the maximization of the aerodynamic efficiency of a fixed owc equipped with the same biradial turbine namely 34 u gen a gen œâ b gen 1 the authors compute the time averaged turbine output power for several sea states as a function of the rotational speed to find an optimal set of angular velocities and determine the constants a gen and b gen with a least squares fitting in this work we set the coefficients to a gen 0 0001 and b gen 3 6 following henriques et al 2017a for the same order and we cannot guarantee optimal values for the simulated sea state however they are suitable to achieve realistic results for initial evaluation the exponent of the rotational speed in eq 34 is chosen so that the power of an ideal generator is given by 35 p gen a gen œâ b gen in this baseline model an ideal generator is assumed by means of the electromagnetic torque applied to the turbine will directly result in an energy conversion for future work several generator types will be incorporated into the simulation environment to assess performance using practical devices 4 time domain simulation numerical simulations of the derived state space model 23 are conducted with matlab simulink in the time domain taking into account the nonlinear effects of a compressible fluid in the air chamber and the specific turbine model 4 1 regular waves the first results of the generated power of the three wecs and the corresponding array interaction factor 36 q Œ∏ t p arr 3 p single presented in fig 9 are obtained using regular stokes waves of 3rd order stokes 1847 with wave height of h s 1 m from varying incident wave angles Œ∏ and varying wave periods t the concept of the interaction factor is widely used in the literature on wec arrays and restated in terms of the averaged power of the array p arr Œ∏ t and the averaged power of a single isolated devise p single Œ∏ t in the same wave scenario after sufficiently long simulation time the dynamics reach an asymptotic behavior for every Œ∏ t combination and the last three entire periods of the transient oscillation of each wec are used to compute p arr Œ∏ t which is illustrated in fig 9 on the left to reduce the simulation time around five times we use the terminal state of the previous simulation run as initial condition for the next simulation run with varied incident wave angle of Œ¥ Œ∏ 4 thus reach the transient motion in less time we observe two peaks in the generated power for a varying wave period where the peak at the lower period t 7 3 s results from a decreased oscillation amplitude of the water column and an increased amplitude of the buoy respectively the opposite is the case for the second peak around t 11 2 s where the amplitude of the pistons motions is higher compared to the buoy in both cases the relative motion between the two bodies is locally maximized which is typical for floating two body heaving systems likewise observed for linear frequency domain simulations in gomes et al 2012 the energetic long periodic waves t 14 s result in a motion of both buoy and piston following the water surface elevation hence the relative motion in the floating owc tends towards zero likewise the generated power for short wave periods the excitation force converges towards zero compare Œ≥ i in fig 8 resulting in minimal body motion which also does not yield power generation for t 6 s consequently the peaks in the q factor at the boundaries of the wave period range are not of importance since the significance is lost when dividing a numerically small number by a small number in eq 36 the area of the highest q 1 15 around t 9 25 s 11 2 s implies that the power generation inside the array is increased due to an increase of the pistons motion which can be explained by the hydrodynamic interactions affecting the water columns more relative to the buoys 4 2 irregular waves for more realistic sea states we choose a wave which is irregular in the amplitude but otherwise propagating as a plane wave to be able to distinguish possible interaction effects from the approximation of the diffraction and radiation problem inside the array with the evaluation of the generated power compared to the power generated for the same wave in an isolated device and in terms of differences in the motion of the bodies a wave characterized with the pm spectrum based on h s 2 m and different peak periods t p 6 s 7 s 13 s is the foundation for the excitation force the incident wave angle is chosen to be Œ∏ 15 0 15 30 a further parameter we vary is the mooring stiffness k m 60 kn m 80 kn m 140 kn m to investigate its relevance to the output the generated power p arr is averaged over the time window between 60 and 660 s since we start the simulation from the initial equilibrium and wait for steady state motion in fig 10 p arr is illustrated versus k m and t p in each subplot for a different Œ∏ it has to be noted that the subplots are rotated to enable visualization of each bar but consequently the abscissa and ordinate are decreasing furthermore although unity remains the same color as in fig 9 the colormap has different limits enabling the identification of the maximum and minimum simulated q factor for the irregular waves scenarios in terms of the color of the bars due to symmetry the scenarios for Œ∏ 15 and Œ∏ 15 are equal ignoring minor numerical variations except for t p 6 s decrease in excitation compared to regular waves in fig 9 a decreasing k m yields an increase in p arr since the buoys are less restricted in motion for the irregular waves scenarios we do not observe the two peaks in power as in the regular waves case in fig 9 over the peak wave period but a more evenly distributed power generation generally q 1 for t p 9 s while the highest interaction factor is achieved for Œ∏ 0 t p 12 s and k m 140 kn m however the difference in q is small compared to the regular wave scenario information about the time evolution of the states can be characterized by a single simulation run we set h s 2 m and t p 10 s to emulate a wave which is typically observed in the us pacific northwest lenee bluhm et al 2011 the mooring stiffness is set to k m 80 kn m equal to the regular wave scenario and an incident wave angle Œ∏ 30 results in different arrival times at each wec such that the peaks of the bodies positions are shifted in time in fig 11 we show the heave positions between 460 and 520 s since characteristic effects can be observed during this time window the solid and dashed lines represent the positions of the buoys while the dash dotted and dotted lines of the same color and marker represents the corresponding piston in the sketch of the array in fig 4 the first buoy with heave position x 1 is the furthermost one thus it is reached first by the wave since Œ∏ 0 given in orange solar flare solid line width 1 2pt with circled marker followed by the second wec system illustrated with the blue green dashed line rogue wave dashed line width 1 2pt with square markers the black dashed plot black dashed line width 1 2pt with cross markers shows the motion of the third buoy which is always reached last for the used Œ∏ the differences between a local extrema for different wecs are hard to notice with the naked eye but e g the peak of x 1 before t 490 s is 0 025 m higher than those of the two other buoys generally it can be observed that the motion of the piston is shifted from the buoys motion therefore a varying relative motion inside the two body heaving system results leading to the pressure change in the air chamber this pressure p 1 is illustrated for the first wec with the same orange in fig 12 as dotted line solar flare dotted line width 1 2pt with triangle markers and oscillates about the atmospheric pressure a turbine is accelerated for an inflow as well as an outflow thus the high frequency oscillation on the rotational speed graph in solid orange solar flare solid line width 1 2pt has half of the wave and bodies period we notice high variations in œâ for example from 480 to 490 s since it follows the peaks in the chamber pressure reflecting the varying oscillation amplitudes of our wec systems during this period wec 1 picks up on motion amplitude in addition to a higher difference to the change in the relative position with the corresponding owc this behavior results in an unsteady power output because in this case we do not control the rotational speed based on any other information apart from itself 5 discussion as illustrated by the motions in fig 11 the differences between distinct systems are small compared to the total range of motion in irregular waves additionally in more realistic sea states the computed interaction factor q only varies by 5 this implies that the radiation and diffraction problem inside the investigated array has no greater impact for this specific example which can be explained with the geometry of the marmok a 5 devices the ratio of the diameter d b to the draft is small about 0 14 which is connected to weak radiation properties furthermore the separation distance compared to diameter the has to be mentioned with d s 8 d b the buoys are far apart however d s is chosen this way to guarantee that maintenance ships can navigate between the wec devices without colliding with them since the roll and pitch motion is not yet evaluated in appendix an outlook to include other degrees of freedom and the phenomenon of parametric resonance is given the simulation results herein presented after inspecting the hydrodynamic coefficients of our case study appear to be reasonable the added mass and especially its inverse has the largest entries on its diagonal which implies a high dependency on its own component in the composite force for every wec body additionally the magnitudes of the irfs are small compared to the mass dimensions of the bodies with the cross coupling terms being even smaller by at least an order of magnitude the diffraction inside the array reflected by the differences between the excitation force coefficients is as well marginal and the excitation is much more related to the wave frequency compared to anything else nevertheless the simulation results in regular wave suggest that the employment of this specific floating owcs in an array can widen the range of regular waves frequencies desirable for energy conversion which agrees with q 1 for t p 9 s for the irregular case however we also observe q below unity for some wave periods implying destructive interference which suggest future investigations of different array configurations to be able to optimize the layout and separation for different wave climates for the floating owcs and compare the results to existing approaches on different two body heaving systems de andr√©s et al 2014 or fixed owcs sharp et al 2017 2018 the differences resulting from varying incident wave angle Œ∏ are again marginal due to the symmetry of the array but cannot be generalized for non symmetric configurations subsequent work will also consider the effects of viscous drag forces to obtain a more practical representation the pto and the air chamber model are highly nonlinear and the strong changes in simulated rotational speed in fig 12 suggest further investigations of a sliding mode controller which with its discontinuous nature should perform well in maintaining a constant œâ this rotational speed will be set to a value resulting in an improved efficiency of the turbine to this date the authors do not know of any studies addressing optimal control of floating owc parks with nonlinear pto future research will aim for semi global control of sub array off several devices followed by decentralized supervising control for entire wec parks large arrays of wec devices will need different methodologies to model the hydrodynamic interactions this work can serve as basis for the comparison of results when methods to derive the diffraction and radiation capabilities based on the hydrodynamics of an single device like mcnatt et al 2015 are adapted to floating owcs 6 conclusion we derived a methodology to efficiently model full scale arrays of floating owcs taking hydrodynamic interactions between all distinct bodies into account without making simplification in the devices geometries as well as connected them to a nonlinear air chamber turbine model the approach is neither limited to an symmetric array nor to identical devices but to the availability of the linear hydrodynamic coefficients simulated for the entire configuration the case study of the marmok a 5 is used since it is one kind of device that has actually been deployed and tested in the ocean we found that for the assumed separation between the single devices we could neglect the cross coupling between the wecs in irregular waves but not in regular waves however different mooring configurations or further insights in the real world constraints of the array placement could justify a smaller separation and consequently higher hydrodynamic interactions nevertheless the analytic model can be used to design more advanced control strategies like nonlinear sliding mode control to maintain a constant rotational speed or methods aiming to optimize the power generation for example by means of smoothing the power output the next step in our research will consider semi global control approaches for sub arrays followed by supervisory control for entire wec parks acknowledgment this research was kindly sponsored by the national science foundation usa award number 1711859 appendix multiple degrees of freedom increasing the number of the degrees of freedom dof in the presented coupled model can be achieved by expanding the system equations namely by adding more spatial states to the sub state vectors x pos and consequently to x vel the procedure is illustrated with help of the roll angle œï as an example the time derivative of the bodies velocities from 23 evolves to 37 x vel z œï a 1 a z œï 1 a œï z 1 a œï œï 1 f x t œï x here a i j 1 r 2 n 2 n is defined in the same manner as a 1 is defined in section and the subscripts denote the interaction from the dof j to i the accumulated torques on the roll axis are represented by t œï x and would not act on the pistons the second part of radiation problem eq 6 can be obtained as described in section 3 1 however the necessary interaction terms increase quadratically with the number of dofs n dof namely 2 n n dof 2 therefore a trade off between accuracy and computational effort has to be obtained by neglecting the non significant interactions the coupling of at least two dofs enables the phenomenon of parametric resonance to occur under the condition that the incident wave frequency is approximately twice the pitch or roll natural frequency rodr√≠guez and neves 2016 rho et al 2005 this dynamic instability is commonly found in spar type oscillating water columns extracting energy in heave direction gomes et al 2017 the state equations are further coupled by the metacentric height gm in t œï x which varies with instantaneous heave position of the device directly affecting the center of buoyancy of the spar if the gm becomes negative the motion becomes unstable decreasing the extracted power since kinetic energy is transferred from the heave mode to the pitch mode rho et al 2005 those phenomena have to noted if more detailed studies of the motion of

and design and are found throughout the entire fishing system including warps sweeps bridles headline fishingline and forward panels of the trawl garner 1978 sainsbury 1996 the resulting underwater shape of a trawl and the 3 dimensional 3d position of various trawl components are greatly affected by the hydrodynamic properties of the ropes used in its construction thus studies on the interaction

towing applications such as midwater trawls helical ropes commonly known as helix ropes are similar in many respects to traditional ropes but include the added feature of a smaller rope twisted over the surface of the main rope the physical shape is very similar to a cylinder with thinner wire twisted over the surface thus previous scientific findings on cylinders with an outer helical wire can be instructive for current and future studies on helix ropes used in fishing gears there are a number of past studies on fluid patterns around plain rough and helical covered cylindrical structures by disrupting fluid flow around a cylinder by using rough elements or helical fins on the surface a reduction in structural vibration and stress can be obtained as well as enhancing the early transition of the laminar boundary layer into turbulent flow resulting in a smaller drag coefficient rhahi 1991 yang et al 1994 evidence has shown that the addition of roughness on the surface of a cylinder can shift the boundary layer at transition state to a lower reynolds number 8 104 compared to the transition state of a smooth cylinder at reynold number 2 105 achenbach 1971 potter et al 2016 moreover adding rough structures on the surface may shift the separation point closer to the rear stagnation point resulting in a smaller wake width and less drag rhahi 1991 for instance the attachment of a triangular wedge pointing downstream on the rear side of a smooth cylinder can reduce the drag coefficient from 1 19 to 0 89 hoerner 1965 for wire wrapped cylinders below the subcritical regime when the wire diameter is appreciably less than the size of the boundary layer thickness there is no change in drag coefficient with respect to corresponding values of smooth cylinders however when the helical wire diameter is much larger than the estimated boundary layer thickness the drag coefficient becomes greater than the corresponding value for a smooth cylinder nassif et al 1989 winkel and

parallel to the direction of the water flow for the purpose of measuring drag d while the other was positioned perpendicular to water flow for the purpose of measuring lift l yaw rotation along the z

forces the hydrodynamic force on a rope is represented only in the plane defined by water speed and the rope which is sum of lift and drag forces lift l is the sum of vertical forces due to components pressures and shears and drag d is the sum of the horizontal forces due to components pressures and shears cengel 2010 garrison 1985 hoerner 1965 this is put into a more general form referred to as the cross flow principle where l is normal to the flow and d is inline with the flow both of which are components of the resistance force r which is normal to the rope when rope aligned at a certain angle to flow direction however the resultant resistance force direction is dependent on drag and lift forces fridman and carrothers 1986 hoerner 1965 see fig 3b moreover when the rope is parallel to the water flow the resistance force will be in the same direction as of flow and drag the magnitude of the resistance force r is expressed as 6 r l 2 d 2 1 2 the resistance force also can also be defined as the sum of normal force n and tangential force t and its magnitude expressed as 7 r n 2 t 2 1 2 however the tangential and resistance forces are related by an equation 8 t n t a n Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the angle of attack in a similar manner the coefficient of resistance force c r can be obtained from drag and lift coefficients the coefficient of tangential force c t can be determined from the angle of attack and normal force coefficient c n 2 5 data treatment and statistical analysis millivolt signals generated by the load cells were processed using a signal conditioning amplifier which boosted the signal to a level 0 10 vdc compatible with our data acquisition hardware which logged the data at a frequency of 50 hz the resulting loads kgf were imported into ms excel for initial data exploration and removal of outliers see tsukrov et al 2011 for methodology the known force of the bare frame without ropes for each test condition was then subtracted to determine the forces generated by the ropes themselves the processed dataset was saved as text tab delimited file for statistical analysis using r studio software for comparison of the drag and lift coefficients we used the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test to compare each of the datasets collected at each water velocity and angle of attack we used one way anova and tukey hsd tukey honest significant difference to compare the mean lift and drag forces produced by the ropes 3 results 3 1 coefficients of lift and drag fig 4 a c illustrates the relationship between the coefficient of lift c l and angle of attack for conventional and helix ropes at varying water velocities in general the maximum c l was obtained at 45 and 61 for all rope types while the minimum c l was obtained at 0 and 90 angles of attack variation among the rope types was most notable at the 61 angle of attack for example at a water velocity of 0 9 m s and an angle of attack of 61 the c l for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 were 0 62 0 66 and 0 47 respectively for 8 mm ropes under the same conditions the c l for hes 8 hez 8 and pa 8 were 0 55 0 59 and 0 54 respectively similarly for 14 mm ropes the c l of hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 were 0 55 0 57 and 0 57 respectively however despite few variation in c l values most pairwise comparisons revealed no significant differences among the coefficients for a given rope diameter water velocity and angle of attack i e d value d critical at Œ± 0 25 in other words neither the direction of lay s or z material pa or pe or the presence absence of the helix helical had a detectable effect on the resulting coefficient of lift c l p 0 05 fig 5 a c illustrates the relationship between the coefficient of drag c d and the angle of attack for conventional and helix ropes at varying water velocities for all rope types the lowest c d occurred at 0 increasing rapidly with increasing angle of attack deviation in c d among the different rope types was most notable at the 61 and 90 angles of attack for example at a water velocity of 0 9 m s and an angle of attack of 90 the c d for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 were 1 91 1 99 and 1 79 respectively for 8 mm ropes under the same conditions the c d for hes 8 hez 8 and pa 8 were 1 81 1 72 and 1 71 respectively similarly for 14 mm ropes the c d for hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 were 1 81 1 8 and 1 72 respectively however despite few variation in c d values most pairwise comparisons revealed no significant differences among the coefficients for a given rope diameter water velocity and angle of attack d value d critical Œ± 0 25 in other words neither the direction of lay s or z material pa or pe nor the presence absence of the helix had a detectable effect on the resulting coefficient of drag c d p 0 05 fig 6 illustrates the drag and lift coefficients of 6 mm rope samples calculated using the cross flow principle described in equations 4 and 5 both conventional and helix ropes show a very similar trend with increasing angle of attack the relationship for c d was sigmoidal characterized by an increasing slope near 30 maximum steepness near 60 decreasing slope near 80 with maximum c d values observed at 90 the relationship for c l was bell shaped characterized by minimum values at 0 and 90 and maximum values near 55 the trend was also very similar to that obtained by madsen et al 2011 and kristiansen et al 2015 for different fiber net panels 3 2 lift and drag forces figs 7 and 8 provide a direct comparison of the lift and drag kgf forces observed for the different rope types at a water velocity of 0 9 m s and 20 angle of attack which are the conditions most comparable to trawling applications the results reveal that for a given rope diameter the type of rope had significant effect on both the lift and drag measured see table 2√£ b for anova results these differences were statistically detectable for both lift and drag at all three diameters p 0 001 for 6 mm ropes the mean lift force for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 was 2 24 kg 2 49 kg and 2 08 kg respectively similarly for 8 mm ropes hes 8 and hez 8 showed 9 32 and 9 74 increase with respect to pa 8 once again for 14 mm ropes hes 14 and hez 14 gained 7 9 increase and 8 6 increase with respect to pa 14 for 6 mm ropes drag force for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 were 5 51 kg 5 58 kg and 4 85 kg respectively similarly for 8 mm rope samples hes 8 and hez 8 possessed 6 9 and 9 3 increase with respect to pa 8 for 14 mm rope samples hes 14 and hez 14 gained a 19 5 and 15 5 increase with respect to pa 14 subsequent pairwise comparisons are shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of reynolds number hydrodynamic coefficients of ropes in trawling applications depends on their geometry material composition and reynolds number fridman and carrothers 1986 using data collected in the previous experiment we examined the hydrodynamic coefficients c l and c d with increasing reynolds number re for the 14 mm ropes hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 fig 10 reveals inconsistency at lower reynolds numbers however for reynolds numbers above 8 103 the mean deviations of c l of the hes 14 and hez 14 with respect to pa 14 were 31 3 and 18 8 for c d both conventional and helix ropes showed very similar values for re ranges from 4 103 to 10 103 however for re above 10 103 the mean deviations of c d of the hes 14 and hez 14 with respect to pa 14 were 5 1 and 7 7 kolmogorov smirnov pairwise comparisons revealed no statistical difference d value d critical Œ± 0 05 for any corresponding pair of c l and c d at each water velocity 3 4 coefficients of normal and tangential resistance forces normal c n and tangential c t force coefficients were calculated for 14 mm rope samples specifically hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 table 3 lists the resulting values at different angles of attack and a water velocity of 0 9 m s overall the coefficient of tangential force c t showed a declining trend with increasing attack angle however the coefficient of normal force c n showed an increasing trend with increasing attack angle as it is mainly dependent on the drag coefficient moreover tangential force coefficients in conventional and helix ropes are shown to be very similar at different attack angles 4 discussion previous studies evaluating the hydrodynamic forces produced by ropes and netting have been conducted at flume tanks located in south korea lee et al 2007 and denmark madsen et al 2011 our study was similar to these experiments in its use of a metal frame rotated in the yaw direction to achieve different angles of attack to the water current however our experimental design differed with respect to instrumentation lee et al 2007 and madsen et al 2011 both mounted their metal frame directly to a multi axis force torque sensor for the measurement of lift and drag forces our design by comparison used two inline load cells for the measurement of drag and lift forces our yaw rotation was controlled by shortening a pair of bridles which was time consuming and proved difficult for attaining a desired attack angle nevertheless our approach was found to perform well producing accurate and repeatable estimates of lift and drag lift forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes when tested at the same water velocities and angles of attack this represents the first known evidence of its kind published in the scientific literature it supports the claims of existing patents e g safwat and perevoshchikov 2005 erlendsson and safwat 2012 and validates the concept of self spreading midwater trawls hampidjan 2018 though not directly investigated in this study the ability of helix ropes to increase lift has significant application for midwater trawling use of helix ropes could theoretically increase the mouth opening of a trawl allowing vessels to achieve the same mouth opening as conventional trawls but with reduced door size floatation on the headline and weights on the footline this in turn could reduce fuel consumption gear size speed up hauling and setting operation and improve fishing efficiency drag forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes when tested at the same water velocities and angles of attack we attribute this finding to the fact that our flume tank could only achieve a maximum velocity of 0 9 m s thus we conducted our experiment within the subcritical region low re nassif et al 1989 and were not able to observe an earlier transition and a quick declining trend of drag for the helical ropes we speculate that a reduction in drag would have been detected had we tested at higher velocities i e higher re achenbach 1971 found that the surface roughness of the cylinder had no effect on drag at low reynold numbers in subcritical regions however at upper end of subcritical the early transition of the laminar boundary to turbulent boundary can be obtained through the addition of a helical wire on a smooth cylinder yang et al 1994 this transition might be attained at re between 2 104 10 104 potter et al 2016 goldstein 1938 found at re above 5 0 104 drag reduction could be attained by placing thinner wires at 65 from front stagnation point around a smooth cylinder this arrangement was able to delay the separation by causing the boundary layer to become turbulent which resulted in reduced drag in another study ferro 1990 documented that stranded rough cables had lower drag coefficient than smooth cables when towed behind a research vessel at velocities between 0 4 m s 2 8 m s taken together these results lead us to speculate that at higher water velocities the helix ropes used in this study would exhibit reduced drag in comparison to conventional ropes moreover trend of the hydrodynamic coefficients at low reynolds numbers 0 3 m s flow speed should be investigated in the future 5 conclusion in this study we observed the basic parameters that are essential for characterizing the hydrodynamic properties of ropes helix nylon and polyethylene used for construction of midwater trawls using a flume tank we evaluated the drag and lift forces for 17 different ropes at various water velocities and angles of attack in summary we found these results based on comparative analysis in specified test conditions 4 51 102 re 1 24 104 no statistical difference was detected among coefficients of lift c l and drag c d for helix and conventional ropes lift l forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes drag d forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes in conclusion the hydrodynamic properties of helix ropes are uniquely different from conventional polyethylene pe and nylon pa ropes however the study was not without its limitations due to the slower water velocities used 0 9 m s we did not detect a reduction in drag for helix ropes which was expected we recommend future studies be conducted at higher velocities higher re as well as numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics cfd both of which can more closely approximate actual towing speeds 2 8 4 0kn of midwater trawls acknowledgements this study was funded by the ocean frontier institute ofi canada fisheries and marine institute of memorial university

at re 0 i e at no flow condition the coefficients of drag c d Œ∏ and lift c l Œ∏ as function of attack angle are expressed as 4 c d Œ∏ c d 90 c d 0 s i n 3 Œ∏ c d 0 5 c l Œ∏ c d 90 c d 0 s i n 2 Œ∏ c o s Œ∏ c l 0 where c d90 and c d0 are the calculated coefficient of drag at 90 and 0 attack angles and c l0 is the calculated lift coefficient at 0 attack angle 2 4 normal and tangential resistance forces the hydrodynamic force on a rope is represented only in the plane defined by water speed and the rope which is sum of lift and drag forces lift l is the sum of vertical forces due to components pressures and shears and drag d is the sum of the horizontal forces due to components pressures and shears cengel 2010 garrison 1985 hoerner 1965 this is put into a more general form referred to as the cross flow principle where l is normal to the flow and d is inline with the flow both of which are components of the resistance force r which is normal to the rope when rope aligned at a certain angle to flow direction however the resultant resistance force direction is dependent on drag and lift forces fridman and carrothers 1986 hoerner 1965 see fig 3b moreover when the rope is parallel to the water flow the resistance force will be in the same direction as of flow and drag the magnitude of the resistance force r is expressed as 6 r l 2 d 2 1 2 the resistance force also can also be defined as the sum of normal force n and tangential force t and its magnitude expressed as 7 r n 2 t 2 1 2 however the tangential and resistance forces are related by an equation 8 t n t a n Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the angle of attack in a similar manner the coefficient of resistance force c r can be obtained from drag and lift coefficients the coefficient of tangential force c t can be determined from the angle of attack and normal force coefficient c n 2 5 data treatment and statistical analysis millivolt signals generated by the load cells were processed using a signal conditioning amplifier which boosted the signal to a level 0 10 vdc compatible with our data acquisition hardware which logged the data at a frequency of 50 hz the resulting loads kgf were imported into ms excel for initial data exploration and removal of outliers see tsukrov et al 2011 for methodology the known force of the bare frame without ropes for each test condition was then subtracted to determine the forces generated by the ropes themselves the processed dataset was saved as text tab delimited file for statistical analysis using r studio software for comparison of the drag and lift coefficients we used the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test to compare each of the datasets collected at each water velocity and angle of attack we used one way anova and tukey hsd tukey honest significant difference to compare the mean lift and drag forces produced by the ropes 3 results 3 1 coefficients of lift and drag fig 4 a c illustrates the relationship between the coefficient of lift c l and angle of attack for conventional and helix ropes at varying water velocities in general the maximum c l was obtained at 45 and 61 for all rope types while the minimum c l was obtained at 0 and 90 angles of attack variation among the rope types was most notable at the 61 angle of attack for example at a water velocity of 0 9 m s and an angle of attack of 61 the c l for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 were 0 62 0 66 and 0 47 respectively for 8 mm ropes under the same conditions the c l for hes 8 hez 8 and pa 8 were 0 55 0 59 and 0 54 respectively similarly for 14 mm ropes the c l of hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 were 0 55 0 57 and 0 57 respectively however despite few variation in c l values most pairwise comparisons revealed no significant differences among the coefficients for a given rope diameter water velocity and angle of attack i e d value d critical at Œ± 0 25 in other words neither the direction of lay s or z material pa or pe or the presence absence of the helix helical had a detectable effect on the resulting coefficient of lift c l p 0 05 fig 5 a c illustrates the relationship between the coefficient of drag c d and the angle of attack for conventional and helix ropes at varying water velocities for all rope types the lowest c d occurred at 0 increasing rapidly with increasing angle of attack deviation in c d among the different rope types was most notable at the 61 and 90 angles of attack for example at a water velocity of 0 9 m s and an angle of attack of 90 the c d for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 were 1 91 1 99 and 1 79 respectively for 8 mm ropes under the same conditions the c d for hes 8 hez 8 and pa 8 were 1 81 1 72 and 1 71 respectively similarly for 14 mm ropes the c d for hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 were 1 81 1 8 and 1 72 respectively however despite few variation in c d values most pairwise comparisons revealed no significant differences among the coefficients for a given rope diameter water velocity and angle of attack d value d critical Œ± 0 25 in other words neither the direction of lay s or z material pa or pe nor the presence absence of the helix had a detectable effect on the resulting coefficient of drag c d p 0 05 fig 6 illustrates the drag and lift coefficients of 6 mm rope samples calculated using the cross flow principle described in equations 4 and 5 both conventional and helix ropes show a very similar trend with increasing angle of attack the relationship for c d was sigmoidal characterized by an increasing slope near 30 maximum steepness near 60 decreasing slope near 80 with maximum c d values observed at 90 the relationship for c l was bell shaped characterized by minimum values at 0 and 90 and maximum values near 55 the trend was also very similar to that obtained by madsen et al 2011 and kristiansen et al 2015 for different fiber net panels 3 2 lift and drag forces figs 7 and 8 provide a direct comparison of the lift and drag kgf forces observed for the different rope types at a water velocity of 0 9 m s and 20 angle of attack which are the conditions most comparable to trawling applications the results reveal that for a given rope diameter the type of rope had significant effect on both the lift and drag measured see table 2√£ b for anova results these differences were statistically detectable for both lift and drag at all three diameters p 0 001 for 6 mm ropes the mean lift force for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 was 2 24 kg 2 49 kg and 2 08 kg respectively similarly for 8 mm ropes hes 8 and hez 8 showed 9 32 and 9 74 increase with respect to pa 8 once again for 14 mm ropes hes 14 and hez 14 gained 7 9 increase and 8 6 increase with respect to pa 14 for 6 mm ropes drag force for hes 6 hez 6 and pa 6 were 5 51 kg 5 58 kg and 4 85 kg respectively similarly for 8 mm rope samples hes 8 and hez 8 possessed 6 9 and 9 3 increase with respect to pa 8 for 14 mm rope samples hes 14 and hez 14 gained a 19 5 and 15 5 increase with respect to pa 14 subsequent pairwise comparisons are shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of reynolds number hydrodynamic coefficients of ropes in trawling applications depends on their geometry material composition and reynolds number fridman and carrothers 1986 using data collected in the previous experiment we examined the hydrodynamic coefficients c l and c d with increasing reynolds number re for the 14 mm ropes hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 fig 10 reveals inconsistency at lower reynolds numbers however for reynolds numbers above 8 103 the mean deviations of c l of the hes 14 and hez 14 with respect to pa 14 were 31 3 and 18 8 for c d both conventional and helix ropes showed very similar values for re ranges from 4 103 to 10 103 however for re above 10 103 the mean deviations of c d of the hes 14 and hez 14 with respect to pa 14 were 5 1 and 7 7 kolmogorov smirnov pairwise comparisons revealed no statistical difference d value d critical Œ± 0 05 for any corresponding pair of c l and c d at each water velocity 3 4 coefficients of normal and tangential resistance forces normal c n and tangential c t force coefficients were calculated for 14 mm rope samples specifically hes 14 hez 14 and pa 14 table 3 lists the resulting values at different angles of attack and a water velocity of 0 9 m s overall the coefficient of tangential force c t showed a declining trend with increasing attack angle however the coefficient of normal force c n showed an increasing trend with increasing attack angle as it is mainly dependent on the drag coefficient moreover tangential force coefficients in conventional and helix ropes are shown to be very similar at different attack angles 4 discussion previous studies evaluating the hydrodynamic forces produced by ropes and netting have been conducted at flume tanks located in south korea lee et al 2007 and denmark madsen et al 2011 our study was similar to these experiments in its use of a metal frame rotated in the yaw direction to achieve different angles of attack to the water current however our experimental design differed with respect to instrumentation lee et al 2007 and madsen et al 2011 both mounted their metal frame directly to a multi axis force torque sensor for the measurement of lift and drag forces our design by comparison used two inline load cells for the measurement of drag and lift forces our yaw rotation was controlled by shortening a pair of bridles which was time consuming and proved difficult for attaining a desired attack angle nevertheless our approach was found to perform well producing accurate and repeatable estimates of lift and drag lift forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes when tested at the same water velocities and angles of attack this represents the first known evidence of its kind published in the scientific literature it supports the claims of existing patents e g safwat and perevoshchikov 2005 erlendsson and safwat 2012 and validates the concept of self spreading midwater trawls hampidjan 2018 though not directly investigated in this study the ability of helix ropes to increase lift has significant application for midwater trawling use of helix ropes could theoretically increase the mouth opening of a trawl allowing vessels to achieve the same mouth opening as conventional trawls but with reduced door size floatation on the headline and weights on the footline this in turn could reduce fuel consumption gear size speed up hauling and setting operation and improve fishing efficiency drag forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes when tested at the same water velocities and angles of attack we attribute this finding to the fact that our flume tank could only achieve a maximum velocity of 0 9 m s thus we conducted our experiment within the subcritical region low re nassif et al 1989 and were not able to observe an earlier transition and a quick declining trend of drag for the helical ropes we speculate that a reduction in drag would have been detected had we tested at higher velocities i e higher re achenbach 1971 found that the surface roughness of the cylinder had no effect on drag at low reynold numbers in subcritical regions however at upper end of subcritical the early transition of the laminar boundary to turbulent boundary can be obtained through the addition of a helical wire on a smooth cylinder yang et al 1994 this transition might be attained at re between 2 104 10 104 potter et al 2016 goldstein 1938 found at re above 5 0 104 drag reduction could be attained by placing thinner wires at 65 from front stagnation point around a smooth cylinder this arrangement was able to delay the separation by causing the boundary layer to become turbulent which resulted in reduced drag in another study ferro 1990 documented that stranded rough cables had lower drag coefficient than smooth cables when towed behind a research vessel at velocities between 0 4 m s 2 8 m s taken together these results lead us to speculate that at higher water velocities the helix ropes used in this study would exhibit reduced drag in comparison to conventional ropes moreover trend of the hydrodynamic coefficients at low reynolds numbers 0 3 m s flow speed should be investigated in the future 5 conclusion in this study we observed the basic parameters that are essential for characterizing the hydrodynamic properties of ropes helix nylon and polyethylene used for construction of midwater trawls using a flume tank we evaluated the drag and lift forces for 17 different ropes at various water velocities and angles of attack in summary we found these results based on comparative analysis in specified test conditions 4 51 102 re 1 24 104 no statistical difference was detected among coefficients of lift c l and drag c d for helix and conventional ropes lift l forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes drag d forces were higher for helix ropes compared to conventional ropes in conclusion the hydrodynamic properties of helix ropes are uniquely different from conventional polyethylene pe and nylon pa ropes however the study was not without its limitations due to the slower water velocities used 0 9 m s we did not detect a reduction in drag for helix ropes which was expected we recommend future studies be conducted at higher velocities higher re as well as numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics cfd both of which can more closely approximate actual towing speeds 2 8 4 0kn of midwater trawls acknowledgements this study was funded by the ocean frontier institute ofi canada fisheries and marine institute of memorial university
