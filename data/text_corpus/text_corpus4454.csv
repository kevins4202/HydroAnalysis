22270,vortex ring thruster vrt is a new type of propulsion device which adopts impulse propulsion mode the idea of impulse propulsion comes from bionics it imitates cephalopods like squid and can achieve high efficiency vortex ring is a typical phenomenon during the pulse process and it can help improve the propulsion efficiency many previous studies believe that vrt can obtain large thrust and efficiency but few articles study the efficiency problem systematically in addition experiment is the main research method adopted at present in this paper an axisymmetric piston nozzle computational model is established to simulate the thruster fluid is solved by cfd method based on the open source platform openfoam dynamic mesh technology is adopted to control piston motion this paper focus on two aspects vortex ring evolution and propulsion efficiency characteristics in the first part simulations of pulse process with different strokes are carried out and compared with standard experiments the two results are in good agreement the vortex ring evolution is then studied with different background flows in the second part a reasonable open water characteristics calculation method for vrt is proposed thrust coefficient and propulsion efficiency are obtained in the calculation the results indicate that the vrt can achieve high efficiency near to 1 in the case of high advance ratio in addition efficiency comparison is carried out between four kinds of asymmetric velocity programs and three kinds of symmetric velocity programs to find out a more reasonable velocity program design finally the impact of piston stroke is investigated results show that smaller stroke can obtain larger efficiency because pulsation effect is more prominent keywords vortex ring thruster evolution of vortex ring propulsion efficiency openfoam 1 introduction propeller is the most common propulsion device for the existing underwater vehicles because of stability and convenience however propeller propulsion can cause some inherent energy loss propeller generates thrust depending on the rotation of the blades swirl velocity of water is generated because of the spin of the blades water kinetic energy due to the swirl of water does not contribute to the generation of thrust and therefore it is an energy waste previous studies van terwisga 2013 have shown that this rotational kinetic energy losses can be as high as nearly 20 these energy losses are unavoidable for propeller no matter how optimized thus it is very essential to adopt a new kind of propulsion without rotational energy loss the impulse propulsion was developed against this background the idea of impulse propulsion comes from bionics as a result of natural selection fast moving marine animals like squid choose impulse mode to swim this propulsion mode can be simplified to a system consisting of a piston and a nozzle in this system the thrust is produced by the piston pushing water because the piston surface always maintains normal to the flow or the thrust axis during the stroke this propulsion system has no rotational energy loss and can achieve relatively high efficiency at the same time the pulse process is often accompanied by the generation of the vortex ring the vortex ring had been proved that plays an important role in the propulsion and because of its remarkable effect the impulse propulsion device is called vortex ring thruster vrt based on the above two contents many scholars have carried out investigation in the past several years new and yu 2015 vortex ring is a typical phenomenon in pulse process a great number of experimental works have been carried out to study vortex ring in the starting flow generated from a piston nozzle apparatus gharib et al 1998 carried out experimental studies about the formation process of the vortex ring a piston nozzle apparatus was used in their experiment to investigate the formation process of vortex rings for a wide range of piston stroke to cylinder diameter lm d ratio several important conclusions were obtained in their studies which become key basis for follow up researches for cases lm d 4 the leading vortex ring is small and there is no trailing vorticity behind the vortex ring for cases lm d 4 it appears that the leading vortex ring is nearly saturated for cases lm d 4 there is an obvious trailing vorticity behind the leading vortex ring thus a non dimensional time called the formation time is defined equals to 4 in their experiment at the same time rosenfeld et al 1998 carried out cfd simulation to investigate the same problem as gharib et al 1998 they found that for the cases lm d 4 the leading vortex ring moves faster and would break off from the trailing vorticity behind this phenomenon is called pinch off it is worth noting that their studies were carried out without background flow krueger et al 2003 used similar test equipment as gharib et al 1998 to investigate the vortex ring pinch off in the presence of simultaneously initiated uniform background co flow according to their conclusion the formation time is significantly reduced with the effect of background velocity different from krueger et al 2003 jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 set a fully developed background co flow and wake of the nozzle was also present the strong interaction between the vortex ring and the nozzle wake was studied in their research on the other hand many studies have analyzed the mechanism how vortex ring improves propulsive thrust krueger 2001 used a piston cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets krueger and gharib 2003 2005 analyzed the interaction between the vortex ring and the surrounding fluid in detail as the vortex ring moves forward it draw in the surrounding fluid which accelerates the otherwise static fluid to the average velocity of the vortex ring motion thus the momentum of the vortex ring becomes larger because of the entrained fluid according to the newton s third law the force of the fluid against the thruster increases it was also observed in their experiment that the total thrust generated per pulse is much more than that due to momentum flux from the jet alone the difference is largely due to the over pressure effect at the nozzle exit during vortex ring formation dabiri and gharib 2004 carried out detailed study focusing on the fluid entrainment by isolated vortex rings cater et al 2004 studied the interaction between piston vortex and primary leading vortex ring in detail in their experiments the influence of piston vortex on the primary vortex ring was small when the piston was far away from the nozzle exit however when the piston vortex was ejected into the flow it increased the circulation and fluctuation of primary vortex ring lim et al 2001 2006 and new et al 2003 2006 carried out very detailed experimental studies on the evolution and influencing factors of vortex rings in cross flow because of the complex interaction between the jet and the cross flow four kinds of vortex structures were formed they are the leading edge vortex the horseshoe vortex the wake vortex and the counter rotating vortex pair the effects of jet exit shape and velocity profile on the vortex ring evolution were analyzed in detail more recently cheng et al 2009 2010 2016 adopted lattice boltzmann method to simulate vortex ring the simulation results were proved to be reliable besides the influence of shear flow and the complex evolution process of elliptic vortex rings with different aspect ratios are analyzed based on the researches introduced above it is generally accepted that pulse propulsion can get a really high efficiency because there is no rotational energy loss and vortex rings can manipulate the over pressure at the nozzle exit and entrain fluid thus many studies were carried out using the vortex ring thrust vrt as propulsion device to investigate the thrust performance kamran mohseni 2006 designed a pulsatile vortex generator for low speed maneuvering of small underwater vehicles by combining the device and the main propeller the performance of the underwater vehicle was improved krieg and mohseni 2008 studied the thrust characterization of vortex ring thruster by open water experiment the results show that thrust increases with frequency and stroke then krieg and mohseni 2010 designed the dynamic control system for this vortex ring thruster and the corresponding underwater vehicle based on the system the vehicle achieved three different maneuver regimes including cruising docking and transition regimes for the investigation of propulsive efficiency moslemi and krueger 2010 studied experimentally on a self propelled pulsed jet underwater vehicle propulsive efficiency in their study is generally defined as the ratio of the useful propulsive power output to the total power exerted propelling the vehicle which is given by 1 η p w u w u e e x f t u v f t u v e e x where u v is the average vehicle velocity and both f t and e e x can be obtained from the dpiv measurement ruiz et al 2011 designed a self propelled underwater vehicle with the capability to operate using either steady jet propulsion or a pulsed jet mode that features the roll up of large scale vortex rings in the near wake in their study a drag based hydrodynamic efficiency for the vehicle is defined as 2 η h f d u s u b f d u s u b 0 5 ρ a o u t u w u w u 2 by this calculation method the experiments demonstrate an obvious increment in propulsive efficiency over 50 greater than the efficiency of the steady jet mode in addition there are some new researches about the soft internal structure of the vortex ring thruster system serchi et al 2013 renda et al 2015 serchi and weymouth 2017 their studies proved that soft bodied vehicles can benefit from exploiting their own body deformation to obtain larger propulsive forces among the past researches about the propulsive efficiency of the vortex ring thruster the experimental study of underwater vehicle model is the most common method few articles use cfd method to study the efficiency problem systematically and the efficiency calculation methods are generally defined for whole vehicle in experiment in this paper the authors use cfd method to study open water performance of the vortex ring thruster firstly the basic vortex ring evolution is simulated using the same geometry and condition with gharib et al 1998 and jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 for comparison then the impact of background flow on the vortex ring evolution is investigated for the thrust and efficiency study the authors propose an open water characteristic calculation method detailed analysis is carried out about the force on piston the thrust and the efficiency with different piston velocity program nozzle length and piston stroke 2 numerical design 2 1 computational domain in this paper a piston nozzle apparatus is established to simulate the thruster only the thruster model is built in order to perform an open water simulation the whole computational domain is axisymmetric consisting of a piston nozzle apparatus and outer flow domain the domain configuration is shown in fig 1 the details of the domain dimension and boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 dimensions of the piston and nozzle are exactly the same as previous experiments of gharib et al 1998 the inner diameter d of nozzle is 0 0254m and the total length of the nozzle lp is 0 4m which limits the maximum stroke ratio l d max to 15 7 the nozzle exit adopts a sharp wedged form with a tip angle of 20 the outer flow domain spans 10d in the streamwise direction and 2 5d in the radial direction the piston surface is a motion boundary moving velocity up in x direction is imposed on the boundary throughout the whole pulse pushing process in the simulation the average of up is equal to 0 1524 m s for all cases no slip boundary condition is adopted in the inner surface of nozzle so that the vortex ring can be generated by the shear layer the side boundary of the outer domain uses slip boundary condition the left patch of the outer flow domain is a wall boundary for the conditions without background flow and an inlet boundary with a velocity us for cases with background flow in order to better describe the calculation conditions and results in the following simulations two non dimensional times are defined as 3 t l m d u p t d 4 t l d u p t d where l m is piston stroke l is the distance of piston motion d is the inner diameter of nozzle u p is piston velocity thus t represents the total moving time of the piston and t represent the time piston is moving 2 2 governing equations and numerical scheme a relatively low piston velocity is adopted in the present study referring to previous numerical simulation studies using the same speed conditions jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 an unsteady laminar incompressible and newtonian flow is assumed the time dependent incompressible navier stokes equations are employed for solving the flow the governing equations can be written as follows 5 u i 0 6 u i t u i u i p υ 2 u i where u i is velocity in three directions i x y z is divergence operator 2 is laplace operator and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity for the incompressible flow the fluid density ρ is 1 0 103 kg m3 fluid kinematic viscosity ν is 1 0 10 6 m2 s in the present work the governing equations with the above described computational domain and simulation conditions are solved based on open source platform openfoam the solver pimpledymfoam is used to solve the impulse problem in this solver the pimple method which is the combination of simple and piso is used to handle pressure velocity coupling temporal discretization is a second order implicit scheme and second order scheme is used for spatial discretization 2 3 dynamic mesh technology in order to simulate piston nozzle jet dynamic mesh technology is used to control the piston motion the mesh motion is obtained by solving a mesh motion equation where boundary motion acts as a boundary condition and determines the position of mesh points the motion is characterized by the spacing between nodes which changes by stretching and squeezing the mesh motion equation used in this work is a laplace equation with variable diffusivity which can be written as follows 7 γ u g 0 where the u g is the velocity of mesh motion by this velocity the mesh moves forward to a new position 8 x n e w x o l d u g δ t the coefficient γ in eqn 7 is the diffusion coefficient which is given by diffusivity diffusivity model is used to determine how the points should be moved after solving the cell motion equation for each time step in this work the diffusivity model is 9 γ r 1 r m where r is the radius from the moving boundary m is an integer in this study for x direction m is set to 1 to obtain an appropriate mesh motion for y direction and z direction m is set to a very large number so that the mesh motion in these two directions are restrained the schematic diagram of mesh motion can be seen in fig 3 2 4 grid distribution and sensitivity study fig 4 shows the detailed grid distribution structured grids are adopted in the whole computational domain grids in the nozzle are uniform in three directions while grids in the outer flow domain are equal ratio distribution in the radial direction in order to reduce numerical dissipation the aspect ratio of the grids near the evolution path of the vortex ring is equal to 1 according to previous literatures it is essential to accurately calculate the friction in the nozzle to simulate the formation of vortex accurately the nozzle domain is separated from the whole computational domain and an internal nozzle flow simulation without piston motion is carried out the frictional resistance of inner wall of the nozzle under different grids is calculated by doing this the grids distribution 80 50 40 is adopted for the nozzle domain for the outer flow domain pressure of specific point was applied for grid sensitivity study it avoids the problem in the previous numerical researches grid sensitivity study rosenfeld et al 1998 jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 that total circulation cannot reflect the particulars the specific point is on the central axis of the nozzle and 2d distance away from the nozzle exit test results are shown as fig 5 according to the results of grid sensitivity study 1000 60 40 grids in the axial radial and circumferential directions is good enough at the same time by adopting this grid distribution aspect ratio of the grids near the vortex evolution path is about 1 this grid distribution is used in all the following simulations 3 vortex ring evolution vortex ring evolution is a typical phenomenon in pulse process in order to validate the numerical method used in this paper standard vortex ring evolution without background flow is simulated and compared with the standard measurement results in addition considering the steady sailing state of a vehicle equipped with the vortex ring thruster the speed of the vehicle can be converted into a background flow the influence of background flow on vortex ring evolution is simulated and discussed 3 1 inexistence of background flow first simulations are the pulse process in different strokes without background flow these standard cases are performed in the same condition as the standard experiments of gharib et al 1998 and numerical simulation of rosenfeld et al 1998 fig 6 presents the comparison of instantaneous vorticity field for the three different piston strokes t 2 t 3 8 t 14 5 between numerical results and experimental results it is obvious that the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental results regarding to the vortex ring formation the vortex ring keeps getting bigger before t up to 4 and reaches saturation finally when t is approximately equal to 4 trailing vorticity appears when t is larger than 4 the evolution of leading vortex ring is simulated well smaller vortex can be captured in the case of large t the changes of total circulation and vortex ring circulation can reflect the evolution of vortex in pulse jet fig 7 presents the non dimensional circulation change with the non dimensional time t for stroke ratio t 6 total circulation and vortex circulation are defined as the velocity circulation on the closed curve formed by the boundary of outer flow domain and the leading vortex ring outline respectively velocity circulation was calculated according to the stokes theorem which indicates that curl of velocity is the surface density of the circulation the expression can be written as 10 l u d l s u d s in fig 7 total circulation increases linearly during the pushing stroke and then decreases slowly after the piston stop all the three results are in good agreement the horizontal black line represents the maximum value of vortex circulation the intersection of the horizontal line and the total circulation curve represents the formation number under this flow condition the formation number should be approximately equal to 4 as the figure shows that the cfd calculation correctly predicts the formation number the vorticity field in the formation and evolution phases of vortex ring with t 6 is shown in fig 8 the leading vortex ring continues to grow up until t is equal to 6 and there is obvious trailing vorticity behind the leading vortex ring after the energy of vortex is saturated the trailing vorticity cannot get into the vortex and the trailing vorticity becomes longer and longer during the evolution the large scale leading vortex contains larger energy and moves faster then the pinch off phenomenon occurs at t 15 6 e the vortex ring disconnects itself from the bulk of the flow leaving behind a noticeable tail of vorticity flow region 3 2 existing background flow under the steady sailing state of the vehicle the thruster has a certain advance speed thus it is necessary to place this apparatus into an environment with background flow to investigate vortex ring evolution in the presence of background velocity the influence of background flow on vortex ring can be seen from fig 9 the background velocity is set to be half of the piston velocity vorticity is colored by rotation directions of vortex firstly the vortex ring is smaller and trailing vorticity is longer obviously in contrast with cases without background flow at the same time besides there is obvious reverse vorticity around the nozzle exit which can consume the energy of vortex during the formation process in addition the pinch off phenomenon is delayed by the background flow it occurs at the time t 20 4 as fig 9 d shows while it occurs at the time t 15 6 in the condition without background flow as fig 8 c shows fig 10 presents the vortex ring in five different background velocities it can be concluded from the figures that the leading vortex ring becomes smaller and smaller with the increase of background flow velocity us when the background velocity is the same as the piston velocity the strength of wake vortex generated by the background flow pass the outer surface of the nozzle is nearly equivalent to the strength of vortex ring emitted by the piston the energy of vortex ring is too small to maintain its shape under the action of the background flow at the same time the trailing vorticity is longer under the action of high speed background flow the reason for vortex morphological change can be analyzed by the changes of circulation under different background flows fig 11 shows the non dimensional circulation as a function of formation time for u s 0 25u p and u s 0 75u p cases the calculated total circulation in fig 11 only includes the vortex produced by the piston motion in other words the red vorticity in fig 10 there are two reasons why the vortex rings become smaller at high background velocity firstly the increasing u s decreases the strength of the shear layer feeding the ring the reverse vortex produced by background flow consume the energy of vortex ring and trailing vorticity it can be seen from fig 11 that both total circulation and vortex circulation decrease as the background velocity increases secondly the increasing u s increases the velocity that the ring moves away from the nozzle as mentioned in section 3 1 the formation number represents the non dimensional time that the jet shear layer rolls up to form the vortex ring the dotted line in fig 11 shows that the formation number is about 3 and 1 for case with u s 0 25u p and case with u s 0 75u p respectively after the formation time the leading vortex ring will stop entraining circulation and the remainder of the jet will be ejected into the trailing vorticity with the increase of background velocity the time of vortex ring entraining circulation becomes shorter which leads to the smaller vortex ring 4 thrust and efficiency characteristics in this section the thrust and efficiency characteristics of the vortex ring thruster is discussed in past studies the research methods of open water characteristics are not clear in this paper the open water characteristic parameters and calculation methods are proposed at first the thrust and efficiency of the thruster are given quantitatively under an actual piston velocity program and an appropriate nozzle length on the basis the impact of piston velocity program and stroke on efficiency are discussed 4 1 parameters definition in past studies there is no standard open water characteristic definition for vortex ring thruster in this paper an open water characteristic calculation method similar to propeller is proposed the calculated parameters include advance ratio thrust coefficient and open water efficiency the advance ratio j and thrust coefficient k t are defined as 11 j u s u p 12 k t t ρ a p u p 2 where u p is the piston velocity u s is the ambient velocity in other words u s is the advance velocity of the thruster a p is the sectional area of the nozzle the thrust t can be calculated based on the instantaneous axial velocity and pressure at the nozzle exit as 13 t ρ u x 2 d s p p d s where u x is the x direction velocity of the piston exit surface p is the pressure of the piston exit surface s is the area of the piston exit surface p 0 is the ambient pressure the two terms on the right side represent two kinds of contributions to the thrust the first term is the momentum flux term while the second term is the pressure term propulsive efficiency is defined as the work done by the thrust divided by the total work done by the piston which can be written as 14 η 0 u s 0 t t d t 0 t f p f l o w u p f p p u s h u p d t where f p f l o w is the pressure on the surface of the piston caused by the presence of background flow this pressure is present before the piston moves the piston has to overcome it to do work even though it is small in magnitude f p p u s h is the pressure of water on the piston as it pushes water forward 4 2 open water characteristics calculation in this section cases are performed in five different advance ratios j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 the change of advance ratio is depended on the change of ambient velocity u s the average piston velocity is uniform u p 0 1524 m s stroke ratios of these cases are t 6 firstly a fully pulsed velocity program as function 15 is used to control the piston motion the velocity program is shown in fig 12 fully pulsed means that the piston complete acceleration and deceleration in a flash this velocity curve is the same as that used in previous numerical studies of jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 t 0 in this figure stands for the moment that piston starts moving 15 u 0 t 0 u p 0 t t 0 t t fig 13 presents an example of the calculated force on piston and thrust for the case of t 6 j 0 5 at the beginning the piston is stationary for t 0 1 8 after the forces are stable the piston starts to move for the force on the piston a when the piston starts moving the fluid in the nozzle is accelerated to the velocity up instantaneously because the fluid is incompressible the piston is subjected to a great impact force as the piston moves forward fluid in the nozzle decreases and the total frictional force of fluid and nozzle inner wall decreases so force on the piston decreases gradually the piston face receives a positive force due to the inertia of the fluid in the nozzle when the piston stops for the thrust the total thrust is divided into two parts thrust from momentum and thrust from pressure in the process of piston moving the contribution of momentum is the main component thrust from pressure is very small in contrast with thrust from momentum thrust from momentum is attenuating to zero rapidly when the piston stops while thrust from pressure mutants to a positive value these phenomena indicate that thrust from pressure cannot be ignored for impulse jet propulsion this part of the thrust will contribute to the continuous thrust process fig 14 presents the open water performance curves for t 6 with pulse velocity program it can be seen from the figure that both thrust and efficiency increase with the advance ratio the efficiency reaches a really high number more than 1 when advance ratio j is close to 1 it seems to be an impossible result however jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 carried out a similar simulation of pulse propulsion they calculated the energy ratio defined in their paper which is a quantity similar to efficiency but considers the drag they also got results more than ideal efficiency but unfortunately there is no explanation in this paper the authors consider that the reason for this phenomenon is the unreal fully pulsed velocity program which amplifies the effect of the pulse on increasing efficiency besides the impact force of the instant acceleration cannot be obtained accurately the piston does a lot of work accelerating the fluid in the nozzle however in the simulation with fully pulsed velocity program the acceleration process is completed in a flash resulting in the force on the piston cannot be accurately calculated correctly therefore a more practical velocity program with accelerating ramp and decelerating ramp is adopted for further investigation the practical velocity program function is presented by function 16 and the curve is shown in fig 15 16 u p t u max 1 cos π 0 1 t t 2 u max t t 0 1 0 9 t t 0 9 1 1 cos π 0 1 t t 0 8 t where u m a x u p 2 0 9 u p equals to 0 1524 m s to keep the same piston velocity cases are performed in five different advance ratios j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 fig 16 presents an example of the calculated force on piston and thrust for the case of t 6 j 0 5 it can be seen from fig 16 that by using the practical velocity program the accelerating ramp and decelerating ramp of piston velocity play a significant role in force on piston and thrust as is shown in the figure a the piston does most of its work in the acceleration stage and the piston has an effect of energy recovery at the deceleration stage because of the inertia of the fluid still in the nozzle for figure b the thrust is a large positive value in the piston acceleration stage and becomes negative in the piston deceleration stage the positive and negative of thrust in this two stages are mainly affected by the pressure at the nozzle exit fig 17 presents the pressure fields near the nozzle exit at typical moments the fluid is considered incompressible in the calculation so the acceleration and deceleration of the piston directly cause the fluid in the nozzle to accelerate and decelerate the acceleration of the fluid creates an increase in pressure at the nozzle exit and conversely the deceleration of the fluid creates a pressure drop at the nozzle exit in the process of pushing the piston forward at a certain speed 0 1 t t 0 9 thrust from pressure is very small in contrast with thrust from momentum the open water performance curves for t 6 with practical velocity program are shown in fig 18 in contrast with the cases using fully pulsed velocity program the efficiency value is kept within a reasonable range the rationality of the calculation method is proved it is worth noting that the total length of the nozzle is fixed at 0 4m t 15 7 at present which is based on previous literatures however a practical thruster would not use such a long stroke the results introduced above are all based on t 6 the excess nozzle length causes an unnecessary loss of energy due to the viscosity therefore it is essential to adjust the total length of nozzle to be equal to the stroke in the next simulation the total nozzle length is set to be approximately equal to the piston stroke which is more practical specifically for t 6 the total length of nozzle is 0 16m initial and final nozzle length for t 6 are shown in fig 19 cases are performed in five different advance ratios j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 fig 20 and fig 21 present the results using short nozzle contrasting fig 21 with fig 18 the thrust coefficients are almost identical but the open water efficiency with short nozzle length is much higher than that with long nozzle the reason is that the piston does less work with the shorter nozzle the instantaneous vorticity fields of cases with different total length of nozzle are shown in fig 22 the shape and size of vortex rings are basically the same in the two cases the vortex ring only affect the thrust so the coefficients in the two cases remain basically unchanged in the case with short nozzle length the piston is very close to the nozzle exit when it stops moving while in the case with long nozzle length the piston is still a long way 9 x d 0 from the nozzle exit when it stops moving it can be seen from fig 22 that there is significant friction between the fluid and the internal wall in this excess length which increase the work done by piston and reduce the efficiency of thruster the vortex ring thruster is proved that can achieve high efficiency in the case of large advance ratio according to fig 21 small underwater vehicle will maintain a high advance coefficient during the voyage therefore the use of this thruster will greatly improve the efficiency at the same time the curve of force on the piston with short nozzle is different from that with long nozzle in fig 20 a the piston can recover energy from the fluid still in the nozzle due to the inertia at the deceleration stage in the present condition with short nozzle there is little fluid left in the nozzle at the end of stroke the recover energy is extremely small in contrast with the energy consuming in the acceleration stage which leads to the average force acting on the piston increases and the efficiency decreases this phenomenon indicates that the velocity program of the piston has an effect on the work done by the piston at the same average velocity thus it is essential to try some different kinds of piston velocity program and check the efficiency changes 4 3 effect of velocity program on efficiency firstly the authors adopt five kinds of velocity programs as fig 23 to investigate the impact of asymmetric acceleration stage and deceleration stage on the efficiency the phrase velocity program is abbreviated as vp in the follow figures velocity program vp1 consists of 10 acceleration stage and 90 deceleration stage vp2 consists of 30 acceleration stage and 70 deceleration stage vp4 and vp5 are just contrary to vp1 and vp2 these five velocity programs have the same average velocity u p 0 1524 m s stroke ratios of these cases are t 6 two kinds of advance ratio j 0 75 and j 1 are calculated the efficiency with five different velocity programs is shown in fig 24 the presented results are in two kinds of advance ratio j 0 75 and j 1 the figure shows that case with velocity program vp5 can obtain the best efficiency which is about 2 larger than that with vp1 in order word adopting a velocity program with a slow acceleration stage and a faster deceleration stage can improve the propulsion efficiency under the same average piston velocity the reasons for the difference in efficiency are analyzed from the perspective of piston force and thrust fig 25 presents the piston force and total thrust comparison between results from vp1 and vp5 the effect of the length of the acceleration and deceleration stages on the performance can be seen from these figures in the figure a piston with velocity program vp1 does a lot of work in the acceleration stage because that it has to accelerate the fluid in the nozzle with great acceleration in the deceleration stage the recover energy of piston with vp1 is small because the acceleration is small vp1 is the velocity program with the most work done by the piston in the five velocity programs on the other hand piston with vp5 does less work in the acceleration stage and has more energy recovery in the deceleration stage it is the velocity program with the least work done by the piston in the five velocity programs in the figure b total thrust with vp1 suddenly increases in the acceleration stage this increase is from the pressure contribution to the thrust due to the large acceleration in the deceleration stage there is no negative thrust value because the deceleration process is relatively slow on the contrary total thrust with vp5 has no thrust increase and there are negative values in the deceleration in conclusion using velocity program vp1 can obtain the largest thrust on the contrary the thrust obtained by using velocity program vp5 is the smallest in addition the efficiency comparison with three symmetrical velocity programs is carried out the piston velocity programs are shown in fig 26 the velocity program vp3 is the same as fig 23 the acceleration stage and deceleration stage accounts for 60 of the vp6 and 20 of the vp7 these three velocity programs have the same average velocity u p 0 1524 m s stroke ratios of these cases are t 6 the efficiency comparison results are shown in fig 27 the results indicate that the case with velocity program vp7 has the highest efficiency while the case with vp3 have the lowest efficiency combined with the velocity program curves in fig 26 it can be found that the acceleration stage and deceleration stage of velocity program vp7 are the most rapid therefore the case with velocity program vp7 has the most obvious pulse effect which contribute to improve the efficiency in addition the comparison of vortex ring morphology between case with velocity program vp3 and vp7 is shown in fig 28 in the case with vp3 the piston accelerates relatively slowly which leads to the slow formation and small size of vortex ring in contrast the vortex ring with vp7 suck up more energy and becomes larger and faster which is beneficial to efficiency improvement in conclusion in order to obtain higher propulsion efficiency the velocity program with more rapid acceleration and deceleration stage should be adopted 4 4 effect of piston stroke on efficiency piston stroke is another important parameter for the vortex ring thruster for practical thrusters it is unlikely to use a long nozzle considering the interior space of the vehicle the authors choose four kinds of relatively small non dimensional strokes t 2 t 4 t 6 t 8 to study the relationship between efficiency and stroke it is worth noting that the total length of the nozzle is set to be approximately equal to the piston stroke for these cases the computational results are shown in fig 29 the computational results in fig 29 indicate that the efficiency decreases as the stroke increases when the piston stroke reduces the pulse action during propulsion is more significant based on the conclusion that the pulse motion can improve the propulsion efficiency thruster with small stroke has larger efficiency than that with larger stroke 5 conclusions in this paper cfd method is used to investigate the vortex ring evolution and efficiency characteristics of low speed vortex ring thruster in the first part the simulation is validated by comparison with measurement results the vortex ring evolution process is discussed with and without background flow in the second part the authors focus on the open water characteristics of vortex ring thruster detailed analysis is carried out about the force on piston the thrust and the efficiency with different piston velocity program nozzle length and piston stroke conclusions are as follows 1 an axisymmetric piston nozzle computational model is established to simulate the vortex ring thruster the vortex ring evolution and circulation are in good agreement with previous standard experiments with the increase of background flow velocity the leading vortex ring is getting smaller and smaller there are two main reasons for the morphological changes of vortex rings firstly the reverse vortex produced by background flow decreases the strength of the shear layer feeding the ring secondly the increasing us increases the velocity that the ring moves away from the nozzle which reduces the time for vortex ring to gather energy at the same time the pinch off phenomenon is delayed 2 the open water characteristic parameters definition and calculation methods of vortex ring thruster are proposed the thrust and efficiency of the thruster are given quantitatively under an actual piston velocity program and an appropriate nozzle length the open water performance curve is obtained by calculation the vortex ring thruster has been proved that can achieve high efficiency in the case of large advance ratio 3 for piston velocity programs with the same average velocity higher efficiency can be obtained by using velocity program with rapider acceleration and deceleration stages if an asymmetric velocity program is to be adopted using a velocity program with a more gradual acceleration process and a sharper deceleration process can obtain larger efficiency for the impact of piston stroke the results indicate that the efficiency decreases as the stroke increases which because that the pulsation effect is more prominent in the case of small stroke the vortex rings are produced intermittently during the actual operation of thruster therefore the frequency plays an important role in the vortex ring evolution and the propulsion performance the authors are currently working to simulate the complex vortex interaction and in a continuous pulsed jet propulsion

22270,vortex ring thruster vrt is a new type of propulsion device which adopts impulse propulsion mode the idea of impulse propulsion comes from bionics it imitates cephalopods like squid and can achieve high efficiency vortex ring is a typical phenomenon during the pulse process and it can help improve the propulsion efficiency many previous studies believe that vrt can obtain large thrust and efficiency but few articles study the efficiency problem systematically in addition experiment is the main research method adopted at present in this paper an axisymmetric piston nozzle computational model is established to simulate the thruster fluid is solved by cfd method based on the open source platform openfoam dynamic mesh technology is adopted to control piston motion this paper focus on two aspects vortex ring evolution and propulsion efficiency characteristics in the first part simulations of pulse process with different strokes are carried out and compared with standard experiments the two results are in good agreement the vortex ring evolution is then studied with different background flows in the second part a reasonable open water characteristics calculation method for vrt is proposed thrust coefficient and propulsion efficiency are obtained in the calculation the results indicate that the vrt can achieve high efficiency near to 1 in the case of high advance ratio in addition efficiency comparison is carried out between four kinds of asymmetric velocity programs and three kinds of symmetric velocity programs to find out a more reasonable velocity program design finally the impact of piston stroke is investigated results show that smaller stroke can obtain larger efficiency because pulsation effect is more prominent keywords vortex ring thruster evolution of vortex ring propulsion efficiency openfoam 1 introduction propeller is the most common propulsion device for the existing underwater vehicles because of stability and convenience however propeller propulsion can cause some inherent energy loss propeller generates thrust depending on the rotation of the blades swirl velocity of water is generated because of the spin of the blades water kinetic energy due to the swirl of water does not contribute to the generation of thrust and therefore it is an energy waste previous studies van terwisga 2013 have shown that this rotational kinetic energy losses can be as high as nearly 20 these energy losses are unavoidable for propeller no matter how optimized thus it is very essential to adopt a new kind of propulsion without rotational energy loss the impulse propulsion was developed against this background the idea of impulse propulsion comes from bionics as a result of natural selection fast moving marine animals like squid choose impulse mode to swim this propulsion mode can be simplified to a system consisting of a piston and a nozzle in this system the thrust is produced by the piston pushing water because the piston surface always maintains normal to the flow or the thrust axis during the stroke this propulsion system has no rotational energy loss and can achieve relatively high efficiency at the same time the pulse process is often accompanied by the generation of the vortex ring the vortex ring had been proved that plays an important role in the propulsion and because of its remarkable effect the impulse propulsion device is called vortex ring thruster vrt based on the above two contents many scholars have carried out investigation in the past several years new and yu 2015 vortex ring is a typical phenomenon in pulse process a great number of experimental works have been carried out to study vortex ring in the starting flow generated from a piston nozzle apparatus gharib et al 1998 carried out experimental studies about the formation process of the vortex ring a piston nozzle apparatus was used in their experiment to investigate the formation process of vortex rings for a wide range of piston stroke to cylinder diameter lm d ratio several important conclusions were obtained in their studies which become key basis for follow up researches for cases lm d 4 the leading vortex ring is small and there is no trailing vorticity behind the vortex ring for cases lm d 4 it appears that the leading vortex ring is nearly saturated for cases lm d 4 there is an obvious trailing vorticity behind the leading vortex ring thus a non dimensional time called the formation time is defined equals to 4 in their experiment at the same time rosenfeld et al 1998 carried out cfd simulation to investigate the same problem as gharib et al 1998 they found that for the cases lm d 4 the leading vortex ring moves faster and would break off from the trailing vorticity behind this phenomenon is called pinch off it is worth noting that their studies were carried out without background flow krueger et al 2003 used similar test equipment as gharib et al 1998 to investigate the vortex ring pinch off in the presence of simultaneously initiated uniform background co flow according to their conclusion the formation time is significantly reduced with the effect of background velocity different from krueger et al 2003 jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 set a fully developed background co flow and wake of the nozzle was also present the strong interaction between the vortex ring and the nozzle wake was studied in their research on the other hand many studies have analyzed the mechanism how vortex ring improves propulsive thrust krueger 2001 used a piston cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets krueger and gharib 2003 2005 analyzed the interaction between the vortex ring and the surrounding fluid in detail as the vortex ring moves forward it draw in the surrounding fluid which accelerates the otherwise static fluid to the average velocity of the vortex ring motion thus the momentum of the vortex ring becomes larger because of the entrained fluid according to the newton s third law the force of the fluid against the thruster increases it was also observed in their experiment that the total thrust generated per pulse is much more than that due to momentum flux from the jet alone the difference is largely due to the over pressure effect at the nozzle exit during vortex ring formation dabiri and gharib 2004 carried out detailed study focusing on the fluid entrainment by isolated vortex rings cater et al 2004 studied the interaction between piston vortex and primary leading vortex ring in detail in their experiments the influence of piston vortex on the primary vortex ring was small when the piston was far away from the nozzle exit however when the piston vortex was ejected into the flow it increased the circulation and fluctuation of primary vortex ring lim et al 2001 2006 and new et al 2003 2006 carried out very detailed experimental studies on the evolution and influencing factors of vortex rings in cross flow because of the complex interaction between the jet and the cross flow four kinds of vortex structures were formed they are the leading edge vortex the horseshoe vortex the wake vortex and the counter rotating vortex pair the effects of jet exit shape and velocity profile on the vortex ring evolution were analyzed in detail more recently cheng et al 2009 2010 2016 adopted lattice boltzmann method to simulate vortex ring the simulation results were proved to be reliable besides the influence of shear flow and the complex evolution process of elliptic vortex rings with different aspect ratios are analyzed based on the researches introduced above it is generally accepted that pulse propulsion can get a really high efficiency because there is no rotational energy loss and vortex rings can manipulate the over pressure at the nozzle exit and entrain fluid thus many studies were carried out using the vortex ring thrust vrt as propulsion device to investigate the thrust performance kamran mohseni 2006 designed a pulsatile vortex generator for low speed maneuvering of small underwater vehicles by combining the device and the main propeller the performance of the underwater vehicle was improved krieg and mohseni 2008 studied the thrust characterization of vortex ring thruster by open water experiment the results show that thrust increases with frequency and stroke then krieg and mohseni 2010 designed the dynamic control system for this vortex ring thruster and the corresponding underwater vehicle based on the system the vehicle achieved three different maneuver regimes including cruising docking and transition regimes for the investigation of propulsive efficiency moslemi and krueger 2010 studied experimentally on a self propelled pulsed jet underwater vehicle propulsive efficiency in their study is generally defined as the ratio of the useful propulsive power output to the total power exerted propelling the vehicle which is given by 1 η p w u w u e e x f t u v f t u v e e x where u v is the average vehicle velocity and both f t and e e x can be obtained from the dpiv measurement ruiz et al 2011 designed a self propelled underwater vehicle with the capability to operate using either steady jet propulsion or a pulsed jet mode that features the roll up of large scale vortex rings in the near wake in their study a drag based hydrodynamic efficiency for the vehicle is defined as 2 η h f d u s u b f d u s u b 0 5 ρ a o u t u w u w u 2 by this calculation method the experiments demonstrate an obvious increment in propulsive efficiency over 50 greater than the efficiency of the steady jet mode in addition there are some new researches about the soft internal structure of the vortex ring thruster system serchi et al 2013 renda et al 2015 serchi and weymouth 2017 their studies proved that soft bodied vehicles can benefit from exploiting their own body deformation to obtain larger propulsive forces among the past researches about the propulsive efficiency of the vortex ring thruster the experimental study of underwater vehicle model is the most common method few articles use cfd method to study the efficiency problem systematically and the efficiency calculation methods are generally defined for whole vehicle in experiment in this paper the authors use cfd method to study open water performance of the vortex ring thruster firstly the basic vortex ring evolution is simulated using the same geometry and condition with gharib et al 1998 and jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 for comparison then the impact of background flow on the vortex ring evolution is investigated for the thrust and efficiency study the authors propose an open water characteristic calculation method detailed analysis is carried out about the force on piston the thrust and the efficiency with different piston velocity program nozzle length and piston stroke 2 numerical design 2 1 computational domain in this paper a piston nozzle apparatus is established to simulate the thruster only the thruster model is built in order to perform an open water simulation the whole computational domain is axisymmetric consisting of a piston nozzle apparatus and outer flow domain the domain configuration is shown in fig 1 the details of the domain dimension and boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 dimensions of the piston and nozzle are exactly the same as previous experiments of gharib et al 1998 the inner diameter d of nozzle is 0 0254m and the total length of the nozzle lp is 0 4m which limits the maximum stroke ratio l d max to 15 7 the nozzle exit adopts a sharp wedged form with a tip angle of 20 the outer flow domain spans 10d in the streamwise direction and 2 5d in the radial direction the piston surface is a motion boundary moving velocity up in x direction is imposed on the boundary throughout the whole pulse pushing process in the simulation the average of up is equal to 0 1524 m s for all cases no slip boundary condition is adopted in the inner surface of nozzle so that the vortex ring can be generated by the shear layer the side boundary of the outer domain uses slip boundary condition the left patch of the outer flow domain is a wall boundary for the conditions without background flow and an inlet boundary with a velocity us for cases with background flow in order to better describe the calculation conditions and results in the following simulations two non dimensional times are defined as 3 t l m d u p t d 4 t l d u p t d where l m is piston stroke l is the distance of piston motion d is the inner diameter of nozzle u p is piston velocity thus t represents the total moving time of the piston and t represent the time piston is moving 2 2 governing equations and numerical scheme a relatively low piston velocity is adopted in the present study referring to previous numerical simulation studies using the same speed conditions jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 an unsteady laminar incompressible and newtonian flow is assumed the time dependent incompressible navier stokes equations are employed for solving the flow the governing equations can be written as follows 5 u i 0 6 u i t u i u i p υ 2 u i where u i is velocity in three directions i x y z is divergence operator 2 is laplace operator and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity for the incompressible flow the fluid density ρ is 1 0 103 kg m3 fluid kinematic viscosity ν is 1 0 10 6 m2 s in the present work the governing equations with the above described computational domain and simulation conditions are solved based on open source platform openfoam the solver pimpledymfoam is used to solve the impulse problem in this solver the pimple method which is the combination of simple and piso is used to handle pressure velocity coupling temporal discretization is a second order implicit scheme and second order scheme is used for spatial discretization 2 3 dynamic mesh technology in order to simulate piston nozzle jet dynamic mesh technology is used to control the piston motion the mesh motion is obtained by solving a mesh motion equation where boundary motion acts as a boundary condition and determines the position of mesh points the motion is characterized by the spacing between nodes which changes by stretching and squeezing the mesh motion equation used in this work is a laplace equation with variable diffusivity which can be written as follows 7 γ u g 0 where the u g is the velocity of mesh motion by this velocity the mesh moves forward to a new position 8 x n e w x o l d u g δ t the coefficient γ in eqn 7 is the diffusion coefficient which is given by diffusivity diffusivity model is used to determine how the points should be moved after solving the cell motion equation for each time step in this work the diffusivity model is 9 γ r 1 r m where r is the radius from the moving boundary m is an integer in this study for x direction m is set to 1 to obtain an appropriate mesh motion for y direction and z direction m is set to a very large number so that the mesh motion in these two directions are restrained the schematic diagram of mesh motion can be seen in fig 3 2 4 grid distribution and sensitivity study fig 4 shows the detailed grid distribution structured grids are adopted in the whole computational domain grids in the nozzle are uniform in three directions while grids in the outer flow domain are equal ratio distribution in the radial direction in order to reduce numerical dissipation the aspect ratio of the grids near the evolution path of the vortex ring is equal to 1 according to previous literatures it is essential to accurately calculate the friction in the nozzle to simulate the formation of vortex accurately the nozzle domain is separated from the whole computational domain and an internal nozzle flow simulation without piston motion is carried out the frictional resistance of inner wall of the nozzle under different grids is calculated by doing this the grids distribution 80 50 40 is adopted for the nozzle domain for the outer flow domain pressure of specific point was applied for grid sensitivity study it avoids the problem in the previous numerical researches grid sensitivity study rosenfeld et al 1998 jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 that total circulation cannot reflect the particulars the specific point is on the central axis of the nozzle and 2d distance away from the nozzle exit test results are shown as fig 5 according to the results of grid sensitivity study 1000 60 40 grids in the axial radial and circumferential directions is good enough at the same time by adopting this grid distribution aspect ratio of the grids near the vortex evolution path is about 1 this grid distribution is used in all the following simulations 3 vortex ring evolution vortex ring evolution is a typical phenomenon in pulse process in order to validate the numerical method used in this paper standard vortex ring evolution without background flow is simulated and compared with the standard measurement results in addition considering the steady sailing state of a vehicle equipped with the vortex ring thruster the speed of the vehicle can be converted into a background flow the influence of background flow on vortex ring evolution is simulated and discussed 3 1 inexistence of background flow first simulations are the pulse process in different strokes without background flow these standard cases are performed in the same condition as the standard experiments of gharib et al 1998 and numerical simulation of rosenfeld et al 1998 fig 6 presents the comparison of instantaneous vorticity field for the three different piston strokes t 2 t 3 8 t 14 5 between numerical results and experimental results it is obvious that the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental results regarding to the vortex ring formation the vortex ring keeps getting bigger before t up to 4 and reaches saturation finally when t is approximately equal to 4 trailing vorticity appears when t is larger than 4 the evolution of leading vortex ring is simulated well smaller vortex can be captured in the case of large t the changes of total circulation and vortex ring circulation can reflect the evolution of vortex in pulse jet fig 7 presents the non dimensional circulation change with the non dimensional time t for stroke ratio t 6 total circulation and vortex circulation are defined as the velocity circulation on the closed curve formed by the boundary of outer flow domain and the leading vortex ring outline respectively velocity circulation was calculated according to the stokes theorem which indicates that curl of velocity is the surface density of the circulation the expression can be written as 10 l u d l s u d s in fig 7 total circulation increases linearly during the pushing stroke and then decreases slowly after the piston stop all the three results are in good agreement the horizontal black line represents the maximum value of vortex circulation the intersection of the horizontal line and the total circulation curve represents the formation number under this flow condition the formation number should be approximately equal to 4 as the figure shows that the cfd calculation correctly predicts the formation number the vorticity field in the formation and evolution phases of vortex ring with t 6 is shown in fig 8 the leading vortex ring continues to grow up until t is equal to 6 and there is obvious trailing vorticity behind the leading vortex ring after the energy of vortex is saturated the trailing vorticity cannot get into the vortex and the trailing vorticity becomes longer and longer during the evolution the large scale leading vortex contains larger energy and moves faster then the pinch off phenomenon occurs at t 15 6 e the vortex ring disconnects itself from the bulk of the flow leaving behind a noticeable tail of vorticity flow region 3 2 existing background flow under the steady sailing state of the vehicle the thruster has a certain advance speed thus it is necessary to place this apparatus into an environment with background flow to investigate vortex ring evolution in the presence of background velocity the influence of background flow on vortex ring can be seen from fig 9 the background velocity is set to be half of the piston velocity vorticity is colored by rotation directions of vortex firstly the vortex ring is smaller and trailing vorticity is longer obviously in contrast with cases without background flow at the same time besides there is obvious reverse vorticity around the nozzle exit which can consume the energy of vortex during the formation process in addition the pinch off phenomenon is delayed by the background flow it occurs at the time t 20 4 as fig 9 d shows while it occurs at the time t 15 6 in the condition without background flow as fig 8 c shows fig 10 presents the vortex ring in five different background velocities it can be concluded from the figures that the leading vortex ring becomes smaller and smaller with the increase of background flow velocity us when the background velocity is the same as the piston velocity the strength of wake vortex generated by the background flow pass the outer surface of the nozzle is nearly equivalent to the strength of vortex ring emitted by the piston the energy of vortex ring is too small to maintain its shape under the action of the background flow at the same time the trailing vorticity is longer under the action of high speed background flow the reason for vortex morphological change can be analyzed by the changes of circulation under different background flows fig 11 shows the non dimensional circulation as a function of formation time for u s 0 25u p and u s 0 75u p cases the calculated total circulation in fig 11 only includes the vortex produced by the piston motion in other words the red vorticity in fig 10 there are two reasons why the vortex rings become smaller at high background velocity firstly the increasing u s decreases the strength of the shear layer feeding the ring the reverse vortex produced by background flow consume the energy of vortex ring and trailing vorticity it can be seen from fig 11 that both total circulation and vortex circulation decrease as the background velocity increases secondly the increasing u s increases the velocity that the ring moves away from the nozzle as mentioned in section 3 1 the formation number represents the non dimensional time that the jet shear layer rolls up to form the vortex ring the dotted line in fig 11 shows that the formation number is about 3 and 1 for case with u s 0 25u p and case with u s 0 75u p respectively after the formation time the leading vortex ring will stop entraining circulation and the remainder of the jet will be ejected into the trailing vorticity with the increase of background velocity the time of vortex ring entraining circulation becomes shorter which leads to the smaller vortex ring 4 thrust and efficiency characteristics in this section the thrust and efficiency characteristics of the vortex ring thruster is discussed in past studies the research methods of open water characteristics are not clear in this paper the open water characteristic parameters and calculation methods are proposed at first the thrust and efficiency of the thruster are given quantitatively under an actual piston velocity program and an appropriate nozzle length on the basis the impact of piston velocity program and stroke on efficiency are discussed 4 1 parameters definition in past studies there is no standard open water characteristic definition for vortex ring thruster in this paper an open water characteristic calculation method similar to propeller is proposed the calculated parameters include advance ratio thrust coefficient and open water efficiency the advance ratio j and thrust coefficient k t are defined as 11 j u s u p 12 k t t ρ a p u p 2 where u p is the piston velocity u s is the ambient velocity in other words u s is the advance velocity of the thruster a p is the sectional area of the nozzle the thrust t can be calculated based on the instantaneous axial velocity and pressure at the nozzle exit as 13 t ρ u x 2 d s p p d s where u x is the x direction velocity of the piston exit surface p is the pressure of the piston exit surface s is the area of the piston exit surface p 0 is the ambient pressure the two terms on the right side represent two kinds of contributions to the thrust the first term is the momentum flux term while the second term is the pressure term propulsive efficiency is defined as the work done by the thrust divided by the total work done by the piston which can be written as 14 η 0 u s 0 t t d t 0 t f p f l o w u p f p p u s h u p d t where f p f l o w is the pressure on the surface of the piston caused by the presence of background flow this pressure is present before the piston moves the piston has to overcome it to do work even though it is small in magnitude f p p u s h is the pressure of water on the piston as it pushes water forward 4 2 open water characteristics calculation in this section cases are performed in five different advance ratios j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 the change of advance ratio is depended on the change of ambient velocity u s the average piston velocity is uniform u p 0 1524 m s stroke ratios of these cases are t 6 firstly a fully pulsed velocity program as function 15 is used to control the piston motion the velocity program is shown in fig 12 fully pulsed means that the piston complete acceleration and deceleration in a flash this velocity curve is the same as that used in previous numerical studies of jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 t 0 in this figure stands for the moment that piston starts moving 15 u 0 t 0 u p 0 t t 0 t t fig 13 presents an example of the calculated force on piston and thrust for the case of t 6 j 0 5 at the beginning the piston is stationary for t 0 1 8 after the forces are stable the piston starts to move for the force on the piston a when the piston starts moving the fluid in the nozzle is accelerated to the velocity up instantaneously because the fluid is incompressible the piston is subjected to a great impact force as the piston moves forward fluid in the nozzle decreases and the total frictional force of fluid and nozzle inner wall decreases so force on the piston decreases gradually the piston face receives a positive force due to the inertia of the fluid in the nozzle when the piston stops for the thrust the total thrust is divided into two parts thrust from momentum and thrust from pressure in the process of piston moving the contribution of momentum is the main component thrust from pressure is very small in contrast with thrust from momentum thrust from momentum is attenuating to zero rapidly when the piston stops while thrust from pressure mutants to a positive value these phenomena indicate that thrust from pressure cannot be ignored for impulse jet propulsion this part of the thrust will contribute to the continuous thrust process fig 14 presents the open water performance curves for t 6 with pulse velocity program it can be seen from the figure that both thrust and efficiency increase with the advance ratio the efficiency reaches a really high number more than 1 when advance ratio j is close to 1 it seems to be an impossible result however jiang and grosenbaugh 2006 carried out a similar simulation of pulse propulsion they calculated the energy ratio defined in their paper which is a quantity similar to efficiency but considers the drag they also got results more than ideal efficiency but unfortunately there is no explanation in this paper the authors consider that the reason for this phenomenon is the unreal fully pulsed velocity program which amplifies the effect of the pulse on increasing efficiency besides the impact force of the instant acceleration cannot be obtained accurately the piston does a lot of work accelerating the fluid in the nozzle however in the simulation with fully pulsed velocity program the acceleration process is completed in a flash resulting in the force on the piston cannot be accurately calculated correctly therefore a more practical velocity program with accelerating ramp and decelerating ramp is adopted for further investigation the practical velocity program function is presented by function 16 and the curve is shown in fig 15 16 u p t u max 1 cos π 0 1 t t 2 u max t t 0 1 0 9 t t 0 9 1 1 cos π 0 1 t t 0 8 t where u m a x u p 2 0 9 u p equals to 0 1524 m s to keep the same piston velocity cases are performed in five different advance ratios j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 fig 16 presents an example of the calculated force on piston and thrust for the case of t 6 j 0 5 it can be seen from fig 16 that by using the practical velocity program the accelerating ramp and decelerating ramp of piston velocity play a significant role in force on piston and thrust as is shown in the figure a the piston does most of its work in the acceleration stage and the piston has an effect of energy recovery at the deceleration stage because of the inertia of the fluid still in the nozzle for figure b the thrust is a large positive value in the piston acceleration stage and becomes negative in the piston deceleration stage the positive and negative of thrust in this two stages are mainly affected by the pressure at the nozzle exit fig 17 presents the pressure fields near the nozzle exit at typical moments the fluid is considered incompressible in the calculation so the acceleration and deceleration of the piston directly cause the fluid in the nozzle to accelerate and decelerate the acceleration of the fluid creates an increase in pressure at the nozzle exit and conversely the deceleration of the fluid creates a pressure drop at the nozzle exit in the process of pushing the piston forward at a certain speed 0 1 t t 0 9 thrust from pressure is very small in contrast with thrust from momentum the open water performance curves for t 6 with practical velocity program are shown in fig 18 in contrast with the cases using fully pulsed velocity program the efficiency value is kept within a reasonable range the rationality of the calculation method is proved it is worth noting that the total length of the nozzle is fixed at 0 4m t 15 7 at present which is based on previous literatures however a practical thruster would not use such a long stroke the results introduced above are all based on t 6 the excess nozzle length causes an unnecessary loss of energy due to the viscosity therefore it is essential to adjust the total length of nozzle to be equal to the stroke in the next simulation the total nozzle length is set to be approximately equal to the piston stroke which is more practical specifically for t 6 the total length of nozzle is 0 16m initial and final nozzle length for t 6 are shown in fig 19 cases are performed in five different advance ratios j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 fig 20 and fig 21 present the results using short nozzle contrasting fig 21 with fig 18 the thrust coefficients are almost identical but the open water efficiency with short nozzle length is much higher than that with long nozzle the reason is that the piston does less work with the shorter nozzle the instantaneous vorticity fields of cases with different total length of nozzle are shown in fig 22 the shape and size of vortex rings are basically the same in the two cases the vortex ring only affect the thrust so the coefficients in the two cases remain basically unchanged in the case with short nozzle length the piston is very close to the nozzle exit when it stops moving while in the case with long nozzle length the piston is still a long way 9 x d 0 from the nozzle exit when it stops moving it can be seen from fig 22 that there is significant friction between the fluid and the internal wall in this excess length which increase the work done by piston and reduce the efficiency of thruster the vortex ring thruster is proved that can achieve high efficiency in the case of large advance ratio according to fig 21 small underwater vehicle will maintain a high advance coefficient during the voyage therefore the use of this thruster will greatly improve the efficiency at the same time the curve of force on the piston with short nozzle is different from that with long nozzle in fig 20 a the piston can recover energy from the fluid still in the nozzle due to the inertia at the deceleration stage in the present condition with short nozzle there is little fluid left in the nozzle at the end of stroke the recover energy is extremely small in contrast with the energy consuming in the acceleration stage which leads to the average force acting on the piston increases and the efficiency decreases this phenomenon indicates that the velocity program of the piston has an effect on the work done by the piston at the same average velocity thus it is essential to try some different kinds of piston velocity program and check the efficiency changes 4 3 effect of velocity program on efficiency firstly the authors adopt five kinds of velocity programs as fig 23 to investigate the impact of asymmetric acceleration stage and deceleration stage on the efficiency the phrase velocity program is abbreviated as vp in the follow figures velocity program vp1 consists of 10 acceleration stage and 90 deceleration stage vp2 consists of 30 acceleration stage and 70 deceleration stage vp4 and vp5 are just contrary to vp1 and vp2 these five velocity programs have the same average velocity u p 0 1524 m s stroke ratios of these cases are t 6 two kinds of advance ratio j 0 75 and j 1 are calculated the efficiency with five different velocity programs is shown in fig 24 the presented results are in two kinds of advance ratio j 0 75 and j 1 the figure shows that case with velocity program vp5 can obtain the best efficiency which is about 2 larger than that with vp1 in order word adopting a velocity program with a slow acceleration stage and a faster deceleration stage can improve the propulsion efficiency under the same average piston velocity the reasons for the difference in efficiency are analyzed from the perspective of piston force and thrust fig 25 presents the piston force and total thrust comparison between results from vp1 and vp5 the effect of the length of the acceleration and deceleration stages on the performance can be seen from these figures in the figure a piston with velocity program vp1 does a lot of work in the acceleration stage because that it has to accelerate the fluid in the nozzle with great acceleration in the deceleration stage the recover energy of piston with vp1 is small because the acceleration is small vp1 is the velocity program with the most work done by the piston in the five velocity programs on the other hand piston with vp5 does less work in the acceleration stage and has more energy recovery in the deceleration stage it is the velocity program with the least work done by the piston in the five velocity programs in the figure b total thrust with vp1 suddenly increases in the acceleration stage this increase is from the pressure contribution to the thrust due to the large acceleration in the deceleration stage there is no negative thrust value because the deceleration process is relatively slow on the contrary total thrust with vp5 has no thrust increase and there are negative values in the deceleration in conclusion using velocity program vp1 can obtain the largest thrust on the contrary the thrust obtained by using velocity program vp5 is the smallest in addition the efficiency comparison with three symmetrical velocity programs is carried out the piston velocity programs are shown in fig 26 the velocity program vp3 is the same as fig 23 the acceleration stage and deceleration stage accounts for 60 of the vp6 and 20 of the vp7 these three velocity programs have the same average velocity u p 0 1524 m s stroke ratios of these cases are t 6 the efficiency comparison results are shown in fig 27 the results indicate that the case with velocity program vp7 has the highest efficiency while the case with vp3 have the lowest efficiency combined with the velocity program curves in fig 26 it can be found that the acceleration stage and deceleration stage of velocity program vp7 are the most rapid therefore the case with velocity program vp7 has the most obvious pulse effect which contribute to improve the efficiency in addition the comparison of vortex ring morphology between case with velocity program vp3 and vp7 is shown in fig 28 in the case with vp3 the piston accelerates relatively slowly which leads to the slow formation and small size of vortex ring in contrast the vortex ring with vp7 suck up more energy and becomes larger and faster which is beneficial to efficiency improvement in conclusion in order to obtain higher propulsion efficiency the velocity program with more rapid acceleration and deceleration stage should be adopted 4 4 effect of piston stroke on efficiency piston stroke is another important parameter for the vortex ring thruster for practical thrusters it is unlikely to use a long nozzle considering the interior space of the vehicle the authors choose four kinds of relatively small non dimensional strokes t 2 t 4 t 6 t 8 to study the relationship between efficiency and stroke it is worth noting that the total length of the nozzle is set to be approximately equal to the piston stroke for these cases the computational results are shown in fig 29 the computational results in fig 29 indicate that the efficiency decreases as the stroke increases when the piston stroke reduces the pulse action during propulsion is more significant based on the conclusion that the pulse motion can improve the propulsion efficiency thruster with small stroke has larger efficiency than that with larger stroke 5 conclusions in this paper cfd method is used to investigate the vortex ring evolution and efficiency characteristics of low speed vortex ring thruster in the first part the simulation is validated by comparison with measurement results the vortex ring evolution process is discussed with and without background flow in the second part the authors focus on the open water characteristics of vortex ring thruster detailed analysis is carried out about the force on piston the thrust and the efficiency with different piston velocity program nozzle length and piston stroke conclusions are as follows 1 an axisymmetric piston nozzle computational model is established to simulate the vortex ring thruster the vortex ring evolution and circulation are in good agreement with previous standard experiments with the increase of background flow velocity the leading vortex ring is getting smaller and smaller there are two main reasons for the morphological changes of vortex rings firstly the reverse vortex produced by background flow decreases the strength of the shear layer feeding the ring secondly the increasing us increases the velocity that the ring moves away from the nozzle which reduces the time for vortex ring to gather energy at the same time the pinch off phenomenon is delayed 2 the open water characteristic parameters definition and calculation methods of vortex ring thruster are proposed the thrust and efficiency of the thruster are given quantitatively under an actual piston velocity program and an appropriate nozzle length the open water performance curve is obtained by calculation the vortex ring thruster has been proved that can achieve high efficiency in the case of large advance ratio 3 for piston velocity programs with the same average velocity higher efficiency can be obtained by using velocity program with rapider acceleration and deceleration stages if an asymmetric velocity program is to be adopted using a velocity program with a more gradual acceleration process and a sharper deceleration process can obtain larger efficiency for the impact of piston stroke the results indicate that the efficiency decreases as the stroke increases which because that the pulsation effect is more prominent in the case of small stroke the vortex rings are produced intermittently during the actual operation of thruster therefore the frequency plays an important role in the vortex ring evolution and the propulsion performance the authors are currently working to simulate the complex vortex interaction and in a continuous pulsed jet propulsion

well as numerical modeling to propose a source model physical modeling of a volcano flank collapse showed that the initial tsunami wave mostly involves a pure elevation wave we identified initial tsunami period of 6 3 8 9 min through wavelet analysis leading to an initial tsunami dimension of 1 8 7 4 km twelve source models were numerically modelled with source dimensions of 1 5 4 km and initial tsunami amplitudes of 10 200 m based on the qualities of spectral and amplitude fits between observations and simulations we constrained the tsunami source dimension and initial amplitude in

a large tsunami reaching a maximum runup height of 13 m muhari et al 2019 was generated in the sunda strait indonesia due to volcanic activities of the anak krakatoa volcano in the evening of 22 december 2018 fig 1 no large earthquake was reported before the tsunami whereas volcanic activities were observed at the krakatoa volcano from a few months earlier until the time of the destructive tsunami of 22 december according to media reports therefore it is widely believed that the tsunami was generated by volcano related mass failures and associated subaerial landslides satellite images from the sunda strait before and after the event revealed that a large portion of the middle krakatoa volcano island known as anak krakatoa collapsed into the sea as a result of the volcanic eruption

responsible for the anak krakatoa tsunami was also recorded at seismic stations in the region fig 2 based on these seismic records the origin time of the eruption was approximately at 13 56 utc on 22 december 2018 fig 2 indonesia is home to approximately 130 volcanoes lavigne et al 2008 a number of which are located in the sea and are capable of producing tsunamis possibly the predecessor of the december 2018 destructive volcanic tsunami was another deadly volcanic tsunami around the same place in 1883 generated by the krakatoa eruption with 36000 deaths choi et al 2003 pelinovsky et al 2005 based on bryant 2001 the 1883 event produced at least 20 km3 of pyroclastic deposits for the 1883 event tsunami wave runup was approximately 15 m on the average in the near field i e coasts of sunda strait but maximum wave runup was up to 42 m during the 1883 krakatoa tsunami choi et al 2003 nomanbhoy and satake 1995 modelled the 1883 event using nonlinear shallow water equations and successfully reproduced the 1883 tsunami latter 1981 provided a detailed review of the 1883 krakatoa tsunami including origin time period and coastal amplitudes of the waves and arrival times tsunamis generated by volcanic activities are generally less understood due to the scarcity of such events to reproduce the propagation and coastal amplification of volcanic tsunamis it is essential to estimate the source of these tsunamis several authors in the past have studied source mechanism of volcano tsunamis latter 1981 listed 10 mechanisms for generation of volcanic tsunamis worldwide among which the most destructive are those generated by the impacts of pyroclastic flow deposits into the sea as well as volcanic triggered landslides according to latter 1981 tsunamis from pyroclastic flows are rare while those generated by volcanic triggered landslides are more common paris et al 2014 presented a review of volcanic tsunamis including 40 incidents worldwide in the period of 1550 2007 and discussed their generation mechanisms eight mechanisms were proposed by paris et al 2014 underwater explosion pyroclastic flow earthquake flank failure caldera subsidence air wave lahar and collapse of the lava bench caldera uplift associated with volcanic activities can be considered as another generation mechanism for volcanic tsunamis as evidenced during the 2015 torishima volcanic tsunami japan sandanbata et al 2018a fukao et al 2018 the 2002 stromboli volcanic tsunami was reported by tinti et al 2006 who measured a maximum runup of 11 m and associated the tsunami to two landslides with a combined mass volume of 0 02 0 03 km3 satake 2007 modelled the 1741 oshima oshima volcanic tsunami in the japan sea whose landslide volume was estimated to be approximately 2 5 km3 a new modeling of the oshima oshima volcanic tsunami was conducted by ioki et al 2019 estimating the volume of the collapsed material at 2 2 km3 the december 2018 krakatoa volcanic tsunami is among a few examples of relatively well recorded volcanic tsunamis worldwide as the tsunami was recorded by several tide gauges it is therefore an important event whose study will contribute to better understanding of coastal hazards from volcanic tsunamis here we study the source of the recent anak krakatoa volcanic tsunami using tide gauge data and numerical simulations we propose a static source model which fairly reproduces the observed tide gauge data 2 data and methods our approach to estimate the tsunami source model of the december 2018 anak krakatoa tsunami was based on first determination of the type of the source either a dipole depression elevation wave or a pure elevation wave using qualitative physical experiment second approximation of the source dimensions using wavelet analysis of the tide gauge records and third validation of the source model using forward numerical modeling of the tsunami our tsunami numerical modeling is based on assuming an initial tsunami wave at the end of the generation phase and then modeling its propagation and coastal amplification in fact we consider a static model and ignore the initial complicated tsunami generation phase the term static model here implies that the complex two phase flow consisting of water soil interaction at the beginning of the slide motion 10 100 s is ignored this approach has been successfully applied to the 1998 papua new guinea landslide tsunami synolakis et al 2002 okal and synolakis 2004 heidarzadeh and satake 2015a the september 2013 landslide tsunami in the nw indian ocean heidarzadeh and satake 2014 and the 1945 makran tsunami heidarzadeh and satake 2017 this forward modeling trial and error approach is useful for the case of the anak krakatoa tsunami because alternate methods such as tsunami inversion may not yield satisfactory results due to the complexity of the source mechanism and lack of high resolution bathymetry data for our trial and error approach first we consider a hypothetical source and conduct tsunami propagation and compare the synthetic waveforms with actual tide gauge observations wee modify the assumed tsunami source according to the quality of match between synthetic and observed waveforms and continue this process until satisfactory match is achieved sea level data consists of six tide gauge records see fig 1a for locations with sampling intervals of 1 min provided by the agency for geo spatial information indonesia big http tides big go id to remove tidal signals from the original records we predicted the tidal signals using a least squares method of harmonic analysis and then removed them from the original records fig 3 wavelet time frequency analysis was performed by applying the wavelet package of torrence and compo 1998 our wavelet analysis was conducted using the morlet mother function with a wavenumber of 6 and a scale width of 0 10 heidarzadeh et al 2015 the comcot numerical package cornell multi grid coupled tsunami model which is based on nonlinear shallow water equations liu et al 1998 wang and liu 2006 was applied for tsunami simulations a uniform bathymetry grid with a resolution of 8 arc sec approximately 250 m was used the bathymetry grid was interpolated from the gebco 2014 the general bathymetric chart of the oceans 30 arc sec bathymetric digital atlas weatherall et al 2015 we excluded runup calculations in our numerical simulations because it requires high resolution nearshore bathymetry topography nonlinear simulations were conducted for a total time of 3 h with a time step of 0 5 s 3 type of the initial tsunami source and its dimensions the type of the initial wave generated by volcanic tsunamis is not well understood in the existing literature this is the reason that we had to conduct physical experiments to identify the type of the initial wave qualitative physical modeling was performed at the wave flume of the earthquake research institute the university of tokyo japan figs 4 5 to identify the type of the initial tsunami wave this was aimed at understanding the general physics of the initial tsunami wave immediately after the generation phase rather than quantitative measurements froude similarity is used for physical modeling of coastal problems fritz et al 2004 sorensen 2010 however we do not measure wave parameters in this study because this is a qualitative assessment the flume has dimensions of 2 6 m length 0 1 m width 0 3 m height sandanbata et al 2018b numerous subaerial slides were made and the resulting initial waves were photographed figs 4 5 for submarine landslides it was previously shown by numerous authors that the initial wave has a dipole depression elevation shape synolakis 2003 okal and synolakis 2004 okal et al 2009 watts et al 2005 enet and grilli 2007 mcfall and fritz 2016 however for the subaerial mass movements including the flank collapse of a volcano our experiments revealed that the initial wave is of almost pure elevation shape fig 4 we conducted several experiments using the set up shown in figs 4 5 by varying water depth all of them showed initial pure elevation wave two examples of our experiments are shown in fig 4 at two water depths of 6 and 10 cm this was previously partially shown by fritz et al 2001 for the lituya bay subaerial slide experiments therefore we consider an elevation wave as the initial wave for modeling the anak krakatoa volcano tsunami in comparison to other studies walder et al 2003 also considered a wave hump i e an elevation wave to model tsunamis from subaerial landslides the initial estimation of the tsunami source dimension can be achieved using the equation for phase velocity of long oceanic waves e g tsunamis rabinovich et al 2006 rabinovich 2010 sorensen 2010 1 c l t in which c is tsunami phase velocity l is tsunami wavelength and t is the tsunami dominating period for long waves such as tsunamis we know that c g h where g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 and h is water depth sorensen 2010 the tsunami wavelength l is α times larger than the initial length of the source l i n i around the source region 2 l α l i n i previously heidarzadeh and satake 2015b reported α 2 which is confirmed by our qualitative physical experiments fig 5 therefore by combining equations 1 and 2 we have 3 l i n i t 2 g h the sketch in fig 6 c demonstrates the elevations of the anak krakatoa volcano before and after the december 2018 eruption and the initial pure elevation wave considered in this study for modeling the propagation and coastal amplification of the tsunami the volcano lost 228 m of its top structure to the sea due to the eruption fig 6a b c we consider two parameters for our static initial source model the initial length of the source l i n i and the initial wave amplitude a i n i twelve different scenarios were considered with varying values of l i n i 1 5 4 km and a i n i 10 200 m table 1 inspired by our wavelet analyses section 4 a circular elevation wave is used for the shape of the initial wave fig 7 for each scenario the potential energy of the initial tsunami source is calculated using the following equation modified from satake and kanamori 1991 4 e p 1 2 ρ g i 1 n η i 2 s i in which e p is the potential energy of tsunami initial source in joules ρ is density of water which is assumed to be 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 i is a counter for the number of computational cells n is the total number of cells in the computational domain η i is the amplitude of the initial tsunami source scenario at the center of each cell and s i is the area of each computational cell s i 250 m 250 m 62500 m2 to convert the potential energy of tsunami e p joules to an equivalent earthquake magnitude in richter scale the gutenberg richter equation was used gutenberg and richter 1956 5 log e 4 8 1 5 m s in which e is energy released by the earthquake in joules l o g is the logarithm to the base 10 and m s is earthquake surface wave magnitude we used e p of each source scenario as inputs for e in equation 5 both amplitudes and spectra of the simulated waveforms were compared with those of observations at tide gauges in order to select the best source model for amplitude comparisons the normalized root mean square nrms misfit equation of heidarzadeh et al 2016a was applied as subaerial landslide generated waves are usually characterized by short period waves it is necessary to quantify the degree of wave dispersion in order to confirm whether shallow water equations used by comcot are adequate for their simulations we apply the following wave dispersion parameter introduced by glimsdal et al 2013 6 τ 6 h 2 d λ 3 in which τ is dispersion parameter λ is length of tsunami source h is water depth around the source region and d is the distance from source region to the coastline dispersion effect can be neglected for τ 0 01 but it becomes significant if τ 0 1 glimsdal et al 2013 for the case of the 22 december 2018 anak krakatoa volcanic tsunami we have λ 1 5 4 km table 1 d 40 80 km fig 3 and h 0 100 m fig 1 therefore we obtain an average value of 0 04 for the dispersion parameter τ implying that dispersion effects is not significant 4 source dimensions based on wavelet analysis fig 8 presents the results of wavelet analysis which reveals that tsunami energy is distributed in the period band of 5 25 min it can be seen that energy is channeled into varying period bands at different times for example three period bands of 6 3 17 and 23 min are identified in the wavelet plot of marina jambu the high energy channels for kota agung are 8 9 and 17 min different tsunami dominating periods are seen from one station to another in marina jambu the dominating period is 6 3 min while it is 15 min in ciwandan 11 4 min in panjang and 17 min in kota agung appearance of several high energy channels and occurrence of different dominating periods can be attributed to the complicated bathymetry features in the sunda strait which includes shallow water 1000 m water depth and several small islands and coastal rias fig 1 therefore not all of the high energy tsunami periods can be attributed to the tsunamis source itself e g rabinovich 1997 heidarzadeh et al 2016b it has been reported by several authors that the first tsunami waves can be considered as those generated by the tsunami source e g rabinovich 2010 rabinovich et al 2008 heidarzadeh and satake 2013 the wavelet analysis shows that the period of the first tsunami waves are 6 3 7 8 6 7 and 8 9 min in the four tide gauge stations indicating that the average source period of the december 2018 anak krakatoa tsunami was 7 4 min which is the mean value of the aforesaid four periods applying equation 3 by considering water depth in the range of 10 80 m and wave period of 6 3 8 9 min we estimate the initial water surface dimension l i n i in the range of 1 8 7 4 km our source scenarios table 1 fig 7 include initial source lengths l i n i in the range of 1 5 4 0 km because preliminary simulations revealed that source lengths larger than 4 0 km result is synthetic waveforms much larger than observations 5 best source model based on numerical simulations and discussion simulated waveforms for 12 subaerial landslide scenarios ls are compared with observed waveforms fig 9 results showed that scenarios with initial wave amplitude a i n i of 10 20 m ls 11 ls 12 cannot generate any waves at the location of five tide gauges on the other hand scenarios involving large initial length l i n i of 4 0 km ls 5 ls 6 generate much larger simulated waves than observations in terms of quality of amplitude fit between observations and simulations five scenarios ls 1 ls 4 ls 7 ls 8 and ls 9 produce better performances figs 9 10 these five scenarios cover initial lengths and amplitudes in the ranges of 1 5 3 km and 50 200 m respectively the minimum nrms misfit belongs to ls 7 fig 10 to further narrow down our search for the best source model we calculated the water wave spectra for the five scenarios of ls 1 ls 4 ls 7 ls 8 and ls 9 fig 11 it can be seen that the spectra for the observations and simulations match fairly well in marina jambu and panjang for the two stations of kota agung and ciwandan the spectral peaks are identical fig 11 although spectral gaps exist between simulations and observations overall ls 9 better reproduces the observation spectra than the other scenarios in summary the best model in terms of amplitude fit between observations and simulation is ls 7 whereas it is ls 9 in terms of spectral fit considering the uncertainties involved in this research such as lack of high resolution bathymetry limited tide gauge data available and the limited number of tsunami scenarios used it is believed that a single source model should not be chosen as the best model rather the best model could have characteristics between ls 7 and ls 9 fig 12 therefore we report the initial length and initial wave amplitude of the best model in the ranges of l i n i 1 5 2 5 km and a i n i 100 150 m respectively such a source model produces potential energy of 7 14 1013 1 05 1014 j equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 0 6 1 in richter scale table 1 our final source model l i n i 1 5 2 5 km a i n i 100 150 m is consistent with published empirical equations on the maximum amplitude of the initial wave generated by subaerial landslides table 2 fritz et al 2004 2009 noda 1970 by using the characteristics of the december 2018 anak krakatoa volcanic eruption such as average slide thickness s of 114 half of the total collapsed height of 228 m fig 6 average water depth h of 20 50 m friction factor f of 0 1 slide impact angle α of 45 rock density of 2300 kg m3 water density of 1000 kg m3 slide volume v s of 21 1 106 m3 volume of a cone with height of 228 m and radius of 300 m figs 1 and 6 the empirical equations yield initial wave amplitude a i n i of 65 134 m table 2 which is fairly close to our a i n i 100 150 m the final initial source dimension of l i n i 1 5 2 5 km is within the estimated range of source length from wavelet analysis l i n i 1 8 7 4 km we note that the existing empirical equations for the prediction of the maximum amplitude of the initial wave generated by subaerial landslides are associated with large uncertainties as seen in the amplitude range of 65 134 m given by these equations table 2 6 conclusions the 22 december 2018 tsunami generated by the eruption of the anak krakatoa volcano has been studied and a source model is proposed main findings are our qualitative physical modeling of subaerial landslide failures revealed that the initial tsunami wave immediately after the generation phase is mostly a pure elevation wave therefore the tsunami source was assumed to be a pure elevation wave in this study based on the wavelet analyses of the tsunami observations at tide gauges we found the period of the first tsunami signal arriving at different stations in the range of 6 3 8 9 min which guided us to an initial tsunami length of 1 8 7 4 km we considered 12 source scenarios each including a pure elevation wave involving source dimensions of 1 5 4 km and initial amplitudes of 10 200 m numerical modeling of tsunami was conducted for all 12 source scenarios resulting in five scenarios as the best ones in terms of quality of waveform fits between observations and simulations these five scenarios narrowed down the source lengths and initial amplitudes to the domains 1 5 3 0 km and 50 200 m respectively quality of spectral fit between observations and simulations further constrained the source to two models having initial lengths and amplitudes of 1 5 2 5 km and 100 150 m respectively the best model length 1 5 2 5 km amplitude 100 150 m involves potential energy of 7 14 1013 1 05 1014 j equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 0 6 1 in richter scale the amplitude of our final model 100 150 m is consistent with predictions of empirical equations which give initial amplitudes of 65 134 m for the anak

of almost pure elevation shape fig 4 we conducted several experiments using the set up shown in figs 4 5 by varying water depth all of them showed initial pure elevation wave two examples of our experiments are shown in fig 4 at two water depths of 6 and 10 cm this was previously partially shown by fritz et al 2001 for the lituya bay subaerial slide experiments therefore we consider an elevation wave as the initial wave for modeling the anak krakatoa volcano tsunami in comparison to other studies walder et al 2003 also considered a wave hump i e an elevation wave to model tsunamis from subaerial landslides the initial estimation of the tsunami source dimension can be achieved using the equation for phase velocity of long oceanic waves e g tsunamis rabinovich et al 2006 rabinovich 2010 sorensen 2010 1 c l t in which c is tsunami phase velocity l is tsunami wavelength and t is the tsunami dominating period for long waves such as tsunamis we know that c g h where g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 and h is water depth sorensen 2010 the tsunami wavelength l is α times larger than the initial length of the source l i n i around the source region 2 l α l i n i previously heidarzadeh and satake 2015b reported α 2 which is confirmed by our qualitative physical experiments fig 5 therefore by combining equations 1 and 2 we have 3 l i n i t 2 g h the sketch in fig 6 c demonstrates the elevations of the anak krakatoa volcano before and after the december 2018 eruption and the initial pure elevation wave considered in this study for modeling the propagation and coastal amplification of the tsunami the volcano lost 228 m of its top structure to the sea due to the eruption fig 6a b c we consider two parameters for our static initial source model the initial length of the source l i n i and the initial wave amplitude a i n i twelve different scenarios were considered with varying values of l i n i 1 5 4 km and a i n i 10 200 m table 1 inspired by our wavelet analyses section 4 a circular elevation wave is used for the shape of the initial wave fig 7 for each scenario the potential energy of the initial tsunami source is calculated using the following equation modified from satake and kanamori 1991 4 e p 1 2 ρ g i 1 n η i 2 s i in which e p is the potential energy of tsunami initial source in joules ρ is density of water which is assumed to be 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 i is a counter for the number of computational cells n is the total number of cells in the computational domain η i is the amplitude of the initial tsunami source scenario at the center of each cell and s i is the area of each computational cell s i 250 m 250 m 62500 m2 to convert the potential energy of tsunami e p joules to an equivalent earthquake magnitude in richter scale the gutenberg richter equation was used gutenberg and richter 1956 5 log e 4 8 1 5 m s in which e is energy released by the earthquake in joules l o g is the logarithm to the base 10 and m s is earthquake surface wave magnitude we used e p of each source scenario as inputs for e in equation 5 both amplitudes and spectra of the simulated waveforms were compared with those of observations at tide gauges in order to select the best source model for amplitude comparisons the normalized root mean square nrms misfit equation of heidarzadeh et al 2016a was applied as subaerial landslide generated waves are usually characterized by short period waves it is necessary to quantify the degree of wave dispersion in order to confirm whether shallow water equations used by comcot are adequate for their simulations we apply the following wave dispersion parameter introduced by glimsdal et al 2013 6 τ 6 h 2 d λ 3 in which τ is dispersion parameter λ is length of tsunami source h is water depth around the source region and d is the distance from source region to the coastline dispersion effect can be neglected for τ 0 01 but it becomes significant if τ 0 1 glimsdal et al 2013 for the case of the 22 december 2018 anak krakatoa volcanic tsunami we have λ 1 5 4 km table 1 d 40 80 km fig 3 and h 0 100 m fig 1 therefore we obtain an average value of 0 04 for the dispersion parameter τ implying that dispersion effects is not significant 4 source dimensions based on wavelet analysis fig 8 presents the results of wavelet analysis which reveals that tsunami energy is distributed in the period band of 5 25 min it can be seen that energy is channeled into varying period bands at different times for example three period bands of 6 3 17 and 23 min are identified in the wavelet plot of marina jambu the high energy channels for kota agung are 8 9 and 17 min different tsunami dominating periods are seen from one station to another in marina jambu the dominating period is 6 3 min while it is 15 min in ciwandan 11 4 min in panjang and 17 min in kota agung appearance of several high energy channels and occurrence of different dominating periods can be attributed to the complicated bathymetry features in the sunda strait which includes shallow water 1000 m water depth and several small islands and coastal rias fig 1 therefore not all of the high energy tsunami periods can be attributed to the tsunamis source itself e g rabinovich 1997 heidarzadeh et al 2016b it has been reported by several authors that the first tsunami waves can be considered as those generated by the tsunami source e g rabinovich 2010 rabinovich et al 2008 heidarzadeh and satake 2013 the wavelet analysis shows that the period of the first tsunami waves are 6 3 7 8 6 7 and 8 9 min in the four tide gauge stations indicating that the average source period of the december 2018 anak krakatoa tsunami was 7 4 min which is the mean value of the aforesaid four periods applying equation 3 by considering water depth in the range of 10 80 m and wave period of 6 3 8 9 min we estimate the initial water surface dimension l i n i in the range of 1 8 7 4 km our source scenarios table 1 fig 7 include initial source lengths l i n i in the range of 1 5 4 0 km because preliminary simulations revealed that source lengths larger than 4 0 km result is synthetic waveforms much larger than observations 5 best source model based on numerical simulations and discussion simulated waveforms for 12 subaerial landslide scenarios ls are compared with observed waveforms fig 9 results showed that scenarios with initial wave amplitude a i n i of 10 20 m ls 11 ls 12 cannot generate any waves at the location of five tide gauges on the other hand scenarios involving large initial length l i n i of 4 0 km ls 5 ls 6 generate much larger simulated waves than observations in terms of quality of amplitude fit between observations and simulations five scenarios ls 1 ls 4 ls 7 ls 8 and ls 9 produce better performances figs 9 10 these five scenarios cover initial lengths and amplitudes in the ranges of 1 5 3 km and 50 200 m respectively the minimum nrms misfit belongs to ls 7 fig 10 to further narrow down our search for the best source model we calculated the water wave spectra for the five scenarios of ls 1 ls 4 ls 7 ls 8 and ls 9 fig 11 it can be seen that the spectra for the observations and simulations match fairly well in marina jambu and panjang for the two stations of kota agung and ciwandan the spectral peaks are identical fig 11 although spectral gaps exist between simulations and observations overall ls 9 better reproduces the observation spectra than the other scenarios in summary the best model in terms of amplitude fit between observations and simulation is ls 7 whereas it is ls 9 in terms of spectral fit considering the uncertainties involved in this research such as lack of high resolution bathymetry limited tide gauge data available and the limited number of tsunami scenarios used it is believed that a single source model should not be chosen as the best model rather the best model could have characteristics between ls 7 and ls 9 fig 12 therefore we report the initial length and initial wave amplitude of the best model in the ranges of l i n i 1 5 2 5 km and a i n i 100 150 m respectively such a source model produces potential energy of 7 14 1013 1 05 1014 j equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 0 6 1 in richter scale table 1 our final source model l i n i 1 5 2 5 km a i n i 100 150 m is consistent with published empirical equations on the maximum amplitude of the initial wave generated by subaerial landslides table 2 fritz et al 2004 2009 noda 1970 by using the characteristics of the december 2018 anak krakatoa volcanic eruption such as average slide thickness s of 114 half of the total collapsed height of 228 m fig 6 average water depth h of 20 50 m friction factor f of 0 1 slide impact angle α of 45 rock density of 2300 kg m3 water density of 1000 kg m3 slide volume v s of 21 1 106 m3 volume of a cone with height of 228 m and radius of 300 m figs 1 and 6 the empirical equations yield initial wave amplitude a i n i of 65 134 m table 2 which is fairly close to our a i n i 100 150 m the final initial source dimension of l i n i 1 5 2 5 km is within the estimated range of source length from wavelet analysis l i n i 1 8 7 4 km we note that the existing empirical equations for the prediction of the maximum amplitude of the initial wave generated by subaerial landslides are associated with large uncertainties as seen in the amplitude range of 65 134 m given by these equations table 2 6 conclusions the 22 december 2018 tsunami generated by the eruption of the anak krakatoa volcano has been studied and a source model is proposed main findings are our qualitative physical modeling of subaerial landslide failures revealed that the initial tsunami wave immediately after the generation phase is mostly a pure elevation wave therefore the tsunami source was assumed to be a pure elevation wave in this study based on the wavelet analyses of the tsunami observations at tide gauges we found the period of the first tsunami signal arriving at different stations in the range of 6 3 8 9 min which guided us to an initial tsunami length of 1 8 7 4 km we considered 12 source scenarios each including a pure elevation wave involving source dimensions of 1 5 4 km and initial amplitudes of 10 200 m numerical modeling of tsunami was conducted for all 12 source scenarios resulting in five scenarios as the best ones in terms of quality of waveform fits between observations and simulations these five scenarios narrowed down the source lengths and initial amplitudes to the domains 1 5 3 0 km and 50 200 m respectively quality of spectral fit between observations and simulations further constrained the source to two models having initial lengths and amplitudes of 1 5 2 5 km and 100 150 m respectively the best model length 1 5 2 5 km amplitude 100 150 m involves potential energy of 7 14 1013 1 05 1014 j equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 0 6 1 in richter scale the amplitude of our final model 100 150 m is consistent with predictions of empirical equations which give initial amplitudes of 65 134 m for the anak

22272,a novel identification approach to nonlinear ship manoeuvring models based on bayes rule is presented the empirical bayesian method is used to clean simulated polluted responses from a 20 20 zigzag test two efficient bayesian models conjugate regression and semi conjugate regression are adopted for hydrodynamic parameter identification to obtain other prior parameters the bayesian optimization bo algorithm is introduced in the bayesian regression model by using the identified model and an experimental model based on blanke s nonlinear four degrees of freedom 4 dof model 10 10 zigzag motion and 35 turning circle manoeuvring are performed a comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates that both bayesian regression models have good generalization ability for identification and that the conjugate bayesian model has greater prediction accuracy keywords ship manoeuvrability hydrodynamic coefficients system identification bayesian multilinear regression white noise 1 introduction the highly accurate mathematical modelling of vessels plays a vital role in ship design and operation for ships with low centre heights such as container ships ship manoeuvring motion is usually accompanied by a remarkable amount of roll motion son and nomoto son and nomoto 1981 studied container ship motion based on experimental tests and established a four degrees of freedom 4 dof equation of motion blanke et blanke and jensen 1997 pérez and blanke 2002 proposed a nonlinear 4 dof model based on a roll planar motion mechanism rpmm facility and validated it via full scale trials there are many hydrodynamic parameters in the ship motion model added mass in a ship manoeuvring model can be estimated accurately perez and fossen 2006 by slender body theory hence the key to the prediction accuracy is to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives which are regarded as the most uncertain part in the mathematical model many researchers have devoted themselves to solving this challenging problem and indicated that system identification si theory in combination with full scale trials or free running tests padilla et al 2014 is a powerful and practical method classic si techniques are widely applied for ship and underwater vehicle manoeuvring including least square ls estimation nagumo and noda 1967 improved least squares holzhüter 1990 the extended kalman filter ekf abkowitz and martin 1980 tiano et al 2007 the recursive prediction error method rpe blanke et al 1986 and ridge regression yoon and rhee 2003 however these methods have some inherent disadvantages such as sensitivity to noise or simultaneous drift zhang and zou 2013 luo and li 2017 in order to overcome these defects a novel algorithm has been proposed to build a purely input output model on the basis of artificial neural networks ann moreira and guedes soares 2003 2012 woo et al 2018 the advantage of ann is that it is not necessary to prioritize one complex mathematical ship model however ann cannot reflect any physical background moreover the construction of the network structure is blind before full training in recent years several robust machine learning methods such as the back propagation neural network rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 and support vector machines svm wang et al 2015 wang et al 2014 have been proposed and have achieved encouraging results in the application of hydrodynamic parameter identification however the hyperparameters introduced in these algorithms such as initial weights or penalty factors have no intuitive physical meaning or logical explanation the si methods mentioned above assume that unknown hydrodynamic parameters are constants and use limiting relative frequencies to define probability roberts et roberts et al 1994 proposed using markov process theories to solve the linear regression problem in ship roll motion from the perspective of probability and statistics however the case of one degree of freedom cannot fully prove the applicability of these theories to the overall movement of the ship iseki and terada introduced bayesian modelling technology to estimate directional wave spectra based on ship motion data and obtained excellent results iseki and terada 2002 bayesian methods provide an alternative viewpoint that treats the parameters as random variables and can numerically represent a set of subjective rational beliefs bayes rule offers a reasonable way to update beliefs in light of new observations in addition to their formal interpretation as a means of induction bayesian methods have significant advantages in parameter estimation with good statistical properties predictions for missing data forecasting hoff 2009 etc recently bayesian methods especially in parameter estimation have been applied in multiple fields khoshravesh et al 2015 petra et al 2017 zitzmann et al 2016 owing to the prevalence of the bayesian framework and the applicability of modern inference methods based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method this article attempts to apply the bayesian approach to identifying the hydrodynamic parameters in blanke s nonlinear 4 dof model first based on the zigzag test simulated by the 4 dof ship manoeuvring mathematical model blanke and jensen 1997 pérez and blanke 2002 gaussian white noise is added to each observed state to simulate the data obtained in the sea trial an empirical bayesian eb wavelet method silverman and johnstone 2004 is implemented for removing noise then two efficient bayesian regression models are utilized to estimate the parameters and the bayesian hyperparameter optimization bo algorithm is introduced to determine the coefficients of the prior distribution finally in order to validate the proposed method we use the posterior distribution of the obtained parameters to predict the steering motion of the ship and compare the results with rpmm experimental data 2 ship mathematical model to describe the motion characteristics of a vessel as shown in fig 1 two coordinate reference frames are adopted including the earth fixed coordinates e x 0 y 0 z 0 and the body fixed coordinates o x 0 y 0 z 0 according to son and nomoto s nonlinear model son and nomoto 1981 the uniform equations including the x g surge sway yaw and roll coupled motion can be transformed as follows 1 m u v r x g r 2 z g r p f x m v u r x g r z g p f y i z z r m x g v u r m n i x x m z g v u r m k ρ g g z φ where m is the ship s mass u v r and p denote the surge velocity sway velocity yaw rate and roll rate respectively and z g are the coordinates of the ship s centre of gravity in the body fixed coordinate frame i x x and i z z are the moments of inertia of the ship about the x 0 and y 0 axes respectively f x and f y are the longitudinal and lateral force components respectively m n is the yaw moment about the z 0 axis and m k is the roll moment about the x 0 axis in the last term of eq 1 denotes the ship displacement g is the gravity constant ρ is the mass density of the water and g z φ is the buoyancy function which can be approximated as 2 g z φ g m 1 2 b m t a n 2 φ sin φ where g m is the metacentre height b m is the distance from the centre of buoyancy to the metacentre and φ is the roll angle for the convenience of comparison expanding the force and moment in eq 1 with taylor series blanke and jensen 1997 pérez and blanke 2002 and rewriting them in a nondimensional matrix using the prime system of sname sname 1950 for substituting model test results yields 3 m x u 0 0 0 0 m y v m x g y r m z g y 0 m x g n v i z z n r n p 0 m z g k v k r i x x k p u v r p f 1 f 2 m 1 m 2 for notational convenience the first matrix containing the mass inertia coefficients and acceleration derivatives in eq 3 is labelled j the

speed u a u u n o m u u 2 v 2 u n o m is the nominal speed and δ is the rudder angle 3 bayesian regression formulation the object of hydrodynamic parameter identification is to estimate β in the multiple linear regression mlr model as in eq 6 6 y t x t β ε t where t 1 n denotes time y t is the observed response x t is a 1 c row vector of the observed values of c predictors β is a c 1 column vector of regression parameters corresponding to the variables that consist of the columns of x t and ε t is the random disturbance that has a mean of zero and common variance of σ 2 the bayesian approach to estimating mlr models treats β and σ 2 as random variables rather than fixed quantities generally the bayesian analysis process updates the probability distributions of the parameters by incorporating information about the parameters from the observing data which is a kind of incremental learning in other words resolving the bayesian inverse problem is a posterior probability density function pdf bayes theorem gives the posterior pdf as 7 p p a r a m e t e r s d a t a p d a t a p a r a m e t e r s p p a r a m e t e r s p d a t a eq 7 can be simplified to 8 p o s t e r i o r l i k e l i h o o d p r i o r where likelihood represents the information provided by the sample response about the parameters and the mathematical model is 9 ℓ β σ 2 y x t 1 n p y t x t β σ 2 where prior is the parameter distribution that we assume which allows us to incorporate information about the model before data are imported moreover we can control the confidence in our knowledge about the parameter by adjusting the variance of the prior distribution after specifying the type and parameters of the prior distribution the joint posterior density can be obtained by substituting the density probability into eq 7 10 π β σ 2 y x ℓ β σ 2 y x π β π σ 2 π β π σ 2 ρ β σ 2 y x d β d σ 2 where prior distributions are typically denoted π β and π σ 2 however the ultimate goal of regression is to obtain the marginal posterior distribution of β for different types of prior distributions selected various bayesian regression methods such as the hierarchical linear model woltman et al 2012 and the bayesian lasso model park and george 2008 have been proposed to suit different scenarios considering the number of parameters calculation efficiency and accuracy we choose priors so that the corresponding distribution is in the same family of distributions called the conjugate distributions according to the central limit theorem most of the measured value distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution or a gaussian distribution a popular choice is the normal inverse gamma conjugate model robert and christian 2014 in which β obeys the multivariate normal distribution n and σ 2 is the inverse gamma i g distribution eq 10 can be abbreviated as follows 11 π β σ 2 y x n β n σ 2 t 1 n ϕ y t x t β σ 2 where ϕ y t x t β σ 2 is the gaussian probability density with mean x t β and variance σ 2 on y t the regression model is divided into conjugate and semi conjugate regression murphy 2012 depending on whether parameters and variance are independent 3 1 conjugate bayesian regression when β and σ 2 are independent the priori distributions of β and σ 2 are as follows 12 β σ 2 n c μ σ 2 v σ 2 i g a b where μ is the mean value c 1 vector v is the c c diagonal matrix in which each element equals the prior variance factor of β j and i g a b denotes the inverse gamma distribution with shape a and scale b considering our limited prior information about many parameters we cannot set different priors for each coefficient so the diagonal elements in v are simplified to be equal to ➉ in this paper since both the prior and the posterior have the same family of distributions the conditional posterior distribution of β can be calculated by eq 11 and eq 13 with σ 2 held constant as shown in eq 14 13 p β σ 2 y x p β p y x β σ 2 14 β σ 2 y x n c v 1 x t x 1 x t x β ˆ v 1 μ σ 2 v 1 x t x 1 where x is an n c matrix of training data the marginal posterior density of σ 2 from eq 11 is the ig distribution 15 σ 2 y x i g a n c 2 b 1 s s r β 1 2 β ˆ μ t v 1 β ˆ μ 1 where s s r β is given by 16 s s r β i 1 n y i β t x i 2 y x β t y x β to sample from the joint posterior first draw σ 2 from its marginal posterior distribution given in eq 15 and then draw β from its normal conditional posterior distribution given in eq 14 using the simulated value of σ 2 finally from the integration of the joint posterior density with respect to σ 2 the marginal posterior density of β can be calculated as 17 β y x t c v 1 x t x 1 x t x β ˆ v 1 μ λ 2 a n λ 2 b 1 s s r β β ˆ μ t v x t x 1 1 β ˆ μ 2 a n in which t c l λ ➈ denotes the c dimensional multivariate t distribution where l is the location λ is the scale and ➈ represents the degrees of freedom 3 2 semi conjugate bayesian regression when β and σ 2 are dependent the priori distributions of β and σ 2 are as follows 18 β σ 2 n c μ v σ 2 i g a b as with conjugate regression a conditional posterior distribution of β and σ 2 can be obtained 19 β σ 2 y x n c v 1 σ 2 x t x 1 σ 2 x t x β ˆ v 1 μ v 1 x t x 1 20 σ 2 β y x i g a n 2 b 1 1 2 s s r β 1 however since β and σ 2 are mutually influential their posterior distributions are not analytically tractable some numerical integration techniques based on the mcmc method have been proposed to solve this problem in the present work the gibbs sampler gelfand and smith 1990 is applied to approximate the posterior of β and σ 2 the gibbs sampler is an iterative algorithm that constructs a dependent sequence of parameter values whose distribution converges to the target joint posterior distribution the details of the gibbs sampler are shown in algorithm 1 image 1050 finally through the two methods above the forecast of ship motion can be obtained using the mean values of the c dimensional posterior predictive distribution 3 3 hyperparameters in prior distribution a distinctive advantage of the bayesian approach is that prior information and the observed sample are combined in the algorithm the parameters of the prior distribution such as the mean and variance are called hyperparameters in machine learning in contrast with other commonly used machine learning algorithms the prior parameters of the bayesian algorithm have an intuitive meaning specifying a high prior variance implies that we know very little about the parameter so a greater weight is given to the information in the data whereas specifying a low prior variance implies high confidence in prior information based on the feature of bayesian regression this paper proposes to use the bo algorithm bull 2011 to determine the parameters a b of the distribution for σ 2 the variance factor of parameters v that can reflect the confidence for the mean μ the algorithm treats the bayesian regression model as a gaussian process gp and uses the acquisition function af of the expected improvement to find a result that can satisfy the objective function threshold the basic pseudo code for bayesian optimization is shown in algorithm 2 image 10718 compared with other optimization methods the bo algorithm works better in cases with fewer hyperparameters and slower operation of the objective model which coincides with the characteristics of bayesian regression therefore the bo algorithm is applied in the present work to obtain the hyperparameters of the prior distribution the training data are pre processed by z score transformation altman 2000 in order to avoid the influence of the high impact index and k fold cross validation is applied to make full use of the data in this process k fold cross validation randomly divides the set of observations into k groups each time the first fold is treated as a validation set and other folds are used for training 4 numerical example results and discussion 4 1 construction of the training model a container vessel was selected as the object model and the main data and dimensions are given in table 1 the choice of training manoeuvres is as important as the formulation of a regression model as ljung ljung 1987 suggested the input data for si should satisfy the persistence of the excitation condition to guarantee convergence and ensure the robustness properties of the identification method according to his view the 20 20 zigzag test and the 35 turning test reach the appropriate range of extrapolation unlike the 10 10 zigzag test and will therefore provide more informative data for identification however the turning circle test is not appropriate for si because in the motion of the circle after the rudder is turned the observation values are very similar or even constant which will cause the vectors in the matrix to be highly correlated therefore a 20 20 standard zigzag manoeuvre was simulated in matlab with 20000 point output discretization by using the hydrodynamic parameters from the rpmm facility at the danish maritime institute scale ratio 28 75 as given in table 2 and table 3 note that some hydrodynamic derivatives were adjusted to match the full scale trial results blanke and jensen 1997 the sampling interval is 0 02 s and the total time is 400 s the raw training data couples consist of the following 21 i n p u t v a r i a b l e s a i b

is almost meaningless to use the raw data above for identification directly as the real experimental measurements will inevitably be affected by various disturbances and produce a great deal of high frequency responses such as ship oscillatory motion or mechanical noise following sutulo and soares s artificially polluted data construction method sutulo and guedes soares 2014 gaussian white noise is added as follows 22 ζ t ζ 0 t ζ m a x k ζ ξ t where ζ 0 t is the clean sampling data ζ m a x is the maximum absolute value in the original recorded data k ζ is the specific reduction factor for different variables and ξ t is a discrete random variable subject to a gaussian distribution with a variance of 0 2 according to the ship model test data published by simman 2014 2020 ittc 2019 the noise is mainly concentrated in the sway while the noise of the remaining responses is smaller and the deviations of rudder angle can be ignored this is why the value of k ζ is set as 1 0 and 0 3 for the surge velocity and other records respectively 4 2 empirical bayes denoising eb is widely used in the field of noise filtering and jonhstome and sliverman proposed a fully automatic empirical bayes thresholding method silverman and johnstone 2004 which is applicable to various scenarios the general model for a noisy signal has the following form where we have observations at regularly spaced points t i of the unknown function f subjected to noise 23 x i f t i ε i where the ε i are independent n 0 σ e random noises after being suitably renormalized at a particular level eq 23 can be transformed into the following form 24 z i u i ε i where z z 1 z n are observations and ε i are independent n 0 1 variables the denoising objective is to recover the unknown coefficients u on the basis of the observed data here we assume that the elements u i have independent prior distributions each given by the mixture 25 f p r i o r u 1 w δ 0 u w ➇ u where w is the weight used to adjust the near zero part δ 0 u and the nonzero part ➇ u the nonzero part of the prior ➇ is assumed to be a fixed unimodal symmetric density let ➆ denote the convolution of the density ➇ with the standard normal density φ the marginal density of the observations z i is 26 1 w φ ➅ w ➆ ➅ where w can be estimated by the marginal maximum log likelihood to obtain the estimator w ˆ 27 ℓ w i 1 n log 1 w φ ➅ i w ➆ ➅ i subject to the constraint on w that the threshold satisfies ➄ w 2 l o g n since ℓ w is a monotonic function of w the root of eq 27 can easily be obtained numerically if eq 26 is tractable the main idea of this method is to insert the value for w ˆ into the prior and then estimate the raw value of u i using the value of w thus obtained we applied the above method to denoise the polluted data fig 2 shows the simulated raw data polluted data and denoised data from the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre the enlarged figure shows that the eb denoising method has a significant effect the filtered noise data that have been obtained will be used for the next step of parameter identification as training data 4 3 bayesian regression and validation the denoised data entered contain a total of 400 couples with a sampling frequency of 1 hz since the values of the hydrodynamic coefficient are usually small in the dimensionless model the priori mean μ is set to 0 to reflect the priori information then the bo algorithm is adopted for the regression model to obtain the hyperparameters of conjugate regression and semi conjugate regression and the number of evaluations for bo is set at 40 shown in table 4 the values of the variance ➉ of β are quite large indicating that the values of the parameters are scattered around 0 and that the regression results are mainly dependent on observations the ig prior distribution of σ 2 is determined by the obtained values of a and b fig 3 shows the prior and posterior distributions of σ 2 for surge using conjugate regression and semi conjugate regression it should be noted that the prior parameters vary within the same magnitude which has a slight effect on the results the mean value of the distribution of the hydrodynamic coefficients is obtained by eq 17 for conjugate bayesian regression and the semi conjugate regression results are obtained by gibbs sampling the sample trajectories of x u and k v v are shown in fig 4 note that each value of the mean of the trajectories is the value for the parameter results for the two models in comparison with rpmm test data are listed in tables 2 and 3 where are denotes the absolute relative error as in eq 28 underscores are used to mark the values with absolute relative error higher than 50 28 a r e β e s t i m a t e β r p m m β r p m m 100 as shown in tables 2 and 3 most results agree well with the experimental data indicating that the application of the proposed bayesian approach is indeed robust in the presence of noise nevertheless for some high order coefficients such as y p u p u n v φ φ a n d k φ v v the difference is not negligible the discrepancies may be attributed to the sensitivity of these coefficients the noise in the data cannot be completely filtered out so the errors of these high order variables accumulate by multiplication it is difficult to judge the merits and usability of the two bayesian methods only from the results of parameter identification in tables 2 and 3 therefore 10 10 zigzag motion and 35 turning circle manoeuvring are predicted as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 both predictions have achieved good agreement with the rpmm experiments showing the robustness and generalization ability of the proposed bayesian method in addition it can be seen that the accuracy of conjugate regression is higher than that of semi conjugate regression especially with respect to roll motion there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon first in contrast with semi conjugate regression conjugate regression assumes that the variance and the mean are independent of each other considering that the artificial noise added is independent of the observed value the conjugate model is a better fit in the present work second gibbs sampling which is used in the process of semi conjugate regression is less stable than the analytical solution of conjugate regression therefore the prior hyperparameters used in semi conjugate regression ultimately obtained by the bo algorithm are less suitable 5 conclusions and discussions a new method for hydrodynamic coefficient identification in ship manoeuvring mathematical models based on the bayesian rule is presented and is tested and validated in a nonlinear 4 dof model with 108 hydrodynamic derivatives conjugate and semi conjugate bayesian multivariate regression with bo arithmetic are applied for identification with 20 20 zigzag testing polluted data after noise has been filtered by the eb denoising method ship motion simulations of 10 10 zigzag testing and 35 turning manoeuvring are implemented to verify the proposed method compared to experimental data several conclusions can be drawn from the study 1 after the polluted data are cleaned by the empirical bayesian method conjugate regression and semi conjugate regression models for identification have good generalization performance but some high order hydrodynamic coefficients are hard to identify precisely because of their high sensitivity to noise 2 the proposed bayesian approach is suitable for nonlinear dimensionless ship models because the parameters are small other prior parameters can be obtained by the bo algorithm and these hyperparameters have intuitive meanings such as noise and confidence furthermore if we have more prior information of parameters or noise in advance the bayesian method will exhibit superiority to the traditional method 3 conjugate bayesian regression shows better prediction results than semi conjugate bayesian regression under artificial white noise our future work will concentrate on full scale trials with real environmental disturbances acknowledgement this study is supported in part by the national key r d program of china grant no sq2018yfc030044 and in part by the national natural

22272,a novel identification approach to nonlinear ship manoeuvring models based on bayes rule is presented the empirical bayesian method is used to clean simulated polluted responses from a 20 20 zigzag test two efficient bayesian models conjugate regression and semi conjugate regression are adopted for hydrodynamic parameter identification to obtain other prior parameters the bayesian optimization bo algorithm is introduced in the bayesian regression model by using the identified model and an experimental model based on blanke s nonlinear four degrees of freedom 4 dof model 10 10 zigzag motion and 35 turning circle manoeuvring are performed a comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates that both bayesian regression models have good generalization ability for identification and that the conjugate bayesian model has greater prediction accuracy keywords ship manoeuvrability hydrodynamic coefficients system identification bayesian multilinear regression white noise 1 introduction the highly accurate mathematical modelling of vessels plays a vital role in ship design and operation for ships with low centre heights such as container ships ship manoeuvring motion is usually accompanied by a remarkable amount of roll motion son and nomoto son and nomoto 1981 studied container ship motion based on experimental tests and established a four degrees of freedom 4 dof equation of motion blanke et blanke and jensen 1997 pérez and blanke 2002 proposed a nonlinear 4 dof model based on a roll planar motion mechanism rpmm facility and validated it via full scale trials there are many hydrodynamic parameters in the ship motion model added mass in a ship manoeuvring model can be estimated accurately perez and fossen 2006 by slender body theory hence the key to the prediction accuracy is to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives which are regarded as the most uncertain part in the mathematical model many researchers have devoted themselves to solving this challenging problem and indicated that system identification si theory in combination with full scale trials or free running tests padilla et al 2014 is a powerful and practical method classic si techniques are widely applied for ship and underwater vehicle manoeuvring including least square ls estimation nagumo and noda 1967 improved least squares holzhüter 1990 the extended kalman filter ekf abkowitz and martin 1980 tiano et al 2007 the recursive prediction error method rpe blanke et al 1986 and ridge regression yoon and rhee 2003 however these methods have some inherent disadvantages such as sensitivity to noise or simultaneous drift zhang and zou 2013 luo and li 2017 in order to overcome these defects a novel algorithm has been proposed to build a purely input output model on the basis of artificial neural networks ann moreira and guedes soares 2003 2012 woo et al 2018 the advantage of ann is that it is not necessary to prioritize one complex mathematical ship model however ann cannot reflect any physical background moreover the construction of the network structure is blind before full training in recent years several robust machine learning methods such as the back propagation neural network rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 and support vector machines svm wang et al 2015 wang et al 2014 have been proposed and have achieved encouraging results in the application of hydrodynamic parameter identification however the hyperparameters introduced in these algorithms such as initial weights or penalty factors have no intuitive physical meaning or logical explanation the si methods mentioned above assume that unknown hydrodynamic parameters are constants and use limiting relative frequencies to define probability roberts et roberts et al 1994 proposed using markov process theories to solve the linear regression problem in ship roll motion from the perspective of probability and statistics however the case of one degree of freedom cannot fully prove the applicability of these theories to the overall movement of the ship iseki and terada introduced bayesian modelling technology to estimate directional wave spectra based on ship motion data and obtained excellent results iseki and terada 2002 bayesian methods provide an alternative viewpoint that treats the parameters as random variables and can numerically represent a set of subjective rational beliefs bayes rule offers a reasonable way to update beliefs in light of new observations in addition to their formal interpretation as a means of induction bayesian methods have significant advantages in parameter estimation with good statistical properties predictions for missing data forecasting hoff 2009 etc recently bayesian methods especially in parameter estimation have been applied in multiple fields khoshravesh et al 2015 petra et al 2017 zitzmann et al 2016 owing to the prevalence of the bayesian framework and the applicability of modern inference methods based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method this article attempts to apply the bayesian approach to identifying the hydrodynamic parameters in blanke s nonlinear 4 dof model first based on the zigzag test simulated by the 4 dof ship manoeuvring mathematical model blanke and jensen 1997 pérez and blanke 2002 gaussian white noise is added to each observed state to simulate the data obtained in the sea trial an empirical bayesian eb wavelet method silverman and johnstone 2004 is implemented for removing noise then two efficient bayesian regression models are utilized to estimate the parameters and the bayesian hyperparameter optimization bo algorithm is introduced to determine the coefficients of the prior distribution finally in order to validate the proposed method we use the posterior distribution of the obtained parameters to predict the steering motion of the ship and compare the results with rpmm experimental data 2 ship mathematical model to describe the motion characteristics of a vessel as shown in fig 1 two coordinate reference frames are adopted including the earth fixed coordinates e x 0 y 0 z 0 and the body fixed coordinates o x 0 y 0 z 0 according to son and nomoto s nonlinear model son and nomoto 1981 the uniform equations including the x g surge sway yaw and roll coupled motion can be transformed as follows 1 m u v r x g r 2 z g r p f x m v u r x g r z g p f y i z z r m x g v u r m n i x x m z g v u r m k ρ g g z φ where m is the ship s mass u v r and p denote the surge velocity sway velocity yaw rate and roll rate respectively and z g are the coordinates of the ship s centre of gravity in the body fixed coordinate frame i x x and i z z are the moments of inertia of the ship about the x 0 and y 0 axes respectively f x and f y are the longitudinal and lateral force components respectively m n is the yaw moment about the z 0 axis and m k is the roll moment about the x 0 axis in the last term of eq 1 denotes the ship displacement g is the gravity constant ρ is the mass density of the water and g z φ is the buoyancy function which can be approximated as 2 g z φ g m 1 2 b m t a n 2 φ sin φ where g m is the metacentre height b m is the distance from the centre of buoyancy to the metacentre and φ is the roll angle for the convenience of comparison expanding the force and moment in eq 1 with taylor series blanke and jensen 1997 pérez and blanke 2002 and rewriting them in a nondimensional matrix using the prime system of sname sname 1950 for substituting model test results yields 3 m x u 0 0 0 0 m y v m x g y r m z g y 0 m x g n v i z z n r n p 0 m z g k v k r i x x k p u v r p f 1 f 2 m 1 m 2 for notational convenience the first matrix containing the mass inertia coefficients and acceleration derivatives in eq 3 is labelled j the

speed u a u u n o m u u 2 v 2 u n o m is the nominal speed and δ is the rudder angle 3 bayesian regression formulation the object of hydrodynamic parameter identification is to estimate β in the multiple linear regression mlr model as in eq 6 6 y t x t β ε t where t 1 n denotes time y t is the observed response x t is a 1 c row vector of the observed values of c predictors β is a c 1 column vector of regression parameters corresponding to the variables that consist of the columns of x t and ε t is the random disturbance that has a mean of zero and common variance of σ 2 the bayesian approach to estimating mlr models treats β and σ 2 as random variables rather than fixed quantities generally the bayesian analysis process updates the probability distributions of the parameters by incorporating information about the parameters from the observing data which is a kind of incremental learning in other words resolving the bayesian inverse problem is a posterior probability density function pdf bayes theorem gives the posterior pdf as 7 p p a r a m e t e r s d a t a p d a t a p a r a m e t e r s p p a r a m e t e r s p d a t a eq 7 can be simplified to 8 p o s t e r i o r l i k e l i h o o d p r i o r where likelihood represents the information provided by the sample response about the parameters and the mathematical model is 9 ℓ β σ 2 y x t 1 n p y t x t β σ 2 where prior is the parameter distribution that we assume which allows us to incorporate information about the model before data are imported moreover we can control the confidence in our knowledge about the parameter by adjusting the variance of the prior distribution after specifying the type and parameters of the prior distribution the joint posterior density can be obtained by substituting the density probability into eq 7 10 π β σ 2 y x ℓ β σ 2 y x π β π σ 2 π β π σ 2 ρ β σ 2 y x d β d σ 2 where prior distributions are typically denoted π β and π σ 2 however the ultimate goal of regression is to obtain the marginal posterior distribution of β for different types of prior distributions selected various bayesian regression methods such as the hierarchical linear model woltman et al 2012 and the bayesian lasso model park and george 2008 have been proposed to suit different scenarios considering the number of parameters calculation efficiency and accuracy we choose priors so that the corresponding distribution is in the same family of distributions called the conjugate distributions according to the central limit theorem most of the measured value distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution or a gaussian distribution a popular choice is the normal inverse gamma conjugate model robert and christian 2014 in which β obeys the multivariate normal distribution n and σ 2 is the inverse gamma i g distribution eq 10 can be abbreviated as follows 11 π β σ 2 y x n β n σ 2 t 1 n ϕ y t x t β σ 2 where ϕ y t x t β σ 2 is the gaussian probability density with mean x t β and variance σ 2 on y t the regression model is divided into conjugate and semi conjugate regression murphy 2012 depending on whether parameters and variance are independent 3 1 conjugate bayesian regression when β and σ 2 are independent the priori distributions of β and σ 2 are as follows 12 β σ 2 n c μ σ 2 v σ 2 i g a b where μ is the mean value c 1 vector v is the c c diagonal matrix in which each element equals the prior variance factor of β j and i g a b denotes the inverse gamma distribution with shape a and scale b considering our limited prior information about many parameters we cannot set different priors for each coefficient so the diagonal elements in v are simplified to be equal to ➉ in this paper since both the prior and the posterior have the same family of distributions the conditional posterior distribution of β can be calculated by eq 11 and eq 13 with σ 2 held constant as shown in eq 14 13 p β σ 2 y x p β p y x β σ 2 14 β σ 2 y x n c v 1 x t x 1 x t x β ˆ v 1 μ σ 2 v 1 x t x 1 where x is an n c matrix of training data the marginal posterior density of σ 2 from eq 11 is the ig distribution 15 σ 2 y x i g a n c 2 b 1 s s r β 1 2 β ˆ μ t v 1 β ˆ μ 1 where s s r β is given by 16 s s r β i 1 n y i β t x i 2 y x β t y x β to sample from the joint posterior first draw σ 2 from its marginal posterior distribution given in eq 15 and then draw β from its normal conditional posterior distribution given in eq 14 using the simulated value of σ 2 finally from the integration of the joint posterior density with respect to σ 2 the marginal posterior density of β can be calculated as 17 β y x t c v 1 x t x 1 x t x β ˆ v 1 μ λ 2 a n λ 2 b 1 s s r β β ˆ μ t v x t x 1 1 β ˆ μ 2 a n in which t c l λ ➈ denotes the c dimensional multivariate t distribution where l is the location λ is the scale and ➈ represents the degrees of freedom 3 2 semi conjugate bayesian regression when β and σ 2 are dependent the priori distributions of β and σ 2 are as follows 18 β σ 2 n c μ v σ 2 i g a b as with conjugate regression a conditional posterior distribution of β and σ 2 can be obtained 19 β σ 2 y x n c v 1 σ 2 x t x 1 σ 2 x t x β ˆ v 1 μ v 1 x t x 1 20 σ 2 β y x i g a n 2 b 1 1 2 s s r β 1 however since β and σ 2 are mutually influential their posterior distributions are not analytically tractable some numerical integration techniques based on the mcmc method have been proposed to solve this problem in the present work the gibbs sampler gelfand and smith 1990 is applied to approximate the posterior of β and σ 2 the gibbs sampler is an iterative algorithm that constructs a dependent sequence of parameter values whose distribution converges to the target joint posterior distribution the details of the gibbs sampler are shown in algorithm 1 image 1050 finally through the two methods above the forecast of ship motion can be obtained using the mean values of the c dimensional posterior predictive distribution 3 3 hyperparameters in prior distribution a distinctive advantage of the bayesian approach is that prior information and the observed sample are combined in the algorithm the parameters of the prior distribution such as the mean and variance are called hyperparameters in machine learning in contrast with other commonly used machine learning algorithms the prior parameters of the bayesian algorithm have an intuitive meaning specifying a high prior variance implies that we know very little about the parameter so a greater weight is given to the information in the data whereas specifying a low prior variance implies high confidence in prior information based on the feature of bayesian regression this paper proposes to use the bo algorithm bull 2011 to determine the parameters a b of the distribution for σ 2 the variance factor of parameters v that can reflect the confidence for the mean μ the algorithm treats the bayesian regression model as a gaussian process gp and uses the acquisition function af of the expected improvement to find a result that can satisfy the objective function threshold the basic pseudo code for bayesian optimization is shown in algorithm 2 image 10718 compared with other optimization methods the bo algorithm works better in cases with fewer hyperparameters and slower operation of the objective model which coincides with the characteristics of bayesian regression therefore the bo algorithm is applied in the present work to obtain the hyperparameters of the prior distribution the training data are pre processed by z score transformation altman 2000 in order to avoid the influence of the high impact index and k fold cross validation is applied to make full use of the data in this process k fold cross validation randomly divides the set of observations into k groups each time the first fold is treated as a validation set and other folds are used for training 4 numerical example results and discussion 4 1 construction of the training model a container vessel was selected as the object model and the main data and dimensions are given in table 1 the choice of training manoeuvres is as important as the formulation of a regression model as ljung ljung 1987 suggested the input data for si should satisfy the persistence of the excitation condition to guarantee convergence and ensure the robustness properties of the identification method according to his view the 20 20 zigzag test and the 35 turning test reach the appropriate range of extrapolation unlike the 10 10 zigzag test and will therefore provide more informative data for identification however the turning circle test is not appropriate for si because in the motion of the circle after the rudder is turned the observation values are very similar or even constant which will cause the vectors in the matrix to be highly correlated therefore a 20 20 standard zigzag manoeuvre was simulated in matlab with 20000 point output discretization by using the hydrodynamic parameters from the rpmm facility at the danish maritime institute scale ratio 28 75 as given in table 2 and table 3 note that some hydrodynamic derivatives were adjusted to match the full scale trial results blanke and jensen 1997 the sampling interval is 0 02 s and the total time is 400 s the raw training data couples consist of the following 21 i n p u t v a r i a b l e s a i b

is almost meaningless to use the raw data above for identification directly as the real experimental measurements will inevitably be affected by various disturbances and produce a great deal of high frequency responses such as ship oscillatory motion or mechanical noise following sutulo and soares s artificially polluted data construction method sutulo and guedes soares 2014 gaussian white noise is added as follows 22 ζ t ζ 0 t ζ m a x k ζ ξ t where ζ 0 t is the clean sampling data ζ m a x is the maximum absolute value in the original recorded data k ζ is the specific reduction factor for different variables and ξ t is a discrete random variable subject to a gaussian distribution with a variance of 0 2 according to the ship model test data published by simman 2014 2020 ittc 2019 the noise is mainly concentrated in the sway while the noise of the remaining responses is smaller and the deviations of rudder angle can be ignored this is why the value of k ζ is set as 1 0 and 0 3 for the surge velocity and other records respectively 4 2 empirical bayes denoising eb is widely used in the field of noise filtering and jonhstome and sliverman proposed a fully automatic empirical bayes thresholding method silverman and johnstone 2004 which is applicable to various scenarios the general model for a noisy signal has the following form where we have observations at regularly spaced

basis of the observed data here we assume that the elements u i have independent prior distributions each given by the mixture 25 f p r i o r u 1 w δ 0 u w ➇ u where w is the weight used to adjust the near zero part δ 0 u and the nonzero part ➇ u the nonzero part of the prior ➇ is assumed to be a fixed unimodal symmetric density let ➆ denote the convolution of the density ➇ with the standard normal

i subject to the constraint on w that the threshold satisfies ➄ w 2 l o g n since ℓ w is a monotonic function of w the root of eq 27 can easily be obtained numerically if eq 26 is tractable the main idea of this method is to insert the value for w ˆ into the prior and then estimate the raw value of u i using the value of w thus obtained we applied the above method to denoise the polluted data fig 2 shows the simulated raw data polluted data and denoised data from the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre the enlarged figure shows that the eb denoising method has a significant effect the filtered noise data that have been obtained will be used for the next step of parameter identification as training data 4 3 bayesian regression and validation the denoised data entered contain a total of 400 couples with

should be noted that the prior parameters vary within the same magnitude which has a slight effect on the results the mean value of the distribution of the hydrodynamic coefficients is obtained by eq 17 for conjugate bayesian regression and the semi conjugate regression results are obtained by gibbs sampling the sample trajectories of x u and k v v are shown in fig 4 note that each value of the mean of the trajectories is the value for the parameter results for the two models in comparison with rpmm test data are listed in tables 2 and 3 where are denotes the absolute relative error as in eq

high order variables accumulate by multiplication it is difficult to judge the merits and usability of the two bayesian methods only from the results of parameter identification in tables 2 and 3

22273,the vortex induced vibrations viv of two flexible circular cylinders in tandem arrangements were studied using numerical simulations and verified by experimental data simulations were conducted for a constant mass ratio of 1 08 the spacing ranges of 6d to 18d and the reduced velocities of 2 35 6 71 it is shown that the numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental data of the amplitude and frequency of response the features of the vibration amplitude the dominant frequencies the vortex structures and the fluid force acting on the cylinders are discussed the results indicate that there is a great difference between the response of the upstream cylinder and that of the downstream cylinder when the reduced velocity is beyond the critical reduced velocity v r the dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder are no longer the same and both the reduced velocity and the spacing of the cylinders have a great influence on the wake induced vibrations wiv responses of the downstream cylinder considering these influences an empirical model for wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder with a low mass ratio was proposed and verified keywords tandem cylinders vortex induced vibration wake induced vibration empirical model 1 introduction flexible cylinders in tandem arrangements are often seen in ocean engineering such as risers moorings and so on it is essential to study the viv response of these structures because it can cause structural damage and affect their safety and service life the hydrodynamic forces due to vortex shedding may lead to strong vibration of the structures when two cylinders are arranged in tandem the flow around the downstream cylinder is influenced by the wake of the upstream cylinder the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder depends not only on reynolds number re ud υ where u and υ are the velocity and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively its surface roughness and motion state but also on the wake of the upstream cylinder this phenomenon is described as wake induced vibration wiv in the last decades wake induced vibration has received considerable attention due to its complex characteristics and the wide application of tandem cylinders more details can be found in several review papers by chen 1986 zdravkovich 1988 moretti 1993 sumner 2010 bearman 2011 zhou and alam 2016 there are three main types of the research on vortex induced vibration of tandem cylinders experimental investigation numerical simulation and empirical model experimental investigation is one of the most effective and direct ways to study the vortex induced vibration of the cylinders the laboratory experiments of the flow passing fixed cylinders in tandem arrangement provide essential theoretical support for the further study of vortex induced vibration of tandem cylinders several experimental studies were conducted to investigate the influence of cylinders spacing and re on the flow around two fixed cylinders in tandem based on different classification criteria igarashi and suzuki 1984 zhou and yiu 2006 classified flow patterns around two fixed cylinders in tandem and clarified those flow characteristics alam et al 2003 xu and zhou 2004 showed attention to strouhal number st f s d u where f s is the dominant vortex frequency of cylinder of two fixed cylinders in tandem xu and zhou 2004 found that the st depends greatly on spacing ratio t d where t is the spacing of the axes of two cylinders d is the diameter of the cylinders see fig 2 and re and classified the st re relationship into four categories in addition alam et al 2003 also found that the spacing ratio has influences on fluctuating forces pressure distributions and vortex shedding patterns of tandem cylinders wang et al 2015 conducted an experimental study to investigate the flow around two tandem cylinders placed near and parallel to a plane wall and gave the influence of wall proximity on flow around two tandem circular cylinders mahir and rockwell 1996 yang et al 2014 conducted experimental investigations of forced vibration of tandem cylinders they studied the effect of oscillating cylinders on the surrounding fluid by changing the frequency and phase angle between tandem cylinders mahir and rockwell 1996 found that when the spacing between cylinders is relatively small the phase angle has a significant influence on vibration characteristics of cylinders employing the hydrogen bubble visualization technique yang et al 2014 observed two typical vortex patterns and defined them as the low frequency mode and high frequency mode respectively there are also some researchers who conducted laboratory experiments to study viv by considering the fluid structure interaction and proposed the mechanism of wiv allen and henning 2003 found that when the separation distance is long enough the vibration of the downstream cylinder exhibits frequencies at both the vibration frequency of the upstream cylinder and a lower frequency equaling to 60 75 of the vibration frequency of the upstream cylinder according to the spacing ratio the fluctuating lift force and vibration characteristics of the cylinders kim et al 2009 distinguished the vibrations of two tandem cylinders into five modes and discussed the influence between the cylinders assi et al 2010 suggested that the downstream cylinder wiv is excited by the unstable vortex structure generated by the interaction between the downstream cylinder and the wake of the upstream cylinder if the unstable vortices in the upstream wake are removed the wiv would not be excited huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 found that when the spacing of two tandem cylinders is relatively small the excitation mechanism may be viv wiv or their combination which mainly depends on the existence of vortices between two cylinders when the spacing is relatively large the main excitation mechanism is wiv huera huarte et al 2016 also suggested that the downstream cylinder has high modal density so the amplitude of several adjacent modal resonance combinations is much higher than that of a single cylinder at the same reduced velocities xu et al 2019 found that the fluid force on the downstream cylinder is also strongly affected by the wake of the upstream cylinder the basic idea of computational fluid dynamics cfd is to use numerical methods to solve the governing equations of fluid dynamics and simulate the flow field it is one of the commonly used methods to solve the problem of viv the two dimensional numerical simulation takes the plane along the axis direction of tandem cylinders to simplify the calculation it can reduce the computational grids and improves the simulation efficiency at present the most numerical simulations of tandem cylinders have focused on relatively low reynolds numbers re 1 0 10 3 some researchers fixed the re and changed the reduced velocity by varying the natural frequency of tandem cylinders borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 studied tandem cylinders having both one and two degrees of freedom for re 200 it was found that the initial excitation mechanism is provided by the vortex shedding at low reduced velocity which results in the vertical gap between the two cylinders when the gap exceeds the diameter of the cylinder the incoming flow could pass through two cylinders and the gap flow mechanism begin to dominate the vortex induced motion bao et al 2012 utilized the characteristic based split fem to study the viv of the single and the tandem cylinders with different natural frequency ratio for re 150 it is found that the response characteristics of the downstream cylinder are greatly affected by the wake of the upstream cylinder and its in line response is more sensitive to natural frequency ratio than its transverse response lin et al 2013 and jiang et al 2014 employed a lattice boltzmann method to study the viv of tandem cylinders in a parallel wall channel for re 150 and re 1 160 respectively they indicated that gap flow has a significant influence on the tandem cylinders and the blockage ratio the ratio of cylinder diameter to channel width changes the vibration state of the tandem cylinders tu et al 2015 used a four step semi implicit characteristic based split fem to simulate the viv of the tandem cylinders in planar shear flow for re 160 it is found that the shear rate and reduced velocity play a vital role in the viv of the tandem cylinders with different spacing mysa et al 2016 numerically investigated the viv of a single and two tandem cylinders for re 100 and found that the stagnation point motion plays an essential role in the force dynamics of both configurations in the case of a single cylinder the displacement and velocity of the stagnation are almost the same in the case of the tandem cylinders the wake of the upstream cylinder moves the stagnation point on the downstream cylinder to the low suction region therefore the downstream cylinder has a larger lift force than a single cylinder the influences of re on the viv of tandem cylinders were also investigated by some researchers dehkordi et al 2011 used the finite volume method fvm to simulate the flow characteristics of the tandem cylinders in two dimensional unsteady viscous flow for re 100 and re 200 they revealed the influence of re and the spacing on the flow characteristics and found the laminar and turbulent flows around the tandem cylinders have distinct flow characteristics there are also some numerical simulations focusing on relatively high reynolds numbers re 1 0 104 ding et al 2013 performed simulation using openfoam which solves continuum mechanics problems with a finite volume discretization method the reynolds number range in the simulation is 3 0 104 re 1 05 105 which falls in the trsl3 regime transition in shear layer where the shear layers are fully saturated and consequently lift is high nguyen et al 2018 employed an incompressible navier stokes flow solver with a hybrid detached eddy simulation des approach to characterize and study mechanisms of wake induced vibrations at subcritical reynolds number ranging 1 0 103 to 1 0 104 to some extent the two dimensional numerical simulation can simulate the viv characteristics of tandem cylinders but it cannot take spanwise effect into account three dimensional numerical simulation can solve this question but there are only few researches employed 3d simulation due to the quantity and instability of calculation girds kitagawa and ohta 2008 used a 3d numerical method to simulate the flow around two fixed tandem cylinders at subcritical reynolds number the relationship between st and the spacing ratio obtained by numerical simulation is consistent with the experimental results of igarashi 1981 moreover the relationship between phase shift and spacing ratio obtained by simulation is consistent with the linear function proposed by sakata and kiya 1983 mysa et al 2017 studied the local unsteady characteristics of transverse wiv of tandem cylinders at critical reynolds number by 3d numerical simulation the study focused on the interaction between the downstream cylinder and the upstream wake the empirical model is the most widely used model in the industry at present based on the experimental data of viv or forced vibration of cylinders the governing equation of the empirical model is established to solve the viv response of cylinders establishing a reasonable empirical model to simulate the dynamic characteristics and the interaction of wake vortices on structures is the core problem the time domain model of vortex induced vibration includes the wake oscillator model the single degree of freedom model and the force decomposition model at present the studies about the viv of the tandem cylinders are focused on the empirical model of the displacement response of viv while the frequency response of wiv is seldom studied strouhal formula is the primary method to calculate the frequency of tandem cylinders which is related to st inflow velocity and cylinder diameter it is widely used in the calculation of flow around a fixed cylinder but the boundary conditions and the vortex shedding of vibrating cylinder are different from fixed cylinder moreover the viv of tandem cylinders is more complex many studies show that the wiv frequency of a downstream cylinder is quite different from that of a single cylinder most of current empirical models cannot still calculate the wiv frequency of a downstream cylinder therefore it is helpful to study the empirical model of calculating wiv frequency of a downstream cylinder for predicting wiv in this paper numerical simulation was employed to study the viv of tandem cylinders with large spacing ratio and low mass ratio the amplitude and the frequency from the numerical simulations were in satisfied agreement with those from the experiment the effects of tandem arrangement on the viv of the cylinders under different flow velocities and spacing ratios were discussed and an empirical model of wiv frequency response was established and verified 2 numerical method 2 1 the governing equations the finite volume method fvm was used to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation to simulate the flow around the tandem cylinders two dimensional incompressible viscous fluid can be modeled by the continuity equation and ns equation the dimensionless equations in the ale scheme can

simulate the viv of the flexible cylinders in tandem strip theory entailed computing the fluid flow in multiple two dimensional planes that were positioned at intervals along the length of the cylinders as shown in fig 1 the overall motion of the cylinders was the combination of all plane motions and the motion of each plane could be seen as the vibration of a rigid cylinder with elastic support as shown in fig 2 researchers have obtained good results that showed good agreement with experimental data which confirms the feasibility of this method willden 2003 schulz and meling 2004 yamamoto et al 2004 willden and graham 2004 2005 a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the sensitivity of the strip method to the number of the strips chosen in cfd simulation the time histories of the response and spectra of the cylinder with v r 3 53 from this analysis are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 as the similar results were obtained for 8 and 16 strips 8 strips were chosen for the present computations 2 2 1 control equation the vibrations of the cylinders were governed by the follow equations 16 m a c a k a f where m is the system mass matrix k is the system stiffness matrix c is the system damping matrix a a and a are the displacement vector velocity vector and acceleration vector of the system respectively f is the system load vector the rayleigh damping matrix c

third natural frequency of the system the newmark β method which is suitable for the calculation of dynamic response of non linear systems is used to solve dynamic response of the tandem cylinders 2 2 2 computational domain the size of the computational domain of each two dimensional plane was 20 d 40 d t where t was the center to center distance of the tandem cylinders as shown in fig 5 the cylinders were located at the mid width of the computational domain the center of the upstream cylinder was located at 10d from the inlet boundary and the center of the downstream cylinders was located at a distance of 30d from the outlet boundary as shown in fig 5 the entire domain included five boundaries at the inlet the velocity boundary u u v 0 was applied symmetrical boundary conditions u y 0 v 0 were applied to the side wall at the outlet the pressure p 0 was applied in order to apply no slip condition on the boundaries of the tandem cylinders velocity components at the grid points within or on the boundaries were set to u d x d t v d y d t the composite grid distribution method was used to improve the calculating precision more precise structured grids were used in the near field and sparse unstructured grids were used in the far field the grid points were clustered near the cylinder surface with the distance from the cylinder surface to the nearest grid point fixed y 1 grid independence and time step test of tandem cylinders were conduct for re 2000 and the results of t 6d 12d and 18d were listed in table 2 and table 3 c d1 mean c l1 rms st 1 are mean drag coefficient root mean square rms lift coefficient and strouhal number of the upstream cylinder respectively c d2 mean c l2 rms st 2 are mean drag coefficient root mean square rms lift coefficient and strouhal number of the downstream cylinder respectively table 2 shows the effect of grid distribution on various quantities similar results were obtained for grid scheme 2 and 3 considering the calculation accuracy and time the grid scheme 2 case 2 in table 2 was used for both the single cylinder and the tandem cylinders as shown in fig 6 table 3 shows the effect of dimensionless time step on various quantities when the time step is 0 01 the calculation results differ greatly from that of 0 02 while the calculation results of the time step of 0 03 and the time step of 0 02 are very close so the dimensionless time step of 0 02 was used in the numerical simulation 2 2 3 numerical simulation and experimental conditions a physical experiment was designed to verify the reliability of numerical simulation the same parameters such as size stiffness and mass ratio etc were set for both physical experiment and numerical simulation a free vibration test was conducted to get the natural frequencies of the tested cylinders the results show that the natural frequency f n of the cylinders is 4 25 hz considering the performance of the water tank 12 sets of flow velocity were tested the minimum flow velocity was 0 20 m s and the maximum flow velocity was 0 57 m s as shown in table 4 7 sets of the spacing ratios t d 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 were selected 3 experimental verification to verify the reliability of the numerical simulation method adopted in this paper a physical experiment was conducted and the results were compared with the numerical results the experimental devices and methods are as follows 3 1 experiment equipment the experiment was carried out in the wave simulation laboratory of ocean engineering college of engineering ocean university of china the water tank is 30 m in length 1 m in width and 1 2 m in depth it is equipped with a circulating submersible pump flow generating system the flow velocity of the water tank was measured by acoustic doppler point current meter before the beginning of the experiment the flow velocity in the test section was checked to ensure its uniformity two pvc pipes were selected as the test model and more parameters are shown in table 5 the submerged length of the pipes is 0 5 m because the diameter of the pipe is small and the mass of the sensor will affect the mass distribution and dynamic characteristics of the cylinder the pressure sensor is not suitable the strain gages were used to measure the vibration response of the pipe strain gages were installed at four locations in the middle of the test model the experiment device and the arrangement of the strain gages are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 3 2 data processing to obtain satisfied results the sections of 100s with good stability were selected from time domain data then the intercepted time domain data were filtered based on the natural frequency of the test model the filtering range was set for 1 20 hz the modal analysis introduced by lie and kaasen 2006 was applied to calculate the viv displacement response of the test model according to the basic principle of modal analysis the crossflow displacement of cylinders can be expressed as 18 w z t n 1 q n t φ n z z 0 l where φ n z is the mode shape q n t is the mode weight and n is the order of vibration mode the test model can be simplified as a bernoulli euler beam with pined pined boundary conditions the mode shape can be written as φ n z sin n π z l with z 0 l where l is the cylinder length the relationship between curvature and strain is 19 ε z t r κ z t r 2 w z t z 2 where r is the radius of the cylinder κ z t is the curvature of the test model if the test model is vibrated in the first mode formula 18 can be simplified to 20 ε z t r π l 2 q 1 t φ 1 z in this case the measured strain is proportional to the displacement and the displacement of the measured point can be obtained by calculating the weight coefficient more information on modal analysis for strain signal processing can be found in reference song et al 2011 mohapatra and overbye 2015 3 3 comparison of numerical simulation and experiment results fig 9 and fig 10 show the experimental and numerical results of transverse vibration amplitude and dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder at different reduced velocities and spacing ratio by comparing numerical results with that of experiments it is proved that the numerical simulation is satisfied the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement with very little differences in some reduced velocities and spacing ratios fig 11 and fig 12 show the experimental and numerical results of time histories of the response and spectra of the downstream with t 12d as shown in figs 11 and 12 the time histories of the response and spectra obtained by numerical simulation are in good agreement with experimental results also only the first mode showed in both numerical and experimental results 4 numerical simulation results and discussion the viv features of two flexible circular cylinders in tandem with low mass ratio including amplitude response dominant frequency and vortex structures are presented and discussed in this section 4 1 analysis of vortex induced vibration response fig 13 and fig 14 show the dimensionless amplitude responses and dominant frequencies of the single cylinder and the tandem cylinders versus the reduced velocity v r the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is basically the same as that of a single cylinder and there is a limited resonance range which is the lock in the vibration is self excited and self limited during lock in the amplitude increases significantly in the lock in region and decreases when the reduced velocity increases further in contrast the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows obvious characteristics of wake induced vibration the lock in ceases to exist and the amplitude increases continuously with reduced velocities beyond the lock in region when the spacing ratio is small t 10d the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is always larger than that of the upstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is locked the amplitude of the downstream cylinder also increases significantly the maximum dimensionless amplitude of the downstream cylinder a d 1 2 is about twice that of the upstream cylinder a d 0 6 when the spacing is large t 10d the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows an increasing trend in the overall and in lock in region the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is slightly larger than that of the downstream cylinder it is worth noting that when the spacing is 8d the amplitude of the downstream cylinders shows an increasing trend with the reduced velocity increase and it is not affected by the lock in of the upstream cylinder it can be found from fig 14 that the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder is essentially in agreement with that of a single cylinder under different spacings and reduced velocities their dominant frequency in the lock in region is locked onto the natural frequency of the cylinder the previous studies proved that a cylinder undergoing wiv exhibits a frequency that is very close to the natural frequency of the elastic system supporting the cylinder huera huarte and gharib 2011 mysa et al 2017 the natural frequency deviates from the strouhal frequency it can also be found in present study that the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder agrees with that of the upstream cylinder at low reduced velocity while when the reduced velocity increases to a certain value called separation reduced velocity v r in this paper the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder vibration decreases and the dominant frequency curve of the upstream and the downstream cylinder separates the separation reduced velocity v r decreases with the increase of their spacing when the spacing increases to 16d the dominant frequency curves of the upstream and the downstream cylinder are completely separated when the spacing is 8d the dominant frequencies of the upstream and the downstream cylinders remain the same and there is no separation from figs 13 and 14 it can be found that when the spacing is large t 10d the viv dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder is locked onto its natural frequency in the lock in region and the vibration amplitude increases significantly due to resonance while the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder decreases so its vibration amplitude is slightly smaller than that of the upstream cylinder when the spacing is small t 10d the dominant frequency of the tandem cylinders in the lock in region is close to their natural frequencies so the amplitudes of both cylinders increase significantly the special phenomena of the spacing 8d will be explained by analyzing the vorticity diagram in the following section fig 15 shows the time histories of the response of the downstream cylinder at v r 3 53 and v r 5 88 at v r 5 88 the upstream cylinder undergoes large amplitude vibrations compared to that at v r 3 53 this can also be seen from fig 13 the downstream cylinder lies in the unsteady wake of the upstream cylinder and experiences a galloping flutter type of instability beats can be observed in the time histories of the l response of the cylinder this is consistent with the conclusion of mittal and kumar 2001 from fig 15 c d and e it also can be found that the time histories comprise two frequency components 4 2 spectrum analysis of lift and response for examining the force and response characteristics of tandem cylinders furtherly the lift coefficient and dimensionless transverse response spectra of tandem cylinders at reduced velocity v r 3 53 and v r 5 88 are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 where the red lines represent the lift coefficient spectra and the black lines represent the response spectra allen and henning 2003 found when the separation distance of the tandem cylinders was long enough the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited frequencies at both the vibration frequency of the upstream cylinder and at a lower vibration frequency equal to about 60 75 of the upstream cylinder vibration frequency mysa et al 2017 found that the large displacement of the downstream cylinder is due to the appearance of low frequency component in the transverse load which is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder in this paper double peaks are also observed in the lift coefficient and the response spectra and the lower frequency is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder when the reduced velocity is larger than v r the peak with lower frequency of the downstream cylinder will exceed that with higher frequency and become the main peak which leads to the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder different from that of the downstream cylinders when v r 3 53 the frequency separation can only be observed when the spacing increases to 14d however when v r 5 88 the phenomenon can be observed at spacing t 10d with the increase of flow velocity the minimum spacing in which frequency separation can be observed tends to decrease because of the frequency separation if the response frequency of the downstream cylinder is calculated in the same method as a single cylinder the calculation results will be inaccurate it is more appropriate to calculate the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder vibration by piecewise function 4 3 vorticity contours of tandem cylinders to investigate the reason of the frequency separation of the tandem cylinders the vorticity diagram and pressure coefficient of the tandem cylinders at four typical moments in a vibration period of the downstream cylinder were examined for the spacing 6d 8d and 10d when t 0 the cylinder starts to vibrate upward from the center position when t 1 4t p t p is the vibration period of the downstream cylinder the maximum displacement of the cylinder in the positive direction occurs and then moves downward when t 1 2t p the cylinder returns to the center position when t 3 4t p the cylinder reaches the maximum displacement in the negative direction and then moves upward again when t t p the cylinder returns to the center position and begin to vibrate for next period fig 18 to fig 20 show the instantaneous vorticity diagrams and pressure coefficient c p of the tandem cylinders at reduced velocities v r 3 53 and v r 5 88 for the spacing of 6d 8d and 10d respectively in the pressure coefficient diagrams the circles represent the tandem cylinders the solid line represents the pressure coefficient of the upstream cylinder and the dotted line represents the pressure coefficient of the downstream cylinder the front point on the cylinder is defined as α 0 and the positive direction of the x axis is the anticlockwise direction of the cylinder when the c p curve exceeds the circle it represents that point is under negative pressure conversely when the c p curve sinks into the circle it represents that point is under positive pressure it can be found that the wake modes of the upstream cylinder are similar to that of a single cylinder for the three spacing but the wake mode of the downstream cylinder is more complex when the spacing is 6d at a lower velocity v r 3 53 a pair of the vortices shedding from one side of the upstream cylinder have not mixed before reattaching the downstream cylinder because of the phase difference between the tandem cylinders the pair of the vortices reattach to the upper and lower sides of the downstream cylinder respectively for example a pair of clockwise vortices is shed from the upper side of the downstream cylinder in one vibration period and at the same time a clockwise and a counterclockwise vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder reattaches that side because the pair of wake vortices reattach onto the downstream cylinder separately their influence on the downstream cylinder is insufficient the increase of the amplitude of vortex induced vibration is not apparent and the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is still closed to strouhal frequency at a high velocity v r 5 88 a pair of vortices shed from one side of the upstream cylinder has mixed before reattaching the downstream cylinder the mixed vortex reattaches onto the downstream cylinder in the same direction as vortices shedding from the downstream cylinder this is consistent with the conclusion of kim 2009 on the overall interstitial flow because of the wake effect of the upstream cylinder the viv amplitude of the downstream cylinder increases and low frequency component shows up however due to the smaller spacing the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder are not fully developed and the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is still closed to strouhal frequency fig 18 also shows the instantaneous distribution of pressure coefficient c p here the stagnation point is the location in which the cylinder where maximum pressure coefficient c p max occurs it can be found that the stagnation c p max on the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the upstream cylinder because of the vortex s interaction a peak can be observed in the pressure distributions lines of the downstream cylinder in fig 18 b and d this peak represents the reattachment of the shear layer separating from the upstream cylinder in conclusion the length and intensity of the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder vary significantly for different flow velocities and the reattach point on the downstream cylinder is different which has different effects on wake mode vibration frequency and amplitude of the downstream cylinder fig 19 shows the instantaneous vorticity diagrams and pressure coefficient c p of the tandem cylinders with the spacing of 8d because of the increase of spacing a pair of vortices shedding from one side of the upstream cylinder has mixed before reattaching onto the downstream cylinder at a lower flow rate it is worth noticing that the reattach position of the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder is obviously different from the spacing of 6d for the spacing of 8d the reattach position is backward especially at a lower velocity the wake of the upstream cylinder merges with that of the downstream cylinder and does not touch the downstream cylinder directly by comparing the instantaneous distribution of pressure coefficient of the downstream cylinder with that of the spacing of 6d it can be seen that pressure coefficient of the downstream cylinder is also less affected by the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder this is the reason why the vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder is smaller and no apparent frequency separation is observed between the two cylinders at the spacing of 8d when the spacing of the tandem cylinders is larger than 10d a pair of vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder has mixed before reattaching onto the downstream cylinder at a lower flow velocity the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder are fully developed but its energy is low so it has less effect on the downstream cylinder even though an independence low frequency peak can be observed clearly in the spectrum the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is still the same as strouhal frequency at a higher flow velocity the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder have larger energy and can fully develop before reattaching onto the downstream cylinder therefore the low frequency component replaces the high frequency component to become the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder and the dominant frequencies of the tandem cylinders are no longer the same in conclusion the frequency separation phenomenon is related to the spacing of the tandem cylinders and the flow velocity these two factors should be taken into account when the empirical model of the frequency response of wiv is established 5 empirical model 5 1 theory when studying the flow around a cylinder the vortex shedding frequency f s can be determined by strouhal number it can be written as 21 f s s t u d where f s is the frequency of vortex shedding s t is strouhal number u is flow velocity d is the diameter of cylinder and the dimensionless frequency can be written as 22 f s f n s t u f n d s t v r where f n is the natural frequency of a cylinder v r is the reduced velocity v r u f n d so the vortex shedding frequency f s can be written as 23 f s s t v r f n for two cylinders arranged in tandem the wake vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder affect the downstream cylinder so considering the wake effect in wiv frequency calculation model is necessary from the analysis above it can be seen that the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited two frequencies at specific velocity and spacing and the lower frequency peak is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder when the reduced velocity is larger than v r the lower frequency peak of the downstream cylinder will replace the higher frequency peak to become the main peak which leads to the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder different from that of the upstream cylinder at a lower velocity frequency separation phenomenon can only be observed when the spacing of the tandem cylinders is large but at a higher velocity it can be observed at a smaller spacing with the increase of flow velocity the minimum spacing at which the frequency separation occurs tends to decrease when the spacing is 8d the downstream cylinder is less affected by the wake of the upstream cylinder so although there are two peaks in the response spectrum the higher frequency is still the main peak and so there is no frequency separation considering the influence of the spacing on the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder the empirical model for calculating the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder could be written as 24 f s s t v r f n f λ where λ t d is the spacing ratio of two tandem cylinders f λ is the influence of the spacing on the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder considering that the vibration frequency changes greatly when the frequency separation occurs the piecewise method is used to fit the f λ it can be written as 25 f s s t v r f n f 1 λ u g λ f n f v r f 2 λ u g λ where f s is the wiv frequency of the downstream cylinder g λ is the critical velocity of the frequency separation the strouhal number s t 0 20 the spacing ratio λ ranges from 6 to 18 and the velocities are as shown in table 2 5 2 formula fitting and verification fig 21 shows the critical velocity of the frequency separation for different spacing by fitting the data the functional relationship between the critical velocity and the spacing is obtained it can be written as 26 g λ 6 953 0 6 λ 7 6 from the analysis above it can be seen that the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited two frequencies at specific velocity and spacing and the lower frequency peak is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder so the logarithmic function is selected to fit f v r and the function formula is as follows 27 f v r ln a v r the power function is selected to fit f λ written as 28 f λ b λ c fitting by least square method the empirical model for wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder is obtained written as 29 f s 0 9271 λ 0 01815 s t v r f n v r 6 953 0 6 λ 7 6 0 4433 λ 0 1436 ln 0 6925 v r f n v r 6 953 0 6 λ 7 6 to verify if the frequency obtained by simulations can be reproduced by the empirical model the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder versus the reduced velocity and spacing ratio are given in fig 22 and fig 23 respectively the dashed line with solid marks represents the numerical simulation value and the solid line with hollow marks represents the forecast value upon examination the correlation coefficient between forecast frequency and simulated frequency is 0 973 which means that the forecast value of the present empirical model agrees well with the numerical simulation results to further validate the empirical model the wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder by the empirical model compared with the recent experiment of huera huarte and gharib 2011 and the numerical simulation of mysa et al 2017 are given in fig 24 it is shown that the dimensionless frequency f s f n agrees well with the previous work and the frequency separation phenomenon can be reproduced it is obvious that the empirical model presented in this paper is suitable for predicting the wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder 6 conclusion the finite volume method fvm combined with ale dynamic mesh method and slice method is employed to simulate the viv of tandem cylinders with an equal diameter and low mass ratio at v r 2 35 to 6 71 the two flexible cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both in line and cross flow the amplitude and frequency results are in great agreement with experimental data which verifies the reliability of the numerical model the effects of spacing and reduced velocity on the viv response of the downstream cylinder are studied including vibration amplitude vibration frequency lock in interval fluid force and wake mode and so on the numerical results indicate that the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is basically the same as that of a single cylinder while the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows obvious wiv characteristics the lock in ceases to exist and the amplitude increases continuously at reduced velocities beyond the lock in region when the spacing ratio of the tandem cylinders is small t 10d the response amplitude of the downstream cylinder is always larger than that of the upstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is locked the amplitude of the downstream cylinder also increases significantly when the spacing is large t 10d the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows an increasing trend in the overall the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder is basically the same as that of a single cylinder for different spacing and velocities while the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is only closed to that of the upstream cylinder at lower reduced velocities when the reduced velocity increases to a certain value called separation reduced velocity v r in this paper the dominant viv frequency of the downstream cylinder decreases and the frequency separation occurs from the spectrum curves and vorticity diagrams it can be found that the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited two frequencies at specific reduced velocity and spacing when the reduced velocity is larger than v r the lower frequency peak of the downstream cylinder will exceed the higher frequency peak and become the main peak which leads to the different dominant frequency of the upstream and downstream cylinders at lower velocity frequency separation phenomenon can only be observed when the spacing of the tandem cylinders is large but at a higher velocity it can be observed at smaller spacing because of the frequency separation if the frequency of the downstream cylinder is calculated in the same method as a single cylinder the calculation results will be inaccurate an empirical model for calculating wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder with a low mass ratio is established based on strouhal frequency formula and considering the influence of flow velocity and the spacing the forecast values by the present empirical model agree well with the numerical simulation results and the previous work and it can be used for wiv analysis and calculating the response frequency of the

22273,the vortex induced vibrations viv of two flexible circular cylinders in tandem arrangements were studied using numerical simulations and verified by experimental data simulations were conducted for a constant mass ratio of 1 08 the spacing ranges of 6d to 18d and the reduced velocities of 2 35 6 71 it is shown that the numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental data of the amplitude and frequency of response the features of the vibration amplitude the dominant frequencies the vortex structures and the fluid force acting on the cylinders are discussed the results indicate that there is a great difference between the response of the upstream cylinder and that of the downstream cylinder when the reduced velocity is beyond the critical reduced velocity v r the dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder are no longer the same and both the reduced velocity and the spacing of the cylinders have a great influence on the wake induced vibrations wiv responses of the downstream cylinder considering these influences an empirical model for wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder with a low mass ratio was proposed and verified keywords tandem cylinders vortex induced vibration wake induced vibration empirical model 1 introduction flexible cylinders in tandem arrangements are often seen in ocean engineering such as risers moorings and so on it is essential to study the viv response of these structures because it can cause structural damage and affect their safety and service life the hydrodynamic forces due to vortex shedding may lead to strong vibration of the structures when two cylinders are arranged in tandem the flow around the downstream cylinder is influenced by the wake of the upstream cylinder the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder depends not only on reynolds number re ud υ where u and υ are the velocity and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively its surface roughness and motion state but also on the wake of the upstream cylinder this phenomenon is described as wake induced vibration wiv in the last decades wake induced vibration has received considerable attention due to its complex characteristics and the wide application of tandem cylinders more details can be found in several review papers by chen 1986 zdravkovich 1988 moretti 1993 sumner 2010 bearman 2011 zhou and alam 2016 there are three main types of the research on vortex induced vibration of tandem cylinders experimental investigation numerical simulation and empirical model experimental investigation is one of the most effective and direct ways to study the vortex induced vibration of the cylinders the laboratory experiments of the flow passing fixed cylinders in tandem arrangement provide essential theoretical support for the further study of vortex induced vibration of tandem cylinders several experimental studies were conducted to investigate the influence of cylinders spacing and re on the flow around two fixed cylinders in tandem based on different classification criteria igarashi and suzuki 1984 zhou and yiu 2006 classified flow patterns around two fixed cylinders in tandem and clarified those flow characteristics alam et al 2003 xu and zhou 2004 showed attention to strouhal number st f s d u where f s is the dominant vortex frequency of cylinder of two fixed cylinders in tandem xu and zhou 2004 found that the st depends greatly on spacing ratio t d where t is the spacing of the axes of two cylinders d is the diameter of the cylinders see fig 2 and re and classified the st re relationship into four categories in addition alam et al 2003 also found that the spacing ratio has influences on fluctuating forces pressure distributions and vortex shedding patterns of tandem cylinders wang et al 2015 conducted an experimental study to investigate the flow around two tandem cylinders placed near and parallel to a plane wall and gave the influence of wall proximity on flow around two tandem circular cylinders mahir and rockwell 1996 yang et al 2014 conducted experimental investigations of forced vibration of tandem cylinders they studied the effect of oscillating cylinders on the surrounding fluid by changing the frequency and phase angle between tandem cylinders mahir and rockwell 1996 found that when the spacing between cylinders is relatively small the phase angle has a significant influence on vibration characteristics of cylinders employing the hydrogen bubble visualization technique yang et al 2014 observed two typical vortex patterns and defined them as the low frequency mode and high frequency mode respectively there are also some researchers who conducted laboratory experiments to study viv by considering the fluid structure interaction and proposed the mechanism of wiv allen and henning 2003 found that when the separation distance is long enough the vibration of the downstream cylinder exhibits frequencies at both the vibration frequency of the upstream cylinder and a lower frequency equaling to 60 75 of the vibration frequency of the upstream cylinder according to the spacing ratio the fluctuating lift force and vibration characteristics of the cylinders kim et al 2009 distinguished the vibrations of two tandem cylinders into five modes and discussed the influence between the cylinders assi et al 2010 suggested that the downstream cylinder wiv is excited by the unstable vortex structure generated by the interaction between the downstream cylinder and the wake of the upstream cylinder if the unstable vortices in the upstream wake are removed the wiv would not be excited huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 found that when the spacing of two tandem cylinders is relatively small the excitation mechanism may be viv wiv or their combination which mainly depends on the existence of vortices between two cylinders when the spacing is relatively large the main excitation mechanism is wiv huera huarte et al 2016 also suggested that the downstream cylinder has high modal density so the amplitude of several adjacent modal resonance combinations is much higher than that of a single cylinder at the same reduced velocities xu et al 2019 found that the fluid force on the downstream cylinder is also strongly affected by the wake of the upstream cylinder the basic idea of computational fluid dynamics cfd is to use numerical methods to solve the governing equations of fluid dynamics and simulate the flow field it is one of the commonly used methods to solve the problem of viv the two dimensional numerical simulation takes the plane along the axis direction of tandem cylinders to simplify the calculation it can reduce the computational grids and improves the simulation efficiency at present the most numerical simulations of tandem cylinders have focused on relatively low reynolds numbers re 1 0 10 3 some researchers fixed the re and changed the reduced velocity by varying the natural frequency of tandem cylinders borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 studied tandem cylinders having both one and two degrees of freedom for re 200 it was found that the initial excitation mechanism is provided by the vortex shedding at low reduced velocity which results in the vertical gap between the two cylinders when the gap exceeds the diameter of the cylinder the incoming flow could pass through two cylinders and the gap flow mechanism begin to dominate the vortex induced motion bao et al 2012 utilized the characteristic based split fem to study the viv of the single and the tandem cylinders with different natural frequency ratio for re 150 it is found that the response characteristics of the downstream cylinder are greatly affected by the wake of the upstream cylinder and its in line response is more sensitive to natural frequency ratio than its transverse response lin et al 2013 and jiang et al 2014 employed a lattice boltzmann method to study the viv of tandem cylinders in a parallel wall channel for re 150 and re 1 160 respectively they indicated that gap flow has a significant influence on the tandem cylinders and the blockage ratio the ratio of cylinder diameter to channel width changes the vibration state of the tandem cylinders tu et al 2015 used a four step semi implicit characteristic based split fem to simulate the viv of the tandem cylinders in planar shear flow for re 160 it is found that the shear rate and reduced velocity play a vital role in the viv of the tandem cylinders with different spacing mysa et al 2016 numerically investigated the viv of a single and two tandem cylinders for re 100 and found that the stagnation point motion plays an essential role in the force dynamics of both configurations in the case of a single cylinder the displacement and velocity of the stagnation are almost the same in the case of the tandem cylinders the wake of the upstream cylinder moves the stagnation point on the downstream cylinder to the low suction region therefore the downstream cylinder has a larger lift force than a single cylinder the influences of re on the viv of tandem cylinders were also investigated by some researchers dehkordi et al 2011 used the finite volume method fvm to simulate the flow characteristics of the tandem cylinders in two dimensional unsteady viscous flow for re 100 and re 200 they revealed the influence of re and the spacing on the flow characteristics and found the laminar and turbulent flows around the tandem cylinders have distinct flow characteristics there are also some numerical simulations focusing on relatively high reynolds numbers re 1 0 104 ding et al 2013 performed simulation using openfoam which solves continuum mechanics problems with a finite volume discretization method the reynolds number range in the simulation is 3 0 104 re 1 05 105 which falls in the trsl3 regime transition in shear layer where the shear layers are fully saturated and consequently lift is high nguyen et al 2018 employed an incompressible navier stokes flow solver with a hybrid detached eddy simulation des approach to characterize and study mechanisms of wake induced vibrations at subcritical reynolds number ranging 1 0 103 to 1 0 104 to some extent the two dimensional numerical simulation can simulate the viv characteristics of tandem cylinders but it cannot take spanwise effect into account three dimensional numerical simulation can solve this question but there are only few researches employed 3d simulation due to the quantity and instability of calculation girds kitagawa and ohta 2008 used a 3d numerical method to simulate the flow around two fixed tandem cylinders at subcritical reynolds number the relationship between st and the spacing ratio obtained by numerical simulation is consistent with the experimental results of igarashi 1981 moreover the relationship between phase shift and spacing ratio obtained by simulation is consistent with the linear function proposed by sakata and kiya 1983 mysa et al 2017 studied the local unsteady characteristics of transverse wiv of tandem cylinders at critical reynolds number by 3d numerical simulation the study focused on the interaction between the downstream cylinder and the upstream wake the empirical model is the most widely used model in the industry at present based on the experimental data of viv or forced vibration of cylinders the governing equation of the empirical model is established to solve the viv response of cylinders establishing a reasonable empirical model to simulate the dynamic characteristics and the interaction of wake vortices on structures is the core problem the time domain model of vortex induced vibration includes the wake oscillator model the single degree of freedom model and the force decomposition model at present the studies about the viv of the tandem cylinders are focused on the empirical model of the displacement response of viv while the frequency response of wiv is seldom studied strouhal formula is the primary method to calculate the frequency of tandem cylinders which is related to st inflow velocity and cylinder diameter it is widely used in the calculation of flow around a fixed cylinder but the boundary conditions and the vortex shedding of vibrating cylinder are different from fixed cylinder moreover the viv of tandem cylinders is more complex many studies show that the wiv frequency of a downstream cylinder is quite different from that of a single cylinder most of current empirical models cannot still calculate the wiv frequency of a downstream cylinder therefore it is helpful to study the empirical model of calculating wiv frequency of a downstream cylinder for predicting wiv in this paper numerical simulation was employed to study the viv of tandem cylinders with large spacing ratio and low mass ratio the amplitude and the frequency from the numerical simulations were in satisfied agreement with those from the experiment the effects of tandem arrangement on the viv of the cylinders under different flow velocities and spacing ratios were discussed and an empirical model of wiv frequency response was established and verified 2 numerical method 2 1 the governing equations the finite volume method fvm was used to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation to simulate the flow around the tandem cylinders two dimensional incompressible viscous fluid can be modeled by the continuity equation and ns equation the dimensionless equations in the ale scheme can

simulate the viv of the flexible cylinders in tandem strip theory entailed computing the fluid flow in multiple two dimensional planes that were positioned at intervals along the length of the cylinders as shown in fig 1 the overall motion of the cylinders was the combination of all plane motions and the motion of each plane could be seen as the vibration of a rigid cylinder with elastic support as shown in fig 2 researchers have obtained good results that showed good agreement with experimental data which confirms the feasibility of this method willden 2003 schulz and meling 2004 yamamoto et al 2004 willden and graham 2004 2005 a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the sensitivity of the strip method to the number of the strips chosen in cfd simulation the time histories of the response and spectra of the cylinder with v r 3 53 from this analysis are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 as the similar results were obtained for 8 and 16 strips 8 strips were chosen for the present computations 2 2 1 control equation the vibrations of the cylinders were governed by the follow equations 16 m a c a k a f where m is the system mass matrix k is the system stiffness matrix c is the system damping matrix a a and a are the displacement vector velocity vector and acceleration vector of the system respectively f is the system load vector the rayleigh damping matrix c α μ β k is used in equation 16 the coefficients α and β are calculated as follow 17 α β 2 ζ ω m ω n ω m ω n 1 the damping ratio ζ is 0 03 ω 1 is the fundamental frequency of the system ω 3 is the third natural frequency of the system the newmark β method which is suitable for the calculation of dynamic response of non linear systems is used to solve dynamic response of the tandem cylinders 2 2 2 computational domain the size of the computational domain of each two dimensional plane was 20 d 40 d t where t was the center to center distance of the tandem cylinders as shown in fig 5 the cylinders were located at the mid width of the computational domain the center of the upstream cylinder was located at 10d from the inlet boundary and the center of the downstream cylinders was located at a distance of 30d from the outlet boundary as shown in fig 5 the entire domain included five boundaries at the inlet the velocity boundary u u v 0 was applied symmetrical boundary conditions u y 0 v 0 were applied to the side wall at the outlet the pressure p 0 was applied in order to apply no slip condition on the boundaries of the tandem cylinders velocity components at the grid points within or on the boundaries were set to u d x d t v d y d t the composite grid distribution method was used to improve the calculating precision more precise structured grids were used in the near field and sparse unstructured grids were used in the far field the grid points were clustered near the cylinder surface with the distance from the cylinder surface to the nearest grid point fixed y 1 grid independence and time step test of tandem cylinders were conduct for re 2000 and the results of t 6d 12d and 18d were listed in table 2 and table 3 c d1 mean c l1 rms st 1 are mean drag coefficient root mean square rms lift coefficient and strouhal number of the upstream cylinder respectively c d2 mean c l2 rms st 2 are mean drag coefficient root mean square rms lift coefficient and strouhal number of the downstream cylinder respectively table 2 shows the effect of grid distribution on various quantities similar results were obtained for grid scheme 2 and 3 considering the calculation accuracy and time the grid scheme 2 case 2 in table 2 was used for both the single cylinder and the tandem cylinders as shown in fig 6 table 3 shows the effect of dimensionless time step on various quantities when the time step is 0 01 the calculation results differ greatly from that of 0 02 while the calculation results of the time step of 0 03 and the time step of 0 02 are very close so the dimensionless time step of 0 02 was used in the numerical simulation 2 2 3 numerical simulation and experimental conditions a physical experiment was designed to verify the reliability of numerical simulation the same parameters such as size stiffness and mass ratio etc were set for both physical experiment and numerical simulation a free vibration test was conducted to get the natural frequencies of the tested cylinders the results show that the natural frequency f n of the cylinders is 4 25 hz considering the performance of the water tank 12 sets of flow velocity were tested the minimum flow velocity was 0 20 m s and the maximum flow velocity was 0 57 m s as shown in table 4 7 sets of the spacing ratios t d 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 were selected 3 experimental verification to verify the reliability of the numerical simulation method adopted in this paper a physical experiment was conducted and the results were compared with the numerical results the experimental devices and methods are as follows 3 1 experiment equipment the experiment was carried out in the wave simulation laboratory of ocean engineering college of engineering ocean university of china the water tank is 30 m in length 1 m in width and 1 2 m in depth it is equipped with a circulating submersible pump flow generating system the flow velocity of the water tank was measured by acoustic doppler point current meter before the beginning of the experiment the flow velocity in the test section was checked to ensure its uniformity two pvc pipes were selected as the test model and more parameters are shown in table 5 the submerged length of the pipes is 0 5 m because the diameter of the pipe is small and the mass of the sensor will affect the mass distribution and dynamic characteristics of the cylinder the pressure sensor is not suitable the strain gages were used to measure the vibration response of the pipe strain gages were installed at four locations in the middle of the test model the experiment device and the arrangement of the strain gages are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 3 2 data processing to obtain satisfied results the sections of 100s with good stability were selected from time domain data then the intercepted time domain data were filtered based on the natural frequency of the test model the filtering range was set for 1 20 hz the modal analysis introduced by lie and kaasen 2006 was applied to calculate the viv displacement response of the test model according to the basic principle of modal analysis the crossflow displacement of cylinders can be expressed as 18 w z t n 1 q n t φ n z z 0 l where φ n z is the mode shape q n t is the mode weight and n is the order of vibration mode the test model can be simplified as a bernoulli euler beam with pined pined boundary conditions the mode shape can be written as φ n z sin n π z l with z 0 l where l is the cylinder length the relationship between curvature and strain is 19 ε z t r κ z t r 2 w z t z 2 where r is the radius of the cylinder κ z t is the curvature of the test model if the test model is vibrated in the first mode formula 18 can be simplified to 20 ε z t r π l 2 q 1 t φ 1 z in this case the measured strain is proportional to the displacement and the displacement of the measured point can be obtained by calculating the weight coefficient more information on modal analysis for strain signal processing can be found in reference song et al 2011 mohapatra and overbye 2015 3 3 comparison of numerical simulation and experiment results fig 9 and fig 10 show the experimental and numerical results of transverse vibration amplitude and dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder at different reduced velocities and spacing ratio by comparing numerical results with that of experiments it is proved that the numerical simulation is satisfied the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement with very little differences in some reduced velocities and spacing ratios fig 11 and fig 12 show the experimental and numerical results of time histories of the response and spectra of the downstream with t 12d as shown in figs 11 and 12 the time histories of the response and spectra obtained by numerical simulation are in good agreement with experimental results also only the first mode showed in both numerical and experimental results 4 numerical simulation results and discussion the viv features of two flexible circular cylinders in tandem with low mass ratio including amplitude response dominant frequency and vortex structures are presented and discussed in this section 4 1 analysis of vortex induced vibration response fig 13 and fig 14 show the dimensionless amplitude responses and dominant frequencies of the single cylinder and the tandem cylinders versus the reduced velocity v r the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is basically the same as that of a single cylinder and there is a limited resonance range which is the lock in the vibration is self excited and self limited during lock in the amplitude increases significantly in the lock in region and decreases when the reduced velocity increases further in contrast the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows obvious characteristics of wake induced vibration the lock in ceases to exist and the amplitude increases continuously with reduced velocities beyond the lock in region when the spacing ratio is small t 10d the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is always larger than that of the upstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is locked the amplitude of the downstream cylinder also increases significantly the maximum dimensionless amplitude of the downstream cylinder a d 1 2 is about twice that of the upstream cylinder a d 0 6 when the spacing is large t 10d the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows an increasing trend in the overall and in lock in region the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is slightly larger than that of the downstream cylinder it is worth noting that when the spacing is 8d the amplitude of the downstream cylinders shows an increasing trend with the reduced velocity increase and it is not affected by the lock in of the upstream cylinder it can be found from fig 14 that the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder is essentially in agreement with that of a single cylinder under different spacings and reduced velocities their dominant frequency in the lock in region is locked onto the natural frequency of the cylinder the previous studies proved that a cylinder undergoing wiv exhibits a frequency that is very close to the natural frequency of the elastic system supporting the cylinder huera huarte and gharib 2011 mysa et al 2017 the natural frequency deviates from the strouhal frequency it can also be found in present study that the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder agrees with that of the upstream cylinder at low reduced velocity while when the reduced velocity increases to a certain value called separation reduced velocity v r in this paper the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder vibration decreases and the dominant frequency curve of the upstream and the downstream cylinder separates the separation reduced velocity v r decreases with the increase of their spacing when the spacing increases to 16d the dominant frequency curves of the upstream and the downstream cylinder are completely separated when the spacing is 8d the dominant frequencies of the upstream and the downstream cylinders remain the same and there is no separation from figs 13 and 14 it can be found that when the spacing is large t 10d the viv dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder is locked onto its natural frequency in the lock in region and the vibration amplitude increases significantly due to resonance while the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder decreases so its vibration amplitude is slightly smaller than that of the upstream cylinder when the spacing is small t 10d the dominant frequency of the tandem cylinders in the lock in region is close to their natural frequencies so the amplitudes of both cylinders increase significantly the special phenomena of the spacing 8d will be explained by analyzing the vorticity diagram in the following section fig 15 shows the time histories of the response of the downstream cylinder at v r 3 53 and v r 5 88 at v r 5 88 the upstream cylinder undergoes large amplitude vibrations compared to that at v r 3 53 this can also be seen from fig 13 the downstream cylinder lies in the unsteady wake of the upstream cylinder and experiences a galloping flutter type of instability beats can be observed in the time histories of the l response of the cylinder this is consistent with the conclusion of mittal and kumar 2001 from fig 15 c d and e it also can be found that the time histories comprise two frequency components 4 2 spectrum analysis of lift and response for examining the force and response characteristics of tandem cylinders furtherly the lift coefficient and dimensionless transverse response spectra of tandem cylinders at reduced velocity v r 3 53 and v r 5 88 are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 where the red lines represent the lift coefficient spectra and the black lines represent the response spectra allen and henning 2003 found when the separation distance of the tandem cylinders was long enough the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited frequencies at both the vibration frequency of the upstream cylinder and at a lower vibration frequency equal to about 60 75 of the upstream cylinder vibration frequency mysa et al 2017 found that the large displacement of the downstream cylinder is due to the appearance of low frequency component in the transverse load which is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder in this paper double peaks are also observed in the lift coefficient and the response spectra and the lower frequency is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder when the reduced velocity is larger than v r the peak with lower frequency of the downstream cylinder will exceed that with higher frequency and become the main peak which leads to the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder different from that of the downstream cylinders when v r 3 53 the frequency separation can only be observed when the spacing increases to 14d however when v r 5 88 the phenomenon can be observed at spacing t 10d with the increase of flow velocity the minimum spacing in which frequency separation can be observed tends to decrease because of the frequency separation if the response frequency of the downstream cylinder is calculated in the same method as a single cylinder the calculation results will be inaccurate it is more appropriate to calculate the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder vibration by piecewise function 4 3 vorticity contours of tandem cylinders to investigate the reason of the frequency separation of the tandem cylinders the vorticity diagram and pressure coefficient of the tandem cylinders at four typical moments in a vibration period of the downstream cylinder were examined for the spacing 6d 8d and 10d when t 0 the cylinder starts to vibrate upward from the center position when t 1 4t p t p is the vibration period of the downstream cylinder the maximum displacement of the cylinder in the positive direction occurs and then moves downward when t 1 2t p the cylinder returns to the center position when t 3 4t p the cylinder reaches the maximum displacement in the negative direction and then moves upward again when t t p the cylinder returns to the center position and begin to vibrate for next period fig 18 to fig 20 show the instantaneous vorticity diagrams and pressure coefficient c p of the tandem cylinders at reduced velocities v r 3 53 and v r 5 88 for the spacing of 6d 8d and 10d respectively in the pressure coefficient diagrams the circles represent the tandem cylinders the solid line represents the pressure coefficient of the upstream cylinder and the dotted line represents the pressure coefficient of the downstream cylinder the front point on the cylinder is defined as α 0 and the positive direction of the x axis is the anticlockwise direction of the cylinder when the c p curve exceeds the circle it represents that point is under negative pressure conversely when the c p curve sinks into the circle it represents that point is under positive pressure it can be found that the wake modes of the upstream cylinder are similar to that of a single cylinder for the three spacing but the wake mode of the downstream cylinder is more complex when the spacing is 6d at a lower velocity v r 3 53 a pair of the vortices shedding from one side of the upstream cylinder have not mixed before reattaching the downstream cylinder because of the phase difference between the tandem cylinders the pair of the vortices reattach to the upper and lower sides of the downstream cylinder respectively for example a pair of clockwise vortices is shed from the upper side of the downstream cylinder in one vibration period and at the same time a clockwise and a counterclockwise vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder reattaches that side because the pair of wake vortices reattach onto the downstream cylinder separately their influence on the downstream cylinder is insufficient the increase of the amplitude of vortex induced vibration is not apparent and the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is still closed to strouhal frequency at a high velocity v r 5 88 a pair of vortices shed from one side of the upstream cylinder has mixed before reattaching the downstream cylinder the mixed vortex reattaches onto the downstream cylinder in the same direction as vortices shedding from the downstream cylinder this is consistent with the conclusion of kim 2009 on the overall interstitial flow because of the wake effect of the upstream cylinder the viv amplitude of the downstream cylinder increases and low frequency component shows up however due to the smaller spacing the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder are not fully developed and the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is still closed to strouhal frequency fig 18 also shows the instantaneous distribution of pressure coefficient c p here the stagnation point is the location in which the cylinder where maximum pressure coefficient c p max occurs it can be found that the stagnation c p max on the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the upstream cylinder because of the vortex s interaction a peak can be observed in the pressure distributions lines of the downstream cylinder in fig 18 b and d this peak represents the reattachment of the shear layer separating from the upstream cylinder in conclusion the length and intensity of the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder vary significantly for different flow velocities and the reattach point on the downstream cylinder is different which has different effects on wake mode vibration frequency and amplitude of the downstream cylinder fig 19 shows the instantaneous vorticity diagrams and pressure coefficient c p of the tandem cylinders with the spacing of 8d because of the increase of spacing a pair of vortices shedding from one side of the upstream cylinder has mixed before reattaching onto the downstream cylinder at a lower flow rate it is worth noticing that the reattach position of the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder is obviously different from the spacing of 6d for the spacing of 8d the reattach position is backward especially at a lower velocity the wake of the upstream cylinder merges with that of the downstream cylinder and does not touch the downstream cylinder directly by comparing the instantaneous distribution of pressure coefficient of the downstream cylinder with that of the spacing of 6d it can be seen that pressure coefficient of the downstream cylinder is also less affected by the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder this is the reason why the vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder is smaller and no apparent frequency separation is observed between the two cylinders at the spacing of 8d when the spacing of the tandem cylinders is larger than 10d a pair of vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder has mixed before reattaching onto the downstream cylinder at a lower flow velocity the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder are fully developed but its energy is low so it has less effect on the downstream cylinder even though an independence low frequency peak can be observed clearly in the spectrum the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is still the same as strouhal frequency at a higher flow velocity the wake vortices of the upstream cylinder have larger energy and can fully develop before reattaching onto the downstream cylinder therefore the low frequency component replaces the high frequency component to become the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder and the dominant frequencies of the tandem cylinders are no longer the same in conclusion the frequency separation phenomenon is related to the spacing of the tandem cylinders and the flow velocity these two factors should be taken into account when the empirical model of the frequency response of wiv is established 5 empirical model 5 1 theory when studying the flow around a cylinder the vortex shedding frequency f s can be determined by strouhal number it can be written as 21 f s s t u d where f s is the frequency of vortex shedding s t is strouhal number u is flow velocity d is the diameter of cylinder and the dimensionless frequency can be written as 22 f s f n s t u f n d s t v r where f n is the natural frequency of a cylinder v r is the reduced velocity v r u f n d so the vortex shedding frequency f s can be written as 23 f s s t v r f n for two cylinders arranged in tandem the wake vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder affect the downstream cylinder so considering the wake effect in wiv frequency calculation model is necessary from the analysis above it can be seen that the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited two frequencies at specific velocity and spacing and the lower frequency peak is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder when the reduced velocity is larger than v r the lower frequency peak of the downstream cylinder will replace the higher frequency peak to become the main peak which leads to the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder different from that of the upstream cylinder at a lower velocity frequency separation phenomenon can only be observed when the spacing of the tandem cylinders is large but at a higher velocity it can be observed at a smaller spacing with the increase of flow velocity the minimum spacing at which the frequency separation occurs tends to decrease when the spacing is 8d the downstream cylinder is less affected by the wake of the upstream cylinder so although there are two peaks in the response spectrum the higher frequency is still the main peak and so there is no frequency separation considering the influence of the spacing on the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder the empirical model for calculating the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder could be written as 24 f s s t v r f n f λ where λ t d is the spacing ratio of two tandem cylinders f λ is the influence of the spacing on the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder considering that the vibration frequency changes greatly when the frequency separation occurs the piecewise method is used to fit the f λ it can be written as 25 f s s t v r f n f 1 λ u g λ f n f v r f 2 λ u g λ where f s is the wiv frequency of the downstream cylinder g λ is the critical velocity of the frequency separation the strouhal number s t 0 20 the spacing ratio λ ranges from 6 to 18 and the velocities are as shown in table 2 5 2 formula fitting and verification fig 21 shows the critical velocity of the frequency separation for different spacing by fitting the data the functional relationship between the critical velocity and the spacing is obtained it can be written as 26 g λ 6 953 0 6 λ 7 6 from the analysis above it can be seen that the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited two frequencies at specific velocity and spacing and the lower frequency peak is closer to the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder so the logarithmic function is selected to fit f v r and the function formula is as follows 27 f v r ln a v r the power function is selected to fit f λ written as 28 f λ b λ c fitting by least square method the empirical model for wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder is obtained written as 29 f s 0 9271 λ 0 01815 s t v r f n v r 6 953 0 6 λ 7 6 0 4433 λ 0 1436 ln 0 6925 v r f n v r 6 953 0 6 λ 7 6 to verify if the frequency obtained by simulations can be reproduced by the empirical model the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder versus the reduced velocity and spacing ratio are given in fig 22 and fig 23 respectively the dashed line with solid marks represents the numerical simulation value and the solid line with hollow marks represents the forecast value upon examination the correlation coefficient between forecast frequency and simulated frequency is 0 973 which means that the forecast value of the present empirical model agrees well with the numerical simulation results to further validate the empirical model the wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder by the empirical model compared with the recent experiment of huera huarte and gharib 2011 and the numerical simulation of mysa et al 2017 are given in fig 24 it is shown that the dimensionless frequency f s f n agrees well with the previous work and the frequency separation phenomenon can be reproduced it is obvious that the empirical model presented in this paper is suitable for predicting the wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder 6 conclusion the finite volume method fvm combined with ale dynamic mesh method and slice method is employed to simulate the viv of tandem cylinders with an equal diameter and low mass ratio at v r 2 35 to 6 71 the two flexible cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both in line and cross flow the amplitude and frequency results are in great agreement with experimental data which verifies the reliability of the numerical model the effects of spacing and reduced velocity on the viv response of the downstream cylinder are studied including vibration amplitude vibration frequency lock in interval fluid force and wake mode and so on the numerical results indicate that the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is basically the same as that of a single cylinder while the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows obvious wiv characteristics the lock in ceases to exist and the amplitude increases continuously at reduced velocities beyond the lock in region when the spacing ratio of the tandem cylinders is small t 10d the response amplitude of the downstream cylinder is always larger than that of the upstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is locked the amplitude of the downstream cylinder also increases significantly when the spacing is large t 10d the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shows an increasing trend in the overall the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder is basically the same as that of a single cylinder for different spacing and velocities while the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is only closed to that of the upstream cylinder at lower reduced velocities when the reduced velocity increases to a certain value called separation reduced velocity v r in this paper the dominant viv frequency of the downstream cylinder decreases and the frequency separation occurs from the spectrum curves and vorticity diagrams it can be found that the downstream cylinder vibration exhibited two frequencies at specific reduced velocity and spacing when the reduced velocity is larger than v r the lower frequency peak of the downstream cylinder will exceed the higher frequency peak and become the main peak which leads to the different dominant frequency of the upstream and downstream cylinders at lower velocity frequency separation phenomenon can only be observed when the spacing of the tandem cylinders is large but at a higher velocity it can be observed at smaller spacing because of the frequency separation if the frequency of the downstream cylinder is calculated in the same method as a single cylinder the calculation results will be inaccurate an empirical model for calculating wiv frequency response of the downstream cylinder with a low mass ratio is established based on strouhal frequency formula and considering the influence of flow velocity and the spacing the forecast values by the present empirical model agree well with the numerical simulation results and the previous work and it can be used for wiv analysis and calculating the response frequency of the

the peak normalized horizontal force of multiple cylinder array structures keywords generalized finite difference method absorbing boundary conditions perfectly matched layer near trapped mode water wave structure interaction 1 introduction as we known nearly 70 of the surface of the earth is covered by the ocean since the land resources gradually exhausted day by day the mankind turns sight to the abundant ocean of resources with the exploitation of ocean resources more and more marine and offshore structures such as oil exploration platform offshore wind turbines floating airports and so on have been constructed and utilized miozzi et al 2019 rey et al 2018 more and more attentions have been paid on the water wave interactions with the marine and offshore structures bobinski et al 2018 li et al 2016 lu et al 2017 molin et al 2016 these kinds of problems can be considered as the water wave interactions with multiple cylinder array structures bennetts et al 2017 cao and wan 2017 chen et al 2018 several theoretical analysis chatjigeorgiou and katsardi 2018 newman 2017 steward david 2018 wolgamot et al 2015 and experimental studies kagemoto et al 2014 wolgamot et al 2016 found that the interactions of multiple cylinder array structure may result in a great difference at the hydrodynamic loads and wave runup to the isolated individual cylinder structure since theoretical analysis for the interaction of multiple cylinder array structures is a nontrivial task numerical simulation of water wave interactions with multiple cylinder array structures is essential to provide some references on the effective design and manufacture of marine and offshore structures the mesh based methods including the finite difference method fdm berenger 1994 the finite element method fem bai et al 2014 karperaki et al 2019 singh and babarit 2014 and the boundary element method bem hsiao et al 2016 kao et al 2015 kara 2016 teng and song 2017 are the popular and dominant numerical method in the solution of water wave structure interactions among these three methods the fdm and the fem require some additional truncated treatments such as absorbing boundary conditions and perfectly matched layer and so on to carefully cope with the infinite domain the bem needs to derive the fundamental solutions or some other semi analytical functions satisfying the governing equations in advance and it is a sophisticated mathematical and time consuming issue for numerical integration over the singularities on the boundary elements sun and wei 2019 wang et al 2016 for the fast and efficient wave structure interaction simulation the considered water wave interactions of multiple cylinder array structure can be simplified to exterior helmholtz equation problems with multiple obstacles by removing the depth dependence under the assumptions of the potential flow and linear water wave theory not only the aforementioned three numerical methods au and brebbia 1983 perrey debain et al 2003 sun 2017 but also some meshless methods li and li 2017 lin et al 2018 such as the null field boundary integral element method nfbiem chen and lee 2013 chen et al 2009 2011 the eigenfunction expansion method eem evans and porter 1997 linton and evans 1990 the method of fundamental solutions mfs fairweather et al 2003 liu et al 2017 2018 just to mention a few have been implemented to solve exterior helmholtz equation problems with multiple obstacles fu et al 2014 2018a tang et al 2018 the nfbiem chen and lee 2012 employs the fourier series for boundary densities and the degenerate kernels for fundamental solutions to avoid the singular integrals in the bem however it is only available for simple computational geometries including circle and ellipse unlike the nfbiem the mfs and the eem are available for arbitrary computational geometries but all these three methods produce highly ill conditioning resultant matrices fu et al 2018b 2019 which may jeopardize the accuracy of the numerical results in recent decades the meshless fdms such as localized radial basis function collocation method lrbfcm fan et al 2015 tsai et al 2015 yao et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 generalized finite difference method gfdm benito et al 2001 fan et al 2019 qu 2019 shojaei et al 2019 and rbf based finite difference method rbf fd fornberg et al 2013 petras et al 2018 just to mention a few have been proposed to simulate various physical models in engineering and science this kind of method not only inherits the simple discretization formulation from the fdm but also has the meshless property without the ill conditioning resultant matrices in this study we adopt the meshless generalized finite difference method gfdm in conjunction with the truncated treatments of infinite domain for simulating water wave interactions with multiple bottom seated cylinder array structures to our best knowledge so far only a few papers have been published to employ the gfdm coupled with the truncated boundary treatments for wave propagation analysis under infinite domain and most of them focus on the pml treatment this paper makes the first attempt to combine the gfdm with the abc treatment and give a numerical comparison about the gfdm coupled with the pml and abc treatments another contribution of this paper is to apply the present gfdm to revisit the near trapped mode phenomenon accompanied with the related treatment of porous materials the rest of this paper is summarized as follows section 2 introduces the mathematical model of water wave structure interactions and the related gfdm discretization formulation with the absorbing boundary conditions abc or the perfectly matched layer pml benito et al 2013 korkut et al 2018 salete et al 2017 in section 3 the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed gfdm is verified through several typical benchmark examples and the near trapped mode phenomenon accompanied with the related treatment of porous materials are revisited finally some conclusions are presented in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 water wave structure interaction under the assumptions of the potential flow and linear water wave theory the ocean water is considered as an incompressible non viscous and irrotational fluid consider the water wave structure interaction problem as shown in fig 1 where the xy plane is parallel to the cross section of the structure d denotes the water depth and a represents the radius of the cross section of the circular cylinder structure the governing equation of the water wave structure interaction is given by 1 δ φ x y z t 0 x y z d where δ denote the laplace operator d is the domain of interest and φ x y z represents the velocity potential the boundary conditions are bottom boundary conditions 2 φ z 0 z d structure boundary conditions 3 φ n q x y d z 0 x y γ j j 1 2 j simplified free surface boundary conditions 4 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 z 0 in which γ j denotes the structure boundary of the jth circular cylinder n is the unit outward normal vector at the structure surface q x y represents the known function g is the acceleration of gravity by using the method of separation of variables we set 5 φ x y z t r e φ x y f z e i ω t where φ x y is horizontal velocity potential i 1 f z i g a ω cos h k z d cos h k d and wavenumber k is the real root of the linear dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k d in which a ω denote the amplitude of incident wave and the angular frequency respectively substituting eq 5 into eqs 1 4 the three dimensional water wave problems can be reduced to the two dimensional water wave problem chen et al 2009 the corresponding mathematical model can be simplified to 6 δ k 2 φ x y 0 x y ω subjected to the boundary conditions 7 φ n q x y x y γ j j 1 2 j and the well known sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity 8 lim r r 1 2 φ d r i k φ d 0 where the total horizontal velocity potential φ is divided into incident potential φ i and diffraction potential φ d i e φ φ i φ d in which φ i e i k x cos α y sin α with incident wave angle α it should be mentioned that if the structure is impermeable then q x y 0 in the boundary conditions 7 otherwise if the structure with outer porous wall as shown in fig 2 then q x y in the boundary conditions 7 of inner wall and outer wall are respectively represented as follows 9 q x y i g k φ j φ 0 x y γ j 1 10 q x y 0 x y γ j 2 where pe denotes wall thickness coefficient and the dimensionless permeability coefficient g is defined as ω ρ w μ k chwang 1983 in which w is material parameter of the structure μ fluid dynamic viscosity ρ denotes the density of fluid φ j denotes velocity potential at outer porous wall region ω j φ 0 denotes velocity potential outside the structure in addition the fluid flow through the porous wall region ω j is assumed to obey the darcy s law which is also governed by eq 6 one may find more details about the derivation of the porous structure model in the literature chwang 1983 for ease comparison the dimensionless wave height η r the dimensionless wave pressure p r and the dimensionless horizontal wave force components f x r f y r are defined as follows 11 η r x y η x y a a φ x y a φ x y 12 p r x y 0 p x y 0 ρ g a ρ g a φ x y ρ g a φ x y 13 f x r f y r f x f y 1 ρ g a a d ρ g a a k tanh k d 0 2 π φ x y c o s θ s i n θ d θ 1 ρ g a a d tanh k d k d 0 2 π φ x y c o s θ s i n θ d θ 2 2 formulation of generalized finite difference method similar to the traditional fdms the gfdm constructs the numerical differentiation formulations to approximate the partial derivative terms of the considered exterior helmholtz equation problems 6 8 its general formulation can be represented as follows 14 d u w u where the partial derivative vector d u the solution vector u and the weighting matrix w are respectively defined as 15 d u u i x u i y 2 u i x 2 2 u i y 2 2 u i x y 1 5 t 16 u u 1 u 2 u n t 17 w w 1 x i w n x i w 1 y i w n y i w 1 x x i w n x x i w 1 x y i w n x y i w 1 y y i w n y y i 5 n in which u i i 1 2 n are the solutions at discretization nodes x i x y ξ r 2 the key issue in the gfdm is to determine the sparse weighting matrix w for easy understanding we start from the traditional fgm with central difference type for second order pdes in 2d domain as shown in fig 3 the corresponding discretization formulation at inner node ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ ξ r 2 can be represented as follows 18a u ξ 1 ξ 2 x u ξ 1 h ξ 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 18b u ξ 1 ξ 2 y u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 h u ξ 1

ξ 2 h 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h 18e 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 y 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 1 h 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h it can be found from the fdm discretization formulation 18 that the first and second order partial derivative terms of u ξ require only 9 discretization nodes in ξ i e the stencil support of a certain node ξ is ξ ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 h ξ 1 h ξ 2 ξ 1 h ξ 2 h ξ and each row in the weighting matrix w has only 2 4 nonzero elements similar to the traditional fdm the partial derivative terms of u ξ can be represented by a linear combination of the solutions u at the discretization nodes of the stencil support ξ ξ as shown in fig 4 however unlike the traditional fdm the gfdm introduces the moving least squares theory and second order taylor series expansion to determine the sparse weighting matrix w once the stencil support ξ ξ is selected the solution u x j at the node x j ξ ξ can be represented by using second order taylor series expansion 19 u x j u ξ h j 1 u ξ x h j 2 u ξ y h j 1 2 2 2 u ξ x 2 h j 1 h j 2 2 u ξ x y h j 2 2 2 2 u ξ y 2 o ρ 3 where h j 1 x j ξ 1 h j 2 y j ξ 2 ρ j h j 1 2 h j 2 2 it is then possible to define the function b u 20 b u j 1 n s u ξ u x j h j 1 u ξ x h j 2 u ξ y h j 1 2 2 2 u ξ x 2 h j 1 h j 2 2 u ξ x y h j 2 2 2 2 u ξ y 2 β ρ j 2 in which ns

j where d j denote the maximum distance between central node ξ and the nodes of its stencil support ξ ξ in order to determine the numerical differentiation formulations 14 in the gfdm one may minimize the function b u and then obtain the following linear equation system 22 a d u b where 23a a j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 2 j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 h j 2 j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 3 2 j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 h j 2 2 2 j 1 n

b a 1 b u w u namely the weighting matrix w in the gfdm is determined as w a 1 b which can be rewritten as follows 25a u x k i w i x k i u i j 1 j i n s w j x k i u j x i ξ ξ k 1 2 25b 2 u x k x k i w i x k x k i u i j 1 j i n s w j x k x k i u j x i ξ ξ k 1 2 k k k 1 2 it can be found from eq 25 that the weighting matrix w is a sparse matrix with no more than ns nonzero elements in one row to choose the appropriate stencil supports the nearest neighbours algorithm fan et al 2019 is implemented in this study it should be mentioned that unlike the traditional fdms the proposed gfdm can discretize the boundary and interface conditions directly by using formulation 25 with the ns nearest nodes of the considered boundary interface node inside the computational domain and no additional auxiliary nodes outside the computational domain are required the related theoretical analysis and numerical investigations can be found in the literatures benito et al 2001 benito et al 2017 this makes the gfdm easy and efficient to deal with the boundary and interface conditions 2 3 truncated treatments for infinite domain for simulating the interaction between water wave and structure the computational domain is usually an infinite domain as shown in fig 5 the computational domain needs to be truncated into finite domain with artificial boundary γ a before the gfdm implementation in this study two truncated treatments absorbing boundary conditions abc and perfectly matched layer pml are used 2 3 1 absorbing boundary condition abc the abc treatment is taken from the weakened sommerfeld condition namely the boundary conditions on the artificial boundary γ a are 26 φ d r i k φ d 0 x y γ a as shown in fig 6 the region with half length tb bounded by the artificial boundary γ a can be divided into reliable region including the structure and error region the numerical results inside the reliable region with half length rb may achieve the acceptable accuracy since it is far away from the artificial boundary γ a 2 3 2 perfectly matched layer pml berenger 1994 the pml treatment is to set the boundary layer with the attenuation factor σ i outside the artificial boundary γ a to eliminate the wave reflection effect from the truncated artificial boundary as shown in fig 7 the reliable region with half length rb bounded by the pml with the length th in the pml region the real coordinates x y are converted to the following complex coordinates x y 27a x 1 i σ i k x 27b y 1 i σ i k y fig 8 shows the pml region partitions and the attenuation factor σ i along with x and y axis can be represented as follows 28 σ x v x t h 2 x y ① ③ ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ ⑧ σ y v y t h 2 x y ② ④ ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ ⑧ in comparison of the abc and the pml the abc treatment is much simpler than the pml treatment 3 numerical results and discussion in this section the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed gfdm coupled with the abc treatment or the pml treatment are first tested to the water wave interaction with one cylinder and four cylinder structures in comparison with the analytical solutions and the reference solutions then the near trapped mode phenomenons of specific configurations of four cylinder array structures with certain incident water waves are revisited by using the proposed gfdm finally the structure with porous outer wall is demonstrated to eliminate the aforementioned near trapped mode phenomenon of multiple cylinder array structures the numerical accuracy is calculated by the relative error rerr which are defined as follows 29 rerr 1 n i 1 n ε i 2 in which ε i φ x i φ

the number of discretization nodes in the stencil support ξ ξ is set as ns 21 3 1 numerical verification of the proposed gfdm example 1 water wave interaction with single circular cylinder structure first consider an incident water wave φ i e i k x cos α y sin α scattered by rigid circular cylinder mounted on the flat bottom the analytical solution of diffraction potential field is given by liu

shows the analytical dimensionless free surface elevation η r surrounding the circular cylinder with the parameters a 1 0 α 0 k a 1 and a 1 in the proposed gfdm implementation the choices of the parameters in two truncated treatments are investigated namely the location of the truncated boundary γ a tb and the size of the reliable region rb in the abc treatment the size of the reliable region tb and the length of the pml th in the pml treatment in the present numerical study we fix the parameters a 1 0 α 0 r b a 4 and δ h a 0 1 for the regular node distribution here the quasi random nodes are also considered in this example which can be generated from the regular nodes with the random movement inside the circular subdomain with the radius d r μ r δ h as shown in fig 10 a where δ h min h 1 h 2 and μ r is a random number between 0 and 0 5 the quasi random nodes with μ r 0 1 are shown in fig 10 b fig 11 displays the accuracy variations of numerical results with respect to the different locations of the truncated boundary γ a by using the proposed gfdm with the abc treatment under regular random node distributions at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 it can be found from fig 11 that both the numerical errors by using regular and random nodes may decrease with the increasing size of the truncated domain tb a at small wavenumber ka 1 2 however the numerical errors cannot decrease remarkably with the increasing tb a at ka 3 in particular large tb a this is because that too coarse node discretization to obtain the accurate results fig 12 displays the accuracy variations of numerical results with respect to the length of the pml by using the proposed gfdm with the pml treatment under regular random node distributions at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 generally speaking both the numerical errors by using regular and random nodes may decrease with the increasing pml thicknesses th a at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 however the effect of decreasing errors becomes less and less with the increasing pml thicknesses th a and wavenumber ka similarly much smaller node spacing needs to be used to obtain more accurate results in the gfdm implementation next we fix the parameters a 1 0 α 0 r b a 4 and tb a 8 in the abc treatment and th a 4 in the pml treatment fig 13 shows the accuracy variations of numerical results with respect to decreasing the node spacing δ h a by using the proposed gfdm with the abc treatment and the pml treatment at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 from fig 13 it can be observed that both the numerical results obtained by gfdm abc and gfdm pml converge to the analytical solutions with the decrease of the node spacing δ h a moreover the gfdm pml can have the better performance and the faster convergence rate than the gfdm abc in the solution of the case with small wavenumber and small node spacing δ h a 0 2 obviously the smaller node spacing is required to solve example 1 with higher wavenumber to balance the efficiency and accuracy the relationships between the node spacing and the wavenumber in the gfdm abc and gfdm pml are respectively shown in figs 14 and 15 it should be mentioned that the pml treatment uses th a 2 in fig 15 in figs 14 and 15 the red dots represent the numerical results with rerr 10 2 by using the gfdm with abc or pml from the results in figs 14 and 15 the following experiential relationship is obtained by 31 δ h a min κ l k a 1 25 0 1 where κ l 0 24 in the abc treatment and κ l 0 26 in the pml treatment in the proposed gfdm implementation the appropriate node spacing δ h a can be easily determined by using the experiential relationships 31 to guarantee the numerical results with engineering accuracy rerr 10 2 therefore unless otherwise specified the experiential relationship 31 is used to determine the node spacing δ h a in the further numerical implementation then consider an incident water wave φ i e i k x cos α y sin α scattered by a rigid circular cylinder mounted on a general shoal liu et al 2012 as shown in fig 16 where the water depth can be represented as 32 d x y d r d 0 d b d 0 r m r b m r a r r b d b r r b since the water depth d x y is not a constant the wavenumber k x y cannot be a constant too which should be determined by using the linear dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k d then the governing equation can be modified to the following variable coefficient helmholtz type equation i e the mild slope equation karperaki et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 33 c c g φ x y k 2 c c g φ x y 0 x y ω in which c ω k and c g ν ω k denote the phase and group velocity and ν 0 5 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d for ease comparison the parameters are set as a r a 10000 r b 30000 d d b 4000 and d 0 500 t 720 s for d 0 0 and d 0 500 t 480 s for d 0 0 in this case liu et al 2012 fig 17 shows the normalized wave amplitudes obtained by the present gfdm with abc and pml treatments for a rigid circular cylinder mounted on the above defined shoal 32 with a d 0 0 and b d 0 0 under different powers m it can be found that the present gfdm results match well with the reference results liu et al 2012 on the shoal with different powers m 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 4 1 2 8 and the similar conclusions can be drawn that is the gfdm pml provides more accurate results than the gfdm abc it should be mentioned that the boundary discretization methods cannot be directly implemented since finding the related fundamental solutions and wave based functions to satisfy the mild slope equation 34 is a nontrivial task example 2 water wave interaction with four cylinder array structure consider an incident water wave φ i e i k x cos α y sin α scattered by four cylinder array structure mounted on the flat bottom the placement of four circular cylinders is displayed in fig 18 its analytical solution cannot be easily derived due to the wave interaction between four cylinders therefore the present gfdm results are compared with the reference results chen et al 2011 for easy comparisons the parameters are set as a 3 16 b 3 8 α 45 k a π 2 a 0 5 δ h a 0 1 r b a 8 and tb a 64 3 in the abc treatment and th a 3 in the pml treatment fig 19 plots the free surface elevations η of example 2 obtained by the proposed gfdm with abc and pml treatment in comparison with the reference method chen et al 2011 from fig 19 it can be found that the numerical results obtained by the proposed gfdm with abc or pml treatments are in good agreement with the reference results chen et al 2011 the gfdm pml may require the smaller truncated domain and less discretization node number than the gfdm abc in this example 3 2 near trapped modes of multiple cylinder array structure example 3 water wave interaction with four cylinder array structure in this example the placement of four cylinder array structure is also shown in fig 16 and the parameters are set as a 1 0 d a 10 α 45 a 1 r b a 3 t b a 3 in the present gfdm abc implementation fig 20 presents the horizontal wave force amplitude f r f x r 2 f y r 2 along with wave number ka in example 3 with different spacings between adjacent cylinders b a 0 7 and b a 0 8 it can be seen from fig 20 that the horizontal force f r on each cylinder will be decreasing with the increasing wavenumber ka however it may be considerably increasing around the specified wavenumbers e g ka 3 048 when b a 0 7 and ka 4 08482 when b a 0 8 under these two groups of the parameter settings the near trapped mode phenomenons of specific four cylinder array structures are revisited by using the placement adjustment of the discretization nodes as shown in fig 21 where δ h a 0 0372 in setting 1 and δ h a 0 0086 in setting 2 the corresponding free surface elevations η r surrounding the four cylinder structure are shown in fig 22 the maximum wave runup amplitude appearing on the inner sides of the cylinders is more than 10 and 150 times over the incident wave amplitude under the aforementioned two parameter settings respectively it indicates that the wave energy is trapped inside the four cylinder structure which may destroy the structure 3 3 porous material treatment on near trapped modes example 4 water wave interaction with four cylinder structure including outer porous wall to eliminate the near trapped mode phenomenon encountered in example 3 the porous material treatment has been implemented the placement of the discretization nodes is shown in fig 23 the parameters are set as a 1 d a 10 α 45 a 1 r b a 5 g 1 0 p e 0 2 and t h a 3 in the present gfdm pml implementation the free surface elevations η r surrounding the structure of four porous cylinders with different parameter settings setting 1 b a 0 7 k a 3 048 setting 2 b a 0 8 k a 4 08482 are plotted in fig 24 tables 1 2 list the horizontal wave force on each cylinder in two aforementioned two parameter settings by using the impermeable structure and the structure with outer porous wall from figs 22 and 24 it can be demonstrated that the porous wall outside the cylinders can efficiently reduce the free surface elevations inthe vicinity of the structures from tables 1 2 it can be found that the horizontal force on each cylinder can reduce almost 1 2 orders of magnitude by using the outer porous wall these numerical results show that the porous material treatment is an efficient way to avoid the occurrence of near trapped mode phenomenon and reduce the peak horizontal force by the incident water wave with specified wavenumbers 4 conclusions this paper presents the meshless generalized finite difference method gfdm in conjunction with the absorbing boundary conditions abc or the perfectly matched layer pml for simulating water wave structure interactions in comparison with traditional finite difference methods the proposed gfdm is free of mesh and available for irregular discretization nodes due to the implementation of the nearest neighbours algorithm in this study in comparison with the analytical solutions and the reference results numerical demonstrations show that both the gfdm with abc and pml can obtain the accurate results for simulating water wave interactions with single and four cylinder array structures in comparison of the abc and the pml the abc treatment is much simpler and less computational resources than the pml treatment while the pml treatment may achieve more accurate results with faster convergence rate than the abc treatment due to the properties of these two truncated treatments the gfdm abc is used to revisit the near trapped mode phenomenon encountered in the specified four cylinder array structures by the incident water wave with specified wavenumbers the gfdm pml is used to verify the effect of the porous material treatment on the elimination of the near trapped mode and the peak horizontal force therefore the proposed gfdm can be considered as a competitive alternative for water wave interactions with multiple bottom seated cylinder array structures it is worth noting that the present study simplifies the mathematical model from 3d to 2d for the wide applicability of the mathematical model the water depth should be carefully considered clauss et al 2009 namely three dimensional model of water wave structure interactions belibassakis et al 2001 cong et al 2018 xu et al 2015 this issue is still under study and

the peak normalized horizontal force of multiple cylinder array structures keywords generalized finite difference method absorbing boundary conditions perfectly matched layer near trapped mode water wave structure interaction 1 introduction as we known nearly 70 of the surface of the earth is covered by the ocean since the land resources gradually exhausted day by day the mankind turns sight to the abundant ocean of resources with the exploitation of ocean resources more and more marine and offshore structures such as oil exploration platform offshore wind turbines floating airports and so on have been constructed and utilized miozzi et al 2019 rey et al 2018 more and more attentions have been paid on the water wave interactions with the marine and offshore structures bobinski et al 2018 li et al 2016 lu et al 2017 molin et al 2016 these kinds of problems can be considered as the water wave interactions with multiple cylinder array structures bennetts et al 2017 cao and wan 2017 chen et al 2018 several theoretical analysis chatjigeorgiou and katsardi 2018 newman 2017 steward david 2018 wolgamot et al 2015 and experimental studies kagemoto et al 2014 wolgamot et al 2016 found that the interactions of multiple cylinder array structure may result in a great difference at the hydrodynamic loads and wave runup to the isolated individual cylinder structure since theoretical analysis for the interaction of multiple cylinder array structures is a nontrivial task numerical simulation of water wave interactions with multiple cylinder array structures is essential to provide some references on the effective design and manufacture of marine and offshore structures the mesh based methods including the finite difference method fdm berenger 1994 the finite element method fem bai et al 2014 karperaki et al 2019 singh and babarit 2014 and the boundary element method bem hsiao et al 2016 kao et al 2015 kara 2016 teng and song 2017 are the popular and dominant numerical method in the solution of water wave structure interactions among these three methods the fdm and the fem require some additional truncated treatments such as absorbing boundary conditions and perfectly matched layer and so on to carefully cope with the infinite domain the bem needs to derive the fundamental solutions or some other semi analytical functions satisfying the governing equations in advance and it is a sophisticated mathematical and time consuming issue for numerical integration over the singularities on the boundary elements sun and wei 2019 wang et al 2016 for the fast and efficient wave structure interaction simulation the considered water wave interactions of multiple cylinder array structure can be simplified to exterior helmholtz equation problems with multiple obstacles by removing the depth dependence under the assumptions of the potential flow and linear water wave theory not only the aforementioned three numerical methods au and brebbia 1983 perrey debain et al 2003 sun 2017 but also some meshless methods li and li 2017 lin et al 2018 such as the null field boundary integral element method nfbiem chen and lee 2013 chen et al 2009 2011 the eigenfunction expansion method eem evans and porter 1997 linton and evans 1990 the method of fundamental solutions mfs fairweather et al 2003 liu et al 2017 2018 just to mention a few have been implemented to solve exterior helmholtz equation problems with multiple obstacles fu et al 2014 2018a tang et al 2018 the nfbiem chen and lee 2012 employs the fourier series for boundary densities and the degenerate kernels for fundamental solutions to avoid the singular integrals in the bem however it is only available for simple computational geometries including circle and ellipse unlike the nfbiem the mfs and the eem are available for arbitrary computational geometries but all these three methods produce highly ill conditioning resultant matrices fu et al 2018b 2019 which may jeopardize the accuracy of the numerical results in recent decades the meshless fdms such as localized radial basis function collocation method lrbfcm fan et al 2015 tsai et al 2015 yao et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 generalized finite difference method gfdm benito et al 2001 fan et al 2019 qu 2019 shojaei et al 2019 and rbf based finite difference method rbf fd fornberg et al 2013 petras et al 2018 just to mention a few have been proposed to simulate various physical models in engineering and science this kind of method not only inherits the simple discretization formulation from the fdm but also has the meshless property without the ill conditioning resultant matrices in this study we adopt the meshless generalized finite difference method gfdm in conjunction with the truncated treatments of infinite domain for simulating water wave interactions with multiple bottom seated cylinder array structures to our best knowledge so far only a few papers have been published to employ the gfdm coupled with the truncated boundary treatments for wave propagation analysis under infinite domain and most of them focus on the pml treatment this paper makes the first attempt to combine the gfdm with the abc treatment and give a numerical comparison about the gfdm coupled with the pml and abc treatments another contribution of this paper is to apply the present gfdm to revisit the near trapped mode phenomenon accompanied with the related treatment of porous materials the rest of this paper is summarized as follows section 2 introduces the mathematical model of water wave structure interactions and the related gfdm discretization formulation with the absorbing boundary conditions abc or the perfectly matched layer pml benito et al 2013 korkut et al 2018 salete et al 2017 in section 3 the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed gfdm is verified through several typical benchmark examples and the near trapped mode phenomenon accompanied with the related treatment of porous materials are revisited finally some conclusions are presented in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 water wave structure interaction under the assumptions of the potential flow and linear water wave theory the ocean water is considered as an incompressible non viscous and irrotational fluid consider the water wave structure interaction problem as shown in fig 1 where the xy plane is parallel to the cross section of the structure d denotes the water depth and a represents the radius of the cross section of the circular cylinder structure the governing equation of the water wave structure interaction is given by 1 δ φ x y z t 0 x y z d where δ denote the laplace operator d is the domain of interest and φ x y z represents the velocity potential the boundary conditions are bottom boundary conditions 2 φ z 0 z d structure boundary conditions 3 φ n q x y d z 0 x y γ j j 1 2 j simplified free surface boundary conditions 4 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 z 0 in which γ j denotes the structure boundary of the jth circular cylinder n is the unit outward normal vector at the structure surface q x y represents the known function g is the acceleration of gravity by using the method of separation of variables we set 5 φ x y z t r e φ x y f z e i ω t where φ x y is horizontal velocity potential i 1 f z i g a ω cos h k z d cos h k d and wavenumber k is the real root of the linear dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k d in which a ω denote the amplitude of incident wave and the angular frequency respectively substituting eq 5 into eqs 1 4 the three dimensional water wave problems can be reduced to the two dimensional water wave problem chen et al 2009 the corresponding mathematical model can be simplified to 6 δ k 2 φ x y 0 x y ω subjected to the boundary conditions 7 φ n q x y x y γ j j 1 2 j and the well known sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity 8 lim r r 1 2 φ d r i k φ d 0 where the total horizontal velocity potential φ is divided into incident potential φ i and diffraction potential φ d i e φ φ i φ d in which φ i e i k x cos α y sin α with incident wave angle α it should be mentioned that if the structure is impermeable then q x y 0 in the boundary conditions 7 otherwise if the structure with outer porous wall as shown in fig 2 then q x y in the boundary conditions 7 of inner wall and outer wall are respectively represented as follows 9 q x y i g k φ j φ 0 x y γ j 1 10 q x y 0 x y γ j 2 where pe denotes wall thickness coefficient and the dimensionless permeability coefficient g is defined as ω ρ w μ k chwang 1983 in which w is material parameter of the structure μ fluid dynamic viscosity ρ denotes the density of fluid φ j denotes velocity potential at outer porous wall region ω j φ 0 denotes velocity potential outside the structure in addition the fluid flow through the porous wall region ω j is assumed to obey the darcy s law which is also governed by eq 6 one may find more details about the derivation of the porous structure model in the literature chwang 1983 for ease comparison the dimensionless wave height η r the dimensionless wave pressure p r and the dimensionless horizontal wave force components f x r f y r are defined as follows 11 η r x y η x y a a φ x y a φ x y 12 p r x y 0 p x y 0 ρ g a ρ g a φ x y ρ g a φ x y 13 f x r f y r f x f y 1 ρ g a a d ρ g a a k tanh k d 0 2 π φ x y c o s θ s i n θ d θ 1 ρ g a a d tanh k d k d 0 2 π φ x y c o s θ s i n θ d θ 2 2 formulation of generalized finite difference method similar to the traditional fdms the gfdm constructs the numerical differentiation formulations to approximate the partial derivative terms of the considered exterior helmholtz equation problems 6 8 its general formulation can be represented as follows 14 d u w u where the partial derivative vector d u the solution vector u and the weighting matrix w are respectively defined as 15 d u u i x u i y 2 u i x 2 2 u i y 2 2 u i x y 1 5 t 16 u u 1 u 2 u n t 17 w w 1 x i w n x i w 1 y i w n y i w 1 x x i w n x x i w 1 x y i w n x y i w 1 y y i w n y y i 5 n in which u i i 1 2 n are the solutions at discretization nodes x i x y ξ r 2 the key issue in the gfdm is to determine the sparse weighting matrix w for easy understanding we start from the traditional fgm with central difference type for second order pdes in 2d domain as shown in fig 3 the corresponding discretization formulation at inner node ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ ξ r 2 can be represented as follows 18a u ξ 1 ξ 2 x u ξ 1 h ξ 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 18b u ξ 1 ξ 2 y u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 18c 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 x 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 1 h 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 18d 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 x y u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 1 4 h 2 u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h u ξ 1 h ξ 2 h 18e 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 y 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 1 h 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h u ξ 1 ξ 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 h it can be found from the fdm discretization formulation 18 that the first and second order partial derivative terms of u ξ require only 9 discretization nodes in ξ i e the stencil support of a certain node ξ is ξ ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 h ξ 1 h ξ 2 ξ 1 h ξ 2 h ξ and each row in the weighting matrix w has only 2 4 nonzero elements similar to the traditional fdm the partial derivative terms of u ξ can be represented by a linear combination of the solutions u at the discretization nodes of the stencil support ξ ξ as shown in fig 4 however unlike the traditional fdm the gfdm introduces the moving least squares theory and second order taylor series expansion to determine the sparse weighting matrix w once the stencil support ξ ξ is selected the solution u x j at the node x j ξ ξ can be represented by using second order taylor series expansion 19 u x j u ξ h j 1 u ξ x h j 2 u ξ y h j 1 2 2 2 u ξ x 2 h j 1 h j 2 2 u ξ x y h j 2 2 2 2 u ξ y 2 o ρ 3 where h j 1 x j ξ 1 h j 2 y j ξ 2 ρ j h j 1 2 h j 2 2 it is then possible to define the function b u 20 b u j 1 n s u ξ u x j h j 1 u ξ x h j 2 u ξ y h j 1 2 2 2 u ξ x 2 h j 1 h j 2 2 u ξ x y h j 2 2 2 2 u ξ y 2 β ρ j 2 in which ns denotes the number of discretization nodes in the stencil support ξ ξ β ρ j is the weighting function and in this study it is defined as 21 β ρ j 1 6 ρ j d j 2 8 ρ j d j 3 3 ρ j d j 4 ρ j d j 0 ρ j d j where d j denote the maximum distance between central node ξ and the nodes of its stencil support ξ ξ in order to determine the numerical differentiation formulations 14 in the gfdm one may minimize the function b u and then obtain the following linear equation system 22 a d u b where 23a a j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 2 j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 h j 2 j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 3 2 j 1 n s β j 2 h j 1 h j 2 2 2 j 1 n

b a 1 b u w u namely the weighting matrix w in the gfdm is determined as w a 1 b which can be rewritten as follows 25a u x k i w i x k i u i j 1 j i n s w j x k i u j x i ξ ξ k 1 2 25b 2 u x k x k i w i x k x k i u i j 1 j i n s w j x k x k i u j x i ξ ξ k 1 2 k k k 1 2 it can be found from eq 25 that the weighting matrix w is a sparse matrix with no more than ns nonzero elements in one row to choose the appropriate stencil supports the nearest neighbours algorithm fan et al 2019 is implemented in this study it should be mentioned that unlike the traditional fdms the proposed gfdm can discretize the boundary and interface conditions directly by using formulation 25 with the ns nearest nodes of the considered boundary interface node inside the computational domain and no additional auxiliary nodes outside the computational domain are required the related theoretical analysis and numerical investigations can be found in the literatures benito et al 2001 benito et al 2017 this makes the gfdm easy and efficient to deal with the boundary and interface conditions 2 3 truncated treatments for infinite domain for simulating the interaction between water wave and structure the computational domain is usually an infinite domain as shown in fig 5 the computational domain needs to be truncated into finite domain with artificial boundary γ a before the gfdm implementation in this study two truncated treatments absorbing boundary conditions abc and perfectly matched layer pml are used 2 3 1 absorbing boundary condition abc the abc treatment is taken from the weakened sommerfeld condition namely the boundary conditions on the artificial boundary γ a are 26 φ d r i k φ d 0 x y γ a as shown in fig 6 the region with half length tb bounded by the artificial boundary γ a can be divided into reliable region including the structure and error region the numerical results inside the reliable region with half length rb may achieve the acceptable accuracy since it is far away from the artificial boundary γ a 2 3 2 perfectly matched layer pml berenger 1994 the pml treatment is to set the boundary layer with the attenuation factor σ i outside the artificial boundary γ a to eliminate the wave reflection effect from the truncated artificial boundary as shown in fig 7 the reliable region with half length rb bounded by the pml with the length th in the pml region the real coordinates x y are converted to the following complex coordinates x y 27a x 1 i σ i k x 27b y 1 i σ i k y fig 8 shows the pml region partitions and the attenuation factor σ i along with x and y axis can be represented as follows 28 σ x v x t h 2 x y ① ③ ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ ⑧ σ y v y t h 2 x y ② ④ ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ ⑧ in comparison of the abc and the pml the abc treatment is much simpler than the pml treatment 3 numerical results and discussion in this section the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed gfdm coupled with the abc treatment or the pml treatment are first tested to the water wave interaction with one cylinder and four cylinder structures in comparison with the analytical solutions and the reference solutions then the near trapped mode phenomenons of specific configurations of four cylinder array structures with certain incident water waves are revisited by using the proposed gfdm finally the structure with porous outer wall is demonstrated to eliminate the aforementioned near trapped mode phenomenon of multiple cylinder array structures the numerical accuracy is calculated by the relative error rerr which are defined as follows 29 rerr 1 n i 1 n ε i 2 in which ε i φ x i φ x i φ x i 10 3 ε i φ x i φ x i φ x i φ x i 10 3 where n is the number of total discretization nodes φ x i φ x i denotes the numerical solution and analytical solution at x i unless otherwise specified the number of discretization nodes in the stencil support ξ ξ is set as ns 21 3 1 numerical verification of the proposed gfdm example 1 water wave interaction with single circular cylinder structure first consider an incident water wave φ i e i k x cos α y sin α scattered by rigid circular cylinder mounted on the flat bottom the analytical solution of diffraction potential field is given by liu

function of the first kind and the mth order hankel function of the first kind respectively the polar coordinates r θ of the discretization node x i are defined as r x 2 y 2 and θ arctan y x fig 9 shows the analytical dimensionless free surface elevation η r surrounding the circular cylinder with the parameters a 1 0 α 0 k a 1 and a 1 in the proposed gfdm implementation the choices of the parameters in two truncated treatments are investigated namely the location of the truncated boundary γ a tb and the size of the reliable region rb in the abc treatment the size of the reliable region tb and the length of the pml th in the pml treatment in the present numerical study we fix the parameters a 1 0 α 0 r b a 4 and δ h a 0 1 for the regular node distribution here the quasi random nodes are also considered in this example which can be generated from the regular nodes with the random movement inside the circular subdomain with the radius d r μ r δ h as shown in fig 10 a where δ h min h 1 h 2 and μ r is a random number between 0 and 0 5 the quasi random nodes with μ r 0 1 are shown in fig 10 b fig 11 displays the accuracy variations of numerical results with respect to the different locations of the truncated boundary γ a by using the proposed gfdm with the abc treatment under regular random node distributions at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 it can be found from fig 11 that both the numerical errors by using regular and random nodes may decrease with the increasing size of the truncated domain tb a at small wavenumber ka 1 2 however the numerical errors cannot decrease remarkably with the increasing tb a at ka 3 in particular large tb a this is because that too coarse node discretization to obtain the accurate results fig 12 displays the accuracy variations of numerical results with respect to the length of the pml by using the proposed gfdm with the pml treatment under regular random node distributions at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 generally speaking both the numerical errors by using regular and random nodes may decrease with the increasing pml thicknesses th a at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 however the effect of decreasing errors becomes less and less with the increasing pml thicknesses th a and wavenumber ka similarly much smaller node spacing needs to be used to obtain more accurate results in the gfdm implementation next we fix the parameters a 1 0 α 0 r b a 4 and tb a 8 in the abc treatment and th a 4 in the pml treatment fig 13 shows the accuracy variations of numerical results with respect to decreasing the node spacing δ h a by using the proposed gfdm with the abc treatment and the pml treatment at different wavenumbers ka 1 2 3 from fig 13 it can be observed that both the numerical results obtained by gfdm abc and gfdm pml converge to the analytical solutions with the decrease of the node spacing δ h a moreover the gfdm pml can have the better performance and the faster convergence rate than the gfdm abc in the solution of the case with small wavenumber and small node spacing δ h a 0 2 obviously the smaller node spacing is required to solve example 1 with higher wavenumber to balance the efficiency and accuracy the relationships between the node spacing and the wavenumber in the gfdm abc and gfdm pml are respectively shown in figs 14 and 15 it should be mentioned that the pml treatment uses th a 2 in fig 15 in figs 14 and 15 the red dots represent the numerical results with rerr 10 2 by using the gfdm with abc or pml from the results in figs 14 and 15 the following experiential relationship is obtained by 31 δ h a min κ l k a 1 25 0 1 where κ l 0 24 in the abc treatment and κ l 0 26 in the pml treatment in the proposed gfdm implementation the appropriate node spacing δ h a can be easily determined by using the experiential relationships 31 to guarantee the numerical results with engineering accuracy rerr 10 2 therefore unless otherwise specified the experiential relationship 31 is used to determine the node spacing δ h a in the further numerical implementation then consider an incident water wave φ i e i k x cos α y sin α scattered by a rigid circular cylinder mounted on a general shoal liu et al 2012 as shown in fig 16 where the water depth can be represented as 32 d x y d r d 0 d b d 0 r m r b m r a r r b d b r r b since the water depth d x y is not a constant the wavenumber k x y cannot be a constant too which should be determined by using the linear dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k d then the governing equation can be modified to the following variable coefficient helmholtz type equation i e the mild slope equation karperaki et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 33 c c g φ x y k 2 c c g φ x y 0 x y ω in which c ω k and c g ν ω k denote the phase and group velocity and ν 0 5 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d for ease comparison the parameters are set as a r a 10000 r b 30000 d d b 4000 and d 0 500 t 720 s for d 0 0 and d 0 500 t 480 s for d 0 0 in this case liu et al 2012 fig 17 shows the normalized wave amplitudes obtained by the present gfdm with abc and pml treatments for a rigid circular cylinder mounted on the above defined shoal 32 with a d 0 0 and b d 0 0 under different powers m it can be found that the present gfdm results match well with the reference results liu et al 2012 on the shoal with different powers m 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 4 1 2 8 and the similar conclusions can be drawn that is the gfdm pml provides more accurate results than the gfdm abc it should be mentioned that the boundary discretization methods cannot be directly implemented since finding the related fundamental solutions and wave based functions to satisfy the mild slope equation 34 is a nontrivial task example 2 water wave interaction with four cylinder array structure consider an incident water wave φ i e i k x cos α y sin α scattered by four cylinder array structure mounted on the flat bottom the placement of four circular cylinders is displayed in fig 18 its analytical solution cannot be easily derived due to the wave interaction between four cylinders therefore the present gfdm results are compared with the reference results chen et al 2011 for easy comparisons the parameters are set as a 3 16 b 3 8 α 45 k a π 2 a 0 5 δ h a 0 1 r b a 8 and tb a 64 3 in the abc treatment and th a 3 in the pml treatment fig 19 plots the free surface elevations η of example 2 obtained by the proposed gfdm with abc and pml treatment in comparison with the reference method chen et al 2011 from fig 19 it can be found that the numerical results obtained by the proposed gfdm with abc or pml treatments are in good agreement with the reference results chen et al 2011 the gfdm pml may require the smaller truncated domain and less discretization node number than the gfdm abc in this example 3 2 near trapped modes of multiple cylinder array structure example 3 water wave interaction with four cylinder array structure in this example the placement of four cylinder array structure is also shown in fig 16 and the parameters are set as a 1 0 d a 10 α 45 a 1 r b a 3 t b a 3 in the present gfdm abc implementation fig 20 presents the horizontal wave force amplitude f r f x r 2 f y r 2 along with wave number ka in example 3 with different spacings between adjacent cylinders b a 0 7 and b a 0 8 it can be seen from fig 20 that the horizontal force f r on each cylinder will be decreasing with the increasing wavenumber ka however it may be considerably increasing around the specified wavenumbers e g ka 3 048 when b a 0 7 and ka 4 08482 when b a 0 8 under these two groups of the parameter settings the near trapped mode phenomenons of specific four cylinder array structures are revisited by using the placement adjustment of the discretization nodes as shown in fig 21 where δ h a 0 0372 in setting 1 and δ h a 0 0086 in setting 2 the corresponding free surface elevations η r surrounding the four cylinder structure are shown in fig 22 the maximum wave runup amplitude appearing on the inner sides of the cylinders is more than 10 and 150 times over the incident wave amplitude under the aforementioned two parameter settings respectively it indicates that the wave energy is trapped inside the four cylinder structure which may destroy the structure 3 3 porous material treatment on near trapped modes example 4 water wave interaction with four cylinder structure including outer porous wall to eliminate the near trapped mode phenomenon encountered in example 3 the porous material treatment has been implemented the placement of the discretization nodes is shown in fig 23 the parameters are set as a 1 d a 10 α 45 a 1 r b a 5 g 1 0 p e 0 2 and t h a 3 in the present gfdm pml implementation the free surface elevations η r surrounding the structure of four porous cylinders with different parameter settings setting 1 b a 0 7 k a 3 048 setting 2 b a 0 8 k a 4 08482 are plotted in fig 24 tables 1 2 list the horizontal wave force on each cylinder in two aforementioned two parameter settings by using the impermeable structure and the structure with outer porous wall from figs 22 and 24 it can be demonstrated that the porous wall outside the cylinders can efficiently reduce the free surface elevations inthe vicinity of the structures from tables 1 2 it can be found that the horizontal force on each cylinder can reduce almost 1 2 orders of magnitude by using the outer porous wall these numerical results show that the porous material treatment is an efficient way to avoid the occurrence of near trapped mode phenomenon and reduce the peak horizontal force by the incident water wave with specified wavenumbers 4 conclusions this paper presents the meshless generalized finite difference method gfdm in conjunction with the absorbing boundary conditions abc or the perfectly matched layer pml for simulating water wave structure interactions in comparison with traditional finite difference methods the proposed gfdm is free of mesh and available for irregular discretization nodes due to the implementation of the nearest neighbours algorithm in this study in comparison with the analytical solutions and the reference results numerical demonstrations show that both the gfdm with abc and pml can obtain the accurate results for simulating water wave interactions with single and four cylinder array structures in comparison of the abc and the pml the abc treatment is much simpler and less computational resources than the pml treatment while the pml treatment may achieve more accurate results with faster convergence rate than the abc treatment due to the properties of these two truncated treatments the gfdm abc is used to revisit the near trapped mode phenomenon encountered in the specified four cylinder array structures by the incident water wave with specified wavenumbers the gfdm pml is used to verify the effect of the porous material treatment on the elimination of the near trapped mode and the peak horizontal force therefore the proposed gfdm can be considered as a competitive alternative for water wave interactions with multiple bottom seated cylinder array structures it is worth noting that the present study simplifies the mathematical model from 3d to 2d for the wide applicability of the mathematical model the water depth should be carefully considered clauss et al 2009 namely three dimensional model of water wave structure interactions belibassakis et al 2001 cong et al 2018 xu et al 2015 this issue is still under study and
