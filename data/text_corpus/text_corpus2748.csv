the microalgae biomass harvested from the process has the potential to be applied as fertilizer as presented characteristics nutrients amount comparable to other organic fertilizers available on the

treatment needs to be done without compromising the needs of future generations organic and inorganic compounds present in the wastewater are highly valuable products which can be recovered and recycled back to society 1 the construction of wastewater treatment plants in a sustainable way is only possible if the flow of water energy and organic and inorganic material are closed and it is easier to be achieved with decentralized systems at different scales and locations 2 3 decentralized wastewater treatment also makes it possible to reduce the complexity of current treatment processes with efficient easy to apply and low cost technologies 4 one example is to segregate the domestic wastewater into grey water from showerbath laundy and kitchen water and black water from toilet and organic kitchen waste 5 black water bw has high amount of organic and inorganic compounds such as macro and micronutrients that could be recovery 6 by the use of anaerobic digestion ad ad guarantees good removal of organic matter and an improvement in the carbon and nutrient cycle due to the conservation and the possibility of using the resources produced during digestion besides bringing savings to all stages of treatment 7 the most used reactor is the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor that in addition to ensuring the removal of organic matter has the ability to generate by products such as methane and carbon dioxide that can be used for other purposes applying the vision of the circular economy 8 the uasb reactor promotes the organic matter conversion into biogas mainly methane and carbon dioxide and transforms nitrogen organic bounded in ammonium and sulfates into hydrogen sulfides 9 the reactor conserves a high amount of nitrogen and phosphorus present in wastewater 10 however for the recovery of such nutrients it is necessary to implement a post treatment step in a uasb reactor among the various technologies used the cultivation of microalgae has stood out as it guarantees the tertiary treatment of the final effluent and because microalgae have fast growth and high economical value 11 microalgae cultivation is presented as a promising alternative to resource recovery 12 they use the nutrients available at the effluent to grow so the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the effluent controls the microalgae growth rate directly 13 on systems with microalgae bacteria consortia the relationships between the organisms are very complex and the interactions and nutrients assimilation can happen by different reactions nitrogen is present on nucleic acids nucleotides amino acids amides enzymes proteins energy transfer molecules etc 14 and it is removed from the effluent by the microalgae digestion of inorganic nitrogen sources nitrate nitrite and ammonium and by the microbial nitrification and denitrification 15 16 phosphorus participates at the synthesis transformation and transportation of carbohydrate and it is present at sugar phosphates phospholipids nucleic acids nucleotides coenzymes etc 14 it can be assimilated by the microalgae biomass or can be removed by luxury uptake when inorganic polyphosphate granules are stored by the microalgae 17 the use of a uasb reactor followed by microalgae cultivation allows the recovery of three main resources carbon green energy water and nutrients the process as suggested generates methane from the organic matter at the uasb reactor that can be used as fuel to energy generation 9 the wastewater is treated and the generated effluent has the characteristics of reuse water that can be applied in further processes 18 19 the nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and other trace elements are recovered by the microalgae biomass cultivated on the wastewater which could be diverted to co products with high added value with or without further treatment such as nutrient sources fertilizers bioproducts and feedstock for energy production 12 20 22 chlorella sp and scenedesmaceae are usually used at the wastewater treatment because of their characteristics 23 however the separation of microalgae is a major challenge and it can represent up to 60 of the total microalgae biomass production cost 24 therefore investigating the dynamics of the separation process can provide optimization of the system 25 coagulation flocculation is a conventional technology on the separation of solid liquid used to recover microalgae biomass and other materials economically and efficiently the most used coagulants are made of aluminum or iron salts ferric chloride aluminum sulfate and others these inorganic coagulants provide high coagulation performance and are cost effective but they are not biodegradable and their residues could remain after treatment in the water and or sludge this generates possible contamination on the water for human consumption and complications for disposal and treatment of the sludge produced 26 inorganic coagulants largely determine the ph of the culture and the concentration to be dosed studies indicate that the concentrations of inorganic salts must be up to 140 mg l 1 while the concentration for organic coagulants is normally superior to 100 mg l 1 24 although the highest concentration is due to organic coagulants 27 they make them a great ecological alternative due to the low toxicity and the capacity of generating products from microalgae biomass for uses such as animal feed and fertilizers 24 28 the research on natural coagulants has been increasing 27 29 31 and the most commonly used are tannin chitosan and moringa oleifera lam mol mol is one of 14 species of tropical plants belonging to the moringaceae family and which has been standing out as a sustainable alternative for the coagulation of microalgae 28 their seeds contain coagulant properties 32 comparable to aluminum coagulants 33 34 and in addition to being a renewable product have low toxicity 35 mol seeds have an amount of protein that resembles the performance of cationic polyelectrolytes which when added to the water guarantees a good removal of turbidity and contributes to the recovery of microalgae biomass 36 the seeds as natural coagulants can be applied as powder aqueous or saline extracts 37 the preparation and application of this coagulant are simple and inexpensive and mol does not generate a negative impact on the environment or microalgae biomass 38 and produces a final separated material with high biodegradability 31 after sedimentation the microalgae biomass can be applied as fertilizer in order to improve soil health by the availability of nutrients npk and trace elements in the soil plant system in addition to act as a physical barrier against pathogens and pests decomposing organic waste and stimulating plant growth and development 39 the potential of microalgae biomass as an organic fertilizer is evaluated according to the composition of macronutrients primary and secondary and trace elements the production of microalgae based fertilizers is ideal when it is possible to hydrolyze proteins amino acids and peptides and preserve the phyto stimulants contained in the microalgae biomass itself and comply with the regulations for commercialization in terms of nutritional content npk and trace elements 40 microalgae fertilizers can be produced by chemical hydrolysis but acidic conditions provide inferior quality to the final product there are also enzymatic methods and dehydration causing the cells to rupture whose purpose is to obtain the compounds present in the microalgae cells for the preparation of various products 24 therefore the study for the application of an organic coagulant is extremely important and last reviews in the subject identified significant gaps on the research to define the parameters to use natural coagulant 41 as mol 28 and the characteristics of the by products of the process for future application 22 the objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of mol powder as a natural coagulant for the harvesting of microalgae cultivated in anbw through the coagulation flocculation process followed by the sedimentation step coagulation diagrams were made to identify the coagulation conditions that would be studied mol dosage and sedimentation time were evaluated to achieve the best effluent quality after sedimentation considering removal efficiency parameters of turbidity optical density od true color total suspended solids tss total and filtered chemical oxygen demand cod residual nitrogen and phosphorus characteristics of microalgae biomass for its application as an organic fertilizer were also assessed therefore this work brings the novelty of identifying the best parameters for the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation of microalgae biomass using mol as coagulant on laboratory scale and build in knowledge for tests at a larger scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study effluent anbw treated in photobioreactors with chlorella sorokiniana was used in this study bw was produced at laboratory with a mix of swine manure and domestic wastewater pork manure was supplied by fazenda

carlos autonomous water and wastewater service são paulo domestic wastewater and swine manure were sent to an equalization tank on a pilot scale in which the mixture was carried out and provided bw

uasb and pbr conditions are defined at slompo et al 2020 42 the process is presented in fig 1 2 2 natural coagulant mol from a forest recovery association penápolis são paulo was used as natural coagulant prepared according to the methodology proposed by the literature 38 the powder was prepared from 150 peeled seeds with an average protein content of 27 determined by kjeldahl method 43

guarantee they would not decrease their coagulant properties proteins according to the time of storage protein content tests were carried out in triplicate throughout the work stages the powder was used in a maximum time of 7 days due to the biodegradability 2 3 mol dosage and sedimentation time analysis coagulation flocculation and sedimentation tests were performed in jar test policontrol

from photobioreactors with high values of turbidity 171 ntu optical density from 2 1 3 0 nm true color 246 uc and tss 367 mg l 1 these values are indicative of the high concentration of microalgae the ratio between od682nm and od540nm 1 15 at this study is a relative measure of the amount of chlorophyll a present in microalgae cells where values above 1 indicate the presence of healthy microalgae cells 51 chlorella sorokiniana microalgae used in this study has a spherical shape with a diameter between 3 and 5 μm and specific gravity higher than the water s one a common characteristic of green microalgae that can be explored at the sedimentation stage 23 the values of nitrogen 142 mg l 1 and phosphorus 47 mg l 1 shows the potential of the effluent for its future application as fertilizers and is expected that these nutrients are present at the biomass and can be utilized after harvesting 3 2 coagulation flocculation and sedimentation tests 3 2 1 coagulation diagram from the coagulation diagrams fig 2 where blue color represents the lower efficiency and the red color represents higher efficiency in removing the control parameter turbidity it is possible to highlight some conclusions for sedimentation time of 15 min ph between 5 7 obtained lower efficiency for turbidity removal less than 10 while basic ph obtained values of 40 and acidic ph achieved 60 for ph lower than 5 higher efficiencies have been observed an acidic environment can transfer to the sample higher concentration of hydrogen cations h and can help to destabilize the microalgae cell decreasing the application of the natural coagulant dosage however if the sample has an excess of h cations according to the literature there could be a reversal of the microalgae surface loads and the process could become unfeasible 52 53 flocculation of microalgae biomass is sensitive to ph and the improvement in efficiency can occur with increasing ph the ph for flocculation can vary according to the cell surface properties biomass concentration composition and flocculation time the diagrams show that even without the coagulant addition the effluent turbidity removal was increased at more alkaline solutions flocculation by simply increasing the ph can be an attractive alternative due to its low cost low energy and non toxic to microalgae cells 54 at a basic environment ph above 8 microalgae can auto flocculate this can occur through the consumption of co2 by the photosynthesis process or through the direct addition of bases such as the application of sodium hydroxide leading to ions supersaturation in the sample and allowing the mciroalgae cell walls to serve as a support for the flocculation and ensuring a better interaction with the applied coagulant 55 flocculation kinetics plays an important role in collision and it depends upon both mixing and time with longer sedimentation times the removal efficiency improved achieving more than 70 this can suggest the mixing energy applied 15 min was not enough for the shock between the microalgae cells and the formation of dense flocs at longer sedimentation times 30 and 40 min it was possible to verify the influence of the coagulant dosage on the turbidity removal efficiency where even in higher ph neutral or basic the efficiency is improved with higher dosages of coagulant with best results for coagulant dosage of above 450 mg l 1 at 30 min the efficiency achieved 72 and 55 on ph 3 and 9 respectively while at 40 min the efficiency achieved 85 ph 3 and 81 ph 9 at 40 min there were higher turbidity removal efficiencies due probably to a better interaction of microalgae cells with the applied coagulant or higher interaction between flocs regions more defined in the coagulation diagram were generated what agrees with the literature 46 at this time it was possible to verify high turbidity removal efficiency 74 in neutral ph ph 7 for coagulant dosages higher than 350 mg l 1 for using biomass as fertilizer anything that can change its final characteristics can directly influence its final use thus maintaining the effluent ph neutral can maintain the final biomass characteristics for its application as a fertilizer 56 neutral environments with ph 7 generated less impact in the final characteristics of the biomass and guarantees an adequate recovery of chlorella sorokiniana cells 57 what increases the feasibility of the final material for the application in the agriculture therefore the coagulation ph 7 was fixed for the next steps 3 2 2 mol optimum dosage the results of the experiments to evaluate the optimum mol dosage for removing true color turbidity and reducing optical density tss cod and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are presented in fig 3 the mol seeds demonstrated to be a good natural coagulant and in dosages higher than 425 mg l 1 achieved removal efficiency of turbidity and od superior to 80 maximum of 92 and 93 with 35 and 45 min respectively and color 40 fig 3a the control without mol application showed there is no difference between sedimentation time 14 turbidity and 21 od but when the dosage increases the efficiency is higher at longer sedimentation time it is possible to detect a trend of no incremental efficiency after the concentration of 475 mg l 1 with no significant difference between mol dosages the mol seeds applied as a natural coagulant did not change significantly the color of the final effluent fig 3b even with the application of a concentration of 550 mg l 1 the highest studied dosage previous studies showed that with chemical coagulants aluminum sulfate in higher concentrations 1000 mg l 1 the removal could achieve 90 58 the low efficiencies of removing true color can be explained by the coagulant concentration that was not enough to the rupture of microalgae cells observed by the od ratio 682 540 nm superior to 1 the best results for the removal of total suspended solids were obtained at a concentration of 525 mg l 1 with a reduction above 65 in 35 min of sedimentation fig 3b the concentration of organic matter codtotal presented before the application of mol seeds was 740 mg l 1 the average removal of total cod was between 42 and 63 applying from 425 to 550 mg l 1 of the mol seeds fig 3c from all the dosages evaluated the best efficiency obtained was 500 mg l 1 with 45 min of sedimentation and removal of about 63 of the organic matter present in the effluent after filtration the cod was measured again codfiltered in fig 3c and it was possible to notice the efficiency of 25 with 45 min of sedimentation 425 mg l 1 the efficiency of removing the codfiltered agrees with the literature 59 that the application of mol as a natural coagulant has positive aspects since the organic load added to the effluent through the application of mo seeds did not present significant increase and concentration of the organic matter removed is greater than that added by the seeds the nutrients removals are presented in fig 3d nitrogen measured as tkn removal after the assimilation of nutrients by the microalgae and their separation from effluent was 6 at the control effluent and achieved 62 475 mg l 1 for 35 min what confirmed a good removal nitrogen was the only parameter with better removal efficiency with 35 min of sedimentation than with 45 min but different coagulant doses and sedimentation times did not present significant statistical differences p 0 05 like nitrogen phosphorus is a macronutrient responsible for the growth of microalgae and the dissolved portion orthophosphates is preferred for microalgae biomass 60 the n p ratio for the assimilation of microalgae has great relevance since the low concentration of phosphorus in the effluent can compromise the assimilation of nitrogen and therefore decrease the efficiency in removing nutrients for the microalgae separation step the total phosphorus removal efficiency was from 26 white effluent to 60 475 mg l 1 for 45 min however the coagulant doses and sedimentation times did not show significant difference for the removal of this parameter p 0 05 the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was studied before for scenedesmus sp chlorella sp and synechocystis sp associated with the anaerobic effluent and it was possible to achieve an efficiency of more than 90 in an alkaline environment ph 10 49 the balance of nutrients in the medium and the good assimilation by the microalgae can influence the nutrients recovered in the microalgae separation stage 61 62 in general the dosage of 475 mg l 1 of the mol seeds stood out in relation to the others promoting the good removal of turbidity od true color and tss the nutrient removal showed no significant difference between the mol coagulant doses and the sedimentation times studied p 0 05 some parameters were a little better at higher dosages but considering the saving in coagulant and the significance of improvement the dosage of 475 mg l 1 was defined for further analysis the sedimentation time also demonstrated an impact on removing parameters and an increase in this time from 35 to 45 showed better efficiency in removing the turbidity od and true color therefore it was decided to test the 475 mg l 1 with 60 and 120 min of sedimentation 3 2 3 sedimentation time the experiments with the application of 475 mg l 1 of mol fig 4 showed a clear trend on efficiency being increased by the increase in sedimentation time and after 120 min more than 50 of the turbidity was removed without the mol coagulation addition this means that with this time around 50 of the flocs were harvested by natural coagulation and with the addition of the coagulant 95 removal was achieved therefore a primary decanter could be recommended before applying the mol in order to further reduce the dosage and sludge generation even in the biological treatment where the mineralization of organic compounds is counted on the predominant effect is the flocculation of the material in a colloidal state making it possible to remove it by sedimentation in the primary and secondary decanters the sedimentation times of 60 and 120 min showed no significant difference on removing the parameters turbidity optical density and true color when compared to the efficiencies obtained at 45 min p 0 05 the costs and infrastructure on the sedimentation tanks get bigger and more complex 63 a study using mol and wastewater from nigeria identified much longer sedimentation time 250 min but with a lower amount of added coagulant 150 mg l 1 64 it is important to design the sedimentation process and infrastructure according to the future use of the effluent and biomass and balance it with the costs associated with the process therefore despite the good efficiency with 120 min maintaining the sedimentation step in 45 min presents advantages when compared to the other sedimentation times evaluated throughout this study as it might generate savings in the installation and operation of sedimentation infrastructure 3 2 4 microalgae characterization the biomass with microalgae c sorokiniana and mol collected after the sedimentation and drying process presented ph 10 water content 8 and organic matter 51 the nutrient content in comparison to other organic fertilizers from the literature 61 is presented in table 2 the coagulant mol seeds powder can also contribute to the final biomass amount of nutrients but from the amount of biomass recovered 5 g of biomass per liter of initial effluent from the photobioreactor and only 475 mg l 1 of coagulant and mol elemental composition taken from the literature mol contributes less than the nutrients recovered by the microalgae from the wastewater 65 detailed assessment of the nutrients composition of the coagulant is necessary on future works the average carbon content presented in the biomass of this study 315 g kg 1 agrees with the literature for chlorella sp usually around 300 g kg 1 61 it is in the range of the other organic fertilizers 293 to 475 g kg 1 and complies with the minimum concentration defined for application to the soil and leaf the biomass has a c n ratio of 8 microalgae usually has a c n ratio that ranges from 8 to 11 66 this value is also comparable to other organic fertilizers average of 8 6 according to the sda mapa normative instruction nº 25 2009 the c n shall not exceed 20 for fertilizer classes a b c and d therefore there is a good concentration of nutrients in the microalgae biomass of this study despite the wide range of c n p of commercial organic fertilizers the biomass c n p ratio 16 6 2 1 found in this study is similar to the average c n p found in the 8 organic fertilizers 19 4 2 5 1 the biomass also met the other minimum requirements of secondary macronutrient s ca and mg contents for organic fertilizers defined in the legislation the balance of nutrients supply is essential to optimize the composition and commercialization of microalgae products primary and secondary macronutrients of microalgae biomass were within the limits defined for their application as organic foliar fertilizer decree 4 954 2004 the only value above those defined is the sodium na content excess sodium may be explained by the addiction of swine manure in the composition of bw used in this study excess sodium can contribute to increase soil salinity what restrict permeability and increase osmotic pressure in the soil plant system in this case the management of microalgae biomass applications is required to reduce soil salinization 67 the biomass from this study presented a high concentration of phosphorus potassium and magnesium what are adequate and competitive with the microalgae products available on the market the concentration of presented trace elements especially cu mn and fe is sufficient to supply these microelements to the development of the plant 68 69 through the results the concentrations of macronutrients and trace elements of the biomass are comparable to the concentrations of commercial organic fertilizers brazilian legislation provides different definitions for fertilizers such as wastewater sludge classified as organic compound fertilizer however fertilizers obtained from microalgae biomass have not yet been included by the legislation from previous studies on the use of microalgae as fertilizers spirulina platensis with 78 g kg 1 n 8 g kg 1 p and 16 g kg 1 k had a good performance in plants such arugula in comparison with chemical fertilizers 70 chlorella vulgaris improve root and leaf growth when applied to the soil and when used in the irrigation water was a great sustainable biofertilizer in terms of dry weight and chlorophyll content in rice lettuce cucumber and eggplant crops 71 four species of microalgae tetraselmis sp nannochloropsis sp chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were proved to be an excellent fertilizer for the cultivation of wheat plants after cultivation in domestic wastewater however after harvesting these biomasses an acid solution was used to leach out the ferric chloride absorbed during the coagulation process 72 renuka et al 73 tested one microalgae consortium chlorella scenedesmus chlorococcum and chroococcus sp as fertilizer on wheat crops triticum aestivum l which resulted in improved the plant growth and yield these studies besides highlighting the use potential of microalgae biomass as a sustainable biofertilizer were also able to show that the cultivation conditions and environment can interfere in the final concentration of nutrients in the biomass of microalgae the initial composition of domestic wastewater can differ from social cultural climatic conditions and other aspects in different regions in general microalgae cultivated in domestic wastewater has positive effects regarding their use as organic fertilizers the characteristics of the microalgae produced in this study are in the same range of other organic fertilizers available at the market this points to that the microalgae cultivated in anbw could be used as fertilizer in different crops with higher quality than fertilizers from microalgae produced by chemical hydrolysis and acid conditions 74 furthermore the use of microalgae biomass reduces the risk of eutrophication since organic phosphorus mineralization is slow and its absorption by plants is proportional to its release 75 it is recommended the future tests on plant cultivation in order to identify ideal concentrations for its application as fertilizer while controlling the availability of nutrients to the soil plant system other parameters that could also be evaluated are the uasb and photobioreactors operation conditions as they could influence on the anbw and biomass properties and then in the follow process steps coagulation to sedimentation the potential for fertilizer production from the biomass is a significant advantage when compared to the biomass collected after the use of inorganic coagulant because of its toxicity and as their residues aluminum and iron could remain after treatment in the final product 26 72 application of this biomass on the soil and crops as fertilizer needs to be further studied as well as analyses of the coagulant and the microalgae biomass such as scanning electron microscope sem images and isoelectric point 30 in conjunction and individually after a separation process are recommended to characterized their structure and evaluate its efficiency 4 practical applications the use of mol as a natural coagulant presents advantages in different areas as mol grows in tropical areas 32 the use of this resource for the water and wastewater treatment could have an economical advantage to developing countries where it is cultivated such as brazil malaysia 34 76 and african countries 33 65 mol could replace the use of chemical coagulants such as aluminum based ones what would generate less negative environmental impact with less toxic by products and more biodegradable final biomass residue that could be used as fertilizer to recycling nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus therefore this work presented the potential for the direct application of the applied uasb photobioreactor and mol as coagulant to the wastewater treatment plants in order to close the nutrients water and energy cycles with a high perspective of technical and economical feasible application of this technology in decentralized systems on developing countries 31 77 the work identified the best parameters for the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation steps identifying mol dosage sedimentation time and final biomass characteristics in order to build the knowledge to future work in larger scale 5 conclusions this research highlighted the potential of moringa oleifera lam integral powder as a natural coagulant for harvesting microalgae cultivated in anbw through coagulation flocculation and sedimentation steps tests showed that 475 mg l 1 of mol as coagulant with 45 min for sedimentation 0 17 cm min 1 presented the best efficiency in removing turbidity 93 optical density 90 true color 38 total suspended solids 58 chemical oxygen demand 53 nitrogen 57 and phosphorus 60 considering the feasibility of the project the biomass harvested from the process presented characteristics comparable to other organic fertilizers available at the market and future tests on plant cultivation need to be done to confirm its potential to be applied as fertilizers therefore it is possible to conclude that the nutrients presented in the wastewater can be recovered using mol as coagulant during its treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

easier to be achieved with decentralized systems at different scales and locations 2 3 decentralized wastewater treatment also makes it possible to reduce the complexity of current treatment processes with efficient easy to apply and low cost technologies 4 one example is to segregate the domestic wastewater into grey water from showerbath laundy and kitchen water and black water from toilet and organic kitchen waste 5 black water bw has high amount of organic and inorganic compounds such as macro and micronutrients that could be recovery 6 by the use of anaerobic digestion ad ad guarantees good removal of organic matter and an improvement in the carbon and nutrient cycle due to the conservation and the possibility of using the resources produced during digestion besides bringing savings to all stages of treatment 7 the most used reactor is the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor that in addition to ensuring the removal of organic matter has the ability to generate by products such as methane and carbon dioxide that can be used for other purposes applying the vision of the circular economy 8 the uasb reactor promotes the organic matter conversion into biogas mainly

present on nucleic acids nucleotides amino acids amides enzymes proteins energy transfer molecules etc 14 and it is removed from the effluent by the microalgae digestion of inorganic nitrogen sources nitrate nitrite and ammonium and by the microbial nitrification and denitrification 15 16 phosphorus participates at the synthesis transformation and transportation of carbohydrate and it is present at sugar phosphates phospholipids nucleic acids nucleotides coenzymes etc 14 it can be assimilated by the microalgae biomass or can be removed by luxury uptake when inorganic polyphosphate granules are stored by the microalgae 17 the use of a uasb reactor followed by microalgae cultivation allows the recovery of three main resources carbon green energy water and nutrients the process as suggested generates methane from the organic matter at the uasb reactor that can be used as fuel to energy generation 9 the wastewater is treated and the generated effluent has the characteristics of reuse water that can be applied in further processes 18 19 the nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and other trace elements are recovered by the microalgae biomass cultivated on the wastewater which could be diverted to co products with high added value with or without further treatment such as nutrient sources fertilizers bioproducts and feedstock for energy production 12 20 22 chlorella sp and scenedesmaceae are usually used at the wastewater treatment because of their characteristics 23 however the separation of microalgae is a major challenge and it can represent up to 60 of the total microalgae biomass production cost 24 therefore investigating the dynamics of the separation process can provide optimization of the system 25 coagulation flocculation is a conventional technology on the separation of solid liquid used to recover microalgae biomass and other materials economically and efficiently the most used coagulants are made of aluminum or iron salts ferric chloride aluminum sulfate and others these inorganic coagulants provide high coagulation performance and are cost effective but they are not biodegradable and their residues could remain after treatment in the water and or sludge this generates possible contamination on the water for human consumption and complications for disposal and treatment of the sludge produced 26 inorganic coagulants largely determine the ph of the culture and the concentration to be dosed studies indicate that the concentrations of inorganic salts must be up to 140 mg l 1 while the concentration for organic coagulants is normally superior to 100 mg l 1 24 although the highest concentration is due to organic coagulants 27 they make them a great ecological alternative due to the low toxicity and the capacity of generating products from microalgae biomass for uses such as animal feed and fertilizers 24 28 the research on natural coagulants has been increasing 27 29 31 and the most commonly used are tannin chitosan and moringa oleifera lam mol mol is one of 14 species of tropical plants belonging to the moringaceae family and which has been standing out as a sustainable alternative for the coagulation of microalgae 28 their seeds contain coagulant properties 32 comparable to aluminum coagulants 33 34 and in addition to being a renewable product have low toxicity 35 mol seeds have an amount of protein that resembles the performance of cationic polyelectrolytes which when added to the water guarantees a good removal of turbidity and contributes to the recovery of microalgae biomass 36 the seeds as natural coagulants can be applied as powder aqueous or saline extracts 37 the preparation and application of this coagulant are simple and inexpensive and mol does not generate a negative impact on the environment or microalgae biomass 38 and produces a final separated material with high biodegradability 31 after sedimentation the microalgae biomass can be applied as fertilizer in order to improve soil health by the availability of nutrients npk and trace elements in the soil plant system in addition to act as a physical barrier against pathogens and pests decomposing organic waste and stimulating plant growth and development 39 the potential of microalgae biomass as an organic fertilizer is evaluated according to the composition of macronutrients primary and secondary and trace elements the production of microalgae based fertilizers is ideal when it is possible to hydrolyze proteins amino acids and peptides and preserve the phyto stimulants contained in the microalgae biomass itself and comply with the regulations for commercialization in terms of nutritional content npk and trace elements 40 microalgae fertilizers can be produced by chemical hydrolysis but acidic conditions provide inferior quality to the final product there are also enzymatic methods and dehydration causing the cells to rupture whose purpose is to obtain the compounds present in the microalgae cells for the preparation of various products 24 therefore the study for the application of an organic coagulant is extremely important and last reviews in the subject identified significant gaps on the research to define the parameters to use natural coagulant 41 as mol 28 and the characteristics of the by products of the process for future application 22 the objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of mol powder as a natural coagulant for the harvesting of microalgae cultivated in anbw through the coagulation flocculation process followed by the sedimentation step coagulation diagrams were made to identify the coagulation conditions that would be studied mol dosage and sedimentation time were evaluated to achieve the best effluent quality after sedimentation considering removal efficiency parameters of turbidity optical density od true color total suspended solids tss total and filtered chemical oxygen demand cod residual nitrogen and phosphorus characteristics of microalgae biomass for its application as an organic fertilizer were also assessed therefore this work brings the novelty of identifying the best parameters for the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation of microalgae biomass using mol as coagulant on laboratory scale and build in knowledge for tests at a larger scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study effluent anbw treated in photobioreactors with chlorella sorokiniana was used in this study bw was produced at laboratory with a mix of swine manure and domestic wastewater pork manure was supplied by fazenda

carlos autonomous water and wastewater service são paulo domestic wastewater and swine manure were sent to an equalization tank on a pilot scale in which the mixture was carried out and provided bw

uasb and pbr conditions are defined at slompo et al 2020 42 the process is presented in fig 1 2 2 natural coagulant mol from a forest recovery association penápolis são paulo was used as natural coagulant prepared according to the methodology proposed by the literature 38 the powder was prepared from 150 peeled seeds with an average protein content of 27 determined by kjeldahl method 43

guarantee they would not decrease their coagulant properties proteins according to the time of storage protein content tests were carried out in triplicate throughout the work stages the powder was used in a maximum time of 7 days due to the biodegradability 2 3 mol dosage and sedimentation time analysis coagulation flocculation and sedimentation tests were performed in jar test policontrol

from photobioreactors with high values of turbidity 171 ntu optical density from 2 1 3 0 nm true color 246 uc and tss 367 mg l 1 these values are indicative of the high concentration of microalgae the ratio between od682nm and od540nm 1 15 at this study is a relative measure of the amount of chlorophyll a present in microalgae cells where values above 1 indicate the presence of healthy microalgae cells 51 chlorella sorokiniana microalgae used in this study has a spherical shape with a diameter between 3 and 5 μm and specific gravity higher than the water s one a common characteristic of green microalgae that can be explored at the sedimentation stage 23 the values of nitrogen 142 mg l 1 and phosphorus 47 mg l 1 shows the potential of the effluent for its future application as fertilizers and is expected that these nutrients are present at the biomass and can be utilized after harvesting 3 2 coagulation flocculation and sedimentation tests 3 2 1 coagulation diagram from the coagulation diagrams fig 2 where blue color represents the lower efficiency and the red color represents higher efficiency in removing the control parameter turbidity it is possible to highlight some conclusions for sedimentation time of 15 min ph between 5 7 obtained lower efficiency for turbidity removal less than 10 while basic ph obtained values of 40 and acidic ph achieved 60 for ph lower than 5 higher efficiencies have been observed an acidic environment can transfer to the sample higher concentration of hydrogen cations h and can help to destabilize the microalgae cell decreasing the application of the natural coagulant dosage however if the sample has an excess of h cations according to the literature there could be a reversal of the microalgae surface loads and the process could become unfeasible 52 53 flocculation of microalgae biomass is sensitive to ph and the improvement in efficiency can occur with increasing ph the ph for flocculation can vary according to the cell surface properties biomass concentration composition and flocculation time the diagrams show that even without the coagulant addition the effluent turbidity removal was increased at more alkaline solutions flocculation by simply increasing the ph can be an attractive alternative due to its low cost low energy and non toxic to microalgae cells 54 at a basic environment ph above 8 microalgae can auto flocculate this can occur through the consumption of co2 by the photosynthesis process or through the direct addition of bases such as the application of sodium hydroxide leading to ions supersaturation in the sample and allowing the mciroalgae cell walls to serve as a support for the flocculation and ensuring a better interaction with the applied coagulant 55 flocculation kinetics plays an important role in collision and it depends upon both mixing and time with longer sedimentation times the removal efficiency improved achieving more than 70 this can suggest the mixing energy applied 15 min was not enough for the shock between the microalgae cells and the formation of dense flocs at longer sedimentation times 30 and 40 min it was possible to verify the influence of the coagulant dosage on the turbidity removal efficiency where even in higher ph neutral or basic the efficiency is improved with higher dosages of coagulant with best results for coagulant dosage of above 450 mg l 1 at 30 min the efficiency achieved 72 and 55 on ph 3 and 9 respectively while at 40 min the efficiency achieved 85 ph 3 and 81 ph 9 at 40 min there were higher turbidity removal efficiencies due probably to a better interaction of microalgae cells with the applied coagulant or higher interaction between flocs regions more defined in the coagulation diagram were generated what agrees with the literature 46 at this time it was possible to verify high turbidity removal efficiency 74 in neutral ph ph 7 for coagulant dosages higher than 350 mg l 1 for using biomass as fertilizer anything that can change its final characteristics can directly influence its final use thus maintaining the effluent ph neutral can maintain the final biomass characteristics for its application as a fertilizer 56 neutral environments with ph 7 generated less impact in the final characteristics of the biomass and guarantees an adequate recovery of chlorella sorokiniana cells 57 what increases the feasibility of the final material for the application in the agriculture therefore the coagulation ph 7 was fixed for the next steps 3 2 2 mol optimum dosage the results of the experiments to evaluate the optimum mol dosage for removing true color turbidity and reducing optical density tss cod and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are presented in fig 3 the mol seeds demonstrated to be a good natural coagulant and in dosages higher than 425 mg l 1 achieved removal efficiency of turbidity and od superior to 80 maximum of 92 and 93 with 35 and 45 min respectively and color 40 fig 3a the control without mol application showed there is no difference between sedimentation time 14 turbidity and 21 od but when the dosage increases the efficiency is higher at longer sedimentation time it is possible to detect a trend of no incremental efficiency after the concentration of 475 mg l 1 with no significant difference between mol dosages the mol seeds applied as a natural coagulant did not change significantly the color of the final effluent fig 3b even with the application of a concentration of 550 mg l 1 the highest studied dosage previous studies showed that with chemical coagulants aluminum sulfate in higher concentrations 1000 mg l 1 the removal could achieve 90 58 the low efficiencies of removing true color can be explained by the coagulant concentration that was not enough to the rupture of microalgae cells observed by the od ratio 682 540 nm superior to 1 the best results for the removal of total suspended solids were obtained at a concentration of 525 mg l 1 with a reduction above 65 in 35 min of sedimentation fig 3b the concentration of organic matter codtotal presented before the application of mol seeds was 740 mg l 1 the average removal of total cod was between 42 and 63 applying from 425 to 550 mg l 1 of the mol seeds fig 3c from all the dosages evaluated the best efficiency obtained was 500 mg l 1 with 45 min of sedimentation and removal of about 63 of the organic matter present in the effluent after filtration the cod was measured again codfiltered in fig 3c and it was possible to notice the efficiency of 25 with 45 min of sedimentation 425 mg l 1 the efficiency of removing the codfiltered agrees with the literature 59 that the application of mol as a natural coagulant has positive aspects since the organic load added to the effluent through the application of mo seeds did not present significant increase and concentration of the organic matter removed is greater than that added by the seeds the nutrients removals are presented in fig 3d nitrogen measured as tkn removal after the assimilation of nutrients by the microalgae and their separation from effluent was 6 at the control effluent and achieved 62 475 mg l 1 for 35 min what confirmed a good removal nitrogen was the only parameter with better removal efficiency with 35 min of sedimentation than with 45 min but different coagulant doses and sedimentation times did not present significant statistical differences p 0 05 like nitrogen phosphorus is a macronutrient responsible for the growth of microalgae and the dissolved portion orthophosphates is preferred for microalgae biomass 60 the n p ratio for the assimilation of microalgae has great relevance since the low concentration of phosphorus in the effluent can compromise the assimilation of nitrogen and therefore decrease the efficiency in removing nutrients for the microalgae separation step the total phosphorus removal efficiency was from 26 white effluent to 60 475 mg l 1 for 45 min however the coagulant doses and sedimentation times did not show significant difference for the removal of this parameter p 0 05 the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was studied before for scenedesmus sp chlorella sp and synechocystis sp associated with the anaerobic effluent and it was possible to achieve an efficiency of more than 90 in an alkaline environment ph 10 49 the balance of nutrients in the medium and the good assimilation by the microalgae can influence the nutrients recovered in the microalgae separation stage 61 62 in general the dosage of 475 mg l 1 of the mol seeds stood out in relation to the others promoting the good removal of turbidity od true color and tss the nutrient removal showed no significant difference between the mol coagulant doses and the sedimentation times studied p 0 05 some parameters were a little better at higher dosages but considering the saving in coagulant and the significance of improvement the dosage of 475 mg l 1 was defined for further analysis the sedimentation time also demonstrated an impact on removing parameters and an increase in this time from 35 to 45 showed better efficiency in removing the turbidity od and true color therefore it was decided to test the 475 mg l 1 with 60 and 120 min of sedimentation 3 2 3 sedimentation time the experiments with the application of 475 mg l 1 of mol fig 4 showed a clear trend on efficiency being increased by the increase in sedimentation time and after 120 min more than 50 of the turbidity was removed without the mol coagulation addition this means that with this time around 50 of the flocs were harvested by natural coagulation and with the addition of the coagulant 95 removal was achieved therefore a primary decanter could be recommended before applying the mol in order to further reduce the dosage and sludge generation even in the biological treatment where the mineralization of organic compounds is counted on the predominant effect is the flocculation of the material in a colloidal state making it possible to remove it by sedimentation in the primary and secondary decanters the sedimentation times of 60 and 120 min showed no significant difference on removing the parameters turbidity optical density and true color when compared to the efficiencies obtained at 45 min p 0 05 the costs and infrastructure on the sedimentation tanks get bigger and more complex 63 a study using mol and wastewater from nigeria identified much longer sedimentation time 250 min but with a lower amount of added coagulant 150 mg l 1 64 it is important to design the sedimentation process and infrastructure according to the future use of the effluent and biomass and balance it with the costs associated with the process therefore despite the good efficiency with 120 min maintaining the sedimentation step in 45 min presents advantages when compared to the other sedimentation times evaluated throughout this study as it might generate savings in the installation and operation of sedimentation infrastructure 3 2 4 microalgae characterization the biomass with microalgae c sorokiniana and mol collected after the sedimentation and drying process presented ph 10 water content 8 and organic matter 51 the nutrient content in comparison to other organic fertilizers from the literature 61 is presented in table 2 the coagulant mol seeds powder can also contribute to the final biomass amount of nutrients but from the amount of biomass recovered 5 g of biomass per liter of initial effluent from the photobioreactor and only 475 mg l 1 of coagulant and mol elemental composition taken from the literature mol contributes less than the nutrients recovered by the microalgae from the wastewater 65 detailed assessment of the nutrients composition of the coagulant is necessary on future works the average carbon content presented in the biomass of this study 315 g kg 1 agrees with the literature for chlorella sp usually around 300 g kg 1 61 it is in the range of the other organic fertilizers 293 to 475 g kg 1 and complies with the minimum concentration defined for application to the soil and leaf the biomass has a c n ratio of 8 microalgae usually has a c n ratio that ranges from 8 to 11 66 this value is also comparable to other organic fertilizers average of 8 6 according to the sda mapa normative instruction nº 25 2009 the c n shall not exceed 20 for fertilizer classes a b c and d therefore there is a good concentration of nutrients in the microalgae biomass of this study despite the wide range of c n p of commercial organic fertilizers the biomass c n p ratio 16 6 2 1 found in this study is similar to the average c n p found in the 8 organic fertilizers 19 4 2 5 1 the biomass also met the other minimum requirements of secondary macronutrient s ca and mg contents for organic fertilizers defined in the legislation the balance of nutrients supply is essential to optimize the composition and commercialization of microalgae products primary and secondary macronutrients of microalgae biomass were within the limits defined for their application as organic foliar fertilizer decree 4 954 2004 the only value above those defined is the sodium na content excess sodium may be explained by the addiction of swine manure in the composition of bw used in this study excess sodium can contribute to increase soil salinity what restrict permeability and increase osmotic pressure in the soil plant system in this case the management of microalgae biomass applications is required to reduce soil salinization 67 the biomass from this study presented a high concentration of phosphorus potassium and magnesium what are adequate and competitive with the microalgae products available on the market the concentration of presented trace elements especially cu mn and fe is sufficient to supply these microelements to the development of the plant 68 69 through the results the concentrations of macronutrients and trace elements of the biomass are comparable to the concentrations of commercial organic fertilizers brazilian legislation provides different definitions for fertilizers such as wastewater sludge classified as organic compound fertilizer however fertilizers obtained from microalgae biomass have not yet been included by the legislation from previous studies on the use of microalgae as fertilizers spirulina platensis with 78 g kg 1 n 8 g kg 1 p and 16 g kg 1 k had a good performance in plants such arugula in comparison with chemical fertilizers 70 chlorella vulgaris improve root and leaf growth when applied to the soil and when used in the irrigation water was a great sustainable biofertilizer in terms of dry weight and chlorophyll content in rice lettuce cucumber and eggplant crops 71 four species of microalgae tetraselmis sp nannochloropsis sp chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were proved to be an excellent fertilizer for the cultivation of wheat plants after cultivation in domestic wastewater however after harvesting these biomasses an acid solution was used to leach out the ferric chloride absorbed during the coagulation process 72 renuka et al 73 tested one microalgae consortium chlorella scenedesmus chlorococcum and chroococcus sp as fertilizer on wheat crops triticum aestivum l which resulted in improved the plant growth and yield these studies besides highlighting the use potential of microalgae biomass as a sustainable biofertilizer were also able to show that the cultivation conditions and environment can interfere in the final concentration of nutrients in the biomass of microalgae the initial composition of domestic wastewater can differ from social cultural climatic conditions and other aspects in different regions in general microalgae cultivated in domestic wastewater has positive effects regarding their use as organic fertilizers the characteristics of the microalgae produced in this study are in the same range of other organic fertilizers available at the market this points to that the microalgae cultivated in anbw could be used as fertilizer in different crops with higher quality than fertilizers from microalgae produced by chemical hydrolysis and acid conditions 74 furthermore the use of microalgae biomass reduces the risk of eutrophication since organic phosphorus mineralization is slow and its absorption by plants is proportional to its release 75 it is recommended the future tests on plant cultivation in order to identify ideal concentrations for its application as fertilizer while controlling the availability of nutrients to the soil plant system other parameters that could also be evaluated are the uasb and photobioreactors operation conditions as they could influence on the anbw and biomass properties and then in the follow process steps coagulation to sedimentation the potential for fertilizer production from the biomass is a significant advantage when compared to the biomass collected after the use of inorganic coagulant because of its toxicity and as their residues aluminum and iron could remain after treatment in the final product 26 72 application of this biomass on the soil and crops as fertilizer needs to be further studied as well as analyses of the coagulant and the microalgae biomass such as scanning electron microscope sem images and isoelectric point 30 in conjunction and individually after a separation process are recommended to characterized their structure and evaluate its efficiency 4 practical applications the use of mol as a natural coagulant presents advantages in different areas as mol grows in tropical areas 32 the use of this resource for the water and wastewater treatment could have an economical advantage to developing countries where it is cultivated such as brazil malaysia 34 76 and african countries 33 65 mol could replace the use of chemical coagulants such as aluminum based ones what would generate less negative environmental impact with less toxic by products and more biodegradable final biomass residue that could be used as fertilizer to recycling nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus therefore this work presented the potential for the direct application of the applied uasb photobioreactor and mol as coagulant to the wastewater treatment plants in order to close the nutrients water and energy cycles with a high perspective of technical and economical feasible application of this technology in decentralized systems on developing countries 31 77 the work identified the best parameters for the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation steps identifying mol dosage sedimentation time and final biomass characteristics in order to build the knowledge to future work in larger scale 5 conclusions this research highlighted the potential of moringa oleifera lam integral powder as a natural coagulant for harvesting microalgae cultivated in anbw through coagulation flocculation and sedimentation steps tests showed that 475 mg l 1 of mol as coagulant with 45 min for sedimentation 0 17 cm min 1 presented the best efficiency in removing turbidity 93 optical density 90 true color 38 total suspended solids 58 chemical oxygen demand 53 nitrogen 57 and phosphorus 60 considering the feasibility of the project the biomass harvested from the process presented characteristics comparable to other organic fertilizers available at the market and future tests on plant cultivation need to be done to confirm its potential to be applied as fertilizers therefore it is possible to conclude that the nutrients presented in the wastewater can be recovered using mol as coagulant during its treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13741,when coupling wastewater treatment and biofuel production bacteria inevitably compete with microalgae for nutrients and habitat resources yet microalgae utilize symbiotic relationships to mediate adverse effects in unfavorable environments we hypothesized microalgal co culture strategy could be a feasible approach to resist the quorum sensing molecule stress from bacteria here we used two model microalgae taxa chlorella and scenedesmus to compare cell growth and lipid production in mono and co culture conditions under the stress of a representative bacterial signal c6 hsl co culture cultivation reduced growth inhibition by 50 for chlorella and 35 for scenedesmus induced by c6 hsl antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial activities were inhibited by c6 hsl stress in monoculture but they were negligibly affected using the co culture strategy the maximum lipid productivity and production of the co culture system were 0 12 g l d and 0 71 g l respectively and lipid production was 20 79 higher than that of chlorella and scenedesmus monocultures we found that the co culture strategy could efficiently limit bacterial induced competition stress and thus improve microalgae lipid production keywords co culture microalgae quorum sensing molecules lipid production biofuel 1 introduction coupling microalgal biodiesel production with wastewater treatment is a viable alternative for resource recycling and environmental remediation 1 2 microalgae in combination with bacteria is a future development trend which is a cost efficient strategy 3 4 heterotrophic microalgae culture could markedly improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment and lipid production of oleaginous microalgae 5 however bacteria generally grow faster and compete with microalgae for nutrient and living space in heterotrophic conditions 6 in microalgae bacteria symbioses cross kingdom cell to cell communication has recently been identified 7 bacteria release signaling molecules that are sensed by microalgae resulting in the regulation of algae growth and metabolism microalgae also produce some bioactive substances that interfere with the bacterial quorum sensing system 8 acyl homoserine lactones ahls have been shown to mediate communication between microalgae and bacteria 9 ahls have been verified in gram negative bacteria and are linked to population density 10 biofilm formation 11 and bioluminescence intensity 12 ahls inhibit chlorophyta sp growth in initial stages significantly reducing biomass due to key enzymes of dna replication being down regulated 13 microalgae have evolved various responses to defend against ahl stress 14 for instance analogous structure molecules halogenated furanones generated by delisea pulchra could retard bacterial colonization and biofilm formation via interfering with the ahl regulated processes 15 chlamydomonas reinhardtii secrete mimic signal compounds to occupy the lasr binding sites of pseudomonas aeruginosa 16 competition is common among bacteria and microalgae resulting in reductions in biomass and lipid production co culture may be a feasible strategy to address this dilemma as microalgae may display characteristics in co culture that enable them to better cope with adverse conditions 17 multi strain microalgae exhibit better resistance to exogenous predator and environmental stress 17 in co culture the soluble algal products released by haematococcus improve the photosynthetic activity of scenedesmus and the secondary metabolites of scenedesmus are utilized by heterotrophically driven growth of haematococcus 18 the high diversity and density of phytoplankton communities improve stability and defense against predation 19 20 also co cultivation systems could reduce expenditures and save time and energy 21 for instance compared to monoculture biomass and lipid productivity increased significantly when co cultivating chlorella with monoraphidium 22 in a co culture system microbes achieve mutually beneficial cooperation via nutrient exchange bioactive substance stimulation and form microbial symbiotic consortia which have elastic and stability to endure environmental stress 17 18 according to the references we found that ahls caused negative effects on microalgae and microalgae produced synergistic benefits in the co culture system therefore we proposed a hypothesis that co culture may be a feasible strategy to solve the negative effects on microalgae caused by bacterial stress however the performance of the microalgae co culture system with ahls exposure has not been reported until now and the related mechanisms are not clear this study aimed to test the advantages of co culture on microalgal cell synthesis and lipid production with exposure to bacterial signals and consequently explored a co culture strategy to efficiently alleviate bacterial induced competition stress and improve microalgae lipid production chlorella and scenedesmus are microalgae with relatively high lipid content c6 hsl is an important type of quorum sensing signaling molecule and it has been studied in biological wastewater treatment processes 23 24 the co culture system was framed using a logistic approach specifically examining the advantages of co cultivating chlorella and scenedesmus compared to a monoculture system the alleviation of ahl stress and enhancement of lipid accumulation was evaluated moreover we identified the mechanisms based on antioxidant enzymes and cellular morphology analysis this study provided inspiration for enhancing microalgae biomass energy conversion in wastewater treatment with bacterial stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae species and cultivation chlorella regularis fachb 729 and scenedesmus obliquus fachb 416 were obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology in wuhan china the preservation and rejuvenation of the microalgae were conducted according to a previous study 7 to prepare the experimental conditions chlorella and scenedesmus were cultivated under heterotrophic conditions for two generations before ahl exposure

operation details were same to our previous study 30 2 5 antioxidant enzyme activity the microalgae cells in the 4th h were centrifuged at 4 c and 5000 rpm for 10 min tgl 16 m cence china and were washed by sterile phosphate buffer solution pbs 0 02 mm ph 7 4 three times then the collected microalgae pellets were resuspended in pbs and ultrasonicated for 30 min pulsed with 5 s interval under

effects of c6 hsl exposure on microalgal cell growth and lipid production of the mono co culture systems we used an independent samples t test p 0 05 indicated the differences were significant and all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss software package ibm spss statistic 20 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 co culture promoted microalgae growth under the monoculture both chlorella and scenedesmus arrived at the stationary phase on the 4th day and their cell density was 1 9 108 cell ml and 7 4 107 cell ml respectively however when chlorella and scenedesmus were exposed to c6 hsl stress the stationary phase was later and the cell growth was significantly inhibited 50 and 35 p 0 05 respectively fig 2 it worth noting that no significant differences were observed before and after c6 hsl exposure for the co culture system the phenomena indicated the inhibition of cell growth caused by c6 hsl stress was eliminated via the co culture strategy these results indicated chlorella and scenedesmus benefited from synergy effects and resisted the environmental stress scenedesmus exhibited stronger resistance to c6 hsl stress than chlorella in the co culture system to further distinguish resistance ability between chlorella and scenedesmus we examined morphology and competition by logistic curve fitting as shown in fig 3a the cell size of chlorella was 4 6 μm obviously smaller than scenedesmus 10 12 μm scenedesmus cells were wedge shaped and in four cell consortia chlorella cells were dispersed in suspension and cells remained separate the aggregation of scenedesmus may facilitate enduring c6 hsl stress according to the fitting results of a logistic equation fig 3b the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of scenedesmus were 1 05 d and 1 13 108 cell ml respectively about half of chlorella table s1 this suggested scenedesmus is better able to withstand environmental stress similar to findings of a previous report 34 3 2 co culture alleviated ahl stress sod cat and pod are three primary cellular antioxidative enzymes to resist oxidative stress induced by unfavorable environments 35 in monoculture systems the activities of sod cat and pod increased 0 5 2 fold for chlorella and scenedesmus after c6 hsl exposure fig 4 a c also activities rapidly increased and reached a peak at the 4th hour then gradually decreased table s2 s4 the intercellular o2 generally increased when microalgae encountered ahls subsequently cells increased sod activity to avoid oxidative damage sod converts o2 to h2o2 and then it is degraded by cat and pod 36 our data suggested that microalgae were affected by c6 hsl in the monoculture system however when the co culture system exposed to the same c6 hsl stress the activities of sod cat and pod were similar to the normal level of co culture without c6 hsl fig 4a c and these activities maintained a stable level in co culture protocols table s2 s4 this indicated that the co culture strategy alleviated ahl stress the stress tolerance may be attributed to the synergistic mechanism between chlorella and scenedesmus e g the soluble products released by the microalgal consortium possibly interfering with c6 hsl signaling 18 37 therefore a co culture strategy could efficiently counteract the oxidative damage induced by ahls mitochondria provide greater than 95 of the energy for microalgal metabolism for which the activity was evaluated by an mtt assay in mono culture c6 hsl stress decreased the mitochondria activity by 15 and 33 for chlorella and scenedesmus respectively fig 4d the inhibition of mitochondrial activity generally resulted in decreased cell growth and other cell morphological alterations 38 however almost no differences were observed in the co culture system with or without c6 hsl these mtt results were consistent with antioxidative enzyme changes which also suggested the superiority of the co culture strategy chlorella had a normal reproductive pattern in the modified bg11 medium with the number of cell division was decreased after c6 hsl exposure fig 5 a b scenedesmus also showed turgid morphology under c6 hsl stress fig 5c d and this is a detrimental pattern 39 however in the co culture system both chlorella and scenedesmus maintained regular morphology under c6 hsl stress fig 5e f these results further indicated the superiority of the co culture strategy 3 3 co culture enhanced lipid accumulation in the monoculture system c6 hsl stress increased the lipid content of chlorella and scenedesmus by 43 and 30 respectively fig 6 a the glucose and total nitrogen utilization of chlorella decreased by 51 and 24 respectively and these substrate utilizations also decreased in scenedesmus affected by c6 hsl fig 6b the inhibition of nutrient assimilation led to cell growth repression by contrast for the co culture system the total nitrogen and total phosphorus assimilation were not influenced fig 6b with high nutrient assimilation microalgae growth could be maintained at a normal level even with environmental stress and the intracellular protein and lipid accumulation also remained unchanged the co culture promoted the accumulation of protein and lipid and it had stronger resistance to ahl stress these results indicated that microalgal co culture strategy was an effective technique to alleviate negative effects induced by bacteria this approach can be applied in biologic wastewater treatment and high value products in the future in mono culture lipid productivity of chlorella and scenedesmus decreased by 24 86 under c6 hsl stress however these negative effects could be almost eliminated in the co culture system with c6 hsl stress the lipid productivity slightly increased and was 1 fold and 119 fold higher than chlorella and scenedesmus mono systems on the 3rd day fig 7a in the co culture systems lipid productivity and production improved over time 0 12 g l d and 0 71 g l on the 6th day the lipid production was 20 79 higher compared to the monoculture fig 7b these results suggested that the co culture strategy could assist microalgae to resist c6 hsl stress and improve microalgal biofuel production chlorella and scenedesmus mainly produced c16 and c18 fatty acids the saturated fatty acid methyl esters sfames in the co culture system were 14 27 higher than that of the monoculture fig 8 the increase in sfames is preferable for producing biodiesel 40 c6 hsl promoted the sfames accumulation in chlorella and the maximum content of sfames was about 70 however for both the scenedesmus and co culture system there were no observed differences whether c6 hsl addition or not fig 8 these results indicated that the co culture strategy improved the accumulation of saturated fatty acid and the quality of biofuel 3 4 application prospect microalgae is an appropriate feedstock of high value products such as pigments astaxanthin docosahexaenoic acid dha biodiesel etc 41 42 however microalgae are more susceptible to bacterial pollution during microalgae cultivation in this condition microalgae encounter stress from bacteria microalgae cultivation consumed a large amount of water and nutrients which resulted in a high cost of products wastewater is rich in carbon nitrogen and phosphorus a large amount of electricity are consumed during the removal of these nutrients considering the cost efficiency the coupling of microalgae with bacteria is future development trends in both wastewater treatment and biofuel production 43 44 however bacteria grow faster than microalgae and microalgae have to face the stress from bacteria ahls are the typical signaling molecules of gram negative bacteria bacteria sensing the environment and affected other microorganisms this study found that the typical ahls c6 hsl significantly inhibited the growth of chlorella and scenedesmus in mono culture however the negative effects were disappeared in the co culture system it indicated that microalgae co culture strategy improved the defense capability of microalgae which is favorable for microalgae to compete with bacteria and maintain microalgae is dominant in the microalgae bacteria system in addition the microalgae co culture strategy also promoted lipid productivity therefore this study solved the problems that the stress of bacteria resulted in lower performance of the microalgae system these findings are important to the application of the microalgae bacteria system and inspiring the regulating technology of relationships between microalgae and bacteria 4 conclusions this study explored an effective microalgal co culture strategy to minimize the negative effects induced by environmental stress under c6 hsl stress the cell growth was 50 and 35 lower in the mono culture system of chlorella and scenedesmus however microalgal growth was negligibly affected in the co culture system and the cellular morphology was similar to that in conditions without stress the lipid productivity was 1 fold and 119 fold higher than chlorella and scenedesmus in mono culture on the 3rd day the maximum lipid production of the co culture system reached 0 71 g l on the 6th day which was 20 79 higher than that of mono culture antioxidant enzymes and mitochondria activities were inhibited by c6 hsl stress in mono culture but they were generally unchanged when using the co culture strategy this study suggests a promising strategy to improve microalgae lipid conversion in wastewater where bacterial contamination is prevalent declaration of competing interest the

13741,when coupling wastewater treatment and biofuel production bacteria inevitably compete with microalgae for nutrients and habitat resources yet microalgae utilize symbiotic relationships to mediate adverse effects in unfavorable environments we hypothesized microalgal co culture strategy could be a feasible approach to resist the quorum sensing molecule stress from bacteria here we used two model microalgae taxa chlorella and scenedesmus to compare cell growth and lipid production in mono and co culture conditions under the stress of a representative bacterial signal c6 hsl co culture cultivation reduced growth inhibition by 50 for chlorella and 35 for scenedesmus induced by c6 hsl antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial activities were inhibited by c6 hsl stress in monoculture but they were negligibly affected using the co culture strategy the maximum lipid productivity and production of the co culture system were 0 12 g l d and 0 71 g l respectively and lipid production was 20 79 higher than that of chlorella and scenedesmus monocultures we found that the co culture strategy could efficiently limit bacterial induced competition stress and thus improve microalgae lipid production keywords co culture microalgae quorum sensing molecules lipid production biofuel 1 introduction coupling microalgal biodiesel production with wastewater treatment is a viable alternative for resource recycling and environmental remediation 1 2 microalgae in combination with bacteria is a future development trend which is a cost efficient strategy 3 4 heterotrophic microalgae culture could markedly improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment and lipid production of oleaginous microalgae 5 however bacteria generally grow faster and compete with microalgae for nutrient and living space in heterotrophic conditions 6 in microalgae bacteria symbioses cross kingdom cell to cell communication has recently been identified 7 bacteria release signaling molecules that are sensed by microalgae resulting in the regulation of algae growth and metabolism microalgae also produce some bioactive substances that interfere with the bacterial quorum sensing system 8 acyl homoserine lactones ahls have been shown to mediate communication between microalgae and bacteria 9 ahls have been verified in gram negative bacteria and are linked to population density 10 biofilm formation 11 and bioluminescence intensity 12 ahls inhibit chlorophyta sp growth in initial stages significantly reducing biomass due to key enzymes of dna replication being down regulated 13 microalgae have evolved various responses to defend against ahl stress 14 for instance analogous structure molecules halogenated furanones generated by delisea pulchra could retard bacterial colonization and biofilm formation via interfering with the ahl regulated processes 15 chlamydomonas reinhardtii secrete mimic signal compounds to occupy the lasr binding sites of pseudomonas aeruginosa 16 competition is common among bacteria and microalgae resulting in reductions in biomass and lipid production co culture may be a feasible strategy to address this dilemma as microalgae may display characteristics in co culture that enable them to better cope with adverse conditions 17 multi strain microalgae exhibit better resistance to exogenous predator and environmental stress 17 in co culture the soluble algal products released by haematococcus improve the photosynthetic activity of scenedesmus and the secondary metabolites of scenedesmus are utilized by heterotrophically driven growth of haematococcus 18 the high diversity and density of phytoplankton communities improve stability and defense against predation 19 20 also co cultivation systems could reduce expenditures and save time and energy 21 for instance compared to monoculture biomass and lipid productivity increased significantly when co cultivating chlorella with monoraphidium 22 in a co culture system microbes achieve mutually beneficial cooperation via nutrient exchange bioactive substance stimulation and form microbial symbiotic consortia which have elastic and stability to endure environmental stress 17 18 according to the references we found that ahls caused negative effects on microalgae and microalgae produced synergistic benefits in the co culture system therefore we proposed a hypothesis that co culture may be a feasible strategy to solve the negative effects on microalgae caused by bacterial stress however the performance of the microalgae co culture system with ahls exposure has not been reported until now and the related mechanisms are not clear this study aimed to test the advantages of co culture on microalgal cell synthesis and lipid production with exposure to bacterial signals and consequently explored a co culture strategy to efficiently alleviate bacterial induced competition stress and improve microalgae lipid production chlorella and scenedesmus are microalgae with relatively high lipid content c6 hsl is an important type of quorum sensing signaling molecule and it has been studied in biological wastewater treatment processes 23 24 the co culture system was framed using a logistic approach specifically examining the advantages of co cultivating chlorella and scenedesmus compared to a monoculture system the alleviation of ahl stress and enhancement of lipid accumulation was evaluated moreover we identified the mechanisms based on antioxidant enzymes and cellular morphology analysis this study provided inspiration for enhancing microalgae biomass energy conversion in wastewater treatment with bacterial stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae species and cultivation chlorella regularis fachb 729 and

13742,a successful rainwater for drinking rfd system was implemented at ton duc thang university vietnam in technical design uncertainties in water quality were resolved with multiple barriers and it assisted monitoring to maintain safe drinking water from a social perspective the university was the most effective platform for rfd promotion and education further contributions from the beneficiary resolved the lack of a sense of ownership and economic problems by using local labor and materials the results demonstrated the possibility of using rainwater as drinking water allowing it to be promoted for sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation sdg6 achievement keywords drinking water developing countries rainwater for drinking suitability 1 introduction safe drinking water is needed for public health recently it has been reported that approximately 2 1 billion people worldwide are unable to access clean drinking water 1 in developing countries drinking water problems are more serious with larger threats posed for the future due to the lack of a centralized water supply system from the government as well as the lack of an economical and sustainable drinking water approach therefore providing solutions for safe drinking water was proposed and emphasized in the sixth sustainable development goals sdg 6 most projects suggested by the un and donor agencies to supply drinking water are based on the centralized concept which cost a significant amount of time money and effort recently rainwater harvesting rwh has gained interest as a safe water supply option to achieve sdgs 2 6 rwh has been practiced since the beginning of human history 7 and urban rainwater tank systems have undergone a surge in popularity in both developed and developing countries recently to contribute to sustainability objectives including water conservation and local flood control 8 9 there are more than one million households in australian cities now with an rwh system which more than doubled over the period 1994 2010 10 in germany over 1 6 million rwh systems 4 of households have been installed and approximately 50 000 rwh systems are installed every year 11 in sweden the rwh system is installed in large 1 100 dwellings community housing complexes to contribute to the concept of ecologically sustainable development 12 in developing countries such as africa and asia including vietnam the installation of local rwh systems to manage the limited sustainable water supply is being strongly supported by government and non government organizations 13 14 however rainwater has rarely been utilized for drinking purposes especially in urban areas it was reported that while most urban household rwh systems in australia are using it for non drinking uses such as garderning or toilet flushing only around 2 of them used rainwater as drinking water 15 in developed countries of europe and asia the interest in rwh systems has gained momentum and strength due to concerns about local stormwater runoff flooding and water supply hence they are mostly designed as a part of flood mitigation systems and secondarily utilized to supply water for non drinking purposes 16 recent studies on the quality of treated rainwater collected from roadside and parking lots 17 19 also reported the utilization for non drinking purposes such as urban use toilet flushing fire protection and flood control 19 in developing countries of africa and asia even though rainwater for drinking has been promoted pratice is still rare and few projects have been reported to date 20 the main challenges of an rfd system in practice can be addressed in terms of technical social and economic aspects technically inadequate design and poor operation of almost all existing rwh systems cause poor water quality in most rainwater storage tanks 20 socially due to the poor performance of previously failed rwh systems urban society has a poor perception of rainwater as urbanization and lifestyle changes rainwater harvesting is considered to be regressive at times air becomes more polluted in urban areas causing more concerns about rainwater quality 14 as a result the use of rainwater is limited to non drinking purposes in some cities water law in france regulated the use of rainwater for non drinking usage only laundry toilet flushing garden watering etc and has still forbidden such rainwater use for drinking 21 due to the concerns of public health meanwhile in many rural areas of vietnam rainwater has been traditionally utilized for drinking with a simple disinfection method of boiling however there are no regulations or policies on the use of rainwater for drinking so far further the improvement of the technical design usage and maintenance of rainwater for drinking systems is limited or non existent from an economic perspective the initial investment cost is high and the low income of local residents is identified as the main cause of limiting the implementation of rwh 14 in august 2018 we installed a successful rainwater for drinking rfd system at ton duc thang university tdtu located in ho chi minh city vietnam and operated it to supplement good quality drinking water several innovations in technical economic and social perspectives have been applied in implementing the tdtu s rfd project multiple barriers were included in the design of the system to maintain safe drinking water it was used as a model system to monitor water quality and quantity the university was selected as the most effective platform to promote and educate rainwater harvesting through the bits rainwater teacher and student group the construction used local material and labor which reduced the cost of the system and improved the workmanship quality both concerns about the investment cost and sense of ownership could be solved by requesting contributions from the beneficiary tdtu such as the installation room electricity and maintenance this paper presents a successful rfd system and lessons learned from the project to overcome the common barriers in implementing rfd the findings could enhance the application of rwh aiming to achieve

being depleted and varies regionally making it a vulnerable water supply resource 23 furthermore saltwater intrusion has recently become more severe in the mekong river basin influencing agriculture production in many areas 24 it is forecasted that saltwater is intruding deeper and earlier in the period of 2019 2020 in comparison to that in the period of 2015 2016 24 as urbanization and population growth in vietnam resulted in more water consumption and increased pressure on water demand water shortage has increased in recent years 22 in addition most of the water resources are being polluted by uncontrolled discharge of wastewater utilization of pesticides in agriculture and the water transport sector considering that rainwater is causing problems such as seasonal water shortages and floods in some regions the concern for rainwater as a water supply resource has recently gained attention the study site was ton duc thang university located in ho chi minh city the largest city

the roof rainwater flowed through a 500 l first flush diverter for debris removal rainwater was then stored in four separate 1 5 m3 stainless steel tanks each tank worked as a settling tank therefore instead of one big storage tank four smaller continuous storage tanks can significantly enhance the sedimentation effect 31 further it also increases the surface to volume ratio of the storage tank which maximizes the self purification capacity 32 in the storage tank a simple calm inlet with a designed j shaped pipe was installed to keep the sludge layer which consists of fine particulate matter that settled to the bottom of the tank the drain pipes were installed to wash out the sludge manually at intervals determined by the operator finally a simple point of use treatment facility including a filter and uv light was installed near the fountain to treat microorganisms providing safe drinking water rainwater quality was analyzed and compared with the vietnam and who drinking water guidelines as shown in table 1 the test results for both stored rainwater except for microbial organisms and treated rainwater were found to be safe for drinking and can be used to change society s perception of rfd the microbiological contamination in the stored rainwater was caused by bird feces dust and leaves however it was effectively disinfected with the filter and uv light as shown in table 2 these results are in line with those reported in previous studies 2 14 33 confirming that the simple point of treatment including filter and uv light is safe for disinfected rainwater by applying the above nature based solutions rainwater can meet drinking quality without adding any chemicals for treatment thus it does not retain any residues it only requires a small amount of energy for the uv lamp 29 w during operation because rainwater is free and there is no social conflict in using rainwater the rainwater system is sustainable in this study water level and quality inside rainwater tanks are monitored with an it system that can be adopted as an innovation in technical design by monitoring water quality and water levels students and staff empower themselves and their communities to become better water stewards to obtain a conservative operation and a reduction in the number of no water days during the dry season 20 3 1 2 social innovations rfd has been successfully promoted in rural areas 3 due to its advantages most people in rural areas trust rainwater because rwh is a traditional water supply and it is the only possible choice for drinking water in some areas 2 however in contrast most urban residents responded negatively to rainwater in addition because of the widely used centralized water supply system the utilization of rainwater has been negligible in urban areas furthermore urban society seems to consider that using rainwater indicates regression as urbanization and changes in lifestyle progress which poses a challenge for rwh application in practice 33 due to a lack of scientific and engineering knowledge barriers to rainwater for drinking in vietnam have been well reported in technical economic and social terms 14 also emphasized that there is a lack of institutional legal and political input regarding rainwater for drinking these are the main obstacles to promoting rfd in urban areas several innovative social concepts have been applied in implementing the tdtu rfd system first the demonstration project of this study was implemented in the university as a good community based scale project where social interaction among many stakeholders is found therefore the university demonstrated the positive aspects of rfd to quickly promote its benefits to the wider community this presents rfd as a commonly used technology and changes the public s perception of it second the construction used local labor and students in addition the project initiated a group named bits rainwater teacher and student which includes a professor on rwh and research students from tdtu through the group students are trained and involved all stages of the project such as design construction maintenance or conducting research on rwh the involvement of local labor and students can lead to implicit capacity building and technology transfer and provide good working knowledge on rwh this can be beneficial to further promote rwh students who have trained and practiced rwh can become experts and active members of their community and transfer their knowledge to their city in addition considering the previous failures we made the demonstration rfd system aesthetically pleasing through simple drawings by students to enhance the community s positive perception of rainwater harvesting fig 3 further changing social awareness using mass media workshops and meetings on rfd was offered to public officers students and professors and citizens finally the sense of community ownership is still lacking causing the ineffectiveness of the system operation and shortening the system s lifespan almost all parts of the rfd system were supported by the government and other donations without local beneficiary involvement consequently the poor continuous follow up for operation ultimately resulted in system failures the beneficiary tdtu is responsible for continuous operation and maintenance of the rfd system bits students and staff in the university are trained a maintenance manual was produced so that the university could manage or construct additional rfd facilities 3 1 3 economic innovations the main economic concerns of promoting rwh are the high initial investment cost for the residents in the demonstration project the availability of the local material and labor could reduce the initial costs allowing rwh to be more affordable communities can also play a role in increasing the affordability of investing in an rfd system via the involvement of corporate social responsibility csr it has been demonstrated that the donation of a company can be a csr or creating shared value csv to achieve a win win rfd system 20 in the project tdtu agreed to contribute to the installation of the rfd system electricity and maintenance fee for the system the contribution of the local residents would have a great impact on reducing the cost as well as creating a positive community ownership it is expected that community ownership would play its role on decision making process to obtain the successful rfd system outcome especially financial return from the project in addition the community ownership in rfd system can be a key to strengthen the utilization of rainwater or provide a sense of satisfaction in the community by assessing the economic aspect of the rfd system the target beneficiaries would pay the fee with their willingness and allow such projects to be well applied in other regions in particular if rainwater is intended for drinking use its value will be optimized compared to other non drinking purposes for example the university could save 1 2 m3 of drinking water by rainwater per month which is 50 usd in equivalent 3 2 public acceptance the stakeholders opinions i e students lecturers and staff on this system in the sports arena of tdtu are summarized and indicated in table 3 through the surveys and interviews it was shown that people had a positive perception of the rfd project they perceived the demonstration project to be an attractive system and convenient to use the stakeholders were able to directly test the high quality rainwater produced from the system which caused a change in perception to consider rainwater as a drinking water source furthermore managers satisfaction with the project was high in terms of economic benefit as they calculated the amount of money saved from purchasing bottled water the high rate of public acceptance at tdtu is a good example of a successful rfd system allowing it to be promoted to other communities and cities as a feasible tool to obtain sdg6 this successful rfd project outcome would be a good practice to be promoted in developing countries by using rainwater as a safe water source countries which are adapting with decentralized drinking water production can install such rfd system at community based levels i e schools medical centers etc in order to promote rfd in others countries demonstration projects should be well implemented with a high rate of public acceptance also the innovations should be taken into account for the installation of an appropriate rfd system by considering the availabilities of the local materials and labors as well as by sharing the cost with a model of one company one community 1c 1c furthermore the community s participations should be involved to achieve the positive consequences for rfd system implementation 4 conclusions this paper provides a successful case of an rfd system in terms of technical economic and social aspects aiming at promoting the utilization of rainwater for drinking purposes in urban areas technically a well designed rfd system with multiple barriers and it assisted monitoring can ensure good quality of rainwater that is used for drinking from a social perspective universities can be the best place for promotion and education of rainwater for drinking through rainwater teachers and students bits further contributions from the beneficiary can resolve the lack of a sense of ownership and economic problems using local labor and material not only reduces the cost of the system but also improves the quality of workmanship to increase affordability the donation of a company as a cooperative social responsibility csr or creating shared value csv can be an important tool for obtaining a win win

13742,a successful rainwater for drinking rfd system was implemented at ton duc thang university vietnam in technical design uncertainties in water quality were resolved with multiple barriers and it assisted monitoring to maintain safe drinking water from a social perspective the university was the most effective platform for rfd promotion and education further contributions from the beneficiary resolved the lack of a sense of ownership and economic problems by using local labor and materials the results demonstrated the possibility of using rainwater as drinking water allowing it to be promoted for sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation sdg6 achievement keywords drinking water developing countries rainwater for drinking suitability 1 introduction safe drinking water is needed for public health recently it has been reported that approximately 2 1 billion people worldwide are unable to access clean drinking water 1 in developing countries drinking water problems are more serious with larger threats posed for the future due to the lack of a centralized water supply system from the government as well as the lack of an economical and sustainable drinking water approach therefore providing solutions for safe drinking water was proposed and emphasized in the sixth sustainable development goals sdg 6 most projects suggested by the un and donor agencies to supply drinking water are based on the centralized concept which cost a significant amount of time money and effort recently rainwater harvesting rwh has gained interest as a safe water supply option to achieve sdgs 2 6 rwh has been practiced since the beginning of human history 7 and urban rainwater tank systems have undergone a surge in popularity in both developed and developing countries recently to contribute to sustainability objectives including water conservation and local flood control 8 9 there are more than one million households in australian cities now with an rwh system which more than doubled over the period 1994 2010 10 in germany over 1 6 million rwh systems 4 of households have been installed and approximately 50 000 rwh systems are installed every year 11 in sweden the rwh system is installed in large 1 100 dwellings community housing complexes to contribute to the concept of ecologically sustainable development 12 in developing countries such as africa and asia including vietnam the installation of local rwh systems to manage the limited sustainable water supply is being strongly supported by government and non government organizations 13 14 however rainwater has rarely been utilized for drinking purposes especially in urban areas it was reported that while most urban household rwh systems in australia are using it for non drinking uses such as garderning or toilet flushing only around 2 of them used rainwater as drinking water 15 in developed countries of europe and asia the interest in rwh systems has gained momentum and strength

13743,the present study is conducted to synthesize vinasse derived biochar followed by modification with micro and nano mgo in an attempt to assess their effects on the phosphate p removal from aqueous medium based on the characterization results of modified biochars and adsorption capacities nano mgo functionalized ones have proven to be more capable in p removal with the specific surface areas of 119 98 125 41 m2 g and maximum p adsorption capacity of 188 67 mg g the dependencies of adsorption on initial p concentration 50 350 mg l contact time 5 90 min and solution ph level 3 11 were investigated by 20 experiments designed via ccd based rsm the regression analysis showed a good fit of the experimental data to the second order polynomial model with coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 9916 and model f value of 131 82 the optimum conditions of ph 7 00 contact time 75 min and initial p concentration 250 mg l were recorded from desirability function based on the thermodynamic analysis the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic in nature in addition the isotherm and kinetic studies indicated that the freundlich and the pseudo second order are the best fitted models for the p adsorption further the p removal efficiency declined slightly in the presence of other co existed anions while acted relatively selective towards p finally the p loaded biochar could be properly regenerated by 1 0 m hcl solution and the pot experiments proved its applicability as a p fertilizer substitute increasing the plant growth rate averagely the height by 40 and the dry mass by 59 keywords phosphate adsorption vinasse biochar ccd rsm nano mgo particles functionalization fertilizer 1 introduction environmental contamination has attracted a lot of attention among which water pollution is considered as its main type which is threatening the environment plants humans as well as all other living organisms such environmental contamination takes place mainly due to toxic substances being discharged in waterbodies 1 4 eutrophication or hypertrophication is a major global water quality problem jeopardizing the aquatic ecosystem threatening human health and impairing the self purification capacity of water 5 6 the level of p in a waterbody is the controlling factor in eutrophication 7 unfortunately about 1 3 million tons of p is discharged into the environment every year through different sources around the world agricultural over application of fertilizers pigment formulation detergent production mineral processing in addition to other human activities are the main sources of p species including h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 h p o 4 2 and p o 4 3 in aquatic systems 8 9 the conventional methods for the p remediation in water consist of bioelectrochemistry adsorption catalytic reduction electrocoagulation membrane and biological processes 10 11 among the aforementioned methods adsorption has become the most promising one which has been widely applied due to its high selectivity removal performance apparatus simplicity and economic privileges 4 12 16 a suitable adsorbent should benefit from cost effective production sources high pore volume and surface area specific chemical functionalities fast intraparticle diffusion excellent performance eco friendliness and desorption capability 17 18 so far various materials such as metal oxides 19 layered double hydroxides 20 mesoporous silicates 21 and carbonaceous materials 22 24 have been investigated as adsorbents in removing pollutant from contaminated waters recently biochar as a carbon rich material derived from renewable biomass or waste has received a lot of attentions as an economic and ecofriendly adsorbent for p recovery 25 27 in addition to these positive aspects the p loaded biochar can be reused as a slow release fertilizer for increasing crop productivity and soil nutrients 28 vinasse is the voluminous final by product of the biomass distillation mainly for the ethanol production from starch sugar crops or lignin cellulose e g wheat straw corn stover sugarcane sugarbeet and sugarcane molasses 29 30 the properties of vinasse mainly depend on the operational conditions during the alcohol production and raw materials 31 potential biochar obtained from vinasse not only could be considered as a treatment for this industrial waste but rather is able to recover its valuable potassium magnesium and calcium elements some studies have focused on the synthesis of biochar from vinasse by examining its soil modifying performance in runoff and soil loss control 32 33 biochars have a limited removal capability for anionic contaminants such as p 34 35 during the last decade attempts have been made to enhance this adsorption capability of biochars through developing and modifying their properties via chemical and physical treatments metal oxide incorporated materials have gained great attention as novel adsorbents for contaminant removal in wastewater treatment 36 37 so far a range of synthesizing techniques have been developed for fabricating metal oxide the most used and reported metals are ferric 38 aluminum 39 lanthanum 40 calcium 41 and magnesium 42 incorporated biochars including biomass pre treatment by metal salt saturating the biochar with metal cations target element enrichment by bio accumulation and metal oxide nanoparticles infusion after pyrolysis 43 45 magnesium is considered a suitable metal for modifying the adsorbent and enhancing its p removal ability due to its non toxicity and wide availability mgo modified biochars have superior adsorption performance towards aqueous p several researchers evaluated the impregnation of biochar with magnesium to improve p adsorption for instance li et al 46 fabricated a novel magnetic adsorbent by impregnating mgo into biochar which revealed a remarkable removal efficiency for p in addition zhang et al 47 incorporated mgo nano flakes into biochar matrix and found that this porous nanocomposite could remove p from water further kamali et al 48 compared three pyrolysis temperatures and found 800 ºc as the best one for vinasse derived biochar vb they proved that the modification with calcined dolomite could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of the biochar other studies in this field endorsed the important role of mgo particles in the p removal from contaminated waters 26 previous studies mainly focused on loading mgo on solid materials to boost the adsorption capacity while the present study pinpointed nano and micro mgo formation on vb via novel functionalization methods which were not previously introduced in p recovery and vinasse modification as well as comparing their impacts on vb characteristics and capacities equally important the proposed method is not only could be considered as a treatment of vinasse but also converts this industrial waste to a valuable p adsorbent recovers it as a potential fertilizer and saves waterbodies from eutrophication in the present study vb was modified by different rations of micro and nano mgo to achieve new adsorbents for p removal the formation of composites and the uptake of p species by mgo modified carbonaceous materials were investigated and confirmed by different characterization methods such as edx and mapping analysis fesem xrf xrd ftir and n2 isotherm analyses conditions of adsorption experiments were optimized by rsm 1 1 rsm response surface methodology the equilibrium process of which was evaluated by isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies further regeneration desorption and pot experiments were conducted to discover the reusability and fertilizing capability of the prepared carbonaceous adsorbent finally the impacts of competing anions during p removal were studied along with comparing the adsorption capacity of developed functionalized biochar with the recently published studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 vinasse derived biochar vb pyrolysis the vb sample was synthesized through pyrolysis where condensed vinasse from ethanol industry located in northwest of iran was used as the biomass feedstock fig 1 a and b before synthesizing the vb the condensed vinasse was fully oven dried at 80 ºc for 12 h the resulting solid was crushed and denoted as dried v in order to convert the dried v to biochar a slow pyrolysis process was conducted in a horizontal electric furnace with a quartz tubular reactor model tf5 40 by azar furnace iran fig 1 c for a typical synthesis dried v was placed in a tube furnace with a programmed controller raising the inside temperature of the reactor to 800 ºc at a rate of 10 ºc min the pyrolysis occurred at 800 ºc for 1 h to obtain the best p adsorptive potency fig 1 d the condition of which was already explained in the previous study 48 after rinsing with deionized water the remaining biochar was oven dried at 70 ºc for 5 h 2 2 synthesis of vb modified by micro mgo mm the magnesium nitrate hexahydrate mg no3 2 6h2o sigma aldrich solution was prepared by dissolving the desired amounts of mg no3 2 6h2o in 20 ml of deionized water the dried v 50 mg was dispersed into the resulting solution for 3 h and then mixture of mg no3 2 6h2o and dried v solution was fully dehydrated in an oven at 80 ºc for 12 h further a solid obtained product was pyrolyzed at 800 ºc for 1 h under n2 flow

clear solution then 2 g of mg no3 2 6h2o was dissolved in the 10 ml of the above pvp solution subsequently 2 5 ml of aqueous ammonium hydroxide 25 wt sigma aldrich was added dropwise at 25 ºc to the mixture under vigorous stirring with careful ph adjustment to 10 5 finally the resulting particles were collected via centrifugation washed fully with a mixture of etoh deionized water and oven dried at 80 ºc for 10 h to modify vb by the prepared nano mgo different amounts of the obtained nano particles and dried v 50 mg were dissolved into 20 ml deionized water after mixing at 25 ºc for 3 h the suspension was kept in an oven at 80 ºc for 10 h until the supernatant evaporated and subsequently air dried for 1 h then the resulting precipitate was pyrolyzed in the furnace at 800 ºc under n2 flow for 1 h after the pyrolysis the obtained solids were named as vb nm 10 vb nm 20 and vb nm 30 for 10 20 and 30 mg of the nanoparticles used respectively 2 4 characterizations n2 adsorption desorption

tescan dynatom czech republic and xrf analysis was performed by a spectrometer pw1404 by philips netherlands 2 5 adsorption studies the adsorption capacity of the synthesized carbonaceous materials

ml of p solution and 0 01 g of adsorbent in addition the effect of temperature was also evaluated at 25 k intervals from 298 to 348 k it is worth noting that ph adjustment was conducted using either hcl 1 m or naoh 1 m the absorbance of the residual p was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 by shimadzu japan the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g p removal percentage and

entropy δs and standard enthalpy δh are regarded as two important thermodynamic criteria estimated by using eq 8 8 ln k d δ s r δ h r t further the isotherms models are used to describe interface adsorption which is a chemical and physical phenomenon by the interactions between solid and liquid phase among the many isotherms available freundlich eq 9 langmuir eq 10 and d r eq 11 models were considered in this study 49 9 l n q e ln k f 1 n l n c e 10 c e q e 1 k l q m 1 q m c e 11 l n q e ln q d r k d r ε 2 where kf and n indicate the freundlich constants attributed to adsorption capacity

the methods proposed in the previous studies 55 56 two different tests were conducted to represent the p recovery potency of the functionalized adsorbent the release in aqueous phase and the pot experiment the aqueous release test was conducted at three ph levels 5 6 and 7 indicating the percentage of adsorbed p released in the deionized water 56 specifically 0 01 g of the best adsorbent after adsorption vb nm 30 p was separated from the solution oven dried for 10 h at 85 c added to 20 ml deionized water and shaken in a stirrer at three aforementioned ph levels for 12 h and eventually separated from the solution the ratio of p detected in deionized water to the previously adsorbed amount was reported as the release capability of the adsorbent further the pot experiment test as proposed in previous studies 55 57 was conducted to assess the performance of p loaded adsorbent as a possible substitution for p fertilizer briefly 11 grass seeds were planted in two different pots containing 1 kg of the same soil texture further 3 0 g of p loaded adsorbent was completely mixed in one of the pots while the another one was kept as a blank soil samples were obtained from a greenhouse surface dried in air for two days and sieved before using in the pot experiment after planting the seeds the pots were kept in the same greenhouse with controlled humidity 54 68 and temperature 18 23 c after 60 days the plants heights above the soil and their dry masses were measured and reported based on the procedures developed by creech et al 58 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized vb adsorbents the structures of the carbonaceous adsorbents were identified by n2 adsorption desorption xrd ftir fesem edx and xrf methods the porosity and bet surface area of the original and modified vb materials were assessed using n2 isotherm analysis table 3 indicates the sbet ap and vtotal of the synthesized samples before and after p adsorption the introduction of mgo greatly changed the textural properties of the vb sample compared with vb the sbet ap and vtotal of vb mm 10 decreased from 128 21 to 103 26 m2 g 1 65 to 1 50 nm and 0 32 to 0 24 cm3 g respectively a reduction occurred in the textural properties of the modified adsorbents by increasing micro mgo loading ratio which is related to the blocking of some pores on the vb surface compared with vb nm 10 the higher textural parameters can be related to the loading of nanosized mgo these reductions in textural properties have also been reported by a previous study focused on mgo decorated magnetic biochar 46 after p adsorption the surface properties decreased due to the partial coverage of p ions on the surface and pores of vb nm 30 the structural reorganization of synthesized vb materials was confirmed by xrd studies fig 2 as shown the xrd patterns of carbonaceous samples indicated several peaks revealing the presence of mineral crystals in addition the xrd spectra of mgo modified samples showed the mgo peaks at 2θ positions of 37 3 43 5 62 6 74 8 and 78 7 which correspond to the crystal plates of 111 200 220 311 and 222 respectively 59 further the xrd pattern of mgo modified samples is consistent with xrd data for mg accumulated tomato tissues reported by yao et al 60 and mgo impregnated biochar reported by li et al 59 based on the results of xrd analysis the intensities of the mgo diffraction peaks of vb nm 30 p decreased compared to the vb nm 30 before adsorption further ft ir was analyzed to examine the functional groups related to unmodified and mgo modified vb materials fig 3 the main functional groups listed at around 880 1250 1407 1640 and 3450 cm 1 are ascribed to the aromatic c h vibration co stretching vibration ch2 and ch3 groups cc aromatic ring stretching and coh linkages respectively the absorption peaks appearing between 450 and 520 cm 1 are attributed to the mg o bending vibrations in mgo modified vb materials the characteristic peaks at approximately 1125 cm 1 represent the vibrations of mg o these peaks are in a good agreement with the results obtained by fang et al 61 and give further evidence for the effective modification of biochar by mgo nanoparticles new peaks at the wavelengths of 620 and 1050 cm 1 are related to the bending vibrations of p species appeared after p uptake compared with vb nm 30 the microstructures and morphologies of the synthesized vb materials were explored by fesem fig 4 displays the particle size and surface morphology of the unmodified and mgo modified samples the vb sample showed almost homogeneous particles based on the fesem micrograph vb mm materials were identified to have irregular shapes with an average diameter of 20 μm further the surface morphology of vb nm materials was smooth compared with that of vb mm materials demonstrating the agglomeration of small particles furthermore vb nm samples were relatively semispherical with an average size smaller than 50 nm finally the edx spectra affirmed the presence of mg ca k o and c in the synthesized vb samples the surface morphology and element dispersion of the vb nm 30 after p adsorption are presented in fig 4 based on the results the morphology of the vb nm 30 remained unchanged even after the p uptake in addition elemental distributions were evaluated by edx element mapping analysis regarding the mapping images in fig 4 it is clearly found that p and all metal species spread homogeneously over the vb nm 30 p the results are consistent with those of haddad et al 62 which studied the removal of p from aqueous media by magnesium pretreated cypress sawdust table 4 reports the inorganic composition of the biochar samples as shown modification with mgo increased mg contents 3 2 p adsorption assessment by vb biochars fig 5 displays the adsorption isotherms of p uptake by the mgo modified and unmodified samples as shown mgo modified nanocomposites demonstrated a better adsorption capacity for p than the pristine one in general the pristine biochar surface is negatively charged and rarely adsorbs the negatively charged p the enhanced removal of p by the mgo modified samples is probably due related to the presence of nano and micro particles on their surface which has a high affinity to attach p in aqueous media the potential of mgo particles to adsorb p from aqueous solutions was demonstrated in some scientific reports 63 64 several factors are important for controlling p adsorption by mgo modified materials including the amount and distribution of mgo in the adsorbent surface as well as morphology and size of mgo particles as shown in fig 5 p adsorption decreases by increasing micro mgo content on vb mm while the removal capacities increase by the increasing the presence of nano mgo on vb nm moreover all vb mm composites show a decrease in the sbet vtotal and ap table 3 such a significant decrease in their textural properties is due to partial and or full blockage of the vb pores caused by the mgo particles based on the above mentioned issues the content higher ratio of mgo particles and morphology nano sized particles were considered as the key features for a better adsorptive removal of p and the vb nm 30 was selected as a suitable adsorbent for further investigations the p removal by mgo particles is attributed to the coupled effect of surface complexation and electrostatic attraction fig 6 mgo particles become hydroxylated when they contact with water which induces either a positive or negative charge depending on the ph of the solution the mgo particles are expected to have a positive charge in most natural aqueous systems due to their high point of zero charge pzc pzcmgo 12 65 on the other hand p can exist in the form of h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 h p o 4 2 and p o 4 3 respectively at ph ranges of 2 2 7 7 12 5 and 12 the various formation of aqueous p under the acidic and basic conditions is given in the following equations 19 h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 h p k a1 2 16 20 h 2 p o 4 hp o 4 2 h p k a2 7 20 21 hp o 4 2 p o 4 3 h p k a3 10 3 clifford 66 reported that between phs of 5 and 12 h 2 p o 4 and h p o 4 2 predominate over p o 4 3 species when the ph value of the adsorption solution is lower than the pzcmgo negatively charged p species can be electrostatically attracted by the hydroxylated mgo mgoh to form mononuclear and polynuclear complexes precipitation takes place between p species and mgo particles on carbon surfaces within the matrix when ph increased and reaction continued leading to the formation of mghpo4 and mg h2po4 2 components 3 3 optimization of p removal using vb nm 30 by rsm rsm involves a set number of designed experiments to attain a response using a limited number of trials it is a statistical technique which is appropriate for multi factor experiments and gives the relationship between various parameters for optimal operation conditions the three main steps involved in this process include experimental design modelling and optimization the collected results were embedded into the quadratic polynomial equation via regression analysis in the rsm based ccd model the obtained equation in terms of the coded parameters is presented as follows 22 qe 124 40 3 11 a 16 99 b 21 22 c 4 23 ab 0 90 ac 8 68 bc 19 54 a2 34 13b2 11 32 c2 where qe shows removal capacity mg g a indicates ph b shows p initial concentration mg l and c is considered as time min the anova indicates whether the response surface quadratic model developed is statistically suitable for representing the process of p adsorption on vb nm 30 within the studied range the adequacy table 5 of the models was justified by the anova generally the significance of regression models is justified by the larger f values very small p values insignificant lack of fit and high values of r2 predicted r2 and adjusted r2 according to data analysis a quadratic model equation was obtained with the anova data provided in table 6 the polynomial model was analyzed by anova presenting data including high fisher test value f value 131 82 insignificant lack of fit 1 94 very low probability value p value 0 0001 as well as high values for coefficient of r squared r2 0 9916 predicted r squared pre d r 2 0 8479 adjusted r squared adj r2 0 9841 and the adequate precision 32 93 for p removal on vb nm 30 3 4 influence of variables via response surface the interactions between three independent factors on the dependent variable qe can be evaluated by response surface 3 dimensional 3d plots fig 7 solution ph is the main factor which controls the p adsorption at the solid liquid interface the ph of solution determines the form of the major species of p and affects the strength of electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion the p uptake by vb nm 30 at different initial ph in the range of 3 11 and the corresponding equilibrium ph are shown in fig 7 as displayed the removal efficiency of vb nm 30 increased when ph raised from 3 0 to 7 0 and remained stable when ph increased to 9 0 afterward the p removal dropped gradually until the ending stage of ph growth the poorer removal of the p at higher ph may be related to the higher concentration of oh which can compete with p oxyanions and react with the mgo nanoparticles the same trends were found in the literature for the p adsorption on aluminum manganese bimetal oxide 67 lanthanum doped activated carbon fiber 68 and al modified biochar 69 fig 7 a displays the variation of p adsorption by vb nm 30 as a function of initial concentration as shown adsorption increased by increasing the initial concentration of adsorbate and the equilibrium curves indicated a slow upward trend when the initial concentration is close to 250 mg l which is attributed to the fact that the mass transfer force of p between the vb nm 30 and solution is improved by increasing the initial concentration the contact time of the adsorbate and absorbent greatly affects the efficiency of the adsorption process significantly in addition in the practical application of absorbents the contact time directly reflects the economic efficiency of the process which is related to the adsorption kinetics as displayed in fig 7 b the adsorption is rapid in the first 40 min while adsorption equilibrium is achieved at 75 min the rate of p removal was higher at the beginning of the adsorption experiment due to a great number of available active sites on the surface of vb nm 30 the optimum levels of three parameters for maximum p uptake were found as contact time 75 min initial ph of solution 7 00 and initial p concentration 250 mg l 3 5 thermodynamic isothermal and kinetic results the effects of temperature on the adsorption can be evaluated by the assessing the thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic analysis was conducted at three temperatures t 298 323 and 348 k under constant conditions the estimated values of δh δs and δg are listed in table 7 as shown the removal efficiency of vb nm 30 decreases by increasing the temperature since the adsorption is an exothermic process δh 0 the δs 0 indicates an increase in randomness at the solid water interface during the uptake of p as shown in table 7 the δg 0 at different temperatures indicates that the adsorption of p onto the prepared adsorbent is feasible and spontaneous the adsorption isotherm of vb nm 30 was investigated in an effort to evaluate the adsorption capacity versus p concentration table 8 indicates in the fitted model parameters and their coefficient of determination r2 by comparing the r2 of the adsorption model fitted by the experimental data freundlich model showed more compatibility than d r and langmuir based on the results the vb nm 30 surface may contain adsorption sites with various energies in fact heterogeneous adsorption surface and multilayer adsorption occurred on the active sites located on the surface 70 the essential feature of a langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant equilibrium parameter or separation factor rl rl 1 1 klc0 which is used to predict the favorability of an adsorption system for a favorable adsorption process the rl value lies between 0 and 1 in this study the rl values for p uptake ions on to vb nm 30 lie within 0 and 1 indicating that p uptake on the prepared sample is a favorable process this finding has also been validated by the n value of the freundlich model which is in the range of 1 10 the e 8 kj mol indicates physical and 8 e 16 kj mol represents chemical adsorption the e value is 8 kj mol suggesting that the uptake of p on the vb nm 30 was chemical adsorption according to the langmuir isotherms the qm for vb nm 30 in p removal is 188 67 mg g table 9 compares the maximum capacities of some other adsorbents reported in the recent literatures with the result of the present research to further study the rate controlling mechanism in the process of adsorption five kinetic models were employed to fit the experimental data the kinetic rate constants of the pseudo first and pseudo second order particle diffusion intra particle diffusion and elovich equations for the vb nm 30 are listed in table 10 the r2 comparison of pseudo first order and second order 0 9955 versus 0 9994 demonstrates that the pseudo second order could offer a better modelling on the p adsorption further the r2 of intraparticle diffusion 0 9786 was less than that of the pseudo second order model revealing that diffusion in the adsorbate adsorbent interface is not a limiting parameter for the rate of uptake 3 6 influence of adsorbent dosage on p adsorption the dose of the adsorbent can significantly influence the removal process obtaining an optimum dose is essential for maximizing the interactions between p ions and adsorptive sites of the vb nm 30 the optimum dose of adsorbent can be obtained by comparing the adsorption capacity at different dosages of vb nm 30 ranging from 0 01 to 0 03 g in 20 ml of 250 mg l p solution fig 8 as illustrated the adsorption capacity decreased by increasing the dosage from 0 01 to 0 03 g as a result of remained unsaturated adsorptive sites hence the vb nm 30 dosage in adsorption experiments was selected as 500 mg l 3 7 influence of interfering anions on p adsorption in general different types of inorganic anions such as h c o 3 f n o 3 c l s o 4 2 and c o 3 2 are present in contaminated waters and these inorganic ions may interfere with the adsorption of p on prepared adsorbent 77 79 81 87 89 the effect of inorganic anions was investigated by keeping 250 mg l as initial p concentration 250 mg l of other inorganic anions and other factors time ph and temperature as constant the results of p adsorption in the presence of interfering anions are shown in fig 9 as shown the presence of h c o 3 f n o 3 and c l anions showed no significant influence without causing a considerable reduction on p removal efficiency however the introduction of s o 4 2 and c o 3 2 anions suppressed the adsorption capacities of p significantly the presence of s o 4 2 and c o 3 2 affected the p uptake more due to their higher negative charges than compared to h c o 3 f n o 3 and c l 3 8 biochar regeneration results hcl 1 0 m was selected to desorb p from the vb nm 30 p with the efficiency of recycled adsorbent at consecutive adsorption desorption cycles fig 10 the cl ions in hcl solution were replaced with p in the vb nm 30 p within 75 min of contact time from 0 01 g of the used adsorbent about 81 of adsorption performance was retained in the seventh adsorption desorption cycle and vb nm 30 still acted as an effective adsorbent for p recovery 3 9 results of recovery experiment p adsorption and desorption are functions of the solution ph the release test described in the methods was conducted on three different occasions for each ph level with the reported average values based on the experimental data illustrated in fig 11 c with the reduction of ph of the solution from 7 to 5 the percentage of p released from vb nm 30 p in the deionized water increased from 8 to 31 this finding is in line with that of the previous studies indicating that p adsorbed by cations could be released at lower ph levels 61 91 a pot experiment was conducted as described in the method section to capture the possible effects of p loaded adsorbent on plant growth and demonstrate its capability as a fertilizer substitution the harvested plants are displayed in fig 11 a and b as shown above and by comparing the heights and dry masses it is understood that the p loaded adsorbent vb nm 30 p had a remarkable result on plant growth and increased the height by 40 and dry mass by 59 on average these results demonstrated that the developed modified biochar was successful in p recovery as an uptakeable element and had a tangible performance on the grass the improvement in the plant growth was related to p loaded on the developed adsorbent as well as the relatively high amount of potassium element in the biochar structure pyrolyzed from vinasse 3 10 practical applications the use of biochar has various positive impacts on the environment particularly on water and soil preservation and greenhouse gas emission control one of the major drivers of its application is attributed to the achieved tangible reductions in greenhouse gas emission reported by life cycle inventory studies 92 93 in addition biochar application could bring fertility back to the soil 94 and enrich it with carbon and microbial biomass 95 96 which results in increasing the crop yield some studies focused on the long term effects and confirmed that adding pyrolyzed bio materials could reinforce the structural properties of the soil resulting in holding capacity augmentation of water and moisture therefore biochars could serve during water stress periods helping in stabilization the resources 97 sadeghi et al endorsed the structural amendments which vinasse biochar could bring to the soil and detected its benefits on runoff control extending the time by 55 and diminishing the runoff volume by 98 and controlling the soil loss 33 in order to have an assessment on economic and practical aspects of proposed methodology in p recovery to the industrial or commercial levels the following terms and conditions that should be evaluated in the targeted region simultaneously 1 the presence of ethanol industries resulting in abundant disposal of its waste vinasse due to underlying economic geopolitical and environmental reasons there have been worldwide attempts to reduce the use of fossil fuels among the potential alternative sources of energy ethanol has been the focus of much attention in addition to fuel and beverages there is always a traditional demand for ethanol as a source of raw material in chemical and cosmetic manufacturing the production of this effluent is expected to rise with an expected perspective of 1742 bli 3 3 bli billion liters produced in 2024 98 hence vinasse as a hazardous waste should be treated and disposed safely 99 2 the importance of p fertilizer in the specific region p fertilizer is an essential element in agriculture however its availability accessibility in conjunction with societal dependency on agriculture vary in different regions 91 3 protecting waterbodies from eutrophication p is considered as the controlling factor in eutrophication crisis leading to the destruction of water quality 37 as such it should be monitored and treated carefully 4 positive environmental effects of biochar application as explained in life cycle impact of biochar it has numerous healing effects on soil water and global warming moreover biochar could minimize the chemical fertilizer demand and bring the fertility back to the soil 96 5 biochar as the by product of bio oil production from a biomass vinasse bio oil production from vinasse through pyrolysis process has attracted a lot of attention in a recent study 100 the proposed method can also be a proper choice for developing countries with a huge volume of ethanol production for instance in india according to the report provided by usda fas 4 4 usda fas united states department of agriculture foreign agricultural service ethanol production was expected to be about 3000 mli 5 5 mli million liters in 2019 101 usda fas has also reported the annual ethanol production for some other developing countries such as peru 127 mli 102 vietnam 180 mli 103 bolivia 380 mli planned for the year 2025 104 philippines 222 mli 105 and indonesia 200 mli 106 such a huge appetite for ethanol leads to massive generation of vinasse which is 11 15 times greater than the ethanol produced during the fermentation of molasses most developing countries depend on agriculture as a primary source of income and economic stability which the p fertilizer accessibility is a central necessity saving the environment most importantly waterbodies from eutrophication and soil from erosion is a serious matter discussed in great details for developing countries such as india ethiopia cambodia vietnam philippines and indonesia in a recent studies 107 finally vb could be considered as a by product of bio oil production from vinasse during pyrolysis 100 and economic aspects of the obtained bio oil could make this recovery more attractive and affordable for the developing countries 4 conclusions nano and micro mgo modified vbs were synthesized through a set of treatments based on the high efficiency and low cost of vb and the p intense affinity for mgo the vb nms performed more effectively in p removal than vb mms the adsorption capacity of the vb nm improved by increasing the loaded mgo the vb samples were characterized by different methods the impacts of the experimental parameters on vb nm 30 adsorption capacity were evaluated by rsm ccd based on the results of thermodynamic study the nature of p removal was proven to be spontaneous and endothermic further the experimental equilibrium data were perfectly fitted to freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models finally the vb nm 30 exhibited excellent selectivity towards p in the presence of the commonly coexisting anionic species the adsorbed p could be almost completely desorbed by hcl solution and vb nm 30 p could act as a fertilizer substitute boosting the crop yield funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13743,the present study is conducted to synthesize vinasse derived biochar followed by modification with micro and nano mgo in an attempt to assess their effects on the phosphate p removal from aqueous medium based on the characterization results of modified biochars and adsorption capacities nano mgo functionalized ones have proven to be more capable in p removal with the specific surface areas of 119 98 125 41 m2 g and maximum p adsorption capacity of 188 67 mg g the dependencies of adsorption on initial p concentration 50 350 mg l contact time 5 90 min and solution ph level 3 11 were investigated by 20 experiments designed via ccd based rsm the regression analysis showed a good fit of the experimental data to the second order polynomial model with coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 9916 and model f value of 131 82 the optimum conditions of ph 7 00 contact time 75 min and initial p concentration 250 mg l were recorded from desirability function based on the thermodynamic analysis the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic in nature in addition the isotherm and kinetic studies indicated that the freundlich and the pseudo second order are the best fitted models for the p adsorption further the p removal efficiency declined slightly in the presence of other co existed anions while acted relatively selective towards p finally the p loaded biochar could be properly regenerated by 1 0 m hcl solution and the pot experiments proved its applicability as a p fertilizer substitute increasing the plant growth rate averagely the height by 40 and the dry mass by 59 keywords phosphate adsorption vinasse biochar ccd rsm nano mgo particles functionalization fertilizer 1 introduction environmental contamination has attracted a lot of attention among which water pollution is considered as its main type which is threatening the environment plants humans as well as all other living organisms such environmental contamination takes place mainly due to toxic substances being discharged in waterbodies 1 4 eutrophication or hypertrophication is a major global water quality problem jeopardizing the aquatic ecosystem threatening human health and impairing the self purification capacity of water 5 6 the level of p in a waterbody is the controlling factor in eutrophication 7 unfortunately about 1 3 million tons of p is discharged into the environment every year through different sources around the world agricultural over application of fertilizers pigment formulation detergent production mineral processing in addition to other human activities are the main sources of p species including h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 h p o 4 2 and p o 4 3 in aquatic systems 8 9 the conventional methods for the p remediation in water consist of bioelectrochemistry adsorption catalytic reduction electrocoagulation membrane and biological processes 10 11 among the aforementioned methods adsorption has become the most promising one which has been widely applied due to its high selectivity removal performance apparatus simplicity and economic privileges 4 12 16 a suitable adsorbent should benefit from cost effective production sources high pore volume and surface area specific chemical functionalities fast intraparticle diffusion excellent performance eco friendliness and desorption capability 17 18 so far various materials such as metal oxides 19 layered double hydroxides 20 mesoporous silicates 21 and carbonaceous materials 22 24 have been investigated as adsorbents in removing pollutant from contaminated waters recently biochar as a carbon rich material derived from renewable biomass or waste has received a lot of attentions as an economic and ecofriendly adsorbent for p recovery 25 27 in addition to these positive aspects the p loaded biochar can be reused as a slow release fertilizer for increasing crop productivity and soil nutrients 28 vinasse is the voluminous final by product of the biomass distillation mainly for the ethanol production from starch sugar crops or lignin cellulose e g wheat straw corn stover sugarcane sugarbeet and sugarcane molasses 29 30 the properties of vinasse mainly depend on the operational conditions during the alcohol production and raw materials 31 potential biochar obtained from vinasse not only could be considered as a treatment for this industrial waste but rather is able to recover its valuable potassium magnesium and calcium elements some studies have focused on the synthesis of biochar from vinasse by examining its soil modifying performance in runoff and soil loss control 32 33 biochars have a limited removal capability for anionic contaminants such as p 34 35 during the last decade attempts have been made to enhance this adsorption capability of biochars through developing and modifying their properties via chemical and physical treatments metal oxide incorporated materials have gained great attention as novel adsorbents for contaminant removal in wastewater treatment 36 37 so far a range of synthesizing techniques have been developed for fabricating metal oxide the most used and reported metals are ferric 38 aluminum 39 lanthanum 40 calcium 41 and magnesium 42 incorporated biochars including biomass pre treatment by metal salt saturating the biochar with metal cations target element enrichment by bio accumulation and metal oxide nanoparticles infusion after pyrolysis 43 45 magnesium is considered a suitable metal for modifying the adsorbent and enhancing its p removal ability due to its non toxicity and wide availability mgo modified biochars have superior adsorption performance towards aqueous p several researchers evaluated the impregnation of biochar with magnesium to improve p adsorption for instance li et al 46 fabricated a novel magnetic adsorbent by impregnating mgo into biochar which revealed a remarkable removal efficiency for p in addition zhang et al 47 incorporated mgo nano flakes into biochar matrix and found that this porous nanocomposite could remove p from water further kamali et al 48 compared three pyrolysis temperatures and found 800 ºc as the best one for vinasse derived biochar vb they proved that the modification with calcined dolomite could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of the biochar other studies in this field endorsed the important role of mgo particles in the p removal from contaminated waters 26 previous studies mainly focused on loading mgo on solid materials to boost the adsorption capacity while the present study pinpointed nano and micro mgo formation on vb via novel functionalization methods which were not previously introduced in p recovery and vinasse modification as well as comparing their impacts on vb characteristics and capacities equally important the proposed method is not only could be considered as a treatment of vinasse but also converts this industrial waste to a valuable p adsorbent recovers it as a potential fertilizer and saves waterbodies from eutrophication in the present study vb was modified by different rations of micro and nano mgo to achieve new adsorbents for p removal the formation of composites and the uptake of p species by mgo modified carbonaceous materials were investigated and confirmed by different characterization methods such as edx and mapping analysis fesem xrf xrd ftir and n2 isotherm analyses conditions of adsorption experiments were optimized by rsm 1 1 rsm response surface methodology the equilibrium process of which was evaluated by isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies further regeneration desorption and pot experiments were conducted to discover the reusability and fertilizing capability of the prepared carbonaceous adsorbent finally the impacts of competing anions during p removal were studied along with comparing the adsorption capacity of developed functionalized biochar with the recently published studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 vinasse derived biochar vb

suspension was kept in an oven at 80 ºc for 10 h until the supernatant evaporated and subsequently air dried for 1 h then the resulting precipitate was pyrolyzed in the furnace at 800 ºc under n2 flow for 1 h after the pyrolysis the obtained solids were named as vb nm 10 vb nm 20 and vb nm 30 for 10 20 and 30 mg of the nanoparticles used respectively 2 4 characterizations n2 adsorption desorption

ml of p solution and 0 01 g of adsorbent in addition the effect of temperature was also evaluated at 25 k intervals from 298 to 348 k it is worth noting that ph adjustment was conducted using either hcl 1 m or naoh 1 m the absorbance of the residual p was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 by shimadzu japan the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g p removal percentage and

adsorption which is a chemical and physical phenomenon by the interactions between solid and liquid phase among the many isotherms available freundlich eq 9 langmuir eq 10 and d r eq 11 models were considered in this study 49 9 l n q e ln k f 1 n l n c e 10 c e q e 1 k l q m 1 q m c e 11 l n q e ln q d r k d r ε 2 where kf and n indicate the freundlich constants attributed to adsorption capacity and intensity and qm mg g and kl l mg are considered as langmuir constants related to the maximum capacity and energy of adsorption respectively in addition qdr mg g shows the d r constant kdr mol2 kj2 is a constant indicating free energy and ε is regarded as the polanyi potential which is defined as eq 12 12 ε rtln 1 1 c e where r shows the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t k represents

the methods proposed in the previous studies 55 56 two different tests were conducted to represent the p recovery potency of the functionalized adsorbent the release in aqueous phase and the pot experiment the aqueous release test was conducted at three ph levels 5 6 and 7 indicating the percentage of adsorbed p released in the deionized water 56 specifically 0 01 g of the best adsorbent after adsorption vb nm 30 p was separated from the solution oven dried for 10 h at 85 c added to 20 ml deionized water and shaken in a stirrer at three aforementioned ph levels for 12 h and eventually separated from the solution the ratio of p detected in deionized water to the previously adsorbed amount was reported as the release capability of the adsorbent further the pot experiment test as proposed in previous studies 55 57 was conducted to assess the performance of p loaded adsorbent as a possible substitution for p fertilizer briefly 11 grass seeds were planted in two different pots containing 1 kg of the same soil texture further 3 0 g of p loaded adsorbent was completely mixed in one of the pots while the another one was kept as a blank soil samples were obtained from a greenhouse surface dried in air for two days and sieved before using in the pot experiment after planting the seeds the pots were kept in the same greenhouse with controlled humidity 54 68 and temperature 18 23 c after 60 days the plants heights above the soil and their dry masses were measured and reported based on the procedures developed by creech et al 58 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized vb adsorbents the structures of the carbonaceous adsorbents were identified by n2 adsorption desorption xrd ftir fesem edx and xrf methods the porosity and bet surface area of the original and modified vb materials were assessed using n2 isotherm analysis table 3 indicates the sbet ap and vtotal of the synthesized samples before and after p adsorption the introduction of mgo greatly changed the textural properties of the vb sample compared with vb the sbet ap and vtotal of vb mm 10 decreased from 128 21 to 103 26 m2 g 1 65 to 1 50 nm and 0 32 to 0 24 cm3 g respectively a reduction occurred in the textural properties of the modified adsorbents by increasing micro mgo loading ratio which is related to the blocking of some pores on the vb surface compared with vb nm 10 the higher textural parameters can be related to the loading of nanosized mgo these reductions in textural properties have also been reported by a previous study focused on mgo decorated magnetic biochar 46 after p adsorption the surface properties decreased due to the partial coverage of p ions on the surface and pores of vb nm 30 the structural reorganization of synthesized vb materials was confirmed by xrd studies fig 2 as shown the xrd patterns of carbonaceous samples indicated several peaks revealing the presence of mineral crystals in addition the xrd spectra of mgo modified samples showed the mgo peaks at 2θ positions of 37 3 43 5 62 6 74 8 and 78 7 which correspond to the crystal plates of 111 200 220 311 and 222 respectively 59 further the xrd pattern of mgo modified samples is consistent with xrd data for mg accumulated tomato tissues reported by yao et al 60 and mgo impregnated biochar reported by li et al 59 based on the results of xrd analysis the intensities of the mgo diffraction peaks of vb nm 30 p decreased compared to the vb nm 30 before adsorption further ft ir was analyzed to examine the functional groups related to unmodified and mgo modified vb materials fig 3 the main functional groups listed at around 880 1250 1407 1640 and 3450 cm 1 are ascribed to the aromatic c h vibration co stretching vibration ch2 and ch3 groups cc aromatic ring stretching and coh linkages respectively the absorption peaks appearing between 450 and 520 cm 1 are attributed to the mg o bending vibrations in mgo modified vb materials the characteristic peaks at approximately 1125 cm 1 represent the vibrations of mg o these peaks are in a good agreement with the results obtained by fang et al 61 and give further evidence for the effective modification of biochar by mgo nanoparticles new peaks at the wavelengths of 620 and 1050 cm 1 are related to the bending vibrations of p species appeared after p uptake compared with vb nm 30 the microstructures and morphologies of the synthesized vb materials were explored by fesem fig 4 displays the particle size and surface morphology of the unmodified and mgo modified samples the vb sample showed almost homogeneous particles based on the fesem micrograph vb mm materials were identified to have irregular shapes with an average diameter of 20 μm further the surface morphology of vb nm materials was smooth compared with that of vb mm materials demonstrating the agglomeration of small particles furthermore vb nm samples were relatively semispherical with an average size smaller than 50 nm finally the edx spectra affirmed the presence of mg ca k o and c in the synthesized vb samples the surface morphology and element dispersion of the vb nm 30 after p adsorption are presented in fig 4 based on the results the morphology of the vb nm 30 remained unchanged even after the p uptake in addition elemental distributions were evaluated by edx element mapping analysis regarding the mapping images in fig 4 it is clearly found that p and all metal species spread homogeneously over the vb nm 30 p the results are consistent with those of haddad et al 62 which studied the removal of p from aqueous media by magnesium pretreated cypress sawdust table 4 reports the inorganic composition of the biochar samples as shown modification with mgo increased mg contents 3 2 p adsorption assessment by vb biochars fig 5 displays the adsorption isotherms of p uptake by the mgo modified and unmodified samples as shown mgo modified nanocomposites demonstrated a better adsorption capacity for p than the pristine one in general the pristine biochar surface is negatively charged and rarely adsorbs the negatively charged p the enhanced removal of p by the mgo modified samples is probably due related to the presence of nano and micro particles on their surface which has a high affinity to attach p in aqueous media the potential of mgo particles to adsorb p from aqueous solutions was demonstrated in some scientific reports 63 64 several factors are important for controlling p adsorption by mgo modified materials including the amount and distribution of mgo in the adsorbent surface as well as morphology and size of mgo particles as shown in fig 5 p adsorption decreases by increasing micro mgo content on vb mm while the removal capacities increase by the increasing the presence of nano mgo on vb nm moreover all vb mm composites show a decrease in the sbet vtotal and ap table 3 such a significant decrease in their textural properties is due to partial and or full blockage of the vb pores caused by the mgo particles based on the above mentioned issues the content higher ratio of mgo particles and morphology nano sized particles were considered as the key features for a better adsorptive removal of p and the vb nm 30 was selected as a suitable adsorbent for further investigations the p removal by mgo particles is attributed to the coupled effect of surface complexation and electrostatic attraction fig 6 mgo particles become hydroxylated when they contact with water which induces either a positive or negative charge depending on the ph of the solution the mgo particles are expected to have a positive charge in most natural aqueous systems due to their high point of zero charge pzc pzcmgo 12 65 on the other hand p can exist in the form of h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 h p o 4 2 and p o 4 3 respectively at ph ranges of 2 2 7 7 12 5 and 12 the various formation of aqueous p under the acidic and basic conditions is given in the following equations 19 h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 h p k a1 2 16 20 h 2 p o 4 hp o 4 2 h p k a2 7 20 21 hp o 4 2 p o 4 3 h p k a3 10 3 clifford 66 reported that between phs of 5 and 12 h 2 p o 4 and h p o 4 2 predominate over p o 4 3 species when the ph value of the adsorption solution is lower than the pzcmgo negatively charged p species can be electrostatically attracted by the hydroxylated mgo mgoh to form mononuclear and polynuclear complexes precipitation takes place between p species and mgo particles on carbon surfaces within the matrix when ph increased and reaction continued leading to the formation of mghpo4 and mg h2po4 2 components 3 3 optimization of p removal using vb nm 30 by rsm rsm involves a set number of designed experiments to attain a response using a limited number of trials it is a statistical technique which is appropriate for multi factor experiments and gives the relationship between various parameters for optimal operation conditions the three main steps involved in this process include experimental design modelling and optimization the collected results were embedded into the quadratic polynomial equation via regression analysis in the rsm based ccd model the obtained equation in terms of the coded parameters is presented as follows 22 qe 124 40 3 11 a 16 99 b 21 22 c 4 23 ab 0 90 ac 8 68 bc 19 54 a2 34 13b2 11 32 c2 where qe shows removal capacity mg g a indicates ph b shows p initial concentration mg l and c is considered as time min the anova indicates whether the response surface quadratic model developed is statistically suitable for representing the process of p adsorption on vb nm 30 within the studied range the adequacy table 5 of the models was justified by the anova generally the significance of regression models is justified by the larger f values very small p values insignificant lack of fit and high values of r2 predicted r2 and adjusted r2 according to data analysis a quadratic model equation was obtained with the anova data provided in table 6 the polynomial model was analyzed by anova presenting data including high fisher test value f value 131 82 insignificant lack of fit 1 94 very low probability value p value 0 0001 as well as high values for coefficient of r squared r2 0 9916 predicted r squared pre d r 2 0 8479 adjusted r squared adj r2 0 9841 and the adequate precision 32 93 for p removal on vb nm 30 3 4 influence of variables via response surface the interactions between three independent factors on the dependent variable qe can be evaluated by response surface 3 dimensional 3d plots fig 7 solution ph is the main factor which controls the p adsorption at the solid liquid interface the ph of solution determines the form of the major species of p and affects the strength of electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion the p uptake by vb nm 30 at different initial ph in the range of 3 11 and the corresponding equilibrium ph are shown in fig 7 as displayed the removal efficiency of vb nm 30 increased when ph raised from 3 0 to 7 0 and remained stable when ph increased to 9 0 afterward the p removal dropped gradually until the ending stage of ph growth the poorer removal of the p at higher ph may be related to the higher concentration of oh which can compete with p oxyanions and react with the mgo nanoparticles the same trends were found in the literature for the p adsorption on aluminum manganese bimetal oxide 67 lanthanum doped activated carbon fiber 68 and al modified biochar 69 fig 7 a displays the variation of p adsorption by vb nm 30 as a function of initial concentration as shown adsorption increased by increasing the initial concentration of adsorbate and the equilibrium curves indicated a slow upward trend when the initial concentration is close to 250 mg l which is attributed to the fact that the mass transfer force of p between the vb nm 30 and solution is improved by increasing the initial concentration the contact time of the adsorbate and absorbent greatly affects the efficiency of the adsorption process significantly in addition in the practical application of absorbents the contact time directly reflects the economic efficiency of the process which is related to the adsorption kinetics as displayed in fig 7 b the adsorption is rapid in the first 40 min while adsorption equilibrium is achieved at 75 min the rate of p removal was higher at the beginning of the adsorption experiment due to a great number of available active sites on the surface of vb nm 30 the optimum levels of three parameters for maximum p uptake were found as contact time 75 min initial ph of solution 7 00 and initial p concentration 250 mg l 3 5 thermodynamic isothermal and kinetic results the effects of temperature on the adsorption can be evaluated by the assessing the thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic analysis was conducted at three temperatures t 298 323 and 348 k under constant conditions the estimated values of δh δs and δg are listed in table 7 as shown the removal efficiency of vb nm 30 decreases by increasing the temperature since the adsorption is an exothermic process δh 0 the δs 0 indicates an increase in randomness at the solid water interface during the uptake of p as shown in table 7 the δg 0 at different temperatures indicates that the adsorption of p onto the prepared adsorbent is feasible and spontaneous the adsorption isotherm of vb nm 30 was investigated in an effort to evaluate the adsorption capacity versus p concentration table 8 indicates in the fitted model parameters and their coefficient of determination r2 by comparing the r2 of the adsorption model fitted by the experimental data freundlich model showed more compatibility than d r and langmuir based on the results the vb nm 30 surface may contain adsorption sites with various energies in fact heterogeneous adsorption surface and multilayer adsorption occurred on the active sites located on the surface 70 the essential feature of a langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant equilibrium parameter or separation factor rl rl 1 1 klc0 which is used to predict the favorability of an adsorption system for a favorable adsorption process the rl value lies between 0 and 1 in this study the rl values for p uptake ions on to vb nm 30 lie within 0 and 1 indicating that p uptake on the prepared sample is a favorable process this finding has also been validated by the n value of the freundlich model which is in the range of 1 10 the e 8 kj mol indicates physical and 8 e 16 kj mol represents chemical adsorption the e value is 8 kj mol suggesting that the uptake of p on the vb nm 30 was chemical adsorption according to the langmuir isotherms the qm for vb nm 30 in p removal is 188 67 mg g table 9 compares the maximum capacities of some other adsorbents reported in the recent literatures with the result of the present research to further study the rate controlling mechanism in the process of adsorption five kinetic models were employed to fit the experimental data the kinetic rate constants of the pseudo first and pseudo second order particle diffusion intra particle diffusion and elovich equations for the vb nm 30 are listed in table 10 the r2 comparison of pseudo first order and second order 0 9955 versus 0 9994 demonstrates that the pseudo second order could offer a better modelling on the p adsorption further the r2 of intraparticle diffusion 0 9786 was less than that of the pseudo second order model revealing that diffusion in the adsorbate adsorbent interface is not a limiting parameter for the rate of uptake 3 6 influence of adsorbent dosage on p adsorption the dose of the adsorbent can significantly influence the removal process obtaining an optimum dose is essential for maximizing the interactions between p ions and adsorptive sites of the vb nm 30 the optimum dose of adsorbent can be obtained by comparing the adsorption capacity at different dosages of vb nm 30 ranging from 0 01 to 0 03 g in 20 ml of 250 mg l p solution fig 8 as illustrated the adsorption capacity decreased by increasing the dosage from 0 01 to 0 03 g as a result of remained unsaturated adsorptive sites hence the vb nm 30 dosage in adsorption experiments was selected as 500 mg l 3 7 influence of interfering anions on p adsorption in general different types of inorganic anions such as h c o 3 f n o 3 c l s o 4 2 and c o 3 2 are present in contaminated waters and these inorganic ions may interfere with the adsorption of p on prepared adsorbent 77 79 81 87 89 the effect of inorganic anions was investigated by keeping 250 mg l as initial p concentration 250 mg l of other inorganic anions and other factors time ph and temperature as constant the results of p adsorption in the presence of interfering anions are shown in fig 9 as shown the presence of h c o 3 f n o 3 and c l anions showed no significant influence without causing a considerable reduction on p removal efficiency however the introduction of s o 4 2 and c o 3 2 anions suppressed the adsorption capacities of p significantly the presence of s o 4 2 and c o 3 2 affected the p uptake more due to their higher negative charges than compared to h c o 3 f n o 3 and c l 3 8 biochar regeneration results hcl 1 0 m was selected to desorb p from the vb nm 30 p with the efficiency of recycled adsorbent at consecutive adsorption desorption cycles fig 10 the cl ions in hcl solution were replaced with p in the vb nm 30 p within 75 min of contact time from 0 01 g of the used adsorbent about 81 of adsorption performance was retained in the seventh adsorption desorption cycle and vb nm 30 still acted as an effective adsorbent for p recovery 3 9 results of recovery experiment p adsorption and desorption are functions of the solution ph the release test described in the methods was conducted on three different occasions for each ph level with the reported average values based on the experimental data illustrated in fig 11 c with the reduction of ph of the solution from 7 to 5 the percentage of p released from vb nm 30 p in the deionized water increased from 8 to 31 this finding is in line with that of the previous studies indicating that p adsorbed by cations could be released at lower ph levels 61 91 a pot experiment was conducted as described in the method section to capture the possible effects of p loaded adsorbent on plant growth and demonstrate its capability as a fertilizer substitution the harvested plants are displayed in fig 11 a and b as shown above and by comparing the heights and dry masses it is understood that the p loaded adsorbent vb nm 30 p had a remarkable result on plant growth and increased the height by 40 and dry mass by 59 on average these results demonstrated that the developed modified biochar was successful in p recovery as an uptakeable element and had a tangible performance on the grass the improvement in the plant growth was related to p loaded on the developed adsorbent as well as the relatively high amount of potassium element in the biochar structure pyrolyzed from vinasse 3 10 practical applications the use of biochar has various positive impacts on the environment particularly on water and soil preservation and greenhouse gas emission control one of the major drivers of its application is attributed to the achieved tangible reductions in greenhouse gas emission reported by life cycle inventory studies 92 93 in addition biochar application could bring fertility back to the soil 94 and enrich it with carbon and microbial biomass 95 96 which results in increasing the crop yield some studies focused on the long term effects and confirmed that adding pyrolyzed bio materials could reinforce the structural properties of the soil resulting in holding capacity augmentation of water and moisture therefore biochars could serve during water stress periods helping in stabilization the resources 97 sadeghi et al endorsed the structural amendments which vinasse biochar could bring to the soil and detected its benefits on runoff control extending the time by 55 and diminishing the runoff volume by 98 and controlling the soil loss 33 in order to have an assessment on economic and practical aspects of proposed methodology in p recovery to the industrial or commercial levels the following terms and conditions that should be evaluated in the targeted region simultaneously 1 the presence of ethanol industries resulting in abundant disposal of its waste vinasse due to underlying economic geopolitical and environmental reasons there have been worldwide attempts to reduce the use of fossil fuels among the potential alternative sources of energy ethanol has been the focus of much attention in addition to fuel and beverages there is always a traditional demand for ethanol as a source of raw material in chemical and cosmetic manufacturing the production of this effluent is expected to rise with an expected perspective of 1742 bli 3 3 bli billion liters produced in 2024 98 hence vinasse as a hazardous waste should be treated and disposed safely 99 2 the importance of p fertilizer in the specific region p fertilizer is an essential element in agriculture however its availability accessibility in conjunction with societal dependency on agriculture vary in different regions 91 3 protecting waterbodies from eutrophication p is considered as the controlling factor in eutrophication crisis leading to the destruction of water quality 37 as such it should be monitored and treated carefully 4 positive environmental effects of biochar application as explained in life cycle impact of biochar it has numerous healing effects on soil water and global warming moreover biochar could minimize the chemical fertilizer demand and bring the fertility back to the soil 96 5 biochar as the by product of bio oil production from a biomass vinasse bio oil production from vinasse through pyrolysis process has attracted a lot of attention in a recent study 100 the proposed method can also be a proper choice for developing countries with a huge volume of ethanol production for instance in india according to the report provided by usda fas 4 4 usda fas united states department of agriculture foreign agricultural service ethanol production was expected to be about 3000 mli 5 5 mli million liters in 2019 101 usda fas has also reported the annual ethanol production for some other developing countries such as peru 127 mli 102 vietnam 180 mli 103 bolivia 380 mli planned for the year 2025 104 philippines 222 mli 105 and indonesia 200 mli 106 such a huge appetite for ethanol leads to massive generation of vinasse which is 11 15 times greater than the ethanol produced during the fermentation of molasses most developing countries depend on agriculture as a primary source of income and economic stability which the p fertilizer accessibility is a central necessity saving the environment most importantly waterbodies from eutrophication and soil from erosion is a serious matter discussed in great details for developing countries such as india ethiopia cambodia vietnam philippines and indonesia in a recent studies 107 finally vb could be considered as a by product of bio oil production from vinasse during pyrolysis 100 and economic aspects of the obtained bio oil could make this recovery more attractive and affordable for the developing countries 4 conclusions nano and micro mgo modified vbs were synthesized through a set of treatments based on the high efficiency and low cost of vb and the p intense affinity for mgo the vb nms performed more effectively in p removal than vb mms the adsorption capacity of the vb nm improved by increasing the loaded mgo the vb samples were characterized by different methods the impacts of the experimental parameters on vb nm 30 adsorption capacity were evaluated by rsm ccd based on the results of thermodynamic study the nature of p removal was proven to be spontaneous and endothermic further the experimental equilibrium data were perfectly fitted to freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models finally the vb nm 30 exhibited excellent selectivity towards p in the presence of the commonly coexisting anionic species the adsorbed p could be almost completely desorbed by hcl solution and vb nm 30 p could act as a fertilizer substitute boosting the crop yield funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

13744,wet coffee pulping process generates organic pollutant rich wastewater and causes serious threat to the local water bodies hence the efficiency of ricinus communis l seed protein to remove colour total dissolved solids tds and chemical oxygen demand cod from the coffee cherry pulping wastewater ccpww was studied treatment with 0 5 g optimum dosage of the seed protein reduced 80 colour 75 total dissolved solids and 80 chemical oxygen demand from the wastewater along with a change in the ph from 3 7 to 5 2 characterisation of the seed protein using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight assay confirmed a ricin glycoprotein band at 28 kda this ricin b chain lectin protein with 262 amino acid residues caused the coagulation activity in the wastewater due to its cationic nature sugar binding sites and hydrogen bonding forces between molecules fourier transformed infrared characterization of the seeds showed the presence of amide groups involved in pollutant removal a positive linear correlation r 0 9 proved the degree of association between the removal of total dissolved solids and chemical oxygen demand from ccpww hence the study suggested that the pollutants from wastewater could be removed using ricinus communis l seed lectin protein as an alternative eco friendly coagulant agent replacing synthetic coagulant chemicals keywords coffee cherry pulping wastewater ricinus communis l seed lectin protein coagulation hydrogen bonding sugar binding sites 1 introduction coffee coffea arabica l is one of the most importantly traded agricultural commodity between different countries 1 india constantly produces superior quality coffee beans and ranks sixth in global coffee crop cultivation and stands one among the top 50 countries producing arabica and robusta array of coffee crops the coffee crop belongs to the family rubiaceae and genus coffea and in india it is cultivated along the western ghats hill tracks of southern states like tamil nadu 11 kerala 28 and karnataka 53 with the overall production of about 8200 tonnes of coffee beans year 2 water pollution emerged due to various industrial activities is one of the serious threats to the environment coffee cherries processed through wet pulping method for the isolation of coffee beans is the highly preferred technique among cultivators to produce high quality coffee beans 3 this kind of processing generates million tons of coffee wastes rich in organic residues every year the coffee pulping wastewater is highly rich in pollutants like carbohydrate polyphenols fibres proteins pectin nitrate phosphate thus these solids present in ccpww produce objectionable odour and attract insect breeding in the disposal area the acidic ph of the wastewater is formed due to the fermentation of sugar solids the mucilage layer from the green coffee beans set free into the coffee wastewater during the pulping process precipitates as a layer of crust on the water surface thus produces anaerobic condition into the water zones by depleting its dissolved oxygen ratio and also creates a toxic environment for the aquatic living beings 4 rodriguez et al 5 reported that the coffee industry used enormous amount of clean water to dehisce the ripe coffee cherries at different stages about 40 45 l of wastewater is produced when pulped 1 kg coffee cherry under wet processing technique such as depulping waters from the removal of the pulp from the coffee bean and wash water from the coffee bean fermentation and it possessed higher concentration of organic content lower ph and objectionable odour the coffee wastewater had a high polluting power as a result of its higher level of suspended and dissolved organic solids such as bod 15 000 mg l cod 18000 25000 mg l 6 later hue et al 7 confirmed 5 l 15 l of wastewater is generated for 1 kg coffee cherry processing synthetic chemical coagulants are widely used for water wastewater treatment due to its increased pollutant removal efficiency and low energy consumption besides they possess certain demerits like high price large quantity of chemicals transportation to the treatment location generation of large volume of sludge with limited recycling potential due to its non biodegradable synthetic polymers content 8 the inorganic coagulants are highly sensitive to the ph of the water and create secondary pollution of water resources during treatment process and releases toxic synthetic polymers and residual iron 9 previously crapper et al 10 studied and reported neurofibrillary degeneration of the neurons of higher mammals due to the deposition of aluminium using atomic absorption assay in brains of alzheimer patients miller et al 11 in their study about frequency of aluminium occurrences in natural water and treatment of water with alum based coagulant have demonstrated with the atomic absorption techniques that purification of water and wastewater with chemical based coagulant such as aluminium sulphate alum concentrates in the treated water in higher percentages this causes dangerous health risk by accumulation of aluminium in the brain cells and ends in alzheimer s disease alternatively schwarz 12 explained that plant seeds contain low molecular weight protein which could dissolve in water and possess a positive charge this cation attracts the freely discharged anionic particles present in the effluent and flocculates them and later settles down by gravity the use of plant materials as natural coagulants for wastewater purification is of commonly practiced in these days the plant ricinus communis l commonly termed as castor plant belongs to the family euphorbiaceae the plant is widespread across tropical sub tropical warm temperate regions and is indigenous to india eastern africa south eastern mediterranean basin it is a fast growing small to medium seized shrub the leaves of the plant are long with 15 45 cm and are reddish brown to green coloured the seeds of the castor plant are rich source of oil and it corresponds about 60 of triglycerides and ricinolein the castor oil is refined for commercial application in products such as paints varnishes oiled fabrics printing inks and enamels the castor oil is also used as lubricant for motors 13 the entire plant parts are useful due to the presence of several phytocompounds such as alkaloids flavonoids tannins saponin phenolic compounds they are efficient in anticancer antiprotozoal and antidiabetic properties and hence used for the treatment of inflammation for liver problems and as a good potent laxative 14 when the castor bean is processed for oil extraction it produces large amount of cake or mash remains as by products these cake remains contains glyceraldehydes 3 p dehydrogenase gapdh enolase fru bisp aldolase fba and phosphoglycerate kinase pgk as the most documented proteins 15 due to its potent biochemical fractions the seed cake is used as manure for paddy field sugarcane cultivation 16 the castor seeds are reported to contain ricin protein is grouped to belong to the 2s albumins protein family 17 the bio coagulants are basically enriched with polysaccharides or proteins components the castor seed used in this study contain 34 of protein 18 proteins with long chain amino acids contain elements like carbon hydrogen oxygen resembling the macromolecules carbohydrates lipids it differs from other molecules with the presence of phosphorous usually protein molecule is composed of a long polypeptide chain small polypeptide chain with 20 30 amino acid residues 19 ricinus communis l seed yielding biodiesel has glycerol chain and the castor bean seed implies the production of 1 13 tons of cake as its by products from the biodiesel agro industry 20 this leftover biomass is rich in proteins and fibre contain compounds ricin ricinin agglutinin and allergen cb 1a within it 21 the lectins and albumins synthesised among them are residual protein and are water soluble glycoprotein 22 protein extraction from oil seeds follows the solubilisation in alkaline medium 23 as an endospermic dicot castor seed at maturation synthesizes 90 95 of the total seed protein 24 the ricin is said to be accumulated after 40 days of pollination in the seeds 25 the seed protein ricin has hemagglutination coagulation activity in mammalian red blood cells due to its agglutination property 26 27 1 1 resource recovery from coffee cherry pulping wastewater coffee cherry processing units are a typical agro based industries the process of pulping coffee cherries by wet method produces liquid and solid by products such as wastewater mucilage pulp and coffee skin apart from green coffee beans the ccpww are rich in organic matters such as mucilage layer set free during the pulping process these mucilage solids are difficult to degrade and are mostly present as proteins sugars and pectin of industrial utilization whereas the organic nutrients along with high water content can serve as a good substrate for the growth of industrially beneficial microbes and production of enzymes for commercial applications from the ccpww dietary fibre can be extracted from mucilage pectins the naturally available coffee sugars and antioxidant compounds can be isolated also colour causing compounds like flavonoids can be recovered the nutrients in the ccpww can be also used as raw materials for the generation of biogas alternate fuel for electricity generation beverages pectic enzymes production of feed vinegar bio ethanol volatile compounds caffeine single cell protein biopesticide and compost the coffee wastewater with mucilage content can be also used as a novel substrate for hydrogen production the ccpww can be used for fertigation purpose due to its rich organic nutrients and can support plant growth extraction and recovery of these industrially valuable compounds from the wastewater would indirectly reduce the pollution load in the ccpww and simultaneously function as an alternative method of wastewater treatment 28 as per the central pollution control board cpcb of india the coffee seed processing industry is scheduled under orange group with a pollution index score 30 50 http www ppcb gov in attachments categorisation 20of 20industries category29 9 2016 pdf hence the present study aimed to treat the ccpww using ricinus communis l seed lectin protein coagulant to remove the pollutants like colour tds and cod further characterization of the seed protein with sds page maldi tof ms ms assay and ft ir studies were performed to confirm the coagulant amino acid peptide and its functional group participation to remove coffee wastewater pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of coffee cherry pulping wastewater ccpww the ccpww was collected in a pre cleaned and sterilized container from a typical coffee pulping unit located at thandigudi 1500 m above mean sea level kodaikanal tamil nadu india the wastewater collected was transported to laboratory with care and stored under proper conditions for further analysis as per standard analytical protocol apha 29 2 2 physico chemical characterisation of ccpww the ccpww was characterised for different physical and chemical parameters such as colour odour ph temperature total solids total dissolved solids total suspended solids acidity dissolved oxygen biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand chloride fluoride phosphate sulphate and nitrate as per standard methodology the chloride ion is estimated using the argentometric method other ions were estimated spectrophotometrically at different wavelength as follows fluoride ion is estimated using spadn s method at 570 nm phosphate by stannous chloride method at 690 nm sulphate by barium chloride method at 420 nm and nitrate by neda method at 410 nm all these estimations were performed in accordance with standard protocols prescribed by apha 2005 during the estimation of nitrate ions the interference of chloride is overcome by the addition of agcl the maximum absorbance λ max of the coffee cherry pulping wastewater was determined with double beam uv vis spectrophotometer elico sl no 218 for the color intensity measurement at 580 nm the values of all parameters are expressed in mg l except colour odour ph and temperature all the data observed were compared with cpcb effluent discharge limit prescribed for wet parchment coffee processing effluent 2 3 screening of natural coagulant from ricinus communis l seeds the ricinus communis l seeds as seen in fig 1 were collected locally from the premises around the coffee cherry pulping unit the matured and healthy seeds were washed and air dried the seed meal within the seed coat was removed manually the seeds cake was defatted using ethanol and evaporated to dryness using vacuum evaporator the seed powder was sieved astm no 200 and later precipitated for protein content using 70 of ammonium sulphate solution the precipitate was collected dried and stored in an air tight container for ccpww treatment studies 2 4 confirmation of coagulation efficiency of isolated seed protein fraction the isolated protein content from the defatted seed powder was tested for its coagulation activity against 1 kaolin synthetic clay solution for contaminant removal 30 2 5 effect of natural coagulant ricinus communis l seed protein on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww a volume of 100 ml of ccpww was accurately measured and poured into 3 sets of four clean individual conical flasks to this wastewater in each individual flask the ricinus communis l seed coagulant was added in different dosage concentrations such as 0 25 g 0 50 g 0 75 g and 1 g separately a clean conical flask added with 100 ml of raw ccpww alone was taken as control test flask all the 3 sets of treatment flasks containing the ccpww and the respective natural coagulant doses added were mixed well initially then the mixture in all the treatment conical flasks was left undisturbed for an hour and later filtered using whatmann no 1 filter paper 11 μm pore size the percentage reduction of colour tds and cod was analysed from the filtrate the experiment was repeated several times to confirm the optimum dosage of seed coagulant needed to treat the ccpww 2 6 effect of time on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww by using ricinus communis l seed protein about 100 ml of the ccpww was accurately measured and poured into four individual clean conical flasks to these treatment flasks containing ccpww 0 5 g of optimal dosage of the coagulant seed protein was added and mixed well initially then the contents of the treatment flask were left undisturbed for an hour later the mixture from the flask was filtered using whatmann no 1 filter paper 11 μm pore size the filtrate was used to analyse the percentage reduction of colour tds and cod at different time intervals such as ½ h 1 h 1½ h and 2 h the experiment was duplicated thrice to confirm the optimal time required by the seed protein coagulant to flocculate the pollutants from the ccpww 2 7 pollutant reduction calculation the percentage of removal of colour tds and cod from ccpww after coagulant treatment was calculated with the following equation 1 pollutant removal ci cf ci x 100 where ci initial reading of parameter before treatment cf final reading of parameter after treatment 2 8 proteomic analysis of ricinus communis l seeds the ricinus communis l seeds protein were isolated and quantified using bradford assay 31 with bovine serum albumin bsa protein standard the molecular mass of the seed protein was determined on 10 sds page as per lamelli method 32 the isolated and purified protein fragments were also identified for molecular weight using maldi 7090 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof mass spectrometry ms shimadzu s the obtained spectral peptides were compared with other reference peptides available in ncbinr protein database and by submission in mascot software http www matrixscience com 33 34 2 9 ft ir analysis of ricinus communis l seeds coagulant before and after ccpww treatment studies the active functional groups present in the ricinus communis l seed coagulant was characterized with ft ir model spectrum 2 perkin elmer usa the seed coagulant was pulverized and mixed with kbr 1 50 and obtained a good particulate form the thin pellet seed coagulant particle were screened using spectrometer with spectrum gx software top signal to noise performance makes it the highest performing by means of a parallel atr connection before and after the ccpww treatment to identify the efficient group involved in removal of colour tds and cod from the ccpww 2 10 co efficient correlation analysis between tds and cod removal for ccpww regression analysis was carried out for the removal of tds and cod from the ccpww using ricinus communis l seed coagulant was analysed with spss version 20 0 package the correlation coefficient was used to determine the nature of correlation 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical characterisation of ccpww the results for physico chemical characterization of ccpww are described in table 1 the colour of the ccpww was brown the dark colour pigmentation of coffee effluent is due to the presence of dissolved and suspended organic solids in the wastewater 35 the ccpww is generally concentrated with the presence of flavonoid the chemical substance causing red colour of coffee cherry 36 37 which contribute to the dark brown colour formation of the wastewater 38 along with flavonoid substances such as caffeine phenolic compounds pectic substances tannins and lignin also impart brown pigmentation of the wastewater 39 mohan et al 40 in their studies have stated that all these parameters expressed the existence of oxygen demanding pollutants in the ccpww apart from dissolved and suspended solids the colour causing substances in the wastewater are anionic r coo substances and the intensity of the colour varies with different ph one of the major reasons for the brown colour of ccpww is due to the chemical compound procyanidins present in the skin of ripe coffee cherries it contains flavanol monomers catechin linked with cyaniding epicatechin which is also an anthocyanidin cyanidin 3 rutinoside cyanidin 3 glucoside aglycone ulavi and kumar 41 characterised the physico chemical parameters of the coffee effluent and reported that the amount of total suspended solid in the coffee wastewater fluctuated from 1400 mg l to 2000 mg l in addition the degraded mucilage along with the pectin proteins and sugars present within the wastewater precipitated and created anaerobic nature in the waterways the ccpww had an objectionable and acidic fruity odour when sampled fresh which was due to the result of acidification and fermentation of gradually degrading organic solids present in the wastewater these organic solids are mostly the volatile compounds such as short chain fatty acids like methyl valeric acid nitrogen containing aromatic rings pyrazine acetic acid propionic acid nonanoic acid aldehydes released from the ripe cherries during the pulping process and its degradation produces nauseating odour all of these organic compounds posses similar type of objectionable odour producing properties like pungent odour rancid butter unpleasant fruity odour mild nut like fatty odour even in a very little diluted concentrations an objectionable foul odour in generated within closed sample containers for long days due to the liberation of ch4 and h2s gas from the coffee cherry pulping wastewater prasad et al 42 studied the influence of coffee effluent irrigation on the nutrient quality of robusta coffee and soil health and reported coffee effluent with 1009 ppm cod concentration did not produce any negative effect on clean coffee yield and the results were similar to the plots irrigated with pond water dhananjaya et al 43 and chanakya and alwis 44 analysed the chemical composition of the coffee processing wastewater and reported that it consists of sugar pectin tannin caffeine soluble salts and suspended solids and these solids are highly acidic and ferment thereby produce foul odour in the wastewater the ccpww had acidic ph 3 69 roger 45 has explained that any fluid overloaded with hydrogen ion turns the solution acid this happened due to the formation of vinegar acetic acid by the fermentation of organic matter such as proteins carbohydrates in the form of mannose arabinogalactose pectin polysaccharides cellulose and sugars the disaccharide sugar such as sucrose is linked together by glycosidic linkage between the glucose and fructose monosaccharides degradation of glucose sugar through glycolysis into pyruvic acid is again reduced to alcohol this process also produces organic acids like carboxylic acid sulfonic acid and lactic acid these organic matters originated from the mucilage that is partly disintegrated from the parchment all through the cherry pulping process 46 posing threat to the survival of the plants and animals 47 selvamurugan et al 48 in his study has documented that the analyzed coffee wastewater sample had low ph within the range of 3 88 4 21 was acidic the acidity of coffee cherry pulping wastewater was 2830 mg l mostly the pulp and the mucilage solids within the wastewater contains organic substances such as the pectin polysaccharide carbohydrates sugar quickly ferment and the proteins 49 the carbohydrate fermentation produces acidification in the wastewater acetic acid organic acid and gas like hydrogen or carbondioxide formic acid and lactic acid deamination of protein molecule produces ammonia and keto acids sugar molecules are metabolized to volatile fatty acids along with carbondioxide methane and lactic acid pectin substances ferment to produce acetate with the help of pectin esterases and remove methoxy compounds pectin lyases enzyme attacks the 1 4 glycosidic links of carbon atoms pectinase enzymes are secreted by aspergillus niger present in the coffee wastewater the presence of acetaldehyde acetic acid ethyl ester ketones e g 2 propanone and 3 methyl 2 butanone and alcohols e g 1 propanol and 2 methyl 1 propanol in the ripe coffee cheery pulp solids are set free into the coffee wastewater also contains certain volatile substances in the form of compounds like 2 methyl propanal methyl acetate 3 methyl furan methyl butanal 3 methyl 2 butenal and â ocimene 50 the results of the present study pointed out that the coffee cherry pulping wastewater was loaded with organic matter and nutrients the coffee effluent characterized in countries like ethiopia and kenya were reported to contain low ph fermenting organic sugar fractions the direct disposal of this untreated effluent caused offensive odour pollution along with surface and ground water contamination 46 the total solid content of the wastewater was 6590 mg l the total dissolved solids was 4800 mg l and the total suspended solids was 1790 mg l dissolved and suspended particles together in coffee wastewater causes water pollution and generally termed as solids tds is responsible for the problems like colour taste and odour in the wastewater hence it is used as an indicator to determine the water quality the tds comprises both organic and inorganic substances suspended solids in the wastewater are visible with volatile and fixed solids 51 mineral elements like phosphate potassium calcium and magnesium are also present in dissolved form in the ccpww solids in the form of tds mostly consists of macro and micro nutrients such as fatty acids caffeine pectic matters sugars cellulose phenolic compounds the carbohydrate found in the ccpww is present in the form of soluble and insoluble oligosaccharides mannose glucose galacturonic acid galactose xylose and arabinose compounds alkaloids in coffee wastewater are found as theobromine theophylline and paraxanthine and they are non protein nitrogen sources of origin moreover volatile and non volatile acids found in the wastewater includes aliphatic acids chlorogenic acids formic acid citric acid malic acid quinic acid lactic acid ferulic acid phenolic acid and caffeic acid 52 asha and kumar 53 have reported in their study that the total suspended solid tss in the coffee effluent was 4500 mg l the dissolved oxygen level of the wastewater was found to be zero the biochemical oxygen demand was 16 500 mg l and chemical oxygen demand was 29 460 mg l the other chemical parameters like chloride fluoride phosphate sulphate and nitrate in the wastewater were 150 mg l 6 mg l 4 mg l 409 mg l and 38 mg l respectively all these organic matters are present in the form of dissolved and suspended particles within the coffee cherry pulping wastewater 54 the organic matter present in the form of polysaccharide lipids and proteins in the ccpww are broken down to simple metabolite form like hexose polygalacturonase enzymes are produce by aspergillus niger present in the ccpww 55 the amount of cod and bod in the coffee cherry pulping wastewater was higher the cod concentration was little higher 80 when compared with bod nelson et al 56 also confirmed increased cod amount in wastewater than bod this is mainly due to the slowly decomposing organic substance such as pectin flavonoids blended in the wastewater 57 the aromatic phenols are degraded into aromatic rings and produce hydroxybenzoate through carboxylation process gallic acid is produced by hydrolysis of ccpww tannic acid with the help of tannase enzyme the tannase enzymes are produced by p verrucosm microbes present in the ccpww 58 the raised amount of cod and bod produces anaerobic environment in the water bodies result bad rotting odour which is unfavourable for aquatic life 59 besides the presence of these components turn the ccpww into dark green colour to black colour on exposure to the air this feature also denotes that the wastewater is not ready for biodegradation 60 these reported pollutant parameters cover the valid reasons behind its occurrences and insist on the need for its removal from ccpww this physico chemical characterization is a useful tool to understand and it provides a clear awareness about the behaviour of emerging pollutants in wastewater and freshwater resources hence there is a need for the treatment of the coffee cherry pulping wastewater before its discharge from the processing unit into its surrounding vicinity 3 2 confirmation of coagulation efficiency of isolated seed protein fraction the isolated ricinus communis l seed lectin protein was used in small volume to test its coagulation efficiency in 1 synthetic kaolin solution the coagulation assay performed with a very little sample volume was easier and clear in analysing the coagulation kinetics of isolated lectin protein fraction and also monitoring the aggregated floc settling rate addition of ricinus communis l seed lectin protein fraction into kaolin solution turned the turbid solution into a clear liquid with particle aggregation settled at bottom the efficiency of coagulation activity was checked by tds measurement the turbidity in water alters the organoleptic property of water and also it serves as a medium for the growth and long survival of pathogenic microbes the reduction in the amount of tds and optical density measurement is due to the coagulation activity occurred between the added charged particle and the suspended floc particles 61 this reaction might be due to the bridging charge neutralization of colloidal particle surface stabilization and flocculation mechanics produced by the amino acids such as lysine arginine glutamine asparagines histidine with nh ion and oh coo ion group and their respective cationic charges present in the seed protein as represented in fig 2 the cationic nature of natural coagulants binds with negatively charged particles which results in the formation of precipitate 62 the hydroxyl ions created attract the colloidal particles from the solution neutralise the charged particles and adsorb on the surface of pollutant particles in addition to increase the bridging course of action between the pollutants present in the wastewater 63 are plausible mechanism for settling the pollutant natural polymer consists many number of charged and functional group in their structure like oh coo and nh ions these ions from coagulants during coagulation process involves interparticle bridging adsorption neutralisation of charged particles sweep coagulation and compression of electrical double layer of charged colloidal particles 64 after neutralisations of charged particles which comes closure contact each other and form flocs and are characteristics with highly porous erratically structured and loosely connected aggregates 65 as a result of coagulation by ricinus communis l protein the contaminant particles amass and grow into bigger size flocs and are settled down later which can be removed easily high molecular weight proteins have been reported as adhesin which enhance the initial attachment on the solid surface to form flocs 66 the protein of natural coagulants can attach on the surface directly and bridge the kaolin particles and thus producing their flocculation 67 the coagulation process typically includes promoting the interaction of particles to form larger aggregates the carboxylate ions generated during the ionization process might have increased the ph of treated solution due to a slight decrease in acidity 68 the coagulation mechanism is ph and surface charge dependent the kaolin particle in suspension state has negative charge and hence absorbs the positive charged polyelectrolyte protein molecules and produces aggregation of particles hence the charge neutralization process might have caused the removal of turbidity from the kaolin solution with respect to ricinus communis l seed lectin protein proteinaceous materials contain different combinations of both the amino and carboxyl groups organic substances acquire their respective surface charge as a result of ionisation of their amino and carboxyl groups 61 at a low ph value the carboxyl groups are not ionised and at high ph the colloidal particles are ionised to anionic particles at an isoelectric ph point the colloidal particles remain neutrally charged 69 coagulation mechanism is a chemical or physical process which aggregates the wastewater pollutants into larger floc which includes colloidal suspended materials and bacteria the charge neutralization mechanism is a coagulation process used in direct filtration of pollutants by the addition of positively charge particles into the negatively charged solution charge neutralization mechanism effectively acts on colour causing components of coffee wastewater and its removal from the wastewater fig 2 now a days biocoagulant gain more attention for wastewater treatment purpose because of its ubiquitous characteristics like low dosage requirement reduced sludge generation and negligible impact on ph of treated water 70 3 3 effect of natural coagulant ricinus communis l seed protein on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww pollutants reduction percentage was calculated as per eq 1 the removal of pollutants increased gradually when increased the ricinus communis l seed protein dosage up to 0 5 g and it showed the highest removal of pollutants than other treatment dosages after this dosage very poor no removal of colour tds and cod was noticed after the treatment of ccpww with the optimum and different doses of seed coagulant agent about 20 ml of water was lost during the filtration process thus at the end of the treatment process 80 ml of water was obtained after filtration this suggested that 0 5 g is an optimum dosage for the treatment of ccpww this optimal dose removed 80 of colour 75 of tds and 80 of cod from the wastewater as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the ph of the wastewater was also found increased to 5 6 from the initial 3 6 value following the treatment the major ccpww contaminants such as carbohydrates proteins lipids alcohols alkaloids are present in the form cooh residues anionic r coo and cationic substances like r nh3 procyanidin chemicals containing flavonol monomers anthocyanidin cyanidin 3 rutinoside cyanidin 3 glucoside aglycone volatile organic compounds such as pyrazine nitrogen containing aromatic molecule 3 methyl valeric acid acetic acid ethyl esters pentanoic acid propionic acid lactic acid formic acid quinic acid ferulic acid caffeic acid 2 propanone and 3 methyl 2 butanone 1 propanol and 2 methyl 1 propanol carbohydrates such as mannose galactose rhamnose arabinogalactose cellulose xylose glucose and fructose sugars linked by glycosidic linkage ethanol from fermenting sugars chlorogenic acids 4 o caffeoylquinic acid theobromine theophylline and paraxanthine mineral compound such as calcium potassium phosphate and sulphate are also present the ricin b chain lectin protein a holoprotein actively binds to sugar moiety and hence termed as carbohydrate binding proteins 69 these binding sites are more specific towards monosaccharide and complex oligosaccharides the galactose sugars are attached to the protein cell surface at the ends by the hydrogen bond thus precipitates and isolates the polysaccharides and glycoproteins from the ccpww tds and cod causing major polysaccharide like carbohydrate sugars can be removed by this reaction in an antigen antibody type of reaction ricin lectin protein is more powerful in binding d galactose sugars and also has metal ion binding sites such as calcium and magnesium the carbohydrate binding agglutination activity of the ricin lectin protein mostly requires metal ions and thus binds and acts like a bridge and interacts with the hydroxyl group of the sugar residues directly the specific hydrogen bridging electrostatic interaction or the non specific van der waals interaction make up the strength and stability of the molecular complex between the ricin lectin protein and ccpww pollutant solids these reactions might have occurred due to charge neutralization mechanism like a magnet attract mostly negatively charged pollutants of cationic coagulant protein which is aqueous soluble and densely charged 70 the amino acids arginine r lysine k and histidine h methionine one of the amino acid containing sulphur element neutral charged present within the ricinus communis l seed protein are positively charged these charged molecules during wastewater treatment might have got ionized to produce proton and has resulted in hydroxyl group release thus changed the ccpww to basic with increased ph 12 these important active compounds present within the seed protein are suggested to be responsible for the pollutant reduction from the coffee cherry pulping waste water 71 it may be attributed to the presence of reducing agent and its coagulating property parisara et al 72 have purified water using moringa seed kernel and found ph increased in water from acidic to basic nature after addition of the seed protein associated with cationic amino acids stillmark 73 has isolated and confirmed the occurrence of protein ricin from ricinus communis l seed in general coagulation is a process that occurs due to surface phenomenon where the net charge on the surface created the coagulation activity 74 3 4 effect of time on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww by using ricinus communis l seed protein the removal of the colour tds and cod from the ccpww using ricinus communis l seed protein was the highest when the treatment time was increased to 1 h further increase in time with 0 5 g of optimal coagulant dose produced static poor removal of pollutants from the wastewater a rapid increase in the pollutant removal was noticed when the duration of the treatment was extended as given in table 3 this reaction may be caused due to the accessibility of elevated vacant surface site within the wastewater medium fig 4 3 5 proteomic analysis of ricinus communis l seeds electrophoresis analysis sds page showed isolated protein bands corresponding to ricin 28 kda the characterisation of seed protein with sds page followed by maldi tof assay confirmed a ricin glycoprotein band between 32 kda to 30 kda with a disulphide bond the ricin b chain as shown in fig 5 comprising the lectin protein at 28 kda with 262 amino acid residue was found to possess the coagulation property it might be due to the cationic nature and sugar binding sites of cysteine rich domain at each end of the chain favouring hydrogen bonding between molecules the three amino acid residues trp leu and ile hold the peptide folding firmly and maintain the hydrophobic core of the protein structure 75 among the amino acid residues trp leu ile found in ricin b chain trp has a major role in coagulation activity due to its sugar binding property at lower affinity site 76 as per weston et al 78 ricin b chain shown in fig 4 is non toxic and ricin chain a individually loses its toxicity the sequence alignment of ricin b chain lectin protein residues with moringa seed flocculent protein residues showed 35 amino acids positions with fully conserved residues c p g q s n a w l d i r t v in different locations multiple sequence alignment as shown in fig 4 b also showed amino acids with strongly and weakly similar properties between the residual groups and they were 26 pairs and 23 pairs respectively mostly the amino acids like aspartic acid d asparagines n glutamine q serine s threonine t tyrosine y present in this seed protein ricin b chain are polar hydrogen donor acceptor with basic and acidic side chains which might have favoured the capable coagulation flocculation during ccpww treatment 77 3 6 ft ir analysis of ricinus communis l seeds coagulant before and after ccpww treatment studies characterisation of the ricinus communis l seed coagulant before and after ccpww treatment expressed some important functional groups prior to treatment the seed coagulant showed 14 absorbance peaks and after treatment showed 9 absorbance peaks the functional groups nh amine c h alkane ch alkane ch aldehydes nh2 bending amide co esters cn alkene no nitrogen compound nh amine cn aliphatic cx organic halogen nh wagging amide were present in the seed coagulant before treatment the seed coagulant examined after treatment showed the absence of few of these groups and also most of the functional groups were found with shifted peak values the absence and shift of group peaks confirmed the coagulation property of the seed protein and removal of pollutants from the ccpww the presence of nh stretch shows the amide group of protein the cn stretch confirms the protein content of the seed coagulant 79 the amino acid groups present in the seeds as shown in table 4 and 5 would have reacted with the anionic compounds of the wastewater through electrostatic interaction thus caused the removal of colour tds and cod the absence of co group at 1740 cm 1 nh group at 3343 cm 1 in the after treated seed coagulant repeatedly confirmed the ionic interaction occurred during the treatment sasikala and muthuraman 80 have reported pollutant removal efficiency of moringa olifera seed coagulant strychnos potatorum seed coagulant and phaseolus vulgaris seed coagulant was due to the presence of active agents like cationic peptides and anionic polyelectrolyte for coagulation 3 7 co efficient correlation analysis between tds and cod removal for ccpww the regression correlation between the two parameters tds and cod from ccpww with ricinus communis l seed coagulant treatment showed r 0 9 and indicated strong relationship analysis of tds is an important water quality parameter to be considered the measure of cod in wastewater demands the requirement of oxygen by the toxic organic and inorganic matters present within it besides biodegradable substances 81 the correlation coefficient is used to evaluate linear relationship between any two parameters considering the degree and path of relationship 82 the r value with 1 to 1 is denoted as positive relationship and r 0 is identified as non related correlation the tds and cod reduction percentage of the ccpww resulted in a positive correlation the treatments were statistically significant thamaraiselvi et al 83 reported correlation coefficient r 0 9 for treatment of sugar wash using synthetic and natural coagulants edet et al 84 statistically analyzed the correlation factors for the physical and chemical parametric data of ground water samples collected from different provinces of nigeria 4 conclusions the present work had confirmed the effect of ricinus communis l seed lectin protein as a coagulant for the removal of colour tds and cod from ccpww the coagulant protein present in the seeds had been isolated and confirmed with the proteomic studies sds page maldi tof ms ms www matrixscience com and ft ir spectral analysis the ricin b chain lectin protein from the ricinus communis l seeds has showed coagulation property by pollutant elimination from ccpww the regression correlation between tds and cod in this study showed r 0 9 and had indicated strong linear relationship the sludge generated at the end of ccpww treatment can be recycled adopting an eco friendly technique biological composting hence this study suggests that this seed coagulant protein can be used as an alternate source against chemical based coagulants alum lime etc to remove tds and cod related pollutants from ccpww declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13744,wet coffee pulping process generates organic pollutant rich wastewater and causes serious threat to the local water bodies hence the efficiency of ricinus communis l seed protein to remove colour total dissolved solids tds and chemical oxygen demand cod from the coffee cherry pulping wastewater ccpww was studied treatment with 0 5 g optimum dosage of the seed protein reduced 80 colour 75 total dissolved solids and 80 chemical oxygen demand from the wastewater along with a change in the ph from 3 7 to 5 2 characterisation of the seed protein using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight assay confirmed a ricin glycoprotein band at 28 kda this ricin b chain lectin protein with 262 amino acid residues caused the coagulation activity in the wastewater due to its cationic nature sugar binding sites and hydrogen bonding forces between molecules fourier transformed infrared characterization of the seeds showed the presence of amide groups involved in pollutant removal a positive linear correlation r 0 9 proved the degree of association between the removal of total dissolved solids and chemical oxygen demand from ccpww hence the study suggested that the pollutants from wastewater could be removed using ricinus communis l seed lectin protein as an alternative eco friendly coagulant agent replacing synthetic coagulant chemicals keywords coffee cherry pulping wastewater ricinus communis l seed lectin protein coagulation hydrogen bonding sugar binding sites 1 introduction coffee coffea arabica l is one of the most importantly traded agricultural commodity between different countries 1 india constantly produces superior quality coffee beans and ranks sixth in global coffee crop cultivation and stands one among the top 50 countries producing arabica and robusta array of coffee crops the coffee crop belongs to the family rubiaceae and genus coffea and in india it is cultivated along the western ghats hill tracks of southern states like tamil nadu 11 kerala 28 and karnataka 53 with the overall production of about 8200 tonnes of coffee beans year 2 water pollution emerged due to various industrial activities is one of the serious threats to the environment coffee cherries processed through wet pulping method for the isolation of coffee beans is the highly preferred technique among cultivators to produce high quality coffee beans 3 this kind of processing generates million tons of coffee wastes rich in organic residues every year the coffee pulping wastewater is highly rich in pollutants like carbohydrate polyphenols fibres proteins pectin nitrate phosphate thus these solids present in ccpww produce objectionable odour and attract insect breeding in the disposal area the acidic ph of the wastewater is formed due to the fermentation of sugar solids the mucilage layer from the green coffee beans set free into the coffee wastewater during the pulping process precipitates as a layer of crust on the water surface thus produces anaerobic condition into the water zones by depleting its dissolved oxygen ratio and also creates a toxic environment for the aquatic living beings 4 rodriguez et al 5 reported that the coffee industry used enormous amount of clean water to dehisce the ripe coffee cherries at different stages about 40 45 l of wastewater is produced when pulped 1 kg coffee cherry under wet processing technique such as depulping waters from the removal of the pulp from the coffee bean and wash water from the coffee bean fermentation and it possessed higher concentration of organic content lower ph and objectionable odour the coffee wastewater had a high polluting power as a result of its higher level of suspended and dissolved organic solids such as bod 15 000 mg l cod 18000 25000 mg l 6 later hue et al 7 confirmed 5 l 15 l of wastewater is generated for 1 kg coffee cherry processing synthetic chemical coagulants are widely used for water wastewater treatment due to its increased pollutant removal efficiency and low energy consumption besides they possess certain demerits like high price large quantity of chemicals transportation to the treatment location generation of large volume of sludge with limited recycling potential due to its non biodegradable synthetic polymers content 8 the inorganic coagulants are highly sensitive to the ph of the water and create secondary pollution of water resources during treatment process and releases toxic synthetic polymers and residual iron 9 previously crapper et al 10 studied and reported neurofibrillary degeneration of the neurons of higher mammals due to the deposition of aluminium using atomic absorption assay in brains of alzheimer patients miller et al 11 in their study about frequency of aluminium occurrences in natural water and treatment of water with alum based coagulant have demonstrated with the atomic absorption techniques that purification of water and wastewater with chemical based coagulant such as aluminium sulphate alum concentrates in the treated water in higher percentages this causes dangerous health risk by accumulation of aluminium in the brain cells and ends in alzheimer s disease alternatively schwarz 12 explained that plant seeds contain low molecular weight protein which could dissolve in water and possess a positive charge this cation attracts the freely discharged anionic particles present in the effluent and flocculates them and later settles down by gravity the use of plant materials as natural coagulants for wastewater purification is of commonly practiced in these days the plant ricinus communis l commonly termed as castor plant belongs to the family euphorbiaceae the plant is widespread across tropical sub tropical warm temperate regions and is indigenous to india eastern africa south eastern mediterranean basin it is a fast growing small to medium seized shrub the leaves of the plant are long with 15 45 cm and are reddish brown to green coloured the seeds of the castor plant are rich source of oil and it corresponds about 60 of triglycerides and ricinolein the castor oil is refined for commercial application in products such as paints varnishes oiled fabrics printing inks and enamels the castor oil is also used as lubricant for motors 13 the entire plant parts are useful due to the presence of several phytocompounds such as alkaloids flavonoids tannins saponin phenolic compounds they are efficient in anticancer antiprotozoal and antidiabetic properties and hence used for the treatment of inflammation for liver problems and as a good potent laxative 14 when the castor bean is processed for oil extraction it produces large amount of cake or mash remains as by products these cake remains contains glyceraldehydes 3 p dehydrogenase gapdh enolase fru bisp aldolase fba and phosphoglycerate kinase pgk as the most documented proteins 15 due to its potent biochemical fractions the seed cake is used as manure for paddy field sugarcane cultivation 16 the castor seeds are reported to contain ricin protein is grouped to belong to the 2s albumins protein family 17 the bio coagulants are basically enriched with polysaccharides or proteins components the castor seed used in this study contain 34 of protein 18 proteins with long chain amino acids contain elements like carbon hydrogen oxygen resembling the macromolecules carbohydrates lipids it differs from other molecules with the presence of phosphorous usually protein molecule is composed of a long polypeptide chain small polypeptide chain with 20 30 amino acid residues 19 ricinus communis l seed yielding biodiesel has glycerol chain and the castor bean seed implies the production of 1 13 tons of cake as its by products from the biodiesel agro industry 20 this leftover biomass is rich in proteins and fibre contain compounds ricin ricinin agglutinin and allergen cb 1a within it 21 the lectins and albumins synthesised among them are residual protein and are water soluble glycoprotein 22 protein extraction from oil seeds follows the solubilisation in alkaline medium 23 as an endospermic dicot castor seed at maturation synthesizes 90 95 of the total seed protein 24 the ricin is said to be accumulated after 40 days of pollination in the seeds 25 the seed protein ricin has hemagglutination coagulation activity in mammalian red blood cells due to its agglutination property 26 27 1 1 resource recovery from coffee cherry pulping wastewater coffee cherry processing units are a typical agro based industries the process of pulping coffee cherries by wet method produces liquid and solid by products such as wastewater mucilage pulp and coffee skin apart from green coffee beans the ccpww are rich in organic matters such as mucilage layer set free during the pulping process these mucilage solids are difficult to degrade and are mostly present as proteins sugars and pectin of industrial utilization whereas the organic nutrients along with high water content can serve as a good substrate for the growth of industrially beneficial microbes and production of enzymes for commercial applications from the ccpww dietary fibre can be extracted from mucilage pectins the naturally available coffee sugars and antioxidant compounds can be isolated also colour causing compounds like flavonoids can be recovered the nutrients in the ccpww can be also used as raw materials for the generation of biogas alternate fuel for electricity generation beverages pectic enzymes production of feed vinegar bio ethanol volatile compounds caffeine single cell protein biopesticide and compost the coffee wastewater with mucilage content can be also used as a novel substrate for hydrogen production the ccpww can be used for fertigation purpose due to its rich organic nutrients and can support plant growth extraction and recovery of these industrially valuable compounds from the wastewater would indirectly reduce the pollution load in the ccpww and simultaneously function as an alternative method of wastewater treatment 28 as per the central pollution control board cpcb of india the coffee seed processing industry is scheduled under orange group with a pollution index score 30 50 http www ppcb gov in attachments categorisation 20of 20industries category29 9 2016 pdf hence the present study aimed to treat the ccpww using ricinus communis l seed lectin protein coagulant to remove the pollutants like colour tds and cod further characterization of the seed protein with sds page maldi tof ms ms assay and ft ir studies were performed to confirm the coagulant amino acid peptide and its functional group participation to remove coffee wastewater pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of coffee cherry pulping wastewater ccpww the ccpww was collected in a pre cleaned and sterilized container from a typical coffee pulping unit located at thandigudi 1500 m above mean sea level kodaikanal tamil nadu india the wastewater collected was transported to laboratory with care and stored under proper conditions for further analysis as per standard analytical protocol apha 29 2 2 physico chemical characterisation of ccpww the ccpww was characterised for different physical and chemical parameters such as colour odour ph temperature total solids total dissolved solids total suspended solids acidity dissolved oxygen biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand chloride fluoride phosphate sulphate and nitrate as per standard methodology the chloride ion is estimated using the argentometric method other ions were estimated spectrophotometrically at different wavelength as follows fluoride ion is estimated using spadn s method at 570 nm phosphate by stannous chloride method at 690 nm sulphate by barium chloride method at 420 nm and nitrate by neda method at 410 nm all these estimations were performed in accordance with standard protocols prescribed by apha 2005 during the estimation of nitrate ions the interference of chloride is overcome by the addition of agcl the maximum absorbance λ max of the coffee cherry pulping wastewater was determined with double beam uv vis spectrophotometer elico sl no 218 for the color intensity measurement at 580 nm the values of all parameters are expressed in mg l except colour odour ph and temperature all the data observed were compared with cpcb effluent discharge limit prescribed for wet parchment coffee processing effluent 2 3 screening of natural coagulant from ricinus communis l seeds the ricinus communis l seeds as seen in fig 1 were collected locally from the premises around the coffee cherry pulping unit the matured and healthy seeds were washed and air dried the seed meal within the seed coat was removed manually the seeds cake was defatted using ethanol and evaporated to dryness using vacuum evaporator the seed powder was sieved astm no 200 and later precipitated for protein content using 70 of ammonium sulphate solution the precipitate was collected dried and stored in an air tight container for ccpww treatment studies 2 4 confirmation of coagulation efficiency of isolated seed protein fraction the isolated protein content from the defatted seed powder was tested for its coagulation activity against 1 kaolin synthetic clay solution for contaminant removal 30 2 5 effect of natural coagulant ricinus communis l seed protein on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww a volume of 100 ml of ccpww was accurately measured and poured into 3 sets of four clean individual conical flasks to this wastewater in each individual flask the ricinus communis l seed coagulant was added in different dosage concentrations such as 0 25 g 0 50 g 0 75 g and 1 g separately a clean conical flask added with 100 ml of raw ccpww alone was taken as control test flask all the 3 sets of treatment flasks containing the ccpww and the respective natural coagulant doses added were mixed well initially then the mixture in all the treatment conical flasks was left undisturbed for an hour and later filtered using whatmann no 1 filter paper 11 μm pore size the percentage reduction of colour tds and cod was analysed from the filtrate the experiment was repeated several times to confirm the optimum dosage of seed coagulant needed to treat the ccpww 2 6 effect of time on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww by using ricinus communis l seed protein about 100 ml of the ccpww was accurately measured and poured into four individual clean conical flasks to these treatment flasks containing ccpww 0 5 g of optimal dosage of the coagulant seed protein was added and mixed well initially then the contents of the treatment flask were left undisturbed for an hour later the mixture from the flask was filtered using whatmann no 1 filter paper 11 μm pore size the filtrate was used to analyse the percentage reduction of colour tds and cod at different time intervals such as ½ h 1 h 1½ h and 2 h the experiment was duplicated thrice to confirm the optimal time required by the seed protein coagulant to flocculate the pollutants from the ccpww 2 7 pollutant reduction calculation the percentage of removal of colour tds and cod from ccpww after coagulant treatment was calculated with the following equation 1 pollutant removal ci cf ci x 100 where ci initial reading of parameter before treatment cf final reading of parameter after treatment 2 8 proteomic analysis of ricinus communis l seeds the ricinus communis l seeds protein were isolated and quantified using bradford assay 31 with bovine serum albumin bsa protein standard the molecular mass of the seed protein was determined on 10 sds page as per lamelli method 32 the isolated and purified protein fragments were also identified for molecular weight using maldi 7090 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof mass spectrometry ms shimadzu s the obtained spectral peptides were compared with other reference peptides available in ncbinr protein database and by submission in mascot software http www matrixscience com 33 34 2 9 ft ir analysis of ricinus communis l seeds coagulant before and after ccpww treatment studies the active functional groups present in the ricinus communis l seed coagulant was characterized with ft ir model spectrum 2 perkin elmer usa the seed coagulant was pulverized and mixed with kbr 1 50 and obtained a good particulate form the thin pellet seed coagulant particle were screened using spectrometer with spectrum gx software top signal to noise performance makes it the highest performing by means of a parallel atr connection before and after the ccpww treatment to identify the efficient group involved in removal of colour tds and cod from the ccpww 2 10 co efficient correlation analysis between tds and cod removal for ccpww regression analysis was carried out for the removal of tds and cod from the ccpww using ricinus communis l seed coagulant was analysed with spss version 20 0 package the correlation coefficient was used to determine the nature of correlation 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical characterisation of ccpww the results for physico chemical characterization of ccpww are described in table 1 the colour of the ccpww was brown the dark colour pigmentation of coffee effluent is due to the presence of dissolved and suspended organic solids in the wastewater 35 the ccpww is generally concentrated with the presence of flavonoid the chemical substance causing red colour of coffee cherry 36 37 which contribute to the dark brown colour formation of the wastewater 38 along with flavonoid substances such as caffeine phenolic compounds pectic substances tannins and lignin also impart brown pigmentation of the wastewater 39 mohan et al 40 in their studies have stated that all these parameters expressed the existence of oxygen demanding pollutants in the ccpww apart from dissolved and suspended solids the colour causing substances in the wastewater are anionic r coo substances and the intensity of the colour varies with different ph one of the major reasons for the brown colour of ccpww is due to the chemical compound procyanidins present in the skin of ripe coffee cherries it contains flavanol monomers catechin linked with cyaniding epicatechin which is also an anthocyanidin cyanidin 3 rutinoside cyanidin 3 glucoside aglycone ulavi and kumar 41 characterised the physico chemical parameters of the coffee effluent and reported that the amount of total suspended solid in the coffee wastewater fluctuated from 1400 mg l to 2000 mg l in addition the degraded mucilage along with the pectin proteins and sugars present within the wastewater precipitated and created anaerobic nature in the waterways the ccpww had an objectionable and acidic fruity odour when sampled fresh which was due to the result of acidification and fermentation of gradually degrading organic solids present in the wastewater these organic solids are mostly the volatile compounds such as short chain fatty acids like methyl valeric acid nitrogen containing aromatic rings pyrazine acetic acid propionic acid nonanoic acid aldehydes released from the ripe cherries during the pulping process and its degradation produces nauseating odour all of these organic compounds posses similar type of objectionable odour producing properties like pungent odour rancid butter unpleasant fruity odour mild nut like fatty odour even in a very little diluted concentrations an objectionable foul odour in generated within closed sample containers for long days due to the liberation of ch4 and h2s gas from the coffee cherry pulping wastewater prasad et al 42 studied the influence of coffee effluent irrigation on the nutrient quality of robusta coffee and soil health and reported coffee effluent with 1009 ppm cod concentration did not produce any negative effect on clean coffee yield and the results were similar to the plots irrigated with pond water dhananjaya et al 43 and chanakya and alwis 44 analysed the chemical composition of the coffee processing wastewater and reported that it consists of sugar pectin tannin caffeine soluble salts and suspended solids and these solids are highly acidic and ferment thereby produce foul odour in the wastewater the ccpww had acidic ph 3 69 roger 45 has explained that any fluid overloaded with hydrogen ion turns the solution acid this happened due to the formation of vinegar acetic acid by the fermentation of organic matter such as proteins carbohydrates in the form of mannose arabinogalactose pectin polysaccharides cellulose and sugars the disaccharide sugar such as sucrose is linked together by glycosidic linkage between the glucose and fructose monosaccharides degradation of glucose sugar through glycolysis into pyruvic acid is again reduced to alcohol this process also produces organic acids like carboxylic acid sulfonic acid and lactic acid these organic matters originated from the mucilage that is partly disintegrated from the parchment all through the cherry pulping process 46 posing threat to the survival of the plants and animals 47 selvamurugan et al 48 in his study has documented that the analyzed coffee wastewater sample had low ph within the range of 3 88 4 21 was acidic the acidity of coffee cherry pulping wastewater was 2830 mg l mostly the pulp and the mucilage solids within the wastewater contains organic substances such as the pectin polysaccharide carbohydrates sugar quickly ferment and the proteins 49 the carbohydrate fermentation produces acidification in the wastewater acetic acid organic acid and gas like hydrogen or carbondioxide formic acid and lactic acid deamination of protein molecule produces ammonia and keto acids sugar molecules are metabolized to volatile fatty acids along with carbondioxide methane and lactic acid pectin substances ferment to produce acetate with the help of pectin esterases and remove methoxy compounds pectin lyases enzyme attacks the 1 4 glycosidic links of carbon atoms pectinase enzymes are secreted by aspergillus niger present in the coffee wastewater the presence of acetaldehyde acetic acid ethyl ester ketones e g 2 propanone and 3 methyl 2 butanone and alcohols e g 1 propanol and 2 methyl 1 propanol in the ripe coffee cheery pulp solids are set free into the coffee wastewater also contains certain volatile substances in the form of compounds like 2 methyl propanal methyl acetate 3 methyl furan methyl butanal 3 methyl 2 butenal and â ocimene 50 the results of the present study pointed out that the coffee cherry pulping wastewater was loaded with organic matter and nutrients the coffee effluent characterized in countries like ethiopia and kenya were reported to contain low ph fermenting organic sugar fractions the direct disposal of this untreated effluent caused offensive odour pollution along with surface and ground water contamination 46 the total solid content of the wastewater was 6590 mg l the total dissolved solids was 4800 mg l and the total suspended solids was 1790 mg l dissolved and suspended particles together in coffee wastewater causes water pollution and generally termed as solids tds is responsible for the problems like colour taste and odour in the wastewater hence it is used as an indicator to determine the water quality the tds comprises both organic and inorganic substances suspended solids in the wastewater are visible with volatile and fixed solids 51 mineral elements like phosphate potassium calcium and magnesium are also present in dissolved form in the ccpww solids in the form of tds mostly consists of macro and micro nutrients such as fatty acids caffeine pectic matters sugars cellulose phenolic compounds the carbohydrate found in the ccpww is present in the form of soluble and insoluble oligosaccharides mannose glucose galacturonic acid galactose xylose and arabinose compounds alkaloids in coffee wastewater are found as theobromine theophylline and paraxanthine and they are non protein nitrogen sources of origin moreover volatile and non volatile acids found in the wastewater includes aliphatic acids chlorogenic acids formic acid citric acid malic acid quinic acid lactic acid ferulic acid phenolic acid and caffeic acid 52 asha and kumar 53 have reported in their study that the total suspended solid tss in the coffee effluent was 4500 mg l the dissolved oxygen level of the wastewater was found to be zero the biochemical oxygen demand was 16 500 mg l and chemical oxygen demand was 29 460 mg l the other chemical parameters like chloride fluoride phosphate sulphate and nitrate in the wastewater were 150 mg l 6 mg l 4 mg l 409 mg l and 38 mg l respectively all these organic matters are present in the form of dissolved and suspended particles within the coffee cherry pulping wastewater 54 the organic matter present in the form of polysaccharide lipids and proteins in the ccpww are broken down to simple metabolite form like hexose polygalacturonase enzymes are produce by aspergillus niger present in the ccpww 55 the amount of cod and bod in the coffee cherry pulping wastewater was higher the cod concentration was little higher 80 when compared with bod nelson et al 56 also confirmed increased cod amount in wastewater than bod this is mainly due to the slowly decomposing organic substance such as pectin flavonoids blended in the wastewater 57 the aromatic phenols are degraded into aromatic rings and produce hydroxybenzoate through carboxylation process gallic acid is produced by hydrolysis of ccpww tannic acid with the help of tannase enzyme the tannase enzymes are produced by p verrucosm microbes present in the ccpww 58 the raised amount of cod and bod produces anaerobic environment in the water bodies result bad rotting odour which is unfavourable for aquatic life 59 besides the presence of these components turn the ccpww into dark green colour to black colour on exposure to the air this feature also denotes that the wastewater is not ready for biodegradation 60 these reported pollutant parameters cover the valid reasons behind its occurrences and insist on the need for its removal from ccpww this physico chemical characterization is a useful tool to understand and it provides a clear awareness about the behaviour of emerging pollutants in wastewater and freshwater resources hence there is a need for the treatment of the coffee cherry pulping wastewater before its discharge from the processing unit into its surrounding vicinity 3 2 confirmation of coagulation efficiency of isolated seed protein fraction the isolated ricinus communis l seed lectin protein was used in small volume to test its coagulation efficiency in 1 synthetic kaolin solution the coagulation assay performed with a very little sample volume was easier and clear in analysing the coagulation kinetics of isolated lectin protein fraction and also monitoring the aggregated floc settling rate addition of ricinus communis l seed lectin protein fraction into kaolin solution turned the turbid solution into a clear liquid with particle aggregation settled at bottom the efficiency of coagulation activity was checked by tds measurement the turbidity in water alters the organoleptic property of water and also it serves as a medium for the growth and long survival of pathogenic microbes the reduction in the amount of tds and optical density measurement is due to the coagulation activity occurred between the added charged particle and the suspended floc particles 61 this reaction might be due to the bridging charge neutralization of colloidal particle surface stabilization and flocculation mechanics produced by the amino acids such as lysine arginine glutamine asparagines histidine with nh ion and oh coo ion group and their respective cationic charges present in the seed protein as represented in fig 2 the cationic nature of natural coagulants binds with negatively charged particles which results in the formation of precipitate 62 the hydroxyl ions created attract the colloidal particles from the solution neutralise the charged particles and adsorb on the surface of pollutant particles in addition to increase the bridging course of action between the pollutants present in the wastewater 63 are plausible mechanism for settling the pollutant natural polymer consists many number of charged and functional group in their structure like oh coo and nh ions these ions from coagulants during coagulation process involves interparticle bridging adsorption neutralisation of charged particles sweep coagulation and compression of electrical double layer of charged colloidal particles 64 after neutralisations of charged particles which comes closure contact each other and form flocs and are characteristics with highly porous erratically structured and loosely connected aggregates 65 as a result of coagulation by ricinus communis l protein the contaminant particles amass and grow into bigger size flocs and are settled down later which can be removed easily high molecular weight proteins have been reported as adhesin which enhance the initial attachment on the solid surface to form flocs 66 the protein of natural coagulants can attach on the surface directly and bridge the kaolin particles and thus producing their flocculation 67 the coagulation process typically includes promoting the interaction of particles to form larger aggregates the carboxylate ions generated during the ionization process might have increased the ph of treated solution due to a slight decrease in acidity 68 the coagulation mechanism is ph and surface charge dependent the kaolin particle in suspension state has negative charge and hence absorbs the positive charged polyelectrolyte protein molecules and produces aggregation of particles hence the charge neutralization process might have caused the removal of turbidity from the kaolin solution with respect to ricinus communis l seed lectin protein proteinaceous materials contain different combinations of both the amino and carboxyl groups organic substances acquire their respective surface charge as a result of ionisation of their amino and carboxyl groups 61 at a low ph value the carboxyl groups are not ionised and at high ph the colloidal particles are ionised to anionic particles at an isoelectric ph point the colloidal particles remain neutrally charged 69 coagulation mechanism is a chemical or physical process which aggregates the wastewater pollutants into larger floc which includes colloidal suspended materials and bacteria the charge neutralization mechanism is a coagulation process used in direct filtration of pollutants by the addition of positively charge particles into the negatively charged solution charge neutralization mechanism effectively acts on colour causing components of coffee wastewater and its removal from the wastewater fig 2 now a days biocoagulant gain more attention for wastewater treatment purpose because of its ubiquitous characteristics like low dosage requirement reduced sludge generation and negligible impact on ph of treated water 70 3 3 effect of natural coagulant ricinus communis l seed protein on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww pollutants reduction percentage was calculated as per eq 1 the removal of pollutants increased gradually when increased the ricinus communis l seed protein dosage up to 0 5 g and it showed the highest removal of pollutants than other treatment dosages after this dosage very poor no removal of colour tds and cod was noticed after the treatment of ccpww with the optimum and different doses of seed coagulant agent about 20 ml of water was lost during the filtration process thus at the end of the treatment process 80 ml of water was obtained after filtration this suggested that 0 5 g is an optimum dosage for the treatment of ccpww this optimal dose removed 80 of colour 75 of tds and 80 of cod from the wastewater as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the ph of the wastewater was also found increased to 5 6 from the initial 3 6 value following the treatment the major ccpww contaminants such as carbohydrates proteins lipids alcohols alkaloids are present in the form cooh residues anionic r coo and cationic substances like r nh3 procyanidin chemicals containing flavonol monomers anthocyanidin cyanidin 3 rutinoside cyanidin 3 glucoside aglycone volatile organic compounds such as pyrazine nitrogen containing aromatic molecule 3 methyl valeric acid acetic acid ethyl esters pentanoic acid propionic acid lactic acid formic acid quinic acid ferulic acid caffeic acid 2 propanone and 3 methyl 2 butanone 1 propanol and 2 methyl 1 propanol carbohydrates such as mannose galactose rhamnose arabinogalactose cellulose xylose glucose and fructose sugars linked by glycosidic linkage ethanol from fermenting sugars chlorogenic acids 4 o caffeoylquinic acid theobromine theophylline and paraxanthine mineral compound such as calcium potassium phosphate and sulphate are also present the ricin b chain lectin protein a holoprotein actively binds to sugar moiety and hence termed as carbohydrate binding proteins 69 these binding sites are more specific towards monosaccharide and complex oligosaccharides the galactose sugars are attached to the protein cell surface at the ends by the hydrogen bond thus precipitates and isolates the polysaccharides and glycoproteins from the ccpww tds and cod causing major polysaccharide like carbohydrate sugars can be removed by this reaction in an antigen antibody type of reaction ricin lectin protein is more powerful in binding d galactose sugars and also has metal ion binding sites such as calcium and magnesium the carbohydrate binding agglutination activity of the ricin lectin protein mostly requires metal ions and thus binds and acts like a bridge and interacts with the hydroxyl group of the sugar residues directly the specific hydrogen bridging electrostatic interaction or the non specific van der waals interaction make up the strength and stability of the molecular complex between the ricin lectin protein and ccpww pollutant solids these reactions might have occurred due to charge neutralization mechanism like a magnet attract mostly negatively charged pollutants of cationic coagulant protein which is aqueous soluble and densely charged 70 the amino acids arginine r lysine k and histidine h methionine one of the amino acid containing sulphur element neutral charged present within the ricinus communis l seed protein are positively charged these charged molecules during wastewater treatment might have got ionized to produce proton and has resulted in hydroxyl group release thus changed the ccpww to basic with increased ph 12 these important active compounds present within the seed protein are suggested to be responsible for the pollutant reduction from the coffee cherry pulping waste water 71 it may be attributed to the presence of reducing agent and its coagulating property parisara et al 72 have purified water using moringa seed kernel and found ph increased in water from acidic to basic nature after addition of the seed protein associated with cationic amino acids stillmark 73 has isolated and confirmed the occurrence of protein ricin from ricinus communis l seed in general coagulation is a process that occurs due to surface phenomenon where the net charge on the surface created the coagulation activity 74 3 4 effect of time on the colour tds and cod removal from ccpww by using ricinus communis l seed protein the removal of the colour tds and cod from the ccpww using ricinus communis l seed protein was the highest when the treatment time was increased to 1 h further increase in time with 0 5 g of optimal coagulant dose produced static poor removal of pollutants from the wastewater a rapid increase in the pollutant removal was noticed when the duration of the treatment was extended as given in table 3 this reaction may be caused due to the accessibility of elevated vacant surface site within the wastewater medium fig 4 3 5 proteomic analysis of ricinus communis l seeds electrophoresis analysis sds page showed isolated protein bands corresponding to ricin 28 kda the characterisation of seed protein with sds page followed by maldi tof assay confirmed a ricin glycoprotein band between 32 kda to 30 kda with a disulphide bond the ricin b chain as shown in fig 5 comprising the lectin protein at 28 kda with 262 amino acid residue was found to possess the coagulation property it might be due to the cationic nature and sugar binding sites of cysteine rich domain at each end of the chain favouring hydrogen bonding between molecules the three amino acid residues trp leu and ile hold the peptide folding firmly and maintain the hydrophobic core of the protein structure 75 among the amino acid residues trp leu ile found in ricin b chain trp has a major role in coagulation activity due to its sugar binding property at lower affinity site 76 as per weston et al 78 ricin b chain shown in fig 4 is non toxic and ricin chain a individually loses its toxicity the sequence alignment of ricin b chain lectin protein residues with moringa seed flocculent protein residues showed 35 amino acids positions with fully conserved residues c p g q s n a w l d i r t v in different locations multiple sequence alignment as shown in fig 4 b also showed amino acids with strongly and weakly similar properties between the residual groups and they were 26 pairs and 23 pairs respectively mostly the amino acids like aspartic acid d asparagines n glutamine q serine s threonine t tyrosine y present in this seed protein ricin b chain are polar hydrogen donor acceptor with basic and acidic side chains which might have favoured the capable coagulation flocculation during ccpww treatment 77 3 6 ft ir analysis of ricinus communis l seeds coagulant before and after ccpww treatment studies characterisation of the ricinus communis l seed coagulant before and after ccpww treatment expressed some important functional groups prior to treatment the seed coagulant showed 14 absorbance peaks and after treatment showed 9 absorbance peaks the functional groups nh amine c h alkane ch alkane ch aldehydes nh2 bending amide co esters cn alkene no nitrogen compound nh amine cn aliphatic cx organic halogen nh wagging amide were present in the seed coagulant before treatment the seed coagulant examined after treatment showed the absence of few of these groups and also most of the functional groups were found with shifted peak values the absence and shift of group peaks confirmed the coagulation property of the seed protein and removal of pollutants from the ccpww the presence of nh stretch shows the amide group of protein the cn stretch confirms the protein content of the seed coagulant 79 the amino acid groups present in the seeds as shown in table 4 and 5 would have reacted with the anionic compounds of the wastewater through electrostatic interaction thus caused the removal of colour tds and cod the absence of co group at 1740 cm 1 nh group at 3343 cm 1 in the after treated seed coagulant repeatedly confirmed the ionic interaction occurred during the treatment sasikala and muthuraman 80 have reported pollutant removal efficiency of moringa olifera seed coagulant strychnos potatorum seed coagulant and phaseolus vulgaris seed coagulant was due to the presence of active agents like cationic peptides and anionic polyelectrolyte for coagulation 3 7 co efficient correlation analysis between tds and cod removal for ccpww the regression correlation between the two parameters tds and cod from ccpww with ricinus communis l seed coagulant treatment showed r 0 9 and indicated strong relationship analysis of tds is an important water quality parameter to be considered the measure of cod in wastewater demands the requirement of oxygen by the toxic organic and inorganic matters present within it besides biodegradable substances 81 the correlation coefficient is used to evaluate linear relationship between any two parameters considering the degree and path of relationship 82 the r value with 1 to 1 is denoted as positive relationship and r 0 is identified as non related correlation the tds and cod reduction percentage of the ccpww resulted in a positive correlation the treatments were statistically significant thamaraiselvi et al 83 reported correlation coefficient r 0 9 for treatment of sugar wash using synthetic and natural coagulants edet et al 84 statistically analyzed the correlation factors for the physical and chemical parametric data of ground water samples collected from different provinces of nigeria 4 conclusions the present work had confirmed the effect of ricinus communis l seed lectin protein as a coagulant for the removal of colour tds and cod from ccpww the coagulant protein present in the seeds had been isolated and confirmed with the proteomic studies sds page maldi tof ms ms www matrixscience com and ft ir spectral analysis the ricin b chain lectin protein from the ricinus communis l seeds has showed coagulation property by pollutant elimination from ccpww the regression correlation between tds and cod in this study showed r 0 9 and had indicated strong linear relationship the sludge generated at the end of ccpww treatment can be recycled adopting an eco friendly technique biological composting hence this study suggests that this seed coagulant protein can be used as an alternate source against chemical based coagulants alum lime etc to remove tds and cod related pollutants from ccpww declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest
