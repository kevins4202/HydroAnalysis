silver polyacrylonitrile zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 nanocomposite m cuo ag pan zif 67 that has multifunctional behavior for removing acetaminophen act and paraquat pq residuals from contaminated water while also acting as an antibacterial agent the antibacterial agent of as prepared nanocomposite on gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus s aureus and bacillus subtilis b subtilis and also gram negative bacteria escherichia coli e coli were studied to minimize the use of harmful chemicals and solvents fe3o4 ag and cuo nanoparticles were prepared through plant mediated green synthesis by renewable and non toxic aqueous extracts of aloe vera plant mulberry leaves and gundelia tournefortii l respectively the adsorption results showed that the nanocomposite could remove 99 41 2 21 of the act and 99 23 1 83 of the pq from the contaminated water the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of act and pq by nanocomposite was calculated as 971 6 and 1143 7 mg g 1 respectively which surpasses that of most nanocomposite based adsorbents also the adsorption kinetic data were well described with the pseudo second order model and the adsorption thermodynamic results showed the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature the antibacterial properties of nanocomposite were studied by pour plate and disk diffusion methods it was concluded that bacterial suppression by the nanocomposite was higher in the gram positive bacteria than in the gram negative bacterium the antibacterial results also showed that the collective antibacterial effects of the nanocomposite are stronger than its components and copper oxide doped has also strengthened the antibacterial properties in addition the nanocomposite could be easily regenerated by washing with methanol and chlorination method finally the adsorption efficiency and antibacterial behavior of nanocomposite remained above 80 and 90 after six reuse cycles respectively graphical

data 1 introduction currently the growth of the presence of various types of emerging pollutants in water such as pharmacological pesticide and bacterial pollutions have become a serious problem that greatly threatens the environment and millions of humans health worldwide many of these pollutants in the environment even in low concentrations cause mutagenicity biological responses and adverse effects on human health and other living organisms 1 2 therefore the elimination of these pollutants and preventing their release into the environment is of particular importance acetaminophen act most known as paracetamol is widely used as a painkiller and antipyretic worldwide 3 continuous exposure to act can lead to serious illness and injuries due to its toxic effects and must be removed from the effluents before being released into the environment 4 pesticides are often agrochemical compounds that are used to kill repel or control pests and also increase productivity herbicides are a broad class of pesticides that are used to remove or inhibiting the growth of nuisance plants herbicides are of particular importance due to high solubility in water toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenic effects 5 paraquat pq is one of the most toxic pesticides that is widely used as an herbicide in agriculture and its residues have been reported in water sources 6 it is known that this pq can cause fatal or severe physiological damage if deliberately or accidentally ingested therefore its removal from water resources is very important 7 on the other hand bacteria are one of the most common types of microorganisms and bacterial contamination of drinking water is led to the spread of dangerous diseases and has become a major concern around the world with thousands of people around the world dying each year related to the use of unsafe water gram positive bacteria bacillus subtilis b subtilis and staphylococcus aureus s aureus and gram negative bacteria escherichia coli e coli are among the bacteria commonly associated with the human environment water contaminated with these bacteria can cause a wide range of clinical diseases and in some cases even mortality 8 the various methods including physical chemical membrane biological treatment and adsorption have been used for the treatment of unwanted pollutants from contaminated water 9 adsorption is considered a feasible flexible effective simple operation and economical technique to remove the wide range of pollution from water 10 over the past few years researchers explored various adsorbents for act and pq contaminated waters treatment however there are still multiple challenges in the adsorption process such as low adsorption capacity and regeneration of adsorbents therefore choice of an efficient adsorbent is very important in the last decades the use of composites to remove pollutants from contaminated water has received much attention from researchers and has been recognized that the nanocomposites fabricated by dispersing nanoparticles in polymer melts have a much better performance than traditional composites and may exhibit multifunctional behaviors 11 the development of multifunctional nanocomposites by combining different nanomaterials and benefiting from their physical chemical and biological properties can create more potential applications in the form of a cohesive structure 12 zeolitic imidazole framework 67 zif 67 is one of the water stable metal organic frameworks mofs which have attractive properties containing high surface area high porosity chemical stability and simple synthesis and has been used in the treatment of many kinds of polluted water besides some work demonstrated that the zif 67 show considerable bactericidal activity toward s aureus and e coli 13 on the other hand it is accepted that some metal and metal oxide nanoparticles show antibacterial behaviors among these materials silver ag and copper oxide cuo nanoparticles have attracted much attention and have been used in a variety of antibacterial activities 14 the potent antibacterial properties of silver have led to its widespread use in medical applications nowadays silver nanoparticles are used as effective nanomaterials against a wide range of bacteria 15 the cuo structures have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to their unique properties such as cheapness very low toxicity high antibacterial properties high adsorption performance and narrow bandwidth 16 17 in recent years researchers reported that the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles could be enhanced by combining with cuo nanoparticles 18 in this paper a magnetic cuo doped silver polyacrylonitrile zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 nanocomposite m cuo ag pan zif 67 was successfully synthesized by plant mediated green synthesis methodology by renewable and non toxic aqueous extracts of aloe vera plant mulberry leaves and gundelia tournefortii l the overall schematic of the preparation steps has been illustrated in fig 1 then the application of as prepared m cuo ag pan zif 67 in the adsorptive removal of pq and act residues as well as the antibacterial effects on gram positive s aureus and b subtilis bacteria and also gram negative e coli bacteria were evaluated in the adsorption process the effects of independent variables including initial concentrations of act pq solution ph adsorbent mass contact time and solution temperature on act pq adsorption efficiency from aqueous solutions were determined and optimized in addition the antibacterial properties of m cuo ag pan zif 67 were studied by pour plate standard method 9215b and disk diffusion methods 2 experimental the chemicals instruments and preparation methods were all specified in the electronic supplementary information 2 1 adsorption experiments all the experiments were conducted in a lab scale batch reactor and the residual concentrations of act and pq were analyzed using uv visible spectrophotometer at their maximum absorption wavelength of λmax 243 and λ 257 nm respectively the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe each time qt and the removal percentage r of the act and pq were determined by the following equations 19 20 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 mg removal r c 0 c e c 0 100 where qe mg g 1 shows the act pq adsorption amounts qt mg g 1 adsorption amounts at any time c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 the initial and equilibrium act pq concentrations respectively and ct mg l 1 act pq concentrations at any time t v l volume of the act pq solutions and m g denotes the mass of the adsorbent in this study the adsorption of act and pq by nanocomposite was optimized using the ccd rsm table s1 by design expert 7 0 software in the optimization process the responses were chosen based on a quadratic model also the adsorption data were processed by analysis of variance anova and the interaction between the independent variables and their responses were studied 21 22 the independent variables affecting adsorption efficiency such as initial act pq concentrations solution ph adsorbent mass sonication time frequency 20 khz power 50 w and solution temperature were investigated systematically with conducted 25 optimal number of experiments the isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies were contended by the equilibrium experiments 2 2 antibacterial experiments in this study two different methods of pour plate standard method 9215b 23 and disk diffusion 18 24 methods were followed for the evaluation of the antibacterial activities of the as prepared nanocomposite by applied the different concentrations 50 500 μg ml 1 for antibacterial experiments the three bacterial strains gram negative escherichia coli e coli atcc 25922 gram positive bacillus subtilis b subtilis atcc 21332 and staphylococcus aureus s aureus atcc 29213 were tested in summary in the pour plate method a certain concentration of nanocomposite was mixed with sterilized warm 40 45 c mueller hinton agar mha also 1 ml of diluted specimen bacterial suspension 1 0 109 cfu ml were poured into the sterile plate then the warm agar was poured into the bacterial containing plate and after the mixing was allowed to solidify finally plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c until bacterial colonies grow also a control plate was also incubated for each bacterial strain without the addition of nanocomposite in the disk diffusion method the fresh bacteria cultures were prepared onto mha plates the antibiotic test discs 6 mm impregnated with nanomaterials are then placed on the agar surface then plates were incubated and the bacteria were allowed to grow completely for 24 h at 37 c finally the clear inhibition zones formed around the test discs were measured 25 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 crystallographic analysis the phase purity and crystallinity of the prepared samples were studied by the xrd patterns and results are presented in fig 2 the characteristic diffraction peaks of zif 67 mofs fig 2a showed that the resulted pattern was consistent with the reported pattern of zif 67 mofs 26 and no extra peaks were observed also the sharp peaks reveal the good crystallinity of zif 67 mofs the xrd pattern of as synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 2b shows good agreement with the data of cubic spinel fe3o4 structure jcpds card no 19 0629 27 the xrd pattern of the as synthesized ag nanoparticles fig 2c shows the characteristics peaks around 38 1 111 and 44 2 200 which is in good agreement with the face centered cubic form of metallic silver jcpds card no 04 0783 28 the xrd pattern of pure pan fig 2d shows a sharp crystalline peak at 17 1 110 corresponding to orthorhombic pan reflection the xrd pattern of the m ag pan zif 67 fig 2e well matched with the naked zif 67 mofs fe3o4 nps ag nps and pan polymer patterns no extra peaks were observed due to the purity of the synthesized nanocomposite and all the peaks were at the right place despite a slight shifting due to interactions between each other in the xrd pattern of m cuo ag pan zif 67 fig 2f the new diffraction peaks have appeared at 36 002 and 39 7 200 along with other peaks related to m ag pan zif 67 the appeared new peaks can be indexed to cubic crystalline phase of cuo jcpds card no 78 0428 29 which confirm the successful dopping of cuo nps on m ag pan zif 67 in addition the average crystallite size of nanocomposite was calculated using scherrer s equation 30 and was determined to be 35 5 nm 3 1 2 surface functional groups analysis the surface functional groups of prepared samples were identified by ftir analysis and results are shown in fig s1 for zif 67 mofs fig s1a the vibrational bands in the range of 600 1300 cm 1 and 1355 cm 1 correspond to the characteristic stretching and bending modes of the imidazole ring and cn in 2 methylimidazole hmim respectively 31 for fe3o4 nps fig s1b the sharp absorption band around 582 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of feo bonds of fe3o4 nps the weak absorption band around 1050 cm 1 is due to the co stretching vibration that may be related to the remnants of using aloe vera leaves extract in the case of ag nps fig s1c the ftir spectra consist of absorption bands correspond to the stretching vibration of ch co and co bonds attributed to the presence of various phytochemicals in the used extract 32 in the ftir spectrum of the pan polymer fig s1d the absorption peaks attributed to the vibration of ch oh co and cn bonds were appeared in the range of 400 2300 cm 1 in the m ag pan zif 67 spectrum fig s1e all the main absorption bands of zif 67 mofs fe3o4 nps ag nps and pan polymer are cumulatively visible with a slight shift which confirms the presence of all their surface functional groups in the nanocomposite structure compared to the ftir spectrum of the m ag pan zif 67 the ftir spectrum of m cuo ag pan zif 67 fig s1f show the additional absorption bands at 516 and 620 cm 1 which can be attributed to the cuo stretching vibrations 33 and confirmed that the cuo nanoparticles has successfully doped on nanocomposite structure 3 1 3 morphological and elemental composition analysis the surface morphology and elemental composition of m cuo ag pan zif 67 were studied by fesem edx analysis as shown in fig 3 the fesem image fig 3a show that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 structure consisting of nanoparticles with different morphologies and sizes the elemental composition of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was investigated as weight percentage by edx analysis fig 3b the edx spectrum reported that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 rendered the elements of silver ag carbon c cobalt co oxygen o copper cu iron fe nitrogen n and which indicates the presence of zif 67 mofs fe3o4 ag and cuo nanoparticles in the nanocomposite structure also the distribution of the elements on the surface of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 is presented by the edx mapping analysis fig 3c as can be seen the distribution of elements was almost uniform and elements regions were clearly observed on the nanocomposite surface 3 1 4 porosity and textural analysis the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm fig s2a of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 exhibited a type iii isotherm with a type h3 loop suggesting the presence of the agglomerated solids particles with the non uniform size and shape 34 also the h3 hysteresis loop is often associated with solids with a very wide distribution of pore size the pore size distribution fig s2b was manifested by the bjh method the result revealed that the prepared sample has a wide range of pore sizes 60 nm and the bet specific surface area and total pore volume were about 271 8 m2 g 1 and 1 0 cm3 g 1 respectively 3 1 5 magnetic measurement the easy separation capability of used adsorbent from the reaction medium is essential for its practical applications magnetic separation using a magnet is one of the most accessible methods in this field the vsm study was used to evaluate the magnetic property of the synthesized m cuo ag pan zif 67 at room temperature in the applied field ranging from 10 000 to 10 000 oe from the vsm measurement fig s2c the saturation magnetization ms of m cuo ag pan zif 67 and naked fe3o4 nanoparticles were determined 6 20 and 76 73 emu g 1 respectively the decrease in the ms value of the nanocomposite compared to naked fe3o4 nanoparticles was attributed mainly to the low fe3o4 content in the nanocomposite structure however this small ms value was also quite suitable for easy magnetic separation also the close to zero magnetic remanence and negligible coercivity in the absence of an external magnetic field indicated that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was superparamagnetic 34 3 1 6 zeta potential measurement the surface charge characteristics of the adsorbent plays a key role in the adsorption process the surface charge characteristic and zero point charge phzpc of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was calculated by the zeta potential measurement within the ph range from 2 to 12 fig s2d as can be seen the zeta potential of the nanocomposite decreased from 15 9 to 27 6 mv with increasing the ph value from 2 0 to 12 indicating that the negative surface charges of the nanocomposite increased within the more alkaline conditions also the phzpc of nanocomposite was about 6 1 and shows that the adsorbent was positively charged at ph 6 1 and negatively charged at ph 6 1 the positive and negative surface charges of the adsorbent will play a very effective role in the formation of repulsion or electrostatic attraction with act and pq at different solution ph and make the role of solution ph in the adsorption process very significant 3 2 ccd rsm statistical analysis the adsorption process was optimized by ccd rsm statistical analysis along with desirability index and the adequacy of the model was studied by anova result in the optimization process the anova results based on the quadratic model are presented in table s2 the results showed that the p values were 0 05 and p values lack of fit were 0 05 which indicated the predicted model was significant and is able to predict the response for adsorption of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 35 36 a summary of the statistical model for the prediction of removal efficiency of act and pq was listed in table s3 the lower standard deviation mean sd values and the closer to 1 of r squared r2 values indicated that the predicted values are very close to the actual values response which is also clearly shown in fig s3a b also the difference between predicted r squared and adjusted r squared are 0 2 for both act and pq adsorption and shows that the predicted data are in good agreement with the obtained data 37 the adequate precision ap values were above 4 and indicated that noise did not cause a response error 38 the statistical significance of the factors affecting adsorption and determining their importance was shown by considering the line on the pareto charts in fig s3c d as can be seen in the pareto charts the most influential factors for the adsorption of act and pq were shown with a longer line and all factors above p 0 05 have been effective in the adsorption process the simultaneous effects of ph contact time and ph adsorbent mass on the removal efficiency of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 were studied by three dimensional 3d response surface plots as shown in fig 4 the results revealed that the r act fig 4a was more desirable at higher solution ph and contact times also in general the r pq fig 4b has increased with increasing of adsorbent mass and solution ph although the r pq decreased slightly with an excessive increase of solution ph value from 8 0 to 11 the simultaneous effects of other experimental conditions on the removal efficiency of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 are shown in fig 5 the simultaneous effects of contact time solution ph fig 5a and solution temperature solution ph fig 5b on r of act are shown and indicated that with increasing solution ph along with increasing contact time and solution temperature the r of act has increased this means that the act adsorption process was more favorable in alkaline conditions and the increase in contact time and temperature caused more saturation of the empty active sites of the nanocomposite which results in an increase in the adsorption rate and capacity also the simultaneous effects of the initial act concentration and the adsorbent mass fig 5c indicated that the r of act was increased with decreases of act initial concentration and increases of adsorbent mass which can be due to the more availability of active adsorption sites as well as less competition in the uptake of act molecules in adsorption process also the simultaneous effects of adsorbent mass solution ph fig 5c and contact time initial pq concentration fig 5d on r of pq are shown and revealed that generally have similar adsorption behaviors to the act adsorption process which can be due to the approximate proximity of the act and pq chemical structures also the predicted optimal conditions with experimental responses r for adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 are shown in table 1 as can be seen the adsorptive removal optimal conditions are predicted based on 100 removal efficiency the obtained average experimental responses with 5 replications of removal efficiency for pq and act were 99 23 1 83 and 99 41 2 21 respectively the proximity of the experimental data obtained with the predicted values showed the accuracy of the experiment design 3 3 adsorption isotherms studies the equilibrium removal data of act and pq from contaminated water were analyzed using four isotherm models and their corresponding parameters are given in table 2 according to the higher correlation coefficients r2 the langmuir isotherm model better described the adsorption process in both pq r2 0 999 and act r2 0 999 which suggesting that the adsorption process was monolayer chemisorption and occurred homogeneously 39 40 also the maximum langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities qm of pq and act were 1143 7 and 971 6 mg g 1 respectively table 3 the essential characteristics of the langmuir model can be described by the separation factor rl and indicated that both adsorption of pq 0 013 0 115 and act 0 012 0 111 were favorable 0 rl 1 in addition the energy of adsorption e obtained from the d r isotherm models 2 16 and 2 41 kj mol 1 were below 8kj mol 1 which suggests the physical adsorption process 41 therefore the results of isotherm models showed the participation of both physical and chemical interactions in the adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 3 4 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics studies the adsorption kinetics were analyzed by four kinetic models and their corresponding results were summarized in table s4 based on r2 values the pseudo second order model was most appropriate with experimental data and theoretically adsorbed amounts qe at equilibrium in the pseudo second order kinetics model were also close to the adsorbed amount at equilibrium obtained from the experiment hence the results indicated that the chemical adsorption process plays an important role in the adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 49 the adsorption thermodynamic parameters include the standard gibbs free energy g enthalpy h and entropy change s were calculated by van t hoffs plot at different temperatures 278 288 298 308 and 318 k and results are depicted in table s5 as can be seen the positive values of h were observed for pq 64 49 kj mol 1 and act 71 91 kj mol 1 and revealed the endothermic nature of the adsorption process which means that the adsorption is more desirable at higher temperatures 52 also h values above 40 kj mol 1 indicated the presence of chemical interactions in the adsorption process the negative g values showed the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process 53 and g values in the range of 0 to 20 kj mol 1 revealed that the adsorptions process of pq and act occurred more by physical adsorption 54 in addition decreasing δg values with increasing temperature showed that heat promoted the adsorption amount furthermore the positive values of s exhibited increased randomness along the adsorption process therefore the results of thermodynamic studies showed the cooperation of both physical and chemical interactions in the adsorption process which was consistent with the results of kinetic studies 3 5 identify the adsorption process the ftir uv vis and edx analysis before and after the adsorption process were used to confirm the adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 the ftir and uv vis results are shown in fig 6 the ftir analysis of m cuo ag pan zif 67 before and after adsorption of pq fig 6a and act fig 6b showed that some absorption bands of nanocomposite were shifted to higher lower wavelengths after the adsorption process also the some new absorption peaks related to act and pq have appeared in the nanocomposite spectrum which suggesting the involvement of chemical interaction in the adsorption process 55 56 on the other hand the act and pq removal from contaminated solutions were justified using uv vis measurements before and after the adsorption process the results showed the absorption intensity of pq fig 6c and act fig 6d were decreased significantly which indicates their very low secondary concentrations in solution after the adsorption process and confirms their effective removal also traces of act and pq absorbed in the m cuo ag pan zif 67 were clearly identified by the edx analysis and are shown in fig 7 the edx analysis after adsorption of act fig 7a shows only an increase in the wt of nitrogen element and doesn t show any additional element after adsorption the edx result after adsorption of pq fig 7b revealed the wt of nitrogen element n has increased and new pq related chlorine element cl has appeared which confirmed the adsorption of pq on the surface of the nanocomposite in addition the element cl was clearly visible throughout the nanocomposite s surface on the edx mapping suggesting that all components of the nanocomposite have been involved in the adsorption process 3 6 possible adsorption mechanisms the possible adsorption mechanisms were explained by isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies also the effects of solution ph on the adsorption efficiency as well as ftir studies before and after the adsorption process were used to more accurate identification of the existing molecular interactions in this regard the monolayer adsorption process better fit of the pseudo second order kinetic model as well as h values above 40 kj mol 1 provides clear evidence of the involvement of chemical interactions in the adsorption process also the appearance of act and pq related absorption peaks in the adsorbent ftir spectrum after the adsorption process was another evidence of the occurrence of chemical adsorption reciprocally the energy of adsorption e values obtained from the d r isotherm models were below 8 kj mol 1 and g values were in the range of 0 to 20 kj mol 1 suggested the physical adsorption process therefore the possible adsorption mechanisms of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 can be considered as the combination of physical and chemical interactions on the other hand the significant effect of solution ph on the adsorption efficiency of act and pq which is attributed to the surface charge of the adsorbent showed that the electrostatic interactions had a major role in the adsorption process also the molecular structures of act and pq showed that their aromatic rings have the ability to interact π π interactions with the zif 67 mofs aromatic rings in the adsorbent structure in addition the presence of oxygen containing surface functional groups in the nanocomposite and act pq structures and their absorption peak shifts in the ftir after the adsorption process also evidence the possibility of adsorption through hydrogen bonds in this regard hydrogen bonds electrostatic attractions and π π interactions may be major mechanisms of act and pq adsorption by the m cuo ag pan zif 67 3 7 antibacterial activity the antibacterial activity of m cuo ag pan zif 67 on e coli s aureus and b subtilis bacteria was examined by pour plate fig 8 and disc diffusion fig 9 methods as can be seen in digital images of the pour plate method fig 8a c the petri dishes with untreated bacteria as the control group were seen as cloudy in these images cloudy the agar medium indicates the massive growth of bacteria the relevant fesem images fig 8d i also clearly show the untreated bacteria morphologies indicating that the bacteria are without any damage in their morphology the digital images of the bacteria after co culture with m cuo ag pan zif 67 for 24 h fig 8j l show that the agar culture medium remained transparent and they are not cloudy the transparency of the agar culture medium indicated the lack of mass growth of bacteria and showed that the bacteria have not been grown in the presence of the nanocomposite also the relevant fesem images fig 8m r clearly shows the deposition of nanocomposite in bacteria and some of the bacteria have suffered destruction in their structure the antibacterial studies of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 and their raw materials by disc diffusion method were also evaluated based on the amount of inhibitory zone created shadow formed around the paper disks impregnated with them the related digital images are shown in fig 9a and the results are summarized in fig 9b the results showed that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 has a more effective antibacterial effect than its components based on their inhibitory zone e coli 2 mm s aureus 5 mm and b subtilis 6 mm which may be due to the synergy and intensification of antibacterial properties of the components together also it is shown that using cuo nanoparticles in the nanocomposite structure has enhanced the antibacterial effect of the composite escherichia coli s greater resistance to the antibacterial properties of the composite may be due to the presence of that outer lipid membrane which positive bacteria lack 2 57 on the other hand the surface of bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus contains surface functional groups such as amines and carboxyl these functional groups cause these bacteria to show a higher affinity for cuo and other metal oxide nanoparticles 58 in addition the antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite may be accredited to the generation of enhanced stages of reactive oxygen species ros and the deposition of nanocomposite on the surface of the bacteria 59 60 3 8 recycling of the adsorbent the reusability and stability of an antibacterial adsorbent are necessary factors for its cost effectiveness for this purpose after each experiment the spent adsorbent was easily collected from the reaction medium by a small magnet and regenerated by washing with methanol and chlorination method the effectiveness of methanol in desorption of pq and act is consistent with the results of other reports 61 62 then the regenerated adsorbent was washed with ultrapure water and was dried at 50 c for subsequent cycle reuse the reusability test results are given in fig s4 as can be seen in fig s4a the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was able to remove about 90 of act and 80 of pq from contaminated waters in the 7th reuse cycle and the reduction in adsorption efficiency may have been due to incomplete adsorbent regeneration and also saturation of some active adsorption sites in addition the reusability test result for antibacterial properties of m cuo ag pan zif 67 was shown in fig s4b the result showed that the bacterial reduction efficiency has remained above 90 until the 7th reuse cycle therefore the results showed that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 is an effective and economical candidate as an antibacterial adsorbent that can be used for water treatment purposes 3 9 practical efficiency of adsorbent the practical efficiency of adsorbent was explored for the removal of pq and act from the real water samples including tap water and river water initially the water samples were filtered through the whatman no 42 filter paper and then the initial concentrations of pq and act in these waters were measured and adjusted to 110 mg l 1 after that the adsorption process was taken under optimum conditions and the residual concentrations of pq and act were measured the results showed that the removal efficiency of adsorbent in tap water for pq and act was 91 and 95 respectively also the removal efficiency of pq and act in river water was 82 and 86 respectively the result indicated that the adsorbent showed excellent performance in real water samples 4 conclusion in this work a multifunctional m cuo ag pan zif 67 was synthesized in the presence of herbal aqueous extracts and was characterized in detail by xrd ftir fesem edx bet bjh vsm and zeta potential analysis the ability of the synthesized nanocomposite to adsorptive removal of acetaminophen and paraquat from contaminated water as well as its antibacterial properties on s aureus b subtilis and e coli bacteria were evaluated the model and optimize the adsorption process were performed based on maximizing removal efficiency of act and pq from aqueous solutions according to this ccd rsm was used and the significance of independent variables and their interactions were tested by the analysis of variance anova the adsorption results showed that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was able to remove 99 41 2 21 of act and 99 23 1 83 of pq from contaminated water under optimal conditions and the maximum langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities for act and pq were 971 6 and 1143 7 mg g 1 respectively the absorption of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 was well confirmed by ftir edx mapping and uv vis analysis the antibacterial properties of m cuo ag pan zif 67 was studied by pour plate and disk diffusion methods on gram positive s aureus and b subtilis bacteria and gram negative e coli bacterium the results showed that the bacterial suppression by nanocomposite was effective in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria nevertheless showed more effectiveness in gram positive bacteria also it concluded that the collective antibacterial effects of the nanocomposite are stronger than its components and copper doped has also strengthened the antibacterial properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12870,wastewaters are contaminated with both biological and chemical pollutants that must be eliminated before reuse and or disposal to surface waters this paper proposes a new magnetic cuo doped silver polyacrylonitrile zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 nanocomposite m cuo ag pan zif 67 that has multifunctional behavior for removing acetaminophen act and paraquat pq residuals from contaminated water while also acting as an antibacterial agent the antibacterial agent of as prepared nanocomposite on gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus s aureus and bacillus subtilis b subtilis and also gram negative bacteria escherichia coli e coli were studied to minimize the use of harmful chemicals and solvents fe3o4 ag and cuo nanoparticles were prepared through plant mediated green synthesis by renewable and non toxic aqueous extracts of aloe vera plant mulberry leaves and gundelia tournefortii l respectively the adsorption results showed that the nanocomposite could remove 99 41 2 21 of the act and 99 23 1 83 of the pq from the contaminated water the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of act and pq by nanocomposite was calculated as 971 6 and 1143 7 mg g 1 respectively which surpasses that of most nanocomposite based adsorbents also the adsorption kinetic data were well described with the pseudo second order model and the adsorption thermodynamic results showed the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature the antibacterial properties of nanocomposite were studied by pour plate and disk diffusion methods it was concluded that bacterial suppression by the nanocomposite was higher in the gram positive bacteria than in the gram negative bacterium the antibacterial results also showed that the collective antibacterial

data 1 introduction currently the growth of the presence of various types of emerging pollutants in water such as pharmacological pesticide and bacterial pollutions have become a serious problem that greatly threatens the environment and millions of humans health worldwide many of these pollutants in the environment even in low concentrations cause mutagenicity biological responses and adverse effects on human health and other living organisms 1 2 therefore the elimination of these pollutants and preventing their release into the environment is of particular importance acetaminophen act most known as paracetamol is widely used as a painkiller and antipyretic worldwide 3 continuous exposure to act can lead to serious illness and injuries due to its toxic effects and must be removed from the effluents before being released into the environment 4 pesticides are often agrochemical compounds that are used to kill repel or control pests and also increase productivity herbicides are a broad class of pesticides that are used to remove or inhibiting the growth of nuisance plants herbicides are of particular importance due to high solubility in water toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenic effects 5 paraquat pq is one of the most toxic pesticides that is widely used as an herbicide in agriculture and its residues have been reported in water sources 6 it is known that this pq can cause fatal or severe physiological damage if deliberately or accidentally ingested therefore its removal from water resources is very important 7 on the other hand bacteria are one of the most common types of microorganisms and bacterial contamination of drinking water is led to the spread of dangerous diseases and has become a major concern around the world with thousands of people around the world dying each year related to the use of unsafe water gram positive bacteria bacillus subtilis b subtilis and staphylococcus aureus s aureus and gram negative bacteria escherichia coli e coli are among the bacteria commonly associated with the human environment water contaminated with these bacteria can cause a wide range of clinical diseases and in some cases even mortality 8 the various methods including physical chemical membrane biological treatment and adsorption have been used for the treatment of unwanted pollutants from contaminated water 9 adsorption is considered a feasible flexible effective simple operation and economical technique to remove the wide range of pollution from water 10 over the past few years researchers explored various adsorbents for act and pq contaminated waters treatment however there are still multiple challenges in the adsorption process such as low adsorption capacity and regeneration of adsorbents therefore choice of an efficient adsorbent is very important in the last decades the use of composites to remove pollutants from contaminated water has received much attention from researchers and has been recognized that the nanocomposites fabricated by dispersing nanoparticles in polymer melts have a much better performance than traditional composites and may exhibit multifunctional behaviors 11 the development of multifunctional nanocomposites by combining different nanomaterials and benefiting from their physical chemical and biological properties can create more potential applications in the form of a cohesive structure 12 zeolitic imidazole framework 67 zif 67 is one of the water stable metal organic frameworks mofs which have attractive properties containing high surface area high porosity chemical stability and simple synthesis and has been used in the treatment of many kinds of polluted water besides some work demonstrated that the zif 67 show considerable bactericidal activity toward s aureus and e coli 13 on the other hand it is accepted that some metal and metal oxide nanoparticles show antibacterial behaviors among these materials silver ag and copper oxide cuo nanoparticles have attracted much attention and have been used in a variety of antibacterial activities 14 the potent antibacterial properties of silver have led to its widespread use in medical applications nowadays silver nanoparticles are used as effective nanomaterials against a wide range of bacteria 15 the cuo structures have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to their unique properties such as cheapness very low toxicity high antibacterial properties high adsorption performance and narrow bandwidth 16 17 in recent years researchers reported that the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles could be enhanced by combining with cuo nanoparticles 18 in this paper a magnetic cuo doped silver polyacrylonitrile zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 nanocomposite m cuo ag pan zif 67 was successfully synthesized by plant mediated green synthesis methodology by renewable and non toxic aqueous extracts of aloe vera plant mulberry leaves and gundelia tournefortii l the overall schematic of the preparation steps has been illustrated in fig 1 then the application of as prepared m cuo ag pan zif 67 in the adsorptive removal of pq and act residues as well as the antibacterial effects on gram positive s aureus and b subtilis bacteria and also gram negative e coli bacteria were evaluated in the adsorption process the effects of independent variables including initial concentrations of act pq solution ph adsorbent mass contact time and solution temperature on act pq adsorption efficiency from aqueous solutions were determined and optimized in addition the antibacterial properties of m cuo ag pan zif 67 were studied by pour plate standard method 9215b and disk diffusion methods 2 experimental the chemicals instruments and preparation methods were all specified in the electronic supplementary information 2 1 adsorption experiments all the experiments were conducted in a lab scale batch reactor and the residual concentrations of act and pq were analyzed using uv visible spectrophotometer at their maximum absorption wavelength of λmax 243 and λ 257 nm respectively the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe each time qt and the removal percentage r of the act and pq were determined by the following equations 19 20 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 mg removal r c 0 c e c 0 100 where qe mg g 1 shows the act pq adsorption amounts qt mg g 1 adsorption amounts at any time c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 the initial and equilibrium act pq concentrations respectively and ct mg l 1 act pq concentrations at any time t v l volume of the act pq solutions and m g denotes the mass of the adsorbent in this study the adsorption of act and pq by nanocomposite was optimized using the ccd rsm table s1 by design expert 7 0 software in the optimization process the responses were chosen based on a quadratic model also the adsorption data were processed by analysis of variance anova and the interaction between the independent variables and their responses were studied 21 22 the independent variables affecting adsorption efficiency such as initial act pq concentrations solution ph adsorbent mass sonication time frequency 20 khz power 50 w and solution temperature were investigated systematically with conducted 25 optimal number of experiments the isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies were contended by the equilibrium experiments 2 2 antibacterial experiments in this study two different methods of pour plate standard method 9215b 23 and disk diffusion 18 24 methods were followed for the evaluation of the antibacterial activities of the as prepared nanocomposite by applied the different concentrations 50 500 μg ml 1 for antibacterial experiments the three bacterial strains gram negative escherichia coli e coli atcc 25922 gram positive bacillus subtilis b subtilis atcc 21332 and staphylococcus aureus s aureus atcc 29213 were tested in summary in the pour plate method a certain concentration of nanocomposite was mixed with sterilized warm 40 45 c mueller hinton agar mha also 1 ml of diluted specimen bacterial suspension 1 0 109 cfu ml were poured into the sterile plate then the warm agar was poured into the bacterial containing plate and after the mixing was allowed to solidify finally plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c until bacterial colonies grow also a control plate was also incubated for each bacterial strain without the addition of nanocomposite in the disk diffusion method the fresh bacteria cultures were prepared onto mha plates the antibiotic test discs 6 mm impregnated with nanomaterials are then placed on the agar surface then plates were incubated and the bacteria were allowed to grow completely for 24 h at 37 c finally the clear inhibition zones formed around the test discs were measured 25 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 crystallographic analysis the phase purity and crystallinity of the prepared samples were studied by the xrd patterns and results are presented in fig 2 the characteristic diffraction peaks of zif 67 mofs fig 2a showed that the resulted pattern was consistent with the reported pattern of zif 67 mofs 26 and no extra peaks were observed also the sharp peaks reveal the good crystallinity of zif 67 mofs the xrd pattern of as synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 2b shows good agreement with the data of cubic spinel fe3o4 structure jcpds card no 19 0629 27 the xrd pattern of the as synthesized ag nanoparticles fig 2c shows the characteristics peaks around 38 1 111 and 44 2 200 which is in good agreement with the face centered cubic form of metallic silver jcpds card no 04 0783 28 the xrd pattern of pure pan fig 2d shows a sharp crystalline peak at 17 1 110 corresponding to orthorhombic pan reflection the xrd pattern of the m ag pan zif 67 fig 2e well matched with the naked zif 67 mofs fe3o4 nps ag nps and pan polymer patterns no extra peaks were observed due to the purity of the synthesized nanocomposite and all the peaks were at the right place despite a slight shifting due to interactions between each other in the xrd pattern of m cuo ag pan zif 67 fig 2f the new diffraction peaks have appeared at 36 002 and 39 7 200 along with other peaks related to m ag pan zif 67 the appeared new peaks can be indexed to cubic crystalline phase of cuo jcpds card no 78 0428 29 which confirm the successful dopping of cuo nps on m ag pan zif 67 in addition the average crystallite size of nanocomposite was calculated using scherrer s equation 30 and was determined to be 35 5 nm 3 1 2 surface functional groups analysis the surface functional groups of prepared samples were identified by ftir analysis and results are shown in fig s1 for zif 67 mofs fig s1a the vibrational bands in the range of 600 1300 cm 1 and 1355 cm 1 correspond to the characteristic stretching and bending modes of the imidazole ring and cn in 2 methylimidazole hmim respectively 31 for fe3o4 nps fig s1b the sharp absorption band around 582 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of feo bonds of fe3o4 nps the weak absorption band around 1050 cm 1 is due to the co stretching vibration that may be related to the remnants of using aloe vera leaves extract in the case of ag nps fig s1c the ftir spectra consist of absorption bands correspond to the stretching vibration of ch co and co bonds attributed to the presence of various phytochemicals in the used extract 32 in the ftir spectrum of the pan polymer fig s1d the absorption peaks attributed to the vibration of ch oh co and cn bonds were appeared in the range of 400 2300 cm 1 in the m ag pan zif 67 spectrum fig s1e all the main absorption bands of zif 67 mofs fe3o4 nps ag nps and pan polymer are cumulatively visible with a slight shift which confirms the presence of all their surface functional groups in the nanocomposite structure compared to the ftir spectrum of the m ag pan zif 67 the ftir spectrum of m cuo ag pan zif 67 fig s1f show the additional absorption bands at 516 and 620 cm 1 which can be attributed to the cuo stretching vibrations 33 and confirmed that the cuo nanoparticles has successfully doped on nanocomposite structure 3 1 3 morphological and elemental composition analysis the surface morphology and elemental composition of m cuo ag pan zif 67 were studied by fesem edx analysis as shown in fig 3 the fesem image fig 3a show that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 structure consisting of nanoparticles with different morphologies and sizes the elemental composition of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was investigated as weight percentage by edx analysis fig 3b the edx spectrum reported that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 rendered the elements of silver ag carbon c cobalt co oxygen o copper cu iron fe nitrogen n and which indicates the presence of zif 67 mofs fe3o4 ag and cuo nanoparticles in the nanocomposite structure also the distribution of the elements on the surface of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 is presented by the edx mapping analysis fig 3c as can be seen the distribution of elements was almost uniform and elements regions were clearly observed on the nanocomposite surface 3 1 4 porosity and textural analysis the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm fig s2a of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 exhibited a type iii isotherm with a type h3 loop suggesting the presence of the agglomerated solids particles with the non uniform size and shape 34 also the h3 hysteresis loop is often associated with solids with a very wide distribution of pore size the pore size distribution fig s2b was manifested by the bjh method the result revealed that the prepared sample has a wide range of pore sizes 60 nm and the bet specific surface area and total pore volume were about 271 8 m2 g 1 and 1 0 cm3 g 1 respectively 3 1 5 magnetic measurement the easy separation capability of used adsorbent from the reaction medium is essential for its practical applications magnetic separation using a magnet is one of the most accessible methods in this field the vsm study was used to evaluate the magnetic property of the synthesized m cuo ag pan zif 67 at room temperature in the applied field ranging from 10 000 to 10 000 oe from the vsm measurement fig s2c the saturation magnetization ms of m cuo ag pan zif 67 and naked fe3o4 nanoparticles were determined 6 20 and 76 73 emu g 1 respectively the decrease in the ms value of the nanocomposite compared to naked fe3o4 nanoparticles was attributed mainly to the low fe3o4 content in the nanocomposite structure however this small ms value was also quite suitable for easy magnetic separation also the close to zero magnetic remanence and negligible coercivity in the absence of an external magnetic field indicated that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was superparamagnetic 34 3 1 6 zeta potential measurement the surface charge characteristics of the adsorbent plays a key role in the adsorption process the surface charge characteristic and zero point charge phzpc of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was calculated by the zeta potential measurement within the ph range from 2 to 12 fig s2d as can be seen the zeta potential of the nanocomposite decreased from 15 9 to 27 6 mv with increasing the ph value from 2 0 to 12 indicating that the negative surface charges of the nanocomposite increased within the more alkaline conditions also the phzpc of nanocomposite was about 6 1 and shows that the adsorbent was positively charged at ph 6 1 and negatively charged at ph 6 1 the positive and negative surface charges of the adsorbent will play a very effective role in the formation of repulsion or electrostatic attraction with act and pq at different solution ph and make the role of solution ph in the adsorption process very significant 3 2 ccd rsm statistical analysis the adsorption process was optimized by ccd rsm statistical analysis along with desirability index and the adequacy of the model was studied by anova result in the optimization process the anova results based on the quadratic model are presented in table s2 the results showed that the p values were 0 05 and p values lack of fit were 0 05 which indicated the predicted model was significant and is able to predict the response for adsorption of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 35 36 a summary of the statistical model for the prediction of removal efficiency of act and pq was listed in table s3 the lower standard deviation mean sd values and the closer to 1 of r squared r2 values indicated that the predicted values are very close to the actual values response which is also clearly shown in fig s3a b also the difference between predicted r squared and adjusted r squared are 0 2 for both act and pq adsorption and shows that the predicted data are in good agreement with the obtained data 37 the adequate precision ap values were above 4 and indicated that noise did not cause a response error 38 the statistical significance of the factors affecting adsorption and determining their importance was shown by considering the line on the pareto charts in fig s3c d as can be seen in the pareto charts the most influential factors for the adsorption of act and pq were shown with a longer line and all factors above p 0 05 have been effective in the adsorption process the simultaneous effects of ph contact time and ph adsorbent mass on the removal efficiency of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 were studied by three dimensional 3d response surface plots as shown in fig 4 the results revealed that the r act fig 4a was more desirable at higher solution ph and contact times also in general the r pq fig 4b has increased with increasing of adsorbent mass and solution ph although the r pq decreased slightly with an excessive increase of solution ph value from 8 0 to 11 the simultaneous effects of other experimental conditions on the removal efficiency of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 are shown in fig 5 the simultaneous effects of contact time solution ph fig 5a and solution temperature solution ph fig 5b on r of act are shown and indicated that with increasing solution ph along with increasing contact time and solution temperature the r of act has increased this means that the act adsorption process was more favorable in alkaline conditions and the increase in contact time and temperature caused more saturation of the empty active sites of the nanocomposite which results in an increase in the adsorption rate and capacity also the simultaneous effects of the initial act concentration and the adsorbent mass fig 5c indicated that the r of act was increased with decreases of act initial concentration and increases of adsorbent mass which can be due to the more availability of active adsorption sites as well as less competition in the uptake of act molecules in adsorption process also the simultaneous effects of adsorbent mass solution ph fig 5c and contact time initial pq concentration fig 5d on r of pq are shown and revealed that generally have similar adsorption behaviors to the act adsorption process which can be due to the approximate proximity of the act and pq chemical structures also the predicted optimal conditions with experimental responses r for adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 are shown in table 1 as can be seen the adsorptive removal optimal conditions are predicted based on 100 removal efficiency the obtained average experimental responses with 5 replications of removal efficiency for pq and act were 99 23 1 83 and 99 41 2 21 respectively the proximity of the experimental data obtained with the predicted values showed the accuracy of the experiment design 3 3 adsorption isotherms studies the equilibrium removal data of act and pq from contaminated water were analyzed using four isotherm models and their corresponding parameters are given in table 2 according to the higher correlation coefficients r2 the langmuir isotherm model better described the adsorption process in both pq r2 0 999 and act r2 0 999 which suggesting that the adsorption process was monolayer chemisorption and occurred homogeneously 39 40 also the maximum langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities qm of pq and act were 1143 7 and 971 6 mg g 1 respectively table 3 the essential characteristics of the langmuir model can be described by the separation factor rl and indicated that both adsorption of pq 0 013 0 115 and act 0 012 0 111 were favorable 0 rl 1 in addition the energy of adsorption e obtained from the d r isotherm models 2 16 and 2 41 kj mol 1 were below 8kj mol 1 which suggests the physical adsorption process 41 therefore the results of isotherm models showed the participation of both physical and chemical interactions in the adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 3 4 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics studies the adsorption kinetics were analyzed by four kinetic models and their corresponding results were summarized in table s4 based on r2 values the pseudo second order model was most appropriate with experimental data and theoretically adsorbed amounts qe at equilibrium in the pseudo second order kinetics model were also close to the adsorbed amount at equilibrium obtained from the experiment hence the results indicated that the chemical adsorption process plays an important role in the adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 49 the adsorption thermodynamic parameters include the standard gibbs free energy g enthalpy h and entropy change s were calculated by van t hoffs plot at different temperatures 278 288 298 308 and 318 k and results are depicted in table s5 as can be seen the positive values of h were observed for pq 64 49 kj mol 1 and act 71 91 kj mol 1 and revealed the endothermic nature of the adsorption process which means that the adsorption is more desirable at higher temperatures 52 also h values above 40 kj mol 1 indicated the presence of chemical interactions in the adsorption process the negative g values showed the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process 53 and g values in the range of 0 to 20 kj mol 1 revealed that the adsorptions process of pq and act occurred more by physical adsorption 54 in addition decreasing δg values with increasing temperature showed that heat promoted the adsorption amount furthermore the positive values of s exhibited increased randomness along the adsorption process therefore the results of thermodynamic studies showed the cooperation of both physical and chemical interactions in the adsorption process which was consistent with the results of kinetic studies 3 5 identify the adsorption process the ftir uv vis and edx analysis before and after the adsorption process were used to confirm the adsorptive removal of pq and act by m cuo ag pan zif 67 the ftir and uv vis results are shown in fig 6 the ftir analysis of m cuo ag pan zif 67 before and after adsorption of pq fig 6a and act fig 6b showed that some absorption bands of nanocomposite were shifted to higher lower wavelengths after the adsorption process also the some new absorption peaks related to act and pq have appeared in the nanocomposite spectrum which suggesting the involvement of chemical interaction in the adsorption process 55 56 on the other hand the act and pq removal from contaminated solutions were justified using uv vis measurements before and after the adsorption process the results showed the absorption intensity of pq fig 6c and act fig 6d were decreased significantly which indicates their very low secondary concentrations in solution after the adsorption process and confirms their effective removal also traces of act and pq absorbed in the m cuo ag pan zif 67 were clearly identified by the edx analysis and are shown in fig 7 the edx analysis after adsorption of act fig 7a shows only an increase in the wt of nitrogen element and doesn t show any additional element after adsorption the edx result after adsorption of pq fig 7b revealed the wt of nitrogen element n has increased and new pq related chlorine element cl has appeared which confirmed the adsorption of pq on the surface of the nanocomposite in addition the element cl was clearly visible throughout the nanocomposite s surface on the edx mapping suggesting that all components of the nanocomposite have been involved in the adsorption process 3 6 possible adsorption mechanisms the possible adsorption mechanisms were explained by isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies also the effects of solution ph on the adsorption efficiency as well as ftir studies before and after the adsorption process were used to more accurate identification of the existing molecular interactions in this regard the monolayer adsorption process better fit of the pseudo second order kinetic model as well as h values above 40 kj mol 1 provides clear evidence of the involvement of chemical interactions in the adsorption process also the appearance of act and pq related absorption peaks in the adsorbent ftir spectrum after the adsorption process was another evidence of the occurrence of chemical adsorption reciprocally the energy of adsorption e values obtained from the d r isotherm models were below 8 kj mol 1 and g values were in the range of 0 to 20 kj mol 1 suggested the physical adsorption process therefore the possible adsorption mechanisms of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 can be considered as the combination of physical and chemical interactions on the other hand the significant effect of solution ph on the adsorption efficiency of act and pq which is attributed to the surface charge of the adsorbent showed that the electrostatic interactions had a major role in the adsorption process also the molecular structures of act and pq showed that their aromatic rings have the ability to interact π π interactions with the zif 67 mofs aromatic rings in the adsorbent structure in addition the presence of oxygen containing surface functional groups in the nanocomposite and act pq structures and their absorption peak shifts in the ftir after the adsorption process also evidence the possibility of adsorption through hydrogen bonds in this regard hydrogen bonds electrostatic attractions and π π interactions may be major mechanisms of act and pq adsorption by the m cuo ag pan zif 67 3 7 antibacterial activity the antibacterial activity of m cuo ag pan zif 67 on e coli s aureus and b subtilis bacteria was examined by pour plate fig 8 and disc diffusion fig 9 methods as can be seen in digital images of the pour plate method fig 8a c the petri dishes with untreated bacteria as the control group were seen as cloudy in these images cloudy the agar medium indicates the massive growth of bacteria the relevant fesem images fig 8d i also clearly show the untreated bacteria morphologies indicating that the bacteria are without any damage in their morphology the digital images of the bacteria after co culture with m cuo ag pan zif 67 for 24 h fig 8j l show that the agar culture medium remained transparent and they are not cloudy the transparency of the agar culture medium indicated the lack of mass growth of bacteria and showed that the bacteria have not been grown in the presence of the nanocomposite also the relevant fesem images fig 8m r clearly shows the deposition of nanocomposite in bacteria and some of the bacteria have suffered destruction in their structure the antibacterial studies of the m cuo ag pan zif 67 and their raw materials by disc diffusion method were also evaluated based on the amount of inhibitory zone created shadow formed around the paper disks impregnated with them the related digital images are shown in fig 9a and the results are summarized in fig 9b the results showed that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 has a more effective antibacterial effect than its components based on their inhibitory zone e coli 2 mm s aureus 5 mm and b subtilis 6 mm which may be due to the synergy and intensification of antibacterial properties of the components together also it is shown that using cuo nanoparticles in the nanocomposite structure has enhanced the antibacterial effect of the composite escherichia coli s greater resistance to the antibacterial properties of the composite may be due to the presence of that outer lipid membrane which positive bacteria lack 2 57 on the other hand the surface of bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus contains surface functional groups such as amines and carboxyl these functional groups cause these bacteria to show a higher affinity for cuo and other metal oxide nanoparticles 58 in addition the antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite may be accredited to the generation of enhanced stages of reactive oxygen species ros and the deposition of nanocomposite on the surface of the bacteria 59 60 3 8 recycling of the adsorbent the reusability and stability of an antibacterial adsorbent are necessary factors for its cost effectiveness for this purpose after each experiment the spent adsorbent was easily collected from the reaction medium by a small magnet and regenerated by washing with methanol and chlorination method the effectiveness of methanol in desorption of pq and act is consistent with the results of other reports 61 62 then the regenerated adsorbent was washed with ultrapure water and was dried at 50 c for subsequent cycle reuse the reusability test results are given in fig s4 as can be seen in fig s4a the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was able to remove about 90 of act and 80 of pq from contaminated waters in the 7th reuse cycle and the reduction in adsorption efficiency may have been due to incomplete adsorbent regeneration and also saturation of some active adsorption sites in addition the reusability test result for antibacterial properties of m cuo ag pan zif 67 was shown in fig s4b the result showed that the bacterial reduction efficiency has remained above 90 until the 7th reuse cycle therefore the results showed that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 is an effective and economical candidate as an antibacterial adsorbent that can be used for water treatment purposes 3 9 practical efficiency of adsorbent the practical efficiency of adsorbent was explored for the removal of pq and act from the real water samples including tap water and river water initially the water samples were filtered through the whatman no 42 filter paper and then the initial concentrations of pq and act in these waters were measured and adjusted to 110 mg l 1 after that the adsorption process was taken under optimum conditions and the residual concentrations of pq and act were measured the results showed that the removal efficiency of adsorbent in tap water for pq and act was 91 and 95 respectively also the removal efficiency of pq and act in river water was 82 and 86 respectively the result indicated that the adsorbent showed excellent performance in real water samples 4 conclusion in this work a multifunctional m cuo ag pan zif 67 was synthesized in the presence of herbal aqueous extracts and was characterized in detail by xrd ftir fesem edx bet bjh vsm and zeta potential analysis the ability of the synthesized nanocomposite to adsorptive removal of acetaminophen and paraquat from contaminated water as well as its antibacterial properties on s aureus b subtilis and e coli bacteria were evaluated the model and optimize the adsorption process were performed based on maximizing removal efficiency of act and pq from aqueous solutions according to this ccd rsm was used and the significance of independent variables and their interactions were tested by the analysis of variance anova the adsorption results showed that the m cuo ag pan zif 67 was able to remove 99 41 2 21 of act and 99 23 1 83 of pq from contaminated water under optimal conditions and the maximum langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities for act and pq were 971 6 and 1143 7 mg g 1 respectively the absorption of act and pq by m cuo ag pan zif 67 was well confirmed by ftir edx mapping and uv vis analysis the antibacterial properties of m cuo ag pan zif 67 was studied by pour plate and disk diffusion methods on gram positive s aureus and b subtilis bacteria and gram negative e coli bacterium the results showed that the bacterial suppression by nanocomposite was effective in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria nevertheless showed more effectiveness in gram positive bacteria also it concluded that the collective antibacterial effects of the nanocomposite are stronger than its components and copper doped has also strengthened the antibacterial properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12871,photocatalysis provides a green strategy to eliminate the emerging pollutants of antibiotics however it remains challenging to design robust photocatalyst to fulfil the requirement of industrial implementation herein a novel z scheme covalent triazine based framework ctf bi2wo6 heterojunction photocatalyst was rationally fabricated by interfacial engineering of layered ctf 1 into flower like bi2wo6 for photocatalytic removal of antibiotic using tetracycline tc as a representative the structural physicochemical and electrochemical capabilities of the as prepared photocatalyst were explored in detail by a range of advanced analyses the results showed that the optimized ctf bi2wo6 exhibited superior photocatalytic performance affording a tc removal efficacy of 77 14 within 60 min which was approximately 18 times and 2 67 times that of individual ctf 1 and bi2wo6 respectively the boosting property could be attributed to the z scheme heterostructure which significantly reinforced the transfer and separation of photoinduced carriers meanwhile the dominate reactive species participating in the degradation process were probed as o2 and h based on scavenger experiments and esr analyses finally the degradation pathway of tc by ctf bi2wo6 was proposed based on intermediate products and the toxicity of tc and its degradation products were estimated by the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t this study showcases a feasible pathway towards designing ctf based z scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for effective and eco friendly antibiotic wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords covalent triazine based framework z scheme antibiotic photocatalytic degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are common pharmaceutical drugs that help combat bacterial infections worldwide their antimicrobial mechanisms typically proceed through inactivating or inhibiting the proliferation of bacteria however in decent decades antibiotics have been overused by human beings and they are inevitably released into the environments mainly the aquatic systems 1 2 the occurrence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment can pose a severe threat to the entire ecosystem 3 4 prior to discharge most antibiotic residues are transferred to wastewater treatment plants wwtps and subjected to conventional wastewater treatments e g biological treatments in urban areas 5 however due to the robust stability of antibiotics and the stubborn nature of biological treatment it is challenging to effectively eliminate antibiotics by biological methods 6 based on this many effective and economical technologies for the removal of antibiotics have been executed to date including adsorption 7 electrocoagulation 8 membrane separation 9 and photocatalysis 10 11 among them photocatalytic degradation is outstanding because of its advantages of simple operation low cost and thorough treatment 12 recently photocatalytic technology based on semiconductor photocatalysts has been extensively recognized as an efficacious and environmentally friendly technology in the aspect of antibiotics degradation and mineralization 13 14 when irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength reactive species rss including hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 hole h electron e and h2o2 can be generated these rss are highly oxidative and responsible for the breakdown of organic molecules to date many types of photocatalysts e g tio2 15 cds 16 zno 17 and in2s3 18 have been fabricated and successfully applied for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants such as dyes pesticides and antibiotics nevertheless it is noteworthy that a large amount of photocatalysts are precious metal oxides and suffer from disadvantages including the low efficiency of solar energy low stability and rapid integration of photoinduced carriers which severely limit their practical application 19 20 hence seeking robust photocatalysts is still a crucial step towards the application of photocatalytic technology for antibiotic elimination more recently novel organic semiconductor photocatalysts have been rationally designed to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages 21 a stunning representative organic photocatalyst is covalent triazine based frameworks ctfs constructed by covalent bonds connecting polymers with high crystallinity and high porosity 22 23 ctf is a representative covalent organic framework cof and has attracted enormous attention in recent years due to the merits of high surface area rich pore structures multiple active sites and the tunable structures previously ctf based photocatalysts have showcased superior activities in photocatalytic pollutant degradation co2 reduction and water treatment 24 26 the superiority can be attributed to the specific periodic ordered columnar array of π conjugated aromatic rings structure in ctfs which have a zealous effect on the electron delocalization and thus permit an excellent photo generated charges transfer and outstanding photoconductivity 27 besides due to the solid covalent bond connection ctfs materials possess relatively high thermal and chemical stability giving ctfs a considerable long lifetime as photocatalysts 28 29 taking the various attractive advantages into consideration it is desirable to employ ctf based composites for the photocatalytic treatment of antibiotics 30 31 for example chao et al developed a novel tio2 based photocatalyst modified with ctfs which exhibited a relatively higher capacity for carbamazepine removal 32 nevertheless the photocatalytic application of ctf based photocatalysts is severely limited by the arduous synthesis process and high cost 33 34 to overcome these shortcomings a novel ctfs material called ctf 1 with a suitable band gap 2 94 ev was fabricated via facile procedures under mild conditions by our research group 35 despite the ctf 1 prepared by this simple method has excellent visible light absorption property its activity can be further improved currently constructing z scheme heterojunction has been confirmed as an effective means to expedite the transportation of photo induced carriers thus improving the photocatalytic performance 36 the establishment of the z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst requires two different photocatalysts with interlaced band structures with this consideration in mind the bi2wo6 can be regarded as an excellent counterpart of ctf 1 to construct the z scheme heterojunction in addition bi2wo6 possesses the merits of a wide range of visible light responses high resistance against acid alkali and satisfactory thermal stability 37 therefore it is rationally anticipated that the ctf 1 and bi2wo6 z scheme heterojunction could serve as a robust photocatalytic system for antibiotic degradation 38 herein we are engineering a z scheme ctf bi2wo6 heterojunction photocatalyst through a facile solvothermal approach towards the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics for the first time tetracycline tc is selected as a typical antibiotic to assess the photocatalytic property of the ctf bi2wo6 composite this work aims to elucidate the following issues i the activity and kinetics of the z scheme ctf bi2wo6 heterojunction in the elimination of tc ii the dominant rss involved in the degradation process iii the electron flow within the ctf bi2wo6 composite iv the degradation mechanism and pathway of tetracycline and v toxicity changes of tc and its degradation intermediates the outcomes of this experiment are of great significance towards the progress of ctf based photocatalysts and are expected to make a remarkable contribution to solving the problems of antibiotics pollution 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of ctf 1 analytical grade chemical reagents were used for all sample preparations the detailed synthesis method of ctf 1 was reported previously 35 first trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 20 ml was gently mixed in 1 4 dicyanobenzene 2 56 g in a flask at 0 c a compound of ice and water the obtained suspension was stirred and kept for 3 days then the resulting solid was respectively rinsed with diluted ammonia solution and dichloromethane afterwards the obtained product was dispersed in a dilute ammonia solution of the same concentration under continuous stirring after 12 h the stirred solution was centrifuged with methanol and distilled water several times then using methanol and dichloromethane refluxed the harvested pellet continuing for 12 h and then vacuum dried at 80 c overnight finally the obtained solid was ground into a powder named ctf 1 2 2 preparation of ctf bi2wo6 composites as shown in scheme 1 ctf bi2wo6 composites with various mass ratios were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method first 0 5 mmol na2wo4 2h2o and a certain amount of ctf 1 were transferred to 50 ml distilled water to obtain samples the mass ratios of ctf 1 bi2wo6 were 3 5 10 15 the compound was subjected to 30 min ultrasonicated treatment and then blended vigorously for 2 h meanwhile 1 0 mmol bi no3 3 5h2o was dispersed into 10 ml glacial acetic acid and after thoroughly stirring for 1 h it was slowly poured into the mixed solution of na2wo4 2h2o and ctf 1 the obtained mixture underwent 2 h stirring and was then transferred to a 100 ml autoclave then heated and kept at 180 c for 14 h when the resultant liquid was cooled to room temperature it was collected by centrifugation and washed respectively with distilled water and ethanol several times eventually the products were vacuum dried at 60 c and denoted as 3 5 10 and 15 ctf bi2wo6 respectively the pure bi2wo6 sample was prepared with the same process without the addition of ctf 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of morphology and porous structure the sem and tem images of the as prepared compounds were indicated in fig 1 it could be observed that the bi2wo6 sample fig 1a presented a uniform flower spherical structure with the petal like flakes being smooth and clean the sem and tem images of the samples fig 1b c demonstrated the graphene like layered structure of ctf 1 for the ctf bi2wo6 sample the mass ratio of 5 unless otherwise stated was taken as a representative fig 1d flocculent like substances were embedded or wrapped in the aperture and surface of the spherical structure indicating that ctf 1 was successfully loaded on the flower spherical like bi2wo6 this observation was confirmed by the tem and hrtem images as indicated in fig 1d and e it can be noticed that layered ctf 1 was embedded on the surface of bi2wo6 as illustrated in fig 1f g and h the closer observation of the hrtem image revealed a lattice spacing of 0 315 nm which was associated with the bi2wo6 113 crystal plane 39 thus it can be inferred that layered ctf 1 was tightly coupled with bi2wo6 to further probe the elemental distribution profile of the ctf bi2wo6 composite the energy dispersive x ray edx mappings of c n o bi and w fig 1i were performed the results revealed that all the mentioned elements were evenly distributed indicating the homogeneity of ctf bi2wo6 according to the electron microscopies observations we can confirm the successful preparation of ctf and bi2wo6 heterostructure with a well attached interface as illustrated in fig s1 n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were implemented to comprehend the bet surface area pore volume and corresponding pore size distributions of the as prepared compounds and the corresponding data are listed in table s1 all samples presented iv type isotherms which were indicative of mesoporous structures 2 50 nm in addition the isotherms of all the samples presented similar shapes suggesting that the samples possessed analogous porous structures in addition as illustrated in table s1 ctf bi2wo6 had a relatively high bet surface area 30 0 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 06 cm3 g 1 which were much higher than those of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 furthermore the average pore size of ctf bi2wo6 was 17 nm while the ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were 8 8 nm and 10 6 nm respectively which were smaller than that of ctf bi2wo6 the significant increase in the surface area aspect of ctf bi2wo6 could be attributed to the fact that ctf 1 was embedded in the interspace of the flower spherical structure of bi2wo6 it was expected that large specific surface area and pore size were decided in favour of increasing the exposed areas to reactants such as antibiotics and o2 molecular which were presumably conducive to boosting the photocatalytic removal of antibiotics 3 2 phase structures and chemical compositions xrd tests were employed to gain insight into the crystal structure of the samples as indicated in fig 2a the diffraction peaks at 25 2 and 26 9 for the pure ctf 1 corresponded to the stacking of conjugated aromatic systems 40 and the layered stacking structure 41 respectively as for the bi2wo6 sample the prominent characteristic peaks at 28 3 32 7 47 1 and 56 0 were indexed to the lattice planes of 113 060 202 and 133 of bi2wo6 42 the diffraction patterns of the ctf bi2wo6 series samples were almost identical to bi2wo6 whereas the characteristic peaks of ctf 1 were hardly recognized this phenomenon can be attributed to the low dosage and low crystallinity of ctf 1 in the composite samples nevertheless we can still infer that the ctf bi2wo6 samples maintained the intrinsic crystal structure of bi2wo6 ft ir spectra were obtained to further explore the functional aspects of the samples further as illustrated in fig 2b there were two characteristic peaks located at 1357 and 1508 cm 1 of the ctf 1 samples which could be ascribed to the stretching oscillation of cn in the triazine unit 43 these peaks were consistently observed in all the ctf bi2wo6 samples implying the existence of ctf 1 in the composites likewise the pure bi2wo6 and ctf bi2wo6 materials shared three characteristic peaks located at 812 731 and 572 cm 1 which were associated with the stretching vibrations of bio and wo bonds 44 collectively the xrd pattern and ftir analyses confirmed that ctf bi2wo6 composites with high quality were obtained fig 2 as illustrated in fig 3 the elements and the chemical status of the samples were inspected by xps the overall xps spectrum of ctf 1 suggested that the c n and o elements were well resolved and for the 5 ctf bi2wo6 c n o bi and w elements can be distinctly observed fig 3a the high resolution c 1s spectra of ctf 1 and ctf bi2wo6 samples fig 3b exhibited two characteristic peaks which had a central point of 287 3 and 284 6 ev respectively and they corresponded with cn bonds in the triazine ring and sp2 hybridized cc bonds in the aromatic carbon 45 as illustrated in fig 3c the n 1s xps spectra of individual ctf 1 showed a prominent peak located at 399 2 ev which was associated with pyridinic n c n c in fig 3d the peak located at 530 0 ev was attributable to the bio bond of bi2wo6 46 as depicted in fig 3e the presence of bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 was verified by two strong peaks at 164 7 and 159 4 ev which were indicative of bi3 47 the two intense peaks of 37 5 and 35 4 ev were attributed to w 4f5 2 and w 4f7 2 fig 3f respectively suggesting the presence of w6 48 notably the n 1s peak of ctf bi2wo6 underwent a slight blue shift by 0 3 ev whereas the bi 4f peaks of ctf bi2wo6 were subjected to a red shift by 0 1 ev in comparison to the pristine ctf 1 based on this observation it was reasonable to postulate that a strong interfacial interaction occurred between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 and this interaction presumably proceeded through the n atoms on ctf 1 and bi on bi2wo6 3 3 analysis of the optical property the uv vis drs analysis was carried out to obtain insightful information regarding the light absorption capacity and bandgap features of the samples as presented in fig 4a ctf 1 and bi2wo6 exhibited an absorption edge at approximately 420 and 475 nm respectively in addition the light absorption behaviour of ctf bi2wo6 was similar to that of bi2wo6 with an absorption edge at 470 nm therefore the modification of ctf 1 on bi2wo6 exerted a negligible impact on the light absorption of bi2wo6 to further identify the band gap profiles the bandgap energy values eg were calculated from the formula as follows αhν a hν eg n 2 where α h ν and a represent the absorption coefficient planck constant light frequency absorption constant respectively meanwhile the value of n was 1 depending on the firsthand transition of the bi2wo6 and ctf 1 samples 49 50 as illustrated in fig 4b the eg values of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were determined as 2 94 and 2 72 ev respectively the photoluminescence pl spectra of the materials were manifested in fig s2 after decoration with ctf 1 the composites exhibited weaker peak intensity than pure bi2wo6 and ctf 1 suggesting the effective prevention of the reintegration of photo generated carriers and quickening of charge transfer due to the formation of the binary heterostructure to directly measure the lifetime of photogenerated charges transient absorption spectra tas of ctf 1 bi2wo6 and 5 ctf bi2wo6 were conducted and the corresponding charge dynamics curves were revealed in fig 5 first of all as indicated in fig 5a c and e the time resolved transient absorption spectra of ctf 1 bi2wo6 and ctf bi2wo6 demonstrated relatively broad absorption bands under the visible light regions moreover the lifetime of photogenerated charges was calculated according to well established multi exponential functions as shown in fig 5b d and f it was found that the average lifetime of charge carriers for ctf bi2wo6 τ 399 8 ps was remarkably higher than that of the ctf 1 τ 108 2 ps and bi2wo6 τ 34 5 ps implying a substantial improvement in the separation and transfer of the photoinduced electron hole pairs on account of the formation of heterostructure between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 3 4 photoelectrochemical measurements it is widely accepted that the separation and transfer of photo generated charges are an essential determinant factors that controls photocatalytic activity 51 the transient photocurrent responses and the eis analyses of the samples were conducted to better investigate the charge migration behaviour as illustrated in fig 6 generally a rapid photocurrent phenomenon was noticed with the light on and off the photocurrents of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were lower than those of all the binary composite photocatalysts fig 6a which demonstrated that the construction of heterojunction herein was able to hasten the separation of electron hole pairs in addition the photocurrent of the 5 ctf bi2wo6 photocatalyst was strongest among the samples suggesting that the optimal mass ratio was 5 ctf 1 over bi2wo6 likewise the eis results as presented in fig 6b indicated that the 5 ctf bi2wo6 sample had the smallest arc diameter compared with other samples suggesting the weakest transfer resistance and the fastest charge transfer at this mass ratio in brief these results suggested that the rational construction of heterojunction between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 could efficaciously reinforce the separation and transfer of photo generated carriers therefore it was reasonable to anticipate that the ctf bi2wo6 heterojunctions would be engineered with outstanding photocatalytic properties for antibiotic degradation under visible irradiation 3 5 photocatalytic performance the degradation of tc was implemented to assess the photocatalytic property under visible light as illustrated in figs 7 and s3 first the equilibrium of adsorption and desorption for all the samples was reached during the dark incubation period therefore the effect of adsorption could be ruled out during light irradiation second the tc concentrations remained constant without photocatalysts or illumination indicating the photocatalytic nature of the reaction the ctf 1 and bi2wo6 photocatalysts alone exhibited extremely inferior tc degradation ability with tc removal rates of 4 27 and 28 91 within 60 min and 6 8 and 41 9 within 120 min respectively noticeably tc removal was significantly strengthened with the increasing loading ratio of ctf 1 on the bi2wo6 reaching a maximum value of 77 14 within 60 min and 92 2 within 120 min as presented in figs 7a b and s3 however when the loading of ctf 1 continued to increase tc degradation was inhibited this could be rationalized by the fact that excessive ctf 1 covered on the surface of bi2wo6 would reduce the light penetration thereby hurdling the availability of light for the photocatalytic reaction these observations were well consistent with the results of the photoelectrochemical measurements additionally the total organic carbon toc removal analysis using 5 ctf bi2wo6 as a photocatalyst was examined to figure out the mineralization of tc and the corresponding curves are described in fig 7c toc removal rate reached 41 2 within 60 min visible light irradiation which was significantly lower than that of tc indicated that 5 ctf bi2wo6 could effectively mineralize tc but produced some intermediates more stable than tc in the photocatalytic process the reaction kinetics was further investigated by fitting data into the pseudo first order kinetic equation as follows ln c0 c kt where c0 and c respectively represent the concentration of tc mg l at t 0 min and residual concentration of tc mg l at specific reaction time the parameter k represented the apparent reaction rate constant 52 it was found that the 5 ctf bi2wo6 composite exhibited the uppermost k value of approximately 0 02137 min 1 which was 31 66 times that of ctf 1 0 000675 min 1 and 4 44 times that of bi2wo6 0 00481 min 1 in summary the optimal ratio of the ctf bi2wo6 composite was 5 at which preeminent photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and mineralization performance were obtained the comparisons of the photocatalytic activities of the ctf bi2wo6 composite with various related bi2wo6 and triazines based photocatalysts previously reported for the photocatalytic degradation of tc were listed in table 1 the tc removal of ctf bi2wo6 composite was 93 2 within 120 min which was superior to most modified photocatalysts bi2wo6 g c3n4 53 ag3vo4 bi2wo6 54 bi2wo6 c cu2o 55 tpma g c3n4 56 although the degradation efficiency of the ctf bi2wo6 composite was not the most eminent it still shows superior photocatalytic degradation performance the stability of photocatalyst is a crucial factor that determines its practical applicability cycle experiments using the same photocatalyst were conducted to investigate the stability of ctf bi2wo6 as indicated in fig s4a no distinct decline in tc degradation activity could be grabbed after four successive cycles suggesting a satisfactory stability of the photocatalysts in the aspect of antibiotic decrease furthermore the xrd patterns of the recycled ctf bi2wo6 presented an insignificant difference from that of the original sample fig s4b demonstrating that ctf bi2wo6 maintained the crystal structures after usage overall the cycle experiments proved that the as prepared ctf bi2wo6 exhibited excellent stability which was undoubtedly conducive to its practical application 3 6 photocatalytic mechanism the rss involved in the degradation of tc were unveiled by scavenger experiments using benzoquinone bq edta 2na and isopropyl alcohol ipa to quench o2 hole h and oh the contribution of each rss could be semi qualitative and ascertained by the corresponding attenuation degree of the photocatalytic activity as manifested in fig 8a and b when bq was mixed with the reaction system tc removal was distinctly inhibited reaching only 19 71 within 1 h suggesting that o2 played a primary contributory role likewise when edta 2na was added to the reaction solution the 1 h tc removal decreased to 20 95 indicating the vital role of h conversely when ipa was applied the tc removal was comparable to the photocatalytic activity without any scavenger thus it could be concluded that the contribution of rss to photocatalytic tc degradation from high to low follows the order of o2 h oh the band structure of the as prepared ctf bi2wo6 was harvested in depth knowledge via mott schottky characterization as shown in fig s5 the conduction band cb potentials of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were determined as 1 23 v and 0 79 v vs ag agcl corresponding to 1 03 v and 0 59 v vs nhe taking the bandgap values of ctf 1 2 94 ev and bi2wo6 2 72 ev into consideration the valence band vb potentials of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 could be calculated as 1 91 v and 2 13 v intriguingly the band structural profiles of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were well coincide with the z scheme heterojunction in which a staggered band structure was a prerequisite to further verify the z scheme heterojunction esr measurement was implemented six characteristic peaks attributed to dmpo o2 were detected for the ctf 1 and ctf bi2wo6 samples while no apparent signals could be found for bi2wo6 as shown in fig 8c furthermore the intensity of dmpo o2 signals for the ctf bi2wo6 sample was significantly stronger than that of ctf 1 suggesting an improved reduction ability meanwhile as shown in fig 8d four prominent peaks with a strength ratio of 1 2 2 1 originated from oh only ctf bi2wo6 induced a strong oh signal whereas no oh signals could be detected for ctf 1 and bi2wo6 alone we conclude that the electron flow of ctf bi2wo6 upon visible light irradiation follows a z scheme profile the engineered heterojunction effectively promoted the electron transfer between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 and had a higher tendency to generate o2 and oh than the single counterpart thus leading to a preeminent photocatalytic removal of antibiotics based on the above analyses the underlying mechanism for tc degradation over the z scheme ctf bi2wo6 photocatalyst was illustrated in scheme 2 upon excitation under the visible light e 1 h pairs were manufactured on ctf 1 and bi2wo6 the cb e of bi2wo6 transferred to ctf 1 and combined with the vb h thus leaving vb h on bi2wo6 with higher oxidizability and cb e on ctf 1 with stronger reducibility to participate in tc degradation in particular there was the possibility that some vb h of bi2wo6 directly reacted with oh in water to produce oh radicals due to the vb edge potential of bi2wo6 2 13 ev is more positive than the potential of oh oh 1 99 v vs nhe ph 7 66 68 moreover the cb e of ctf 1 reacted with o2 to generate o2 0 33 v vs nhe 68 these rss were involved in the efficient degradation of tc molecules to generate a series of intermediates and finally co2 and h2o 3 7 intermediates and toxicity analysis the knowledge of the intermediates and pathways of degradation is another critical aspect of understanding the photocatalytic degradation behaviour of tc as shown in fig 9 first of all a prominent anion peak could be seen at m z 445 which corresponded to the initial tc molecule after irradiation for 10 min the tc molecule was desamidized into no2 with m z 403 when the degradation lasted for 20 min the no2 product was removed from dimethylamino and converted into no3 with m z 365 then the hydroxyl group and methyl group of the no3 product were removed and the benzene ring was opened due to the h attack at this time no3 was transformed into no4 product with m z 331 in the next period no4 was further removed from the ch3ch2co group and oxidized to no5 product with m z 246 in 1 h finally small molecules such as co2 and h2o were generated owing to further degradation of the intermediates which was in reasonable compliance with the results of the toc analysis t e s t based on the mathematical models of qsar composed of bioaccumulation factors and fathead minnow lc50 96 h was applied to estimate the toxicity of intermediates generated in the process of tc degradation and further evaluate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of tc by ctf bi2wo6 the simulation results are presented in fig 10 the potential toxicity of tc and its photocatalytic degradation intermediates could be predicted by analyzing its bioaccumulation factors as illustrated in fig 10a the bioaccumulation factors of all intermediates were significantly lower than the tc indicating that photocatalytic degradation reduced the bioaccumulation factor of tc meanwhile the fathead minnow lc50 96 h mg l of tc was 0 9 mg l classified as a hazardous pollutant fathead minnow lc50 96 h mg l of no2 no3 no4 and no5 were 0 43 mg l 6 78 mg l 3 06 mg l and 12 67 mg l respectively all intermediates except no2 were significantly higher than tc indicating that photocatalytic degradation of tc could effectively lessen its toxicity fig 10b the results indicated that tc may produce some intermediates with higher toxicity during the photocatalytic process but the intermediates transformed into the products with low toxicity after continuous degradation and finally would be completely mineralized the results of toxicity analysis manifested that the bioaccumulation factor and fathead minnow lc50 96 h of tc significantly decreased after photocatalytic degradation by the ctf bi2wo6 composite 4 conclusion a novel z scheme heterojunction ctf bi2wo6 photocatalyst was rationally engineered and successfully synthesized by embedding layered ctf 1 on the surface of the flower like spherical structure of bi2wo6 via a facile solvothermal means the constructed z scheme heterojunction remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and decreased the toxicity of antibiotics using tc as a model under visible light the optimal ratio of 5 ctf bi2wo6 sample exhibited the highest tc removal rate of 77 14 within 1 h and the highest k value of 0 02137 min 1 which was 31 66 times higher than that of pure ctf 1 and 4 44 times higher than that of bi2wo6 the remarkable improvement in photocatalytic performance was due to the larger specific surface area and higher efficacious separation of photo induced electron holes endowed by the construction of z scheme heterojunction this research showcases an amenable approach to achieving efficient tc antibiotic degradation under visible light and offers valuable information regarding the treatment of other antibiotic pollutants using ctf based z scheme heterojunction materials declaration of

12871,photocatalysis provides a green strategy to eliminate the emerging pollutants of antibiotics however it remains challenging to design robust photocatalyst to fulfil the requirement of industrial implementation herein a novel z scheme covalent triazine based framework ctf bi2wo6 heterojunction photocatalyst was rationally fabricated by interfacial engineering of layered ctf 1 into flower like bi2wo6 for photocatalytic removal of antibiotic using tetracycline tc as a representative the structural physicochemical and electrochemical capabilities of the as prepared photocatalyst were explored in detail by a range of advanced analyses the results showed that the optimized ctf bi2wo6 exhibited superior photocatalytic performance affording a tc removal efficacy of 77 14 within 60 min which was approximately 18 times and 2 67 times that of individual ctf 1 and bi2wo6 respectively the boosting property could be attributed to the z scheme heterostructure which significantly reinforced the transfer and separation of photoinduced carriers meanwhile the dominate reactive species participating in the degradation process were probed as o2 and h based on scavenger experiments and esr analyses finally the degradation pathway of tc by ctf bi2wo6 was proposed based on intermediate products and the toxicity of tc and its degradation products were estimated by the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t this study showcases a feasible pathway towards designing ctf based z scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for effective and eco friendly antibiotic wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords covalent triazine based framework z scheme antibiotic photocatalytic degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are common pharmaceutical drugs that help combat bacterial infections worldwide their antimicrobial mechanisms typically proceed through inactivating or inhibiting the proliferation of bacteria however in decent decades antibiotics have been overused by human beings and they are inevitably released into the environments mainly the aquatic systems 1 2 the occurrence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment can pose a severe threat to the entire ecosystem 3 4 prior to discharge most antibiotic residues are transferred to wastewater treatment plants wwtps and subjected to conventional wastewater treatments e g biological treatments in urban areas 5 however due to the robust stability of antibiotics and the stubborn nature of biological treatment it is challenging to effectively eliminate antibiotics by biological methods 6 based on this many effective and economical technologies for the removal of antibiotics have been executed to date including adsorption 7 electrocoagulation 8 membrane separation 9 and photocatalysis 10 11 among them photocatalytic degradation is outstanding because of its advantages of simple operation low cost and thorough treatment 12 recently photocatalytic technology based on semiconductor photocatalysts has been extensively recognized as an efficacious and environmentally friendly technology in the aspect of antibiotics degradation and mineralization 13 14 when irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength reactive species rss including hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 hole h electron e and h2o2 can be generated these rss are highly oxidative and responsible for the breakdown of organic molecules to date many types of photocatalysts e g tio2 15 cds 16 zno 17 and in2s3 18 have been fabricated and successfully applied for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants such as dyes pesticides and antibiotics nevertheless it is noteworthy that a large amount of photocatalysts are precious metal oxides and suffer from disadvantages including the low efficiency of solar energy low stability and rapid integration of photoinduced carriers which severely limit their practical application 19 20 hence seeking robust photocatalysts is still a crucial step towards the application of photocatalytic technology for antibiotic elimination more recently novel organic semiconductor photocatalysts have been rationally designed to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages 21 a stunning representative organic photocatalyst is covalent triazine based frameworks ctfs constructed by covalent bonds connecting polymers with high crystallinity and high porosity 22 23 ctf is a representative covalent organic framework cof and has attracted enormous attention in recent years due to the merits of high surface area rich pore structures multiple active sites and the tunable structures previously ctf based photocatalysts have showcased superior activities in photocatalytic pollutant degradation co2 reduction and water treatment 24 26 the superiority can be attributed to the specific periodic ordered columnar array of π conjugated aromatic rings structure in ctfs which have a zealous effect on the electron delocalization and thus permit an excellent photo generated charges transfer and outstanding photoconductivity 27 besides due to the solid covalent bond connection ctfs materials possess relatively high thermal and chemical stability giving ctfs a considerable long lifetime as photocatalysts 28 29 taking the various attractive advantages into consideration it is desirable to employ ctf based composites for the photocatalytic treatment of antibiotics 30 31 for example chao et al developed a novel tio2 based photocatalyst modified with ctfs which exhibited a relatively higher capacity for carbamazepine removal 32 nevertheless the photocatalytic application of ctf based photocatalysts is severely limited by the arduous synthesis process and high cost 33 34 to overcome these shortcomings a novel ctfs material called ctf 1 with a suitable band gap 2 94 ev was fabricated via facile procedures under mild conditions by our research group 35 despite the ctf 1 prepared by this simple method has excellent visible light absorption property its activity can be further improved currently constructing z scheme heterojunction has been confirmed as an effective means to expedite the transportation of photo induced carriers thus improving the photocatalytic performance 36 the establishment of the z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst requires two different photocatalysts with interlaced band structures with this consideration in mind the bi2wo6 can be regarded as an excellent counterpart of ctf 1 to construct the z scheme heterojunction in addition bi2wo6 possesses the merits of a wide range of visible light responses high resistance against acid alkali and satisfactory thermal stability 37 therefore it is rationally anticipated that the ctf 1 and bi2wo6 z scheme heterojunction could serve as a robust photocatalytic system for antibiotic degradation 38 herein we are engineering a z scheme ctf bi2wo6 heterojunction photocatalyst through a facile solvothermal approach towards the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics for the first time tetracycline tc is selected as a typical antibiotic to assess the photocatalytic property of the ctf bi2wo6 composite this work aims to elucidate the following issues i the activity and kinetics of the z scheme ctf bi2wo6 heterojunction in the elimination of tc ii the dominant rss involved in the degradation process iii the electron flow within the ctf bi2wo6 composite iv the degradation mechanism and pathway of tetracycline and v toxicity changes of tc and its degradation intermediates the outcomes of this experiment are of great significance towards the progress of ctf based photocatalysts and are expected to make a remarkable contribution to solving the problems of antibiotics pollution 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of ctf 1 analytical grade chemical reagents were used for all sample preparations the detailed synthesis method of ctf 1 was reported previously 35 first trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 20 ml was gently mixed in 1 4 dicyanobenzene 2 56 g in a flask at 0 c a compound of ice and water the obtained suspension was stirred and kept for 3 days then the resulting solid was respectively rinsed with diluted ammonia solution and dichloromethane afterwards the obtained product was dispersed in a dilute ammonia solution of the same concentration under continuous stirring after 12 h the stirred solution was centrifuged with methanol and distilled water several times then using methanol and dichloromethane refluxed the harvested pellet continuing for 12 h and then vacuum dried at 80 c overnight finally the obtained solid was ground into a powder named ctf 1 2 2 preparation of ctf bi2wo6 composites as shown in scheme 1 ctf bi2wo6 composites with various mass ratios were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method first 0 5 mmol na2wo4 2h2o and a certain amount of ctf 1 were transferred to 50 ml distilled water to obtain samples the mass ratios of ctf 1 bi2wo6 were 3 5 10 15 the compound was subjected to 30 min ultrasonicated treatment and then blended vigorously for 2 h meanwhile 1 0 mmol bi no3 3 5h2o was dispersed into 10 ml glacial acetic acid and after thoroughly stirring for 1 h it was slowly poured into the mixed solution of na2wo4 2h2o and ctf 1 the obtained mixture underwent 2 h stirring and was then transferred to a 100 ml autoclave then heated and kept at 180 c for 14 h when the resultant liquid was cooled to room temperature it was collected by centrifugation and washed respectively with distilled water and ethanol several times eventually the products were vacuum dried at 60 c and denoted as 3 5 10 and 15 ctf bi2wo6 respectively the pure bi2wo6 sample was prepared with the same process without the addition of ctf 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of morphology and porous structure the sem and tem images of the as prepared compounds were indicated in fig 1 it could be observed that the bi2wo6 sample fig 1a presented a uniform flower spherical structure with the petal like flakes being smooth and clean the sem and tem images of the samples fig 1b c demonstrated the graphene like layered structure of ctf 1 for the ctf bi2wo6 sample the mass ratio of 5 unless otherwise stated was taken as a representative fig 1d flocculent like substances were embedded or wrapped in the aperture and surface of the spherical structure indicating that ctf 1 was successfully loaded on the flower spherical like bi2wo6 this observation was confirmed by the tem and hrtem images as indicated in fig 1d and e it can be noticed that layered ctf 1 was embedded on the surface of bi2wo6 as illustrated in fig 1f g and h the closer observation of the hrtem image revealed a lattice spacing of 0 315 nm which was associated with the bi2wo6 113 crystal plane 39 thus it can be inferred that layered ctf 1 was tightly coupled with bi2wo6 to further probe the elemental distribution profile of the ctf bi2wo6 composite the energy dispersive x ray edx mappings of c n o bi and w fig 1i were performed the results revealed that all the mentioned elements were evenly distributed indicating the homogeneity of ctf bi2wo6 according to the electron microscopies observations we can confirm the successful preparation of ctf and bi2wo6 heterostructure with a well attached interface as illustrated in fig s1 n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were implemented to comprehend the bet surface area pore volume and corresponding pore size distributions of the as prepared compounds and the corresponding data are listed in table s1 all samples presented iv type isotherms which were indicative of mesoporous structures 2 50 nm in addition the isotherms of all the samples presented similar shapes suggesting that the samples possessed analogous porous structures in addition as illustrated in table s1 ctf bi2wo6 had a relatively high bet surface area 30 0 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 06 cm3 g 1 which were much higher than those of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 furthermore the average pore size of ctf bi2wo6 was 17 nm while the ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were 8 8 nm and 10 6 nm respectively which were smaller than that of ctf bi2wo6 the significant increase in the surface area aspect of ctf bi2wo6 could be attributed to the fact that ctf 1 was embedded in the interspace of the flower spherical structure of bi2wo6 it was expected that large specific surface area and pore size were decided in favour of increasing the exposed areas to reactants such as antibiotics and o2 molecular which were presumably conducive to boosting the photocatalytic removal of antibiotics 3 2 phase structures and chemical compositions xrd tests were employed to gain insight into the crystal structure of the samples as indicated in fig 2a the diffraction peaks at 25 2 and 26 9 for the pure ctf 1 corresponded to the stacking of conjugated aromatic systems 40 and the layered stacking structure 41 respectively as for the bi2wo6 sample the prominent characteristic peaks at 28 3 32 7 47 1 and 56 0 were indexed to the lattice planes of 113 060 202 and 133 of bi2wo6 42 the diffraction patterns of the ctf bi2wo6 series samples were almost identical to bi2wo6 whereas the characteristic peaks of ctf 1 were hardly recognized this phenomenon can be attributed to the low dosage and low crystallinity of ctf 1 in the composite samples nevertheless we can still infer that the ctf bi2wo6 samples maintained the intrinsic crystal structure of bi2wo6 ft ir spectra were obtained to further explore the functional aspects of the samples further as illustrated in fig 2b there were two characteristic peaks located at 1357 and 1508 cm 1 of the ctf 1 samples which could be ascribed to the stretching oscillation of cn in the triazine unit 43 these peaks were consistently observed in all the ctf bi2wo6 samples implying the existence of ctf 1 in the composites likewise the pure bi2wo6 and ctf bi2wo6 materials shared three characteristic peaks located at 812 731 and 572 cm 1 which were associated with the stretching vibrations of bio and wo bonds 44 collectively the xrd pattern and ftir analyses confirmed that ctf bi2wo6 composites with high quality were obtained fig 2 as illustrated in fig 3 the elements and the chemical status of the samples were inspected by xps the overall xps spectrum of ctf 1 suggested that the c n and o elements were well resolved and for the 5 ctf bi2wo6 c n o bi and w elements can be distinctly observed fig 3a the high resolution c 1s spectra of ctf 1 and ctf bi2wo6 samples fig 3b exhibited two characteristic peaks which had a central point of 287 3 and 284 6 ev respectively and they corresponded with cn bonds in the triazine ring and sp2 hybridized cc bonds in the aromatic carbon 45 as illustrated in fig 3c the n 1s xps spectra of individual ctf 1 showed a prominent peak located at 399 2 ev which was associated with pyridinic n c n c in fig 3d the peak located at 530 0 ev was attributable to the bio bond of bi2wo6 46 as depicted in fig 3e the presence of bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 was verified by two strong peaks at 164 7 and 159 4 ev which were indicative of bi3 47 the two intense peaks of 37 5 and 35 4 ev were attributed to w 4f5 2 and w 4f7 2 fig 3f respectively suggesting the presence of w6 48 notably the n 1s peak of ctf bi2wo6 underwent a slight blue shift by 0 3 ev whereas the bi 4f peaks of ctf bi2wo6 were subjected to a red shift by 0 1 ev in comparison to the pristine ctf 1 based on this observation it was reasonable to postulate that a strong interfacial interaction occurred between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 and this interaction presumably proceeded through the n atoms on ctf 1 and bi on bi2wo6 3 3 analysis of the optical property the uv vis drs analysis was carried out to obtain insightful information regarding the light absorption capacity and bandgap features of the samples as presented in fig 4a ctf 1 and bi2wo6 exhibited an absorption edge at approximately 420 and 475 nm respectively in addition the light absorption behaviour of ctf bi2wo6 was similar to that of bi2wo6 with an absorption edge at 470 nm therefore the modification of ctf 1 on bi2wo6 exerted a negligible impact on the light absorption of bi2wo6 to further identify the band gap profiles the bandgap energy values eg were calculated from the formula as follows αhν a hν eg n 2 where α h ν and a represent the absorption coefficient planck constant light frequency absorption constant respectively meanwhile the value of n was 1 depending on the firsthand transition of the bi2wo6 and ctf 1 samples 49 50 as illustrated in fig 4b the eg values of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were determined as 2 94 and 2 72 ev respectively the photoluminescence pl spectra of the materials were manifested in fig s2 after decoration with ctf 1 the composites exhibited weaker peak intensity than pure bi2wo6 and ctf 1 suggesting the effective prevention of the reintegration of photo generated carriers and quickening of charge transfer due to the formation of the binary heterostructure to directly measure the lifetime of photogenerated charges transient absorption spectra tas of ctf 1 bi2wo6 and 5 ctf bi2wo6 were conducted and the corresponding charge dynamics curves were revealed in fig 5 first of all as indicated in fig 5a c and e the time resolved transient absorption spectra of ctf 1 bi2wo6 and ctf bi2wo6 demonstrated relatively broad absorption bands under the visible light regions moreover the lifetime of photogenerated charges was calculated according to well established multi exponential functions as shown in fig 5b d and f it was found that the average lifetime of charge carriers for ctf bi2wo6 τ 399 8 ps was remarkably higher than that of the ctf 1 τ 108 2 ps and bi2wo6 τ 34 5 ps implying a substantial improvement in the separation and transfer of the photoinduced electron hole pairs on account of the formation of heterostructure between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 3 4 photoelectrochemical measurements it is widely accepted that the separation and transfer of photo generated charges are an essential determinant factors that controls photocatalytic activity 51 the transient photocurrent responses and the eis analyses of the samples were conducted to better investigate the charge migration behaviour as illustrated in fig 6 generally a rapid photocurrent phenomenon was noticed with the light on and off the photocurrents of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were lower than those of all the binary composite photocatalysts fig 6a which demonstrated that the construction of heterojunction herein was able to hasten the separation of electron hole pairs in addition the photocurrent of the 5 ctf bi2wo6 photocatalyst was strongest among the samples suggesting that the optimal mass ratio was 5 ctf 1 over bi2wo6 likewise the eis results as presented in fig 6b indicated that the 5 ctf bi2wo6 sample had the smallest arc diameter compared with other samples suggesting the weakest transfer resistance and the fastest charge transfer at this mass ratio in brief these results suggested that the rational construction of heterojunction between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 could efficaciously reinforce the separation and transfer of photo generated carriers therefore it was reasonable to anticipate that the ctf bi2wo6 heterojunctions would be engineered with outstanding photocatalytic properties for antibiotic degradation under visible irradiation 3 5 photocatalytic performance the degradation of tc was implemented to assess the photocatalytic property under visible light as illustrated in figs 7 and s3 first the equilibrium of adsorption and desorption for all the samples was reached during the dark incubation period therefore the effect of adsorption could be ruled out during light irradiation second the tc concentrations remained constant without photocatalysts or illumination indicating the photocatalytic nature of the reaction the ctf 1 and bi2wo6 photocatalysts alone exhibited extremely inferior tc degradation ability with tc removal rates of 4 27 and 28 91 within 60 min and 6 8 and 41 9 within 120 min respectively noticeably tc removal was significantly strengthened with the increasing loading ratio of ctf 1 on the bi2wo6 reaching a maximum value of 77 14 within 60 min and 92 2 within 120 min as presented in figs 7a b and s3 however when the loading of ctf 1 continued to increase tc degradation was inhibited this could be rationalized by the fact that excessive ctf 1 covered on the surface of bi2wo6 would reduce the light penetration thereby hurdling the availability of light for the photocatalytic reaction these observations were well consistent with the results of the photoelectrochemical measurements additionally the total organic carbon toc removal analysis using 5 ctf bi2wo6 as a photocatalyst was examined to figure out the mineralization of tc and the corresponding curves are described in fig 7c toc removal rate reached 41 2 within 60 min visible light irradiation which was significantly lower than that of tc indicated that 5 ctf bi2wo6 could effectively mineralize tc but produced some intermediates more stable than tc in the photocatalytic process the reaction kinetics was further investigated by fitting data into the pseudo first order kinetic equation as follows ln c0 c kt where c0 and c respectively represent the concentration of tc mg l at t 0 min and residual concentration of tc mg l at specific reaction time the parameter k represented the apparent reaction rate constant 52 it was found that the 5 ctf bi2wo6 composite exhibited the uppermost k value of approximately 0 02137 min 1 which was 31 66 times that of ctf 1 0 000675 min 1 and 4 44 times that of bi2wo6 0 00481 min 1 in summary the optimal ratio of the ctf bi2wo6 composite was 5 at which preeminent photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and mineralization performance were obtained the comparisons of the photocatalytic activities of the ctf bi2wo6 composite with various related bi2wo6 and triazines based photocatalysts previously reported for the photocatalytic degradation of tc were listed in table 1 the tc removal of ctf bi2wo6 composite was 93 2 within 120 min which was superior to most modified photocatalysts bi2wo6 g c3n4 53 ag3vo4 bi2wo6 54 bi2wo6 c cu2o 55 tpma g c3n4 56 although the degradation efficiency of the ctf bi2wo6 composite was not the most eminent it still shows superior photocatalytic degradation performance the stability of photocatalyst is a crucial factor that determines its practical applicability cycle experiments using the same photocatalyst were conducted to investigate the stability of ctf bi2wo6 as indicated in fig s4a no distinct decline in tc degradation activity could be grabbed after four successive cycles suggesting a satisfactory stability of the photocatalysts in the aspect of antibiotic decrease furthermore the xrd patterns of the recycled ctf bi2wo6 presented an insignificant difference from that of the original sample fig s4b demonstrating that ctf bi2wo6 maintained the crystal structures after usage overall the cycle experiments proved that the as prepared ctf bi2wo6 exhibited excellent stability which was undoubtedly conducive to its practical application 3 6 photocatalytic mechanism the rss involved in the degradation of tc were unveiled by scavenger experiments using benzoquinone bq edta 2na and isopropyl alcohol ipa to quench o2 hole h and oh the contribution of each rss could be semi qualitative and ascertained by the corresponding attenuation degree of the photocatalytic activity as manifested in fig 8a and b when bq was mixed with the reaction system tc removal was distinctly inhibited reaching only 19 71 within 1 h suggesting that o2 played a primary contributory role likewise when edta 2na was added to the reaction solution the 1 h tc removal decreased to 20 95 indicating the vital role of h conversely when ipa was applied the tc removal was comparable to the photocatalytic activity without any scavenger thus it could be concluded that the contribution of rss to photocatalytic tc degradation from high to low follows the order of o2 h oh the band structure of the as prepared ctf bi2wo6 was harvested in depth knowledge via mott schottky characterization as shown in fig s5 the conduction band cb potentials of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were determined as 1 23 v and 0 79 v vs ag agcl corresponding to 1 03 v and 0 59 v vs nhe taking the bandgap values of ctf 1 2 94 ev and bi2wo6 2 72 ev into consideration the valence band vb potentials of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 could be calculated as 1 91 v and 2 13 v intriguingly the band structural profiles of ctf 1 and bi2wo6 were well coincide with the z scheme heterojunction in which a staggered band structure was a prerequisite to further verify the z scheme heterojunction esr measurement was implemented six characteristic peaks attributed to dmpo o2 were detected for the ctf 1 and ctf bi2wo6 samples while no apparent signals could be found for bi2wo6 as shown in fig 8c furthermore the intensity of dmpo o2 signals for the ctf bi2wo6 sample was significantly stronger than that of ctf 1 suggesting an improved reduction ability meanwhile as shown in fig 8d four prominent peaks with a strength ratio of 1 2 2 1 originated from oh only ctf bi2wo6 induced a strong oh signal whereas no oh signals could be detected for ctf 1 and bi2wo6 alone we conclude that the electron flow of ctf bi2wo6 upon visible light irradiation follows a z scheme profile the engineered heterojunction effectively promoted the electron transfer between ctf 1 and bi2wo6 and had a higher tendency to generate o2 and oh than the single counterpart thus leading to a preeminent photocatalytic removal of antibiotics based on the above analyses the underlying mechanism for tc degradation over the z scheme ctf bi2wo6 photocatalyst was illustrated in scheme 2 upon excitation under the visible light e 1 h pairs were manufactured on ctf 1 and bi2wo6 the cb e of bi2wo6 transferred to ctf 1 and combined with the vb h thus leaving vb h on bi2wo6 with higher oxidizability and cb e on ctf 1 with stronger reducibility to participate in tc degradation in particular there was the possibility that some vb h of bi2wo6 directly reacted with oh in water to produce oh radicals due to the vb edge potential of bi2wo6 2 13 ev is more positive than the potential of oh oh 1 99 v vs nhe ph 7 66 68 moreover the cb e of ctf 1 reacted with o2 to generate o2 0 33 v vs nhe 68 these rss were involved in the efficient degradation of tc molecules to generate a series of intermediates and finally co2 and h2o 3 7 intermediates and toxicity analysis the knowledge of the intermediates and pathways of degradation is another critical aspect of understanding the photocatalytic degradation behaviour of tc as shown in fig 9 first of all a prominent anion peak could be seen at m z 445 which corresponded to the initial tc molecule after irradiation for 10 min the tc molecule was desamidized into no2 with m z 403 when the degradation lasted for 20 min the no2 product was removed from dimethylamino and converted into no3 with m z 365 then the hydroxyl group and methyl group of the no3 product were removed and the benzene ring was opened due to the h attack at this time no3 was transformed into no4 product with m z 331 in the next period no4 was further removed from the ch3ch2co group and oxidized to no5 product with m z 246 in 1 h finally small molecules such as co2 and h2o were generated owing to further degradation of the intermediates which was in reasonable compliance with the results of the toc analysis t e s t based on the mathematical models of qsar composed of bioaccumulation factors and fathead minnow lc50 96 h was applied to estimate the toxicity of intermediates generated in the process of tc degradation and further evaluate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of tc by ctf bi2wo6 the simulation results are presented in fig 10 the potential toxicity of tc and its photocatalytic degradation intermediates could be predicted by analyzing its bioaccumulation factors as illustrated in fig 10a the bioaccumulation factors of all intermediates were significantly lower than the tc indicating that photocatalytic degradation reduced the bioaccumulation factor of tc meanwhile the fathead minnow lc50 96 h mg l of tc was 0 9 mg l classified as a hazardous pollutant fathead minnow lc50 96 h mg l of no2 no3 no4 and no5 were 0 43 mg l 6 78 mg l 3 06 mg l and 12 67 mg l respectively all intermediates except no2 were significantly higher than tc indicating that photocatalytic degradation of tc could effectively lessen its toxicity fig 10b the results indicated that tc may produce some intermediates with higher toxicity during the photocatalytic process but the intermediates transformed into the products with low toxicity after continuous degradation and finally would be completely mineralized the results of toxicity analysis manifested that the bioaccumulation factor and fathead minnow lc50 96 h of tc significantly decreased after photocatalytic degradation by the ctf bi2wo6 composite 4 conclusion a novel z scheme heterojunction ctf bi2wo6 photocatalyst was rationally engineered and successfully synthesized by embedding layered ctf 1 on the surface of the flower like spherical structure of bi2wo6 via a facile solvothermal means the constructed z scheme heterojunction remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and decreased the toxicity of antibiotics using tc as a model under visible light the optimal ratio of 5 ctf bi2wo6 sample exhibited the highest tc removal rate of 77 14 within 1 h and the highest k value of 0 02137 min 1 which was 31 66 times higher than that of pure ctf 1 and 4 44 times higher than that of bi2wo6 the remarkable improvement in photocatalytic performance was due to the larger specific surface area and higher efficacious separation of photo induced electron holes endowed by the construction of z scheme heterojunction this research showcases an amenable approach to achieving efficient tc antibiotic degradation under visible light and offers valuable information regarding the treatment of other antibiotic pollutants using ctf based z scheme heterojunction materials declaration of

12872,a high level of chemical energy is contained in petroleum refinery wastewater prw in this study the performance of microbial fuel cell mfc treating prw is investigated in various mfc reactor configurations by studying the removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod from wastewater and the generation of electricity the effect of different hydraulic retention times hrts with a selected external resistance and the effect of catholyte of different phs were investigated in batch and continuous mode of operations using single chamber and dual chamber mfcs the results of continuous modes of operation in dual chamber mfc indicated that the efficiency of cod removal in treating prw reached 84 40 the bioelectricity generation in terms of voltage and current output of mfc was observed to be higher in continuous mode dual chamber operation with cathodic aeration the highest obtained cell voltage of 762 mv and the highest volumetric power density of 328 26 mw m3 were reached in continuously operated dual chamber mfc at hrt of 16 h the highest current density obtained was 79 2 ma m2 this study indicates that the performance of mfc treating prw is promising and continuous mode can be employed for treating prw with simultaneous generation of electricity keywords microbial fuel cell petroleum refinery wastewater chemical oxygen demand bioelectricity generation electrodes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the oil refinery is designed to convert crude oil by physical and chemical transformation into a variety of products 1 the oil refinery in qatar produces a wide range of end products such as liquefied petroleum gas gasoline naphtha diesel jet fuel marine fuel oil lubricating oil and decant oil by processing crude oil and condensate 2 large amounts of water are consumed in petroleum refinery based on the size types of refinery products and operational complications as a result large volumes of wastewater are generated from petroleum refineries it can range from 0 40 to 1 60 times the quantity of crude oil processed 3 in petroleum refineries of qatar a substantial quantity of wastewater produced includes waste that was in contact with hydrocarbons known as process wastewater the wastewater generated from petroleum refinery separation and conversion processing contains many organic pollutants such as hydrocarbons that are toxic to marine life hence petroleum refinery wastewater becomes one of the main pollutants to the environment if not properly treated it causes serious environmental damage and results in abnormal changes in the ecosystem that could spoil the water quality due to the deterioration of microflora and fauna in water bodies 4 prw treatment plant should produce a treated effluent stream that adheres to environmental protection agency emission discharge guidelines and standards applicable in qatar conventional biological and physicochemical methods have been widely used to treat petroleum refinery wastewater prw however the large amounts of energy consumed during the treatment process make it expensive the high energy requirement of the conventional petroleum refinery wastewater treatment systems demands researching alternate treatment technology which is energy efficient technically and economically feasible microbial fuel cells mfcs are an evolving technology that makes use of bacteria for generating electricity from wastewater and simultaneously degrading pollutants in wastewater mfcs are currently gaining importance as they can directly convert the energy in chemical bond to electrical energy in addition to wastewater treatment producing hydrogen from microbial fuel cells desalinating seawater and providing sustainable energy bases for isolated areas are potential fields of future development in the usage of mfcs 5 7 using mfc technology to treat prw the energy consumption is reduced and simultaneously chemical energy contained in the wastewater can be recovered thereby offering a viable and feasible pathway for the utilization of wastewater resources 8 also making use of mfcs for wastewater treatment results in a highly efficient safe process with low emission and candid electricity recovery systems 9 12 mfc generally consists of dual chambers anodic and cathodic compartments which are split by an ion exchange membrane in the anodic compartment bacteria function as a catalyst to transform the organic substrate into electrons protons and carbon dioxide the electrons are moved from anode to cathode that create an electric current while the protons are moved to the cathodic chamber through the membrane in the cathodic chamber oxygen is combined with protons to form water at the surface of a catalyst such as platinum 13 16 although mfc has great potential to be used for renewable energy production and for novel wastewater treatment the process has to be optimized some key issues such as reactor configuration the cost of the catalyst electrode and understanding of microbial activities need to be addressed before the application of mfcs 17 18 considerable attempts were made to maximize the electrical current generation from mfcs by optimizing reactor configuration understanding microbial interaction with electrodes and minimizing internal resistance a wide selection of substrates can be used in mfc as an anode fuel including glucose acetate municipal and industrial wastewaters 19 22 only a few studies have been conducted using prw as a fuel for mfc prw has characteristics differ from one region in the world to another and depending on the type refinery processes zhang et al 2014 reported the effectiveness of treating refinery wastewater in mfc using air cathode 23 guo et al 2014 reported initial findings on the factors affecting mfc start up and performance using oil refinery wastewater as substrate 8 many of the previous studies used either petroleum compounds or individual chemicals such as phenol or using synthetic wastewater in mfc prw contains large organic contaminants with obvious toxicity in addition previous studies elsewhere used mainly batch operation which is not suitable for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater many benefits can be attributed to continuous mode operation including optimization of medium composition for maximal productivity per unit volume data reliability and reproducibility of results 24 additionally understanding of the factors affecting the performance of mfc will be required for converting this technology from lab scale to industrial scale applications for wastewater treatment in the petroleum refining industry ghasemi et al 2021 explored the use of carbon nanotubes and pt cathode nanocomposite electrodes in mfc for the bioenergy production while treating wastewater 25 the highest mfc performance conditions were determined jadhav et al 2021 demonstrated the use of mathematical modeling optimization strategies for the performance enhancement of mfcs 26 mohammadi et al 2021 used two cubic chambers mfc for oilfield produced water treatment at different conditions such as nanocomposite compositions process parameters were optimized for maximum power generation and cod removal efficiency using statistical and mathematical modeling techniques 27 in this work the performance of mfc treating prw is investigated in various mfc reactor configurations in addition the effect of operating parameters like hydraulic retention time hrt and the catholyte solution type were probed in batch and continuous modes of operations using single and dual chamber mfcs the mfc performance was measured as energy recovery mw m3 reactor and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of wastewater besides the electrochemical factors such as power density current density and cell voltage biological parameters such as cod removal efficiency are employed to portray the performance of mfcs 28 29 2 materials and methods 2 1 petroleum refinery wastewater the prw was taken from local refinery in qatar the refinery deals with crude oil and condensate and converts them into a range of finished products primary treatment and secondary treatment facilities are the major components of the existing wastewater treatment plant in the refinery this is followed by carbon adsorption and electrodialysis plant producing treated water of high environmental quality standards and stringent discharge guidelines refinery wastewater samples were collected in bottles of 50 gal each on three different occasions and kept refrigerated at 4 c in the qatar university cold storage room 2 2 characteristics of wastewater the characteristics of the local petroleum refinery wastewater stream were determined after collecting the sample from the refinery output stream of the equalization tank the average feed stream influent wastewater composition admitted to the existing wastewater treatment plant facility is shown in table 1 on average the cod load of the wastewater treatment plant is less than 1000 mg l and the ph ranges from 7 to 9 2 3 construction and design of microbial fuel cells the mfcs configuration used in this work is shown in fig 1 those mfcs were made from acrylic fiber plexiglas the volume of the anodic and cathodic chambers was 250 ml each the anodic chamber was sealed to preserve an anaerobic environment and the anode was made of carbon cloth having a carbon coating of 0 5 mg cm2 with nafion binder the single chamber mfc was of air cathode type in dual chamber mfc the cathode was made of pt with nafion binder 0 50 mg cm2 pt c and the cathode compartment was continuously aerated to keep a constant concentration of dissolved oxygen nafion 117 was installed as pem dual chambered mfcs consist of two compartments as shown in fig 1 the pem connects both chambers the cathode and anode are accommodated in two separate chambers the electrode surface area is 50 cm2 in the continuous mode operation of dual chamber mfcs the catholyte used was phosphate buffer solution pbs of ph 7 for the first set of experiments and acidified water aw of ph 2 for the next set of experiments respectively the four performed batch mode experiments were mfc a mfc b mfc c and mfc d as shown in table 2 2 4 inoculum preparation and enrichment of microorganisms anaerobic sludge taken from local wastewater treatment plant doha qatar was used as an inoculum an inoculum of defined nutrient media containing mineral vitamin solution and fatty acid mixture was prepared this inoculum was used in all the experiments with prw substrate experiments were conducted in batch as well as in continuous operation mode for the first two weeks the reactors were fed with prw in order to accustom the microbial strains to the substrates and to enhance the functional and useful bacterial populations the same inoculum was used when synthetic wastewater was fed as a substrate for one of the batch mode experiments inoculation procedures and transfer of inoculum medium to mfcs were carried out under anaerobic settings the ph of the medium was firstly regulated to 7 0 and the inoculum was added to the media at the ambient temperature of 23 c the inoculated cultures were nurtured by incubation at 30 c to get maximum growth 2 5 analytical and analysis methods the polarization curve is one important parameter used to evaluate the performance of mfc on the base of electrical power generation power density is also a major factor used to portray the phenomena that happen in the mfc reactor and estimate its effectiveness cod removal rate depicts the efficiency of wastewater treatment obviously one of the main objectives of the mfc reactor is treating wastewater to get rid of the cod load polarization curves are considered as a powerful means for the evaluation and representation of microbial fuel cells 14 the plot is a representation of cell potential voltage versus current density the polarization curve can be logged for mfc when it reaches steady state electrical voltage output in this work all the recordings were done by using a variable resistor box 0 10 k ω or potentiostat under variable external loads 0 30 k ω a full featured research grade potentiostat sp 150 of bio logic instrument was used for continuous mode operation sp 150 has a range of current from 10 μa to 800 ma a current resolution of 760 pa a control voltage of 10 v with a voltage resolution of 5 μv in acquirement time of 20 μs and it is integrated with ec lab software while using a potentiostat an appropriate scan rate of 1 mv s was chosen voltage and current were recorded using fluke 289 true rms industrial logging multi meter that is capable of capturing trends the polarization curve data is recorded both from high to low external resistance and low to high external resistance 30 polarization data is obtained using an adjustable external resistance and pseudo steady state conditions are ascertained before the current and potential values are recorded this pseudo steady state achievement can grab a few seconds minutes or more reliant on the mfc scheme and the exterior resistance as per the polarization curve the optimal resistance was found to be 1000 ω and applied to the experimental runs in a continuous mode of operation power density is charted as a function of current density or current which is computed from voltage and current data cod measurements assist how much substrate fuel was transformed into electrical current or biomass through selective reactions with terminal electron acceptors the measurement is carried out using hach lang dr 5000 reactor digestion method to determine the overall bio electrochemical efficiency of the mfc columbic efficiency is calculated from the electrical current data it is the ratio between the electron moles extracted as current to the total electron moles made available due to the oxidation of the substrate 13 31 the cell potential output voltage is recorded with a data logger at 1 minute intervals using fluke 289 multi meter the current current density power and power density were determined using the corresponding formulas 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of batch microbial fuel cell using petroleum refinery wastewater as substrate the initial experiments were performed in a single chamber mfc with air cathode the anode chamber working volume was 250 ml and had an electrode surface area of 50 cm2 the anode chamber of the mfc a was filled with 225 ml prw and 25 ml of inoculum no external resistance was connected in the initial days open circuit voltage ocv between cathode and anode electrodes was recorded using fluke 289 multi meter the ocv steadily progressed and reached 248 mv after 4 days 96 h and was steady for some time and then started to decrease to plot the polarization curve which is a representation of voltage as a function of current density data was recorded when it reached steady state electrical voltage output all the recordings were made using a variable resistor box 0 10 k ω the obtained highest current density and a volumetric power density of 26 67 ma m2 and 67 60 mw m3 respectively were generated in batch mode operation of single chamber mfc using an air cathode fig 2 and table 2 once the system reached a steady state the voltage and current across a selected resistance of 1000 ω were noted over a period of 13 days very low cell potential and power densities were observed the maximum power density observed was only 9 25 μw m2 the cell potential decreased over the time the current density and power density continued to decrease over time and did not show any significant electricity generation as in fig 3 however the cod removal rate was noted as 44 table 3 the initial cod was 992 mg l and after the end of the batch mode operation the cod of the end sample was 549 mg l another experimental run of single chamber mfc using air cathode was performed with synthetic wastewater sww as substrate the sww preparation was done in the lab 32 and filled the anode chamber with 225 ml of sww by adding 25 ml of inoculum medium no external resistance was connected the ocv steadily progressed and reached 250 mv within 48 h and was steady for some time and then started to go down from the polarization curve the maximum volumetric power density value of 10 03 mw m3 and a current density of 5 40 mw m2 were observed table 2 the reactor was connected across a selected resistance of 5000 ω for the next six days to observe the current generation and cod removal efficiency sample analysis results indicated that the cod removal efficiency reached 82 table 3 but the cell potential and electric current generation were declining the third experimental run in batch mode was performed in a dual chamber mfc c with prw as anode fuel and distilled water as a cathodic solution with aeration provided in the cathode chamber without connecting any external resistance ocv was recorded and the cell potential gradually progressed to reach a higher voltage value of 740 mv in 48 h at steady state polarization data was taken the highest cell potential of 432 mv was observed against the external resistance of 10 000 ω during the polarization curve for mfc c the highest volumetric power density value of 99 37 mw m3 and a current density of 51 50 ma m2 were observed across 2000 ω and subsequently the reactor was connected across the selected resistance for the next five days to observe the current generation and cod removal efficiency determined as 89 table 3 the final run in batch mode was conducted in a dual chamber mfc here also prw was the fuel and cathode chamber contained distilled water no aeration was provided it was observed that the performance of mfc d was not stable and the run was repeated three times the current output observed was only 2 38 ma m2 and the volumetric power density was 5 60 mw m3 however there was a cod removal of 72 tables 2 and 3 in batch mode operation the highest cod removal efficiency of 89 fig 4 and the highest current density of 51 50 ma m2 a volumetric power density of 99 40 mw m3 and an ocv of 740 were observed in mfc c which is a dual chamber that use prw as substrate with cathode chamber aeration xuan g et al 2014 reported similar results on starting up the performance of mfc with prw where they reported a maximum volumetric power density of 262 80 mw m3 and a comparatively lower ocv of 550 49 mv 8 that reported higher value of power density might be due to an increased substrate concentration for prw substrate with the exception of the single chamber mfc a which had a cod removal rate of 44 all other mfcs showed more than 70 cod removal in batch mode of operations in both single and dual chamber reactors fig 4 tables 2 3 however current generation is found to be substantially low in mfc d where cathodic aeration was not provided this is an indication that cathodic aeration is an important factor when employing mfcs for wastewater treatment and generation of electricity packing materials affect the performance of mfcs and degradation mechanism of petroleum pollutants using prw as fuel the maximum oil removal efficiency of 84 and power density of 330 4 mw cm3 were achieved using dual chamber granule activated carbon packed bed mfcs 33 prw treatment was carried out in two chamber mfcs using oxygen and permanganate as cathodic electron acceptors a maximum power density of 0 95 w m2 and cod removal efficiency of 78 were achieved during 44 h 34 3 2 effect of hydraulic retention times on the performance of microbial fuel cell with acidified water as catholyte to investigate the effect of various hrt on cod removal efficiency and electricity generation eight experimental runs were performed in dual chamber mfc using prw as substrate in the anode chamber four experimental runs with acidified water aw of ph 2 as cathodic solution were conducted for hrts of 48 24 16 12 h similarly another four experimental runs were performed with pbs ph 7 as a cathodic solution twenty four samples were collected for testing and analysis initially for acclimatization dual chamber mfc using prw as substrate with pbs ph 7 as catholyte and aw ph 2 as catholyte were separately run in continuous mode with a fixed feed flow rate at open circuit conditions after achieving a steady state in the mfc reactor in the first stage 48 h hrt was used this run made use of acidified water with a ph of 2 as a cathodic solution and prw was the substrate in the anode chamber a continuous mode of operation with a feed pump rotation speed of 1 rpm corresponding to hrt of 48 h was maintained using watson marlow peristaltic pump after a steady state operation of 24 h data for the polarization curve was recorded across varying resistance an ocv of 230 mv was reached within 24 h and became a steady state cell potential and volumetric power density profile in relation to external resistances in polarization curve of mfc are represented in fig 5 the cell potential data was captured with respect to the changing external resistances from zero to 30 000 ω the volumetric power density of 10 12 mw m3 was observed at the peak fig 5 then cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h both cell potential and current densities decreased over the period of time fig 6 this plot indicates the cell potential power density and current density in relation to time across selected resistance low power densities and cell potentials were observed at 48 h hrt as seen in fig 6 the maximum current density observed was 2 70 ma m2 the second stage experiment was performed using 24 h hrt after a steady state operation the polarization curve showed to peak at 751 mv across varying resistance the voltage data was captured concerning the changing external resistances from zero to 30 000 ω then cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h results showed that at the peak a volumetric power density of 326 9 mw m3 and current density of 59 9 ma m2 were noticed tables 4 and 5 in addition a maximum current density of 42 ma m2 and the corresponding cell potential of 210 mv was obtained table 5 comparatively higher current densities and cell potentials were noted at 24 h hrt the third sequence of experiments operated at hrt of 16 h and aw catholyte was used with aeration after a steady state operation the polarization curve showed to peak at 698 mv across varying resistance in this experiment the volumetric power density of 328 26 mw m3 and current density of 79 20 ma m2 was the highest recorded table 4 cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h and the maximum current density observed was 49 ma m2 table 5 in the 12 h hrt cycle it was observed that the cell potential dropped to 311 mv the volumetric power density of 21 60 mw m3 and current density of 6 09 ma m2 were noticed table 4 this may be probably because the flow rate is higher and the substrate is not getting enough residence time in the reactor 7 3 3 effect of hydraulic retention times on the performance of microbial fuel cell with phosphate buffer solution as catholyte the second set of four rounds of experiments in continuous mode was also performed in dual chamber mfc pbs of ph 7 was used in the cathode chamber with aeration and conducted at various hrts the first run made use of pbs of ph 7 as a cathodic solution and prw was the substrate at hrt of 48 h after reaching a steady state ocv data for the polarization curve was recorded across varying resistance an ocv of 513 mv was reached at a steady state polarization curves with hrt of 48 h are shown in fig 7 the volumetric power density of 124 51 mw m3 and current density of 17 12 ma m2 were obtained then cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h low power densities and cell potentials were observed at 48 h hrt as seen in fig 8 the maximum current density observed was 3 80 ma m2 however unlike in aw catholyte at 48 h hrt a gradual increase of cell potential and current density were observed for pbs catholyte when connected across a selected resistance of 1000 ω the second round of experimental runs is carried out at an hrt of 24 h after a steady state operation the polarization data was taken and showed to peak at 500 mv for 24 h hrt the cell potential volumetric power density and current density have shown a downward trend compared to 48 h hrt the volumetric power density of 102 90 mw m3 and current density of 15 59 ma m2 were noticed table 6 then cell potential across a selected resistance was recorded for the next 72 h power densities and cell potentials were observed to be lower compared to 48 h hrt the 3rd run which is carried out at hrt of 16 h using prw as substrate and pbs catholyte with cathodic aeration also showed declining voltage and power output after a steady state operation the polarization data was taken and showed to peak at 460 mv results are shown in tables 6 and 7 the overall current density was lower than that of 24 h hrt the final run carried out at hrt of 12 h also showed decreasing cell potential and power output after a steady state operation the polarization data was taken and showed a maximum cell potential of 358 mv the polarization curve reads a volumetric power density of 54 90 mw m3 and a current density of 12 50 ma m2 table 6 power densities and cell potentials were observed to be the lowest compared to other hrts 3 4 power generation at various hydraulic retention times using different catholytes in the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater using dual chamber mfc operating in continuous mode with pbs of ph 7 in the cathode chamber the analysis of experimental data showed that a gradual increase in electricity generation in terms of current and power density was observed with increasing the hydraulic retention time fig 9a the highest current density of 17 12 ma m2 and volumetric power density of 124 50 mw m3 were observed corresponding to an hrt of 48 h for pbs catholyte table 6 however using aw of ph 2 in the cathode chamber at 48 h hrt there is only a very small power generation and 24 h hrt shows a substantial increase in power generation it reaches maximum values at 16 h hrt however current and power density values steeply drop when it comes to 12 h hrt table 4 the highest current density of 79 20 ma m2 and volumetric power density value of 328 26 mw m3 were observed for an hrt of 16 h table 4 this is higher than experiments using pbs catholyte at any of the other hrt trials this value is greater than the reported value of 288 mw m3 for a similar study on starting up the performance of mfc using prw as substrate in batch mode 8 in addition the performance of mfc treating refinery wastewater in continuous mode in terms of the current generation is observed to be better than batch mode operation in similar mfcs in another previous study srikanth et al 2016 showed that continuous operation of mfc treating prw achieved higher performance over batch 225 mw m2 and 84 40 substrate removal at 16 h hrt 35 recently several strategies have been used in our lab to increase the efficiency of mfc treating prw using labaneh whey and sewage as co substrate 36 37 applying mild electrochemical potential with anodic and cathodic biofilm 38 application of short term voltage 39 and integration of mfc with electrochemical system 40 other researchers used pre cultured anode to enhance the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons 41 however reactor scale up and system optimization is required by increasing reactor capacity to an industrial pilot plant size for attaining the effective level of useful and sustainable energy 3 5 wastewater treatment efficiency at various hydraulic retention times using different catholytes the analysis of cod removal data indicates that the cod removal efficiency of dual chamber mfc with pbs of ph 7 in the cathode chamber gradually increases from 74 to 83 as hrt increases in the continuous mode of operation it reaches the highest value of 83 at 48 hrt however it can be seen that when aw of ph 2 is used as catholyte there is no significant change in the cod removal rate as it varies between 81 60 and 84 40 fig 10 analysis of the results of this work indicates that the effluent quality of the refinery wastewater after mfc treatment is highly promising the amount of power generation in all these systems can be affected by various factors including the surface area of the cathodic electrode compared to that of the anode surface area of the membrane nature of microorganisms and internal resistance rabaey and verstraete 2005 31 reported that the range of variables and operating conditions deficiency of available data of internal resistances or power densities resulting from polarization curves make it hard to compare different works in the literature however there was no reporting of the actual setup of dynamically sustainable mfcs for wastewater treatment 31 so the major task of mfcs proposed for prw treatment application is an expansion of the reactor size and electrical energy productivity at the same time for real world large scale industrial applications system scaling up of mfcs will be required by increasing reactor size to a realistic level and attaining an effective quantity of useful energy 7 18 in addition characterization of continuously operated dual chamber mfc will be necessary to determine the essential parameters for optimizing the performance and industrial scale up specific limitations for industrial scale up also include substantial material charge and less effectiveness of diverse culture biofilm on an electrode 42 this study demonstrated the use of real industrial wastewater treatment in mfc reactor the mfc used for cod reduction and power generation while treating the wastewater in the near future the obtained results can be also used as biosensor for determining the cod values the produced power can be stored and may be used for real time application such as lightning and temperature control in reactor however substantial research is needed for finding ways to maximize electrical power generation and scale up to industrial prw treatment applications effects of other operational variables like electrode surface area variable temperature conditions larger reactor volumes different microbial strains organic loading rates and time of operation have to be investigated for process optimization 4 conclusions the performance of mfc using different reactor configurations was investigated for prw treatment and electrical energy generation a single chambered and double chambered mfc using prw obtained from qatar as fuel was used for investigating the degradation efficiency cod removal and characteristics of electricity production this study demonstrated that an mfc system in continuous mode of operation could be a suitable approach for treatment of prw and simultaneous electricity production a cod reduction efficiency higher than 80 was accomplished in continuous double chamber mfc producing a current density of 79 2 ma m2 which is equivalent to a volumetric power density of 328 26 mw m3 the performance of other mfc reactor configurations like stacked mfcs up flow reactors also needs to be probed mfcs are carbon neutral they achieve cod removal objectives of prw with simultaneous energy production eventually advancements in material cost reduction and obtainable power densities may one day make it technically

12872,a high level of chemical energy is contained in petroleum refinery wastewater prw in this study the performance of microbial fuel cell mfc treating prw is investigated in various mfc reactor configurations by studying the removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod from wastewater and the generation of electricity the effect of different hydraulic retention times hrts with a selected external resistance and the effect of catholyte of different phs were investigated in batch and continuous mode of operations using single chamber and dual chamber mfcs the results of continuous modes of operation in dual chamber mfc indicated that the efficiency of cod removal in treating prw reached 84 40 the bioelectricity generation in terms of voltage and current output of mfc was observed to be higher in continuous mode dual chamber operation with cathodic aeration the highest obtained cell voltage of 762 mv and the highest volumetric power density of 328 26 mw m3 were reached in continuously operated dual chamber mfc at hrt of 16 h the highest current density obtained was 79 2 ma m2 this study indicates that the performance of mfc treating prw is promising and continuous mode can be employed for treating prw with simultaneous generation of electricity keywords microbial fuel cell petroleum refinery wastewater chemical oxygen demand bioelectricity generation electrodes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the oil refinery is designed to convert crude oil by physical and chemical transformation into a variety of products 1 the oil refinery in qatar produces a wide range of end products such as liquefied petroleum gas gasoline naphtha diesel jet fuel marine fuel oil lubricating oil and decant oil by processing crude oil and condensate 2 large amounts of water are consumed in petroleum refinery based on the size types of refinery products and operational complications as a result large volumes of wastewater are generated from petroleum refineries it can range from 0 40 to 1 60 times the quantity of crude oil processed 3 in petroleum refineries of qatar a substantial quantity of wastewater produced includes waste that was in contact with hydrocarbons known as process wastewater the wastewater generated from petroleum refinery separation and conversion processing contains many organic pollutants such as hydrocarbons that are toxic to marine life hence petroleum refinery wastewater becomes one of the main pollutants to the environment if not properly treated it causes serious environmental damage and results in abnormal changes in the ecosystem that could spoil the water quality due to the deterioration of microflora and fauna in water bodies 4 prw treatment plant should produce a treated effluent stream that adheres to environmental protection agency emission discharge guidelines and standards applicable in qatar conventional biological and physicochemical methods have been widely used to treat petroleum refinery wastewater prw however the large amounts of energy consumed during the treatment process make it expensive the high energy requirement of the conventional petroleum refinery wastewater treatment systems demands researching alternate treatment technology which is energy efficient technically and economically feasible microbial fuel cells mfcs are an evolving technology that makes use of bacteria for generating electricity from wastewater and simultaneously degrading pollutants in wastewater mfcs are currently gaining importance as they can directly convert the energy in chemical bond to electrical energy in addition to wastewater treatment producing hydrogen from microbial fuel cells desalinating seawater and providing sustainable energy bases for isolated areas are potential fields of future development in the usage of mfcs 5 7 using mfc technology to treat prw the energy consumption is reduced and simultaneously chemical energy contained in the wastewater can be recovered thereby offering a viable and feasible pathway for the utilization of wastewater resources 8 also making use of mfcs for wastewater treatment results in a highly efficient safe process with low emission and candid electricity recovery systems 9 12 mfc generally consists of dual chambers anodic and cathodic compartments which are split by an ion exchange membrane in the anodic compartment bacteria function as a catalyst to transform the organic substrate into electrons protons and carbon dioxide the electrons are moved from anode to cathode that create an electric current while the protons are moved to the cathodic chamber through the membrane in the cathodic chamber oxygen is combined with protons to form water at the surface of a catalyst such as platinum 13 16 although mfc has great potential to be used for renewable energy production and for novel wastewater treatment the process has to be optimized some key issues such as reactor configuration the cost of the catalyst electrode and understanding of microbial activities need to be addressed before the application of mfcs 17 18 considerable attempts were made to maximize the electrical current generation from mfcs by optimizing reactor configuration understanding microbial interaction with electrodes and minimizing internal resistance a wide selection of substrates can be used in mfc as an anode fuel including glucose acetate municipal and industrial wastewaters 19 22 only a few studies have been conducted using prw as a fuel for mfc prw has characteristics differ from one region in the world to another and depending on the type refinery processes zhang et al 2014 reported the effectiveness of treating refinery wastewater in mfc using air cathode 23 guo et al 2014 reported initial findings on the factors affecting mfc start up and performance using oil refinery wastewater as substrate 8 many of the previous studies used either petroleum compounds or individual chemicals such as phenol or using synthetic wastewater in mfc prw contains large organic contaminants with obvious toxicity in addition previous studies elsewhere used mainly batch operation which is not suitable for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater many benefits can be attributed to continuous mode operation including optimization of medium composition for maximal productivity per unit volume data reliability and reproducibility of results 24 additionally understanding of the factors affecting the performance of mfc will be required for converting this technology from lab scale to industrial scale applications for wastewater treatment in the petroleum refining industry ghasemi et al 2021 explored the use of carbon nanotubes and pt cathode nanocomposite electrodes in mfc for the bioenergy production while treating wastewater 25 the highest mfc performance conditions were determined jadhav et al 2021 demonstrated the use of mathematical modeling optimization strategies for the performance enhancement of mfcs 26 mohammadi et al 2021 used two cubic chambers mfc for oilfield produced water treatment at different conditions such as nanocomposite compositions process parameters were optimized for maximum power generation and cod removal efficiency using statistical and mathematical modeling techniques 27 in this work the performance of mfc treating prw is investigated in various mfc reactor configurations in addition the effect of operating parameters like hydraulic retention time hrt and the catholyte solution type were probed in batch and continuous modes of operations using single and dual chamber mfcs the mfc performance was measured as energy recovery mw m3 reactor and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of wastewater besides the electrochemical factors such as power density current density and cell voltage biological parameters such as cod removal efficiency are employed to portray the performance of mfcs 28 29 2 materials and methods 2 1 petroleum refinery wastewater the prw was taken from local refinery in qatar the refinery deals with crude oil and condensate and converts them into a range of finished products primary treatment and secondary treatment facilities are the major components of the existing wastewater treatment plant in the refinery this is followed by carbon adsorption and electrodialysis plant producing treated water of high environmental quality standards and stringent discharge guidelines refinery wastewater samples were collected in bottles of 50 gal each on three different occasions and kept refrigerated at 4 c in the qatar university cold storage room 2 2 characteristics of wastewater the characteristics of the local petroleum refinery wastewater stream were determined after collecting the sample from the refinery output stream of the equalization tank the average feed stream influent wastewater composition admitted to the existing wastewater treatment plant facility is shown in table 1 on average the cod load of the wastewater treatment plant is less than 1000 mg l and the ph ranges from 7 to 9 2 3 construction and design of microbial fuel cells the mfcs configuration used in this work is shown in fig 1 those mfcs were made from acrylic fiber plexiglas the volume of the anodic and cathodic chambers was 250 ml each the anodic chamber was sealed to preserve an anaerobic environment and the anode was made of carbon cloth having a carbon coating of 0 5 mg cm2 with nafion binder the single chamber mfc was of air cathode type in dual chamber mfc the cathode was made of pt with nafion binder 0 50 mg cm2 pt c and the cathode compartment was continuously aerated to keep a constant concentration of dissolved oxygen nafion 117 was installed as pem dual chambered mfcs consist of two compartments as shown in fig 1 the pem connects both chambers the cathode and anode are accommodated in two separate chambers the electrode surface area is 50 cm2 in the continuous mode operation of dual chamber mfcs the catholyte used was phosphate buffer solution pbs of ph 7 for the first set of experiments and acidified water aw of ph 2 for the next set of experiments respectively the four performed batch mode experiments were mfc a mfc b mfc c and mfc d as shown in table 2 2 4 inoculum preparation and enrichment of microorganisms anaerobic sludge taken from local wastewater treatment plant doha qatar was used as an inoculum an inoculum of defined nutrient media containing mineral vitamin solution and fatty acid mixture was prepared this inoculum was used in all the experiments with prw substrate experiments were conducted in batch as well as in continuous operation mode for the first two weeks the reactors were fed with prw in order to accustom the microbial strains to the substrates and to enhance the functional and useful bacterial populations the same inoculum was used when synthetic wastewater was fed as a substrate for one of the batch mode experiments inoculation procedures and transfer of inoculum medium to mfcs were carried out under anaerobic settings the ph of the medium was firstly regulated to 7 0 and the inoculum was added to the media at the ambient temperature of 23 c the inoculated cultures were nurtured by incubation at 30 c to get maximum growth 2 5 analytical and analysis methods the polarization curve is one important parameter used to evaluate the performance of mfc on the base of electrical power generation power density is also a major factor used to portray the phenomena that happen in the mfc reactor and estimate its effectiveness cod removal rate depicts the efficiency of wastewater treatment obviously one of the main objectives of the mfc reactor is treating wastewater to get rid of the cod load polarization curves are considered as a powerful means for the evaluation and representation of microbial fuel cells 14 the plot is a representation of cell potential voltage versus current density the polarization curve can be logged for mfc when it reaches steady state electrical voltage output in this work all the recordings were done by using a variable resistor box 0 10 k ω or potentiostat under variable external loads 0 30 k ω a full featured research grade potentiostat sp 150 of bio logic instrument was used for continuous mode operation sp 150 has a range of current from 10 μa to 800 ma a current resolution of 760 pa a control voltage of 10 v with a voltage resolution of 5 μv in acquirement time of 20 μs and it is integrated with ec lab software while using a potentiostat an appropriate scan rate of 1 mv s was chosen voltage and current were recorded using fluke 289 true rms industrial logging multi meter that is capable of capturing trends the polarization curve data is recorded both from high to low external resistance and low to high external resistance 30 polarization data is obtained using an adjustable external resistance and pseudo steady state conditions are ascertained before the current and potential values are recorded this pseudo steady state achievement can grab a few seconds minutes or more reliant on the mfc scheme and the exterior resistance as per the polarization curve the optimal resistance was found to be 1000 ω and applied to the experimental runs in a continuous mode of operation power density is charted as a function of current density or current which is computed from voltage and current data cod measurements assist how much substrate fuel was transformed into electrical current or biomass through selective reactions with terminal electron acceptors the measurement is carried out using hach lang dr 5000 reactor digestion method to determine the overall bio electrochemical efficiency of the mfc columbic efficiency is calculated from the electrical current data it is the ratio between the electron moles extracted as current to the total electron moles made available due to the oxidation of the substrate 13 31 the cell potential output voltage is recorded with a data logger at 1 minute intervals using fluke 289 multi meter the current current density power and power density were determined using the corresponding formulas 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of batch microbial fuel cell using petroleum refinery wastewater as substrate the initial experiments were performed in a single chamber mfc with air cathode the anode chamber working volume was 250 ml and had an electrode surface area of 50 cm2 the anode chamber of the mfc a was filled with 225 ml prw and 25 ml of inoculum no external resistance was connected in the initial days open circuit voltage ocv between cathode and anode electrodes was recorded using fluke 289 multi meter the ocv steadily progressed and reached 248 mv after 4 days 96 h and was steady for some time and then started to decrease to plot the polarization curve which is a representation of voltage as a function of current density data was recorded when it reached steady state electrical voltage output all the recordings were made using a variable resistor box 0 10 k ω the obtained highest current density and a volumetric power density of 26 67 ma m2 and 67 60 mw m3 respectively were generated in batch mode operation of single chamber mfc using an air cathode fig 2 and table 2 once the system reached a steady state the voltage and current across a selected resistance of 1000 ω were noted over a period of 13 days very low cell potential and power densities were observed the maximum power density observed was only 9 25 μw m2 the cell potential decreased over the time the current density and power density continued to decrease over time and did not show any significant electricity generation as in fig 3 however the cod removal rate was noted as 44 table 3 the initial cod was 992 mg l and after the end of the batch mode operation the cod of the end sample was 549 mg l another experimental run of single chamber mfc using air cathode was performed with synthetic wastewater sww as substrate the sww preparation was done in the lab 32 and filled the anode chamber with 225 ml of sww by adding 25 ml of inoculum medium no external resistance was connected the ocv steadily progressed and reached 250 mv within 48 h and was steady for some time and then started to go down from the polarization curve the maximum volumetric power density value of 10 03 mw m3 and a current density of 5 40 mw m2 were observed table 2 the reactor was connected across a selected resistance of 5000 ω for the next six days to observe the current generation and cod removal efficiency sample analysis results indicated that the cod removal efficiency reached 82 table 3 but the cell potential and electric current generation were declining the third experimental run in batch mode was performed in a dual chamber mfc c with prw as anode fuel and distilled water as a cathodic solution with aeration provided in the cathode chamber without connecting any external resistance ocv was recorded and the cell potential gradually progressed to reach a higher voltage value of 740 mv in 48 h at steady state polarization data was taken the highest cell potential of 432 mv was observed against the external resistance of 10 000 ω during the polarization curve for mfc c the highest volumetric power density value of 99 37 mw m3 and a current density of 51 50 ma m2 were observed across 2000 ω and subsequently the reactor was connected across the selected resistance for the next five days to observe the current generation and cod removal efficiency determined as 89 table 3 the final run in batch mode was conducted in a dual chamber mfc here also prw was the fuel and cathode chamber contained distilled water no aeration was provided it was observed that the performance of mfc d was not stable and the run was repeated three times the current output observed was only 2 38 ma m2 and the volumetric power density was 5 60 mw m3 however there was a cod removal of 72 tables 2 and 3 in batch mode operation the highest cod removal efficiency of 89 fig 4 and the highest current density of 51 50 ma m2 a volumetric power density of 99 40 mw m3 and an ocv of 740 were observed in mfc c which is a dual chamber that use prw as substrate with cathode chamber aeration xuan g et al 2014 reported similar results on starting up the performance of mfc with prw where they reported a maximum volumetric power density of 262 80 mw m3 and a comparatively lower ocv of 550 49 mv 8 that reported higher value of power density might be due to an increased substrate concentration for prw substrate with the exception of the single chamber mfc a which had a cod removal rate of 44 all other mfcs showed more than 70 cod removal in batch mode of operations in both single and dual chamber reactors fig 4 tables 2 3 however current generation is found to be substantially low in mfc d where cathodic aeration was not provided this is an indication that cathodic aeration is an important factor when employing mfcs for wastewater treatment and generation of electricity packing materials affect the performance of mfcs and degradation mechanism of petroleum pollutants using prw as fuel the maximum oil removal efficiency of 84 and power density of 330 4 mw cm3 were achieved using dual chamber granule activated carbon packed bed mfcs 33 prw treatment was carried out in two chamber mfcs using oxygen and permanganate as cathodic electron acceptors a maximum power density of 0 95 w m2 and cod removal efficiency of 78 were achieved during 44 h 34 3 2 effect of hydraulic retention times on the performance of microbial fuel cell with acidified water as catholyte to investigate the effect of various hrt on cod removal efficiency and electricity generation eight experimental runs were performed in dual chamber mfc using prw as substrate in the anode chamber four experimental runs with acidified water aw of ph 2 as cathodic solution were conducted for hrts of 48 24 16 12 h similarly another four experimental runs were performed with pbs ph 7 as a cathodic solution twenty four samples were collected for testing and analysis initially for acclimatization dual chamber mfc using prw as substrate with pbs ph 7 as catholyte and aw ph 2 as catholyte were separately run in continuous mode with a fixed feed flow rate at open circuit conditions after achieving a steady state in the mfc reactor in the first stage 48 h hrt was used this run made use of acidified water with a ph of 2 as a cathodic solution and prw was the substrate in the anode chamber a continuous mode of operation with a feed pump rotation speed of 1 rpm corresponding to hrt of 48 h was maintained using watson marlow peristaltic pump after a steady state operation of 24 h data for the polarization curve was recorded across varying resistance an ocv of 230 mv was reached within 24 h and became a steady state cell potential and volumetric power density profile in relation to external resistances in polarization curve of mfc are represented in fig 5 the cell potential data was captured with respect to the changing external resistances from zero to 30 000 ω the volumetric power density of 10 12 mw m3 was observed at the peak fig 5 then cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h both cell potential and current densities decreased over the period of time fig 6 this plot indicates the cell potential power density and current density in relation to time across selected resistance low power densities and cell potentials were observed at 48 h hrt as seen in fig 6 the maximum current density observed was 2 70 ma m2 the second stage experiment was performed using 24 h hrt after a steady state operation the polarization curve showed to peak at 751 mv across varying resistance the voltage data was captured concerning the changing external resistances from zero to 30 000 ω then cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h results showed that at the peak a volumetric power density of 326 9 mw m3 and current density of 59 9 ma m2 were noticed tables 4 and 5 in addition a maximum current density of 42 ma m2 and the corresponding cell potential of 210 mv was obtained table 5 comparatively higher current densities and cell potentials were noted at 24 h hrt the third sequence of experiments operated at hrt of 16 h and aw catholyte was used with aeration after a steady state operation the polarization curve showed to peak at 698 mv across varying resistance in this experiment the volumetric power density of 328 26 mw m3 and current density of 79 20 ma m2 was the highest recorded table 4 cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h and the maximum current density observed was 49 ma m2 table 5 in the 12 h hrt cycle it was observed that the cell potential dropped to 311 mv the volumetric power density of 21 60 mw m3 and current density of 6 09 ma m2 were noticed table 4 this may be probably because the flow rate is higher and the substrate is not getting enough residence time in the reactor 7 3 3 effect of hydraulic retention times on the performance of microbial fuel cell with phosphate buffer solution as catholyte the second set of four rounds of experiments in continuous mode was also performed in dual chamber mfc pbs of ph 7 was used in the cathode chamber with aeration and conducted at various hrts the first run made use of pbs of ph 7 as a cathodic solution and prw was the substrate at hrt of 48 h after reaching a steady state ocv data for the polarization curve was recorded across varying resistance an ocv of 513 mv was reached at a steady state polarization curves with hrt of 48 h are shown in fig 7 the volumetric power density of 124 51 mw m3 and current density of 17 12 ma m2 were obtained then cell potential across a selected resistance of 1000 ω was recorded for the next 72 h low power densities and cell potentials were observed at 48 h hrt as seen in fig 8 the maximum current density observed was 3 80 ma m2 however unlike in aw catholyte at 48 h hrt a gradual increase of cell potential and current density were observed for pbs catholyte when connected across a selected resistance of 1000 ω the second round of experimental runs is carried out at an hrt of 24 h after a steady state operation the polarization data was taken and showed to peak at 500 mv for 24 h hrt the cell potential volumetric power density and current density have shown a downward trend compared to 48 h hrt the volumetric power density of 102 90 mw m3 and current density of 15 59 ma m2 were noticed table 6 then cell potential across a selected resistance was recorded for the next 72 h power densities and cell potentials were observed to be lower compared to 48 h hrt the 3rd run which is carried out at hrt of 16 h using prw as substrate and pbs catholyte with cathodic aeration also showed declining voltage and power output after a steady state operation the polarization data was taken and showed to peak at 460 mv results are shown in tables 6 and 7 the overall current density was lower than that of 24 h hrt the final run carried out at hrt of 12 h also showed decreasing cell potential and power output after a steady state operation the polarization data was taken and showed a maximum cell potential of 358 mv the polarization curve reads a volumetric power density of 54 90 mw m3 and a current density of 12 50 ma m2 table 6 power densities and cell potentials were observed to be the lowest compared to other hrts 3 4 power generation at various hydraulic retention times using different catholytes in the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater using dual chamber mfc operating in continuous mode with pbs of ph 7 in the cathode chamber the analysis of experimental data showed that a gradual increase in electricity generation in terms of current and power density was observed with increasing the hydraulic retention time fig 9a the highest current density of 17 12 ma m2 and volumetric power density of 124 50 mw m3 were observed corresponding to an hrt of 48 h for pbs catholyte table 6 however using aw of ph 2 in the cathode chamber at 48 h hrt there is only a very small power generation and 24 h hrt shows a substantial increase in power generation it reaches maximum values at 16 h hrt however current and power density values steeply drop when it comes to 12 h hrt table 4 the highest current density of 79 20 ma m2 and volumetric power density value of 328 26 mw m3 were observed for an hrt of 16 h table 4 this is higher than experiments using pbs catholyte at any of the other hrt trials this value is greater than the reported value of 288 mw m3 for a similar study on starting up the performance of mfc using prw as substrate in batch mode 8 in addition the performance of mfc treating refinery wastewater in continuous mode in terms of the current generation is observed to be better than batch mode operation in similar mfcs in another previous study srikanth et al 2016 showed that continuous operation of mfc treating prw achieved higher performance over batch 225 mw m2 and 84 40 substrate removal at 16 h hrt 35 recently several strategies have been used in our lab to increase the efficiency of mfc treating prw using labaneh whey and sewage as co substrate 36 37 applying mild electrochemical potential with anodic and cathodic biofilm 38 application of short term voltage 39 and integration of mfc with electrochemical system 40 other researchers used pre cultured anode to enhance the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons 41 however reactor scale up and system optimization is required by increasing reactor capacity to an industrial pilot plant size for attaining the effective level of useful and sustainable energy 3 5 wastewater treatment efficiency at various hydraulic retention times using different catholytes the analysis of cod removal data indicates that the cod removal efficiency of dual chamber mfc with pbs of ph 7 in the cathode chamber gradually increases from 74 to 83 as hrt increases in the continuous mode of operation it reaches the highest value of 83 at 48 hrt however it can be seen that when aw of ph 2 is used as catholyte there is no significant change in the cod removal rate as it varies between 81 60 and 84 40 fig 10 analysis of the results of this work indicates that the effluent quality of the refinery wastewater after mfc treatment is highly promising the amount of power generation in all these systems can be affected by various factors including the surface area of the cathodic electrode compared to that of the anode surface area of the membrane nature of microorganisms and internal resistance rabaey and verstraete 2005 31 reported that the range of variables and operating conditions deficiency of available data of internal resistances or power densities resulting from polarization curves make it hard to compare different works in the literature however there was no reporting of the actual setup of dynamically sustainable mfcs for wastewater treatment 31 so the major task of mfcs proposed for prw treatment application is an expansion of the reactor size and electrical energy productivity at the same time for real world large scale industrial applications system scaling up of mfcs will be required by increasing reactor size to a realistic level and attaining an effective quantity of useful energy 7 18 in addition characterization of continuously operated dual chamber mfc will be necessary to determine the essential parameters for optimizing the performance and industrial scale up specific limitations for industrial scale up also include substantial material charge and less effectiveness of diverse culture biofilm on an electrode 42 this study demonstrated the use of real industrial wastewater treatment in mfc reactor the mfc used for cod reduction and power generation while treating the wastewater in the near future the obtained results can be also used as biosensor for determining the cod values the produced power can be stored and may be used for real time application such as lightning and temperature control in reactor however substantial research is needed for finding ways to maximize electrical power generation and scale up to industrial prw treatment applications effects of other operational variables like electrode surface area variable temperature conditions larger reactor volumes different microbial strains organic loading rates and time of operation have to be investigated for process optimization 4 conclusions the performance of mfc using different reactor configurations was investigated for prw treatment and electrical energy generation a single chambered and double chambered mfc using prw obtained from qatar as fuel was used for investigating the degradation efficiency cod removal and characteristics of electricity production this study demonstrated that an mfc system in continuous mode of operation could be a suitable approach for treatment of prw and simultaneous electricity production a cod reduction efficiency higher than 80 was accomplished in continuous double chamber mfc producing a current density of 79 2 ma m2 which is equivalent to a volumetric power density of 328 26 mw m3 the performance of other mfc reactor configurations like stacked mfcs up flow reactors also needs to be probed mfcs are carbon neutral they achieve cod removal objectives of prw with simultaneous energy production eventually advancements in material cost reduction and obtainable power densities may one day make it technically

12873,this study presents an environmental friendly technique for vanadium precipitation using lysine experimental results indicate that 99 4 of the vanadium is precipitated under the select reaction conditions within the lysine during the precipitation process the vanadium exists as negatively charged polyoxometalates while the lysine is positively charged the negative vanadium polyoxometalates precipitate out through electrostatic interactions the results shown in this study introduce a new way to utilize lysine and a new treatment for polyoxometalates graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords vanadium precipitation lysine data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vanadium and its compounds are widely used in many fields owing to their excellent physicochemical properties they have been nick named the vitamins of modern industry 1 4 vanadium is often recovered as v2o5 through several steps roasting sodium calcium and blank roasting leaching direct leaching acidic leaching alkaline leaching and water leaching precipitation hydrolysis ammonium precipitation metal precipitation and roasting 5 8 during the precipitation process many technologies have been used as the final step for recovery of vanadium 9 13 ammonium salt precipitation technology is the most common and traditional method of vanadium recovery it has been successful in industrial applications in china with high vanadium recovery efficiency however the excess ammonium in residual wastewater poses a threat to the environment thus there is a crucial need for new treatments some new precipitating agents have been introduced to replace ammonium salts amino acids possessing nh2 and cooh have drawn our attention because previous studies have indicated that melamine and urea have considerable precipitation efficiency for vanadium under specific conditions nearly 100 with melamine and 95 with urea 14 18 in recent studies lysine has been widely used in the treatment of heavy metal containing wastewater and the acid dissociation constant of lysine is 2 18 which indicates that lysine is positively charged at low ph and can absorb negatively charged anions 19 21 in this study lysine is used to precipitate vanadium and the effect of various reaction parameters including dosage of lysine reaction temperature concentration of h2so4 solution ph and reaction time on the precipitation process are discussed 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials sodium vanadate sulfuric acid and lysine are purchased from kelong co ltd and all the chemicals used are of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures the vanadium solution for the precipitation tests is prepared by dissolving a certain amount of na3vo4 in the distilled water batch precipitation experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of operating parameters dosage of lysine concentration of h2so4 or solution ph reaction time and reaction temperature on the precipitation efficiency of vanadium firstly 100 ml vanadium solution with a concentration of 2 7 g l is adding into 250 ml three neck flasks and then being placed in a water bath to heat secondly the ph value of the vanadium solution is adjusted with sulfuric acid next amount of lysine is added into the solution as the temperature is heated to the specified temperature followed with stirring at 500 rpm finally the filtrate is separated rapidly from the precipitation by vacuum filtration after reacted for specified reaction time the concentration of residual vanadium in the filtrate is measured by icp oes 17 18 and the precipitation efficiency of vanadium η is calculated using eq 1 1 η c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of vanadium g l and ct is the concentration of residual vanadium at time t g l 3 results and discussion many studies about precipitation of metal ions by lysine have been conducted and the related results are displayed in table 1 22 the results indicate that lysine can cause high efficiency precipitation of polyoxometalates 3 1 effect of lysine during the precipitation process vanadium is removed from the solution by reacting with lysine thus the dosage of lysine shows a significant influence on the precipitation process some experiments are conducted at different reaction temperatures with an h2so4 concentration of 10 g l the dosage of lysine n ly n v is set as n ly n v 0 6 n ly n v 1 2 n ly n v 1 8 n ly n v 2 4 and n ly n v 3 0 respectively as shown in fig 1 increasing the dosage of lysine can have a detectable though not statistically positive effect on the precipitation of vanadium at a low dosage of lysine there are not enough charge sites at the surface of the lysine particles so few negatively charged vanadium ions are precipitated the high dosage of lysine provides enough charge sites for vanadium and achieves high precipitation efficiency 23 higher precipitation efficiency is achieved by extending the reaction time 3 2 effect of h2so4 concentration the presence of vanadium in the vanadium v h2o system is simulated and the mole fraction of each species along the ph is plotted in fig 2a the results indicate that the main vanadium species are vo2 h2vo4 h2v2o7 2 hv10o28 5 h2v10o28 4 v10o28 6 and h3v10o28 3 the other species are ignored as the mole fraction below 1 almost 100 of the vanadium v in the solution is presented in the form of vo2 at ph 1 it transforms into other species as the ph increases h2vo4 forms at ph 3 5 and the highest mole fraction is below 15 at all ph values the other main species are hxv10o28 6 x like v10o28 6 ph 4 5 7 hv10o28 5 ph 2 7 h2v10o28 4 ph 2 6 5 and h3v10o28 3 ph 1 5 5 which means that the vanadium is present mainly in the form of polyoxometalates the effect of concentration of h2so4 h2so4 on the precipitation efficiency of vanadium is investigated as the vanadium species have significant effect on the precipitation process the h2so4 is set as h2so4 10 g l about ph 2 5 h2so4 15 g l about ph 2 0 h2so4 20 g l about ph 1 8 h2so4 25 g l about ph 1 5 and h2so4 30 g l about ph 1 2 respectively as shown in fig 2b the precipitation efficiency of vanadium decreased with as the concentration of h2so4 increased of note 99 4 of vanadium is precipitated at h2so4 10 g l which means just1 66 mg l vanadium retains in the solution previous studies have indicated that lysine can remove metals in polyoxometalates effectively the vanadium solution is in weak medium and the vanadium present as polyoxometalates at h2so4 10 g l according to the results shown in fig 2a thus most of the vanadium can be precipitated increasing the concentration of h2so4 increases the solution acidic and the vanadium transforms to vo2 which is not beneficial for vanadium precipitation with lysine thus the precipitation efficiency decreases as the concentration of h2so4 increases these results differ from removal of vanadium by urea glycine glutamic acid and melamine 14 18 thus h2so4 10 g l is selected as optimal concentration of h2so4 for further experiments 3 3 effect of reaction temperature fig 3 summarizes the effect of reaction temperature results show that the precipitation efficiency increases with reaction temperature in a linear fashion at low reaction temperatures the overall precipitation is below 40 at all dosages of lysine even with a long reaction time most vanadium remains in the solution and cannot be precipitated out due to a low diffusion rate and high viscosity the diffusion rate of vanadium ions and lysine is promoted by the increase in reaction temperature which caused them to come into contact more frequently and achieved high precipitation efficiency the precipitation efficiency increases from 21 2 to 84 3 as reaction temperature increases from 30 to 90 c at n ly n v 0 6 and from 42 1 to 99 4 at n ly n v 3 0 over all higher reaction temperatures are beneficial to vanadium precipitation 3 4 precipitation kinetics analysis a widely used method for the description of crystallization kinetics and analysis of the dimensions of crystal growth is the avrami model described well in the supporting information the experimental data are fitted with avrami model to analyze the precipitation kinetics as shown in fig 4 the calculated avrami exponents are all below 1 0 3080 at 30 c 0 2764 at 45 c 0 2914 at 60 c 0 8147 at 75 c and 0 9112 at 90 c which indicate that the precipitation occurred in the column per the one dimensional crystalline growth model 24 25 while the sem of the precipitation showing in fig 5 displays the precipitation is in sphericity with complex structure like a flower with many holes the results are non consistent with the avrami model thus the precipitation kinetics behavior is more complex and cannot be described just by the simulated model it is similar with the results in our previous study that recovery of vanadium with glycine 17 meanwhile the element mapping of the precipitation is conducted and the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the precipitation is a complex compound consists of c n o v and h not display which is not nh4 2v6o16 1 5h2o obtained by other nh2 compounds inorganic ammonium salt urea 14 the reaction mechanism between nh2 compounds and vanadium ions is more complex which cannot explain well just according to the results of lysine and vanadium ions more and more works about recovery of vanadium with nh2 compounds are needed to explain the detail mechanism in our future works 4 conclusions this paper study proposes a novel method for vanadium precipitation the following conclusions can be drawn 1 lysine is an efficient precipitation agent for vanadium recovery the vanadium concentration is decreased from 2 7 g l to 1 66 mg l nearly 99 4 of vanadium is precipitated under the selected reaction conditions concentration of h2so4 at 10 g l dosage of lysine at n lysine n v 3 0 reaction time of 60 min and reaction temperature of 90 c respectively 2 researching results show lysine can promote dehydration condensation reactions of polyoxometalates during the reaction process and achieve high precipitation efficiency of heavy metals it can be used for industrial waste treatment and recycling in the near future owing to this great advantage declaration of competing interest the authors

12874,superhydrophobic materials like carbon coated sponges have been attracting attention due to their wide applicability in several industries one of the main applications of such materials is the efficient removal of various water pollutants such as oil by adsorption herein a flexible porous and hydrophilic melamine sponge was coated by superhydrophobic soot that was produced by incomplete combustion of the propane butane mixture characterization of the soot and the sponge was performed via several methods such as spectroscopy microscopy and thermogravimetry the product was tested in the petroleum oil removal process the superhydrophobic sponge repelled water well and at the same time perfectly sorbed oil products the wetting edge angle of soot coated sponge was found between 145 and 150 the sponge showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 24 g oil g for the selective separation of oil from water the entrapped oil was released simply by squeezing the sponge for cyclic use and about 95 5 wt of the oil was adsorbed and the soot coated sponge still maintained this capacity after 19 cycles hence this novel soot coated hydrophobic sponge is considered a promising candidate for oil polluted water treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords soot hydrophobicity hydrophobic sponge adsorption oil water separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water on earth is one of the most abundant natural resources but only about 1 of that resource is available for human consumption it is known that over 1 1 billion people lack a supply of adequate high quality water due to the growing population and a variety of climatic and environmental effects 1 3 the majority of the pollutants in drinking water are arising from industrial agricultural and mining activities that lead to an increase in toxic materials contamination 4 in addition to these inorganic contaminants organic pollutants from volatile organic compounds synthetic organic compounds oil spills and waste disposal are the main reasons for water pollution which have reprotoxic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects 5 especially spillage of petroleum hydrocarbons during exploration production transportation storage and utilization of oil causes serious environmental pollution 6 7 oil spills are known among the most extensive and environmentally damaging pollution problems 8 when petroleum oil is emulsified in water problems generate ecological changes and negative impacts on aquatic life such as threatening the lives of fauna and the food chain due to the destruction of arable farmlands and fishing areas the greatest concern of such spills is the long term effects of both acute and chronic contaminations that can cause diseases for decades or more 9 therefore significant research has been devoted to remedial technologies for oil water separation across the globe 10 currently several treatment processes for oil water separation have been investigated such as chemical methods dispersion solidification in situ burning bioremediation and mechanical recovery 11 however most of these methods are considered non viable due to their cost creation of secondary pollution having low selectivity and efficiency towards petroleum contaminants 3 11 the oil water separation process by physical sorption has always been the subject of active research since it is one of the most effective and inexpensive methods that offer good recyclability of the adsorbents various sorbent materials are aimed at removing and remediating oil spills which may be in the form of powders foams and fabrics 12 but some challenges remain in the adsorption technology such as improving expertise in developing selective sorbents and reducing the manufacturing cost using low cost precursors the important point is the production of adsorbents with superior capacity and selectivity which means they are capable of primary removal of petroleum oil rather than water moreover reusability and regeneration characteristics are the other factors that should be considered in the selection of sorbent materials there has been an increasing amount of research on the fabrication of oil adsorbing materials aiming at the separation of oils from water 11 at this point tailoring materials with specific wettability using the basics of chemistry and nanotechnology for oil water separation is essential to developing feasible water remediation processes 13 in the literature some natural sorbents have shown promising results making them potential candidates for oil adsorption from the aqueous medium on the other hand synthetic sorbents such as waste material or a side product of industrial processing have promising results 14 especially carbon based adsorbents have been considered to be the best candidates in the field of oil spill cleanup as they possess high surface area low density good chemical stability and large pore volume some carbon materials including carbon aerogels graphene or carbon nanotube coated sponges graphene foams or sponges activated carbon porous carbon nanoparticles and activated carbon fibers have already been successfully applied for adsorption based separation and purification processes 15 17 this is due to the existence of several physiochemical mechanisms forces such as van der waals hydrogen bonding dipole dipole interactions ion exchange covalent bonding and cation bridging and water bridging during the adsorption on the carbons 18 furthermore carbons with different morphology and functionality may be obtained by adjusting precursor production method and conditions together with post treatments such as modification 19 in this study special attention was paid to the use of carbonaceous soot to prepare a superhydrophobic material for the oil spill clean up process soot can be simply defined as a carbon material that is generated from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons it is well known that soot has remarkable advantages in the cost effectiveness and production scalability over other carbon materials like graphene carbon nanotube and activated carbons in their synthesis moreover when soot is examined in sorption processes it shows good adsorption capacity towards several pollutants and has good recyclability due to its chemical stability 20 21 in addition it can be easily modified to have magnetic properties to achieve better separation characteristics 22 24 a broad literature survey pointed out the applicability of the soot in such kinds of adsorption studies but to our knowledge there are no studies that formally test the ability of sponges in cyclic petroleum oil adsorption which incorporates soot of propane butane combustion flame into the melamine matrix the oil removal application of straightforward and easily producible soot coated sponges with a high capacity and reusability is the essential feature of this study within the scope of this study superhydrophobic soot was produced from propane butane mixture to obtain a hydrophobic sponge by coating technique due to having high strength low cost and lightweight features together with good chemical and thermal resistance the melamine sponge was selected as a template highly porous melamine sponge over 99 porosity commercially known as magic eraser and its composites can be utilized as adsorbents for several water cleaning purposes the hydrophilic character of melamine sponge is its drawback for water applications and therefore the properties of melamine sponge are modified to achieve more suitable materials among the several modification techniques of melamine sponge coating its surface with a carbon material via a simple dip and dry method seems to be a promising one for oil water separation processes typically graphene oxide or reduced graphene oxide nanoparticles are preferred as the coating material to enhance the mechanical strength of the pristine sponge and to obtain a hydrophobic structure 25 27 the novelty of this study is that it is the first to explicitly examine the oil sorption behavior of soot coated melamine sponge by employing cyclic adsorption

analytical grade for the adsorption of oil petroleum from the zhanaozen region of kazakhstan is used without any pretreatment 2 2 synthesis of the soot the synthesis of superhydrophobic soot was carried out in the flame of a propane butane mixture by applying an electric field fig 1 shows a diagram of the synthesis apparatus a special generator drives a steel drum with a diameter of 12 5 cm and a length of 13 5 cm the principle of operation of the installation is based on the deposition of soot particles from the flame on the surface of a rotating drum cylinder and its automatic collection into a soot collector using a built in scraper the structure and properties of soot particles depend on the temperature in the flame volume since the formation of a soot particle does not occur instantly but through a sequence of reactions its structure and properties will also depend on the collection of soot at a certain level of its growth the distance between the drum and the burner normally 2 0 cm is an important operating condition and increasing the distance over 3 0 cm leads to an increase in the amount of forming soot the optimal mode of formation of soot having a superhydrophobic property is obtained at a collection distance of 2 0 cm with a contact angle of 150 in this work the soot was synthesized in the 1 kv current field under the action of incomplete combustion of propane butane mixture under optimal conditions the flow rate of the supplied gas was between 425 and 500 cm3 min 1 the rate of soot synthesis was equal to 0 005 g min 1 2 3 characterization of the soot the soot sample prepared as described above was characterized in terms of thermal stability surface characteristics morphology and other physicochemical properties thermogravimetric analysis tga was implemented on an analyzer setaram labsys evo with a heating rate of 20 c min 1 under nitrogen or air atmospheres with a flow rate of 20 ml min 1 to observe the stability of the soot sample against elevated temperatures 10 0 3 mg of sample was placed in a 100 μl alumina crucible and placed in tga prior to the heating step the furnace chamber was kept at 25 c for 35 min under n2 atmosphere to reach steady conditions the real density of the soot sample was measured using a quantachrome ultrafoam 1200e helium pycnometer approximately 2 cm3 of the sample was placed in the measurement cell and 5 runs were carried out to calculate the average density and standard deviation the particle size distribution of soot was measured by a particle size analyzer

sputter coater to minimize sample charging secondary electron micrographs were taken at several magnifications the pore characteristics and specific surface area ssa were determined by multi point n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 196 c using quantachrome autosorb prior to n2 adsorption soot was degassed at 150 c for at least 12 h using brunauer emmett teller bet equation ssa was determined ft ir spectroscopy was carried out in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 using a spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet is10 the samples were well mixed with kbr at a weight ratio of 1 99 and the mixture was pressed into pellets under 8 10 tons of pressure for 10 s the scan time and spectral resolution were 32 and 4 cm 1 respectively the raman characterization of carbon based samples was performed on a raman spectrometer ntegra spectra raman λ 473 nm the area signals with a diameter of 80 nm the x ray diffractogram xrd of soot was recorded using an x ray diffractometer miniflex 600 w rigaku with cu kα radiation 1 5436 å 40 kv 15 ma the diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10 90 with an increment of 2 min 1 the graphitization degree of the sample was calculated according to the following equation 28 30 1 graphitization degree 0 3440 d 002 0 3440 0 3354 100 where 0 3440 nm and 0 3354 nm are the interlayer spacing of fully non graphite crystals and the ideal graphite crystals respectively d002 is the interlaying spacing and can be calculated by bragg s law 28 29 2 d 002 nλ 2 sin θ where n is the order of the diffraction n 1 λ is the emission wavelength 0 15406 nm and θ is the peak position in radians for 002 peak 2 4 preparation and characterization of superhydrophobic sponge 25 mg of the soot was dispersed in a 20 ml solution of dichloroethane after which a 60 minute ultrasound treatment was performed then the melamine sponge which was cleaned with acetone and dried in an oven at 80 c was immersed in the soot dispersion the sponge covered with soot was dried again in the oven at a temperature of 80 c for 2 h after coating the melamine sponge with superhydrophobic soot its water flotation behavior was tested and compared with the as received melamine sponge as shown in fig 2 the coated melamine sponge with superhydrophobic soot seemed to float easily on the surface of the water which can be an indication of its applicability for the liquid phase selective adsorption processes the wetting contact angle was measured using a drop shape analyzer dsa25 krüss gmbh kruss device the accuracy of the device is 0 1 the experiments were carried out at 25 c under 931 mpa and at a humidity of 60 80 distilled water was used for all the experiments a 2 00 μl drop of water was dosed on the sample after 5 s of stabilization the wetting angle of the sample surface was measured the effect of acid and alkali conditions on the mechanical characteristics of the soot coated sponge was studied in detail the product was placed into 1 m hcl and naoh solutions for 3 h of exposure cyclic compressing bending and twisting behaviors were tested together with tensile strength measurements to investigate the acid and alkali resistance of the soot coated sponges the tensile strength of the sponges at ambient temperature was measured using an electronic tensile machine jinan hensgrand wdw 50e for the samples prepared in the same dimensions 2 cm 2 cm 1 cm the drawing speed was 5 mm min 1 and the clamping distance was 200 mm 2 5 oil water separation for the oil water separation experiments petroleum from the zhanaozen deposit of the west kazakhstan region was used to study the adsorption properties the oil water mixture was prepared as follows 35 ml of distilled water was poured into a petri dish and 3 0 ml of petroleum oil was added a sponge with dimensions of 2 cm 2 cm 1 cm was placed on the surface of the water oil mixture and the sponge was allowed to fully adsorb the oil fig 3 to confirm the hydrophobic characteristic of the coated sponge for the adsorption of oil in the aqueous phase the adsorption capacity was tested in batch experiments the time required for the sorption was noted to calculate the adsorption rate desorption was carried out by simple compression of the sponge and then to completely remove the oil sponge was washed in benzene the adsorption desorption experiments were repeated until reaching a point where the oil sorption capacity decreased all adsorption desorption experiments were performed at least three times to ensure repeatability the weight of the superhydrophobic sponge was measured before and after sorption experiments to calculate the sorption capacity the equation used for the calculation of the oil sorption capacity is 3 oil sorption capacity weight of adsorbed oil g weight of sponge g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the soot the thermal characteristics of the soot were quantified with tga under both air and nitrogen atmospheres to determine the oxidation behavior and thermal stability respectively fig 4 as a function of temperature the thermogravimetric weight loss curve tg and the weight loss derivative curve dtg were recorded and compared during oxidation the soot sample exhibited a single broad mass loss within the temperature range of 460 700 c which is apparent on the dtg curve this single step oxidation reaction is similar to that of carbon black and graphite samples whereas typically two step oxidation was observed for diesel soot samples indicating the combustion of soluble and volatile organic fractions 31 after about 700 c the dtg curve reached an asymptotic value and the remaining mass was 3 1 of the initial sample mass at that temperature while it was 1 2 at 1000 c in other words complete oxidation of the carbonaceous soot was nearly accomplished at higher temperatures with a minor amount of residue the thermogram of the soot sample heated under nitrogen atmosphere is also displayed in fig 4 as seen the total mass loss was significantly low approximately 7 7 and no notable mass loss rate was observed in the dtg curve by comparison the mass losses for air and nitrogen atmosphere thermograms were recorded as 98 8 and 7 7 respectively considering the thermal stability of carbonaceous materials under inert atmosphere it could be admitted that the soot sample showed high stability against high temperatures which could be advantageous during its utilization for separation processes the particle size distribution of the soot sample by intensity volume and number percent is given in fig 5 according to rayleigh s approximation the intensity of scattering of a particle is proportional to the sixth power of its diameter 32 and hence dls is an effective tool to understand the particle size distribution the basic distribution obtained from dls is the intensity data and the others are generated from this the average particle size is recorded to be 835 nm and as can be seen from the number size distribution analysis the diameter of the particles is between 342 and 2000 nm with a major peak at approximately 531 nm repeated analyses showed consistent results among themselves which indicated soot particles retain their stability in size even after being subjected to sonification there are not any observed particle growth and agglomeration which increases the mean particle size to observe the surface morphology of the particles together with chemical analysis sem edx spectra of the produced soot were captured fig 6 irregularly shaped compact aggregates with a structure including almost spherical soot particles are obviously seen in the micrographs furthermore the irregular edges of the soot may indicate defects in the carbonaceous network arising from the presence of sp3 carbon 33 the particles with a heterogeneous surface may enhance the oil removal process by creating sites to adhere to the surface from sem edx analysis the carbon content of the soot is reported as 92 wt in addition minor amounts of oxygen and nitrogen are situated in the structure but pure carbon without any contamination is present during synthesis to characterize the porous structure of the soot n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained in the range of 0 001 and 0 9961 p po as given in fig 7 a brunauer emmett teller bet surface area 34 of the soot was quantitatively determined via selected points of the adsorption isotherm while pore size distribution was estimated with barrett joyner halenda bjh method 35 the obtained isotherm exhibited a shape that is characterized by a mesoporous structure the hysteresis loop non overlapping branches of adsorption and desorption branches of isotherm in fig 7 a indicate a mesoporous character of the synthesized soot 36 37 at the same time a progressive increase in volume adsorbed in the entire range of p po is an indicator of a mesoporous nature of the carbon 38 the isotherm has a hysteresis loop and its exact shape varies from one adsorption system to another due to capillary condensation according to the results the total nitrogen adsorbed was 910 1 cm3 g 1 while bet surface area was calculated to be 175 7 m2 g 1 accordingly the total pore volume was estimated to be 1 411 cm3 g 1 at p po 0 9961 fig 7 b shows the pore size distribution of the soot sample representing that the diameter of the majority of the pores lies in the range of 6 320 ǻ with a peak value of about 10 ǻ in addition to the n2 adsorption desorption analysis the real density of the soot was determined as 1 7783 0 0005 g cm 3 using the he pycnometer the functional group analysis of the soot sample was performed with an ft ir spectrometer and the spectrum is given in fig 8 a weak peaks of symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations attributed to the presence of ch2 and ch3 groups are observed for the sample between 2950 and 2860 cm 1 the band between 1566 and 1650 cm 1 is assigned to the presence of cc stretching vibrations arising from the alkene structure the characteristic strong peaks for co stretching vibrations appear between 1275 and 1200 cm 1 and 1075 1020 cm 1 revealing the fact that during the formation of soot minor amounts of oxygenated compounds also formed 39 moreover the plain spectrum showed that the soot sample does not contain overly complicated functional groups and the material is composed of amorphous carbon having sp2 and sp3 configurations as a result of the raman spectroscopy study of the sample fig 8 b the two characteristic bands g and d bands for amorphous carbon are observed the spectrum exhibits a strong peak g band with a maximum intensity at around 1570 cm 1 that can be assigned to the ideal graphitic lattice vibrations the second broadband d band which is noticed at around 1350 cm 1 is due to the disordered graphitic lattice the d peak is associated with defects in the sample structure whereas the g band refers to tangential cc valence oscillations the g band is sensitive to stress in the sample structure the third significant broadband in the range of about 2500 cm 1 to 3250 cm 1 is observed from the spectrum which can be attributed to the overlapping of second order bands resulting from the graphitic lattice vibration modes 40 the graphitic character of the soot sample was further investigated via xrd and pdxl software was used for the analysis of the profile fig 8 c the two main bragg diffraction peaks are observed the xrd peak around 2θ 26 23 indexed as c 002 represents the amorphous structure of carbon materials and the second peak around 2θ 42 21 indexed as 100 plane is an indication of the low crystalline structure icdd card 1200017 the interlayer spacing d002 equal to 0 3611 nm which is in the typical ranges 0 3591 0 3679 nm of soot samples prepared from different gases under different conditions was calculated using eq 2 41 43 the interlaying spacing of the soot sample is larger than the non graphitized crystal interlaying spacing and thus the graphitization degree is calculated to be 198 8 it is obvious that the amorphous structured soot sample showed a significantly low degree of graphitization 3 2 characteristics of soot coated hydrophobic sponge raw melamine sponge was used as the substrate material for soot particles foam like structured hydrophilic melamine sponge was coated with carbon soot to achieve a hydrophobic surface for its further utilization in oil water separation processes the attachment and well distribution of soot particles on the surface is an important phenomenon and can be carried out simply via the dip and dry method during the interaction of sponge and soot particles the three dimensional 3d structure of pristine melamine sponge with its interconnected network and high porosity of over 99 ensured the proper distribution of soot and prevented the agglomeration of the particles 25 44 it is evident from the photograph of the sponge that the melamine sponge initially white was completely covered with soot the final color is black after a successive dip and dry process fig 9 the surface morphology of the raw and soot coated sponge samples was carried out by sem and the images are also presented in fig 9 as described in previous papers 20 45 sem micrographs demonstrate the three dimensional hierarchical porous structure of the sponge the micrograph of the sorbent shows the available adsorption sites which may be accessible by the sorbate molecules 46 soot is strongly attached to the skeleton of the melamine sponge due to the van der waals interactions between the soot and the sponge the nanoscale porous surface and the hierarchical porous structure contribute to the hydrophobicity of the superhydrophobic sponge and thus provide high efficiency in adsorbing oil it is well known that sorbents need to have the ability to hold the sorbate oils in their voids once they are sucked up to maintain a better oil water separation therefore a hydrophobic preferably superhydrophobic and oleophilic surface is required to enhance the capacity and recyclability of the sorbent 47 compared with the raw sponge the sem image shows the soot coated sponge retained the microporous structured 3d framework although a noticeable thickening was observed in the framework struts after the soot coating a uniform distribution of soot was clearly monitored since there was no agglomeration on the edges or the struts the image obtained at higher magnifications also revealed the fact that soot nanoparticles were successfully attached to the framework struts the hydrophobicity of the surface of soot coated sponge was evaluated using the contact angle test results the water contact angle of the sponge surface was 145 150 indicating superior hydrophobicity fig 9 this is due to the high hydrophobicity of the soot prepared from the propane butane mixture on the other hand the raw melamine sponge was completely hydrophilic as given in fig 3 it adsorbed water in its pores and sank to the bottom immediately similar work was reported by gao et al 20 where the soot was prepared from ethylene combustion and the water contact angle of the soot coated sponge was determined between 140 and 145 3 3 oil adsorption performance of hydrophobic sponge the utilization of soot coated sponges in the adsorption processes was investigated through their oil adsorption performance for this purpose the raw melamine sponge after being washed with acetone and dried was used to remove oil residues from the water surface it was observed that the pure melamine sponge adsorbs oil since the sponge showed hydrophilic properties it simultaneously adsorbed water and was immersed in it not completely adsorbing the oil from the surface on the other hand as shown by the melamine sponge coated with soot in fig 3 the high contact angle hydrophobic character and low density made it float easily on the water surface and completely adsorbed oil residue from the surface the mass of oil adsorbed by the sponge was found by the difference between the mass of the sponge after and before sorption once the sponge has been placed over the surface of the oil water the floating sponge adsorbed the oil rapidly and completely during the experiments soot coated melamine sponge with a total surface area of 16 cm2 a volume of 4 cm3 and a mass of 0 086 g was used to adsorb about 2 08 0 50 g of petroleum oil which corresponds to an average adsorption capacity of 23 40 g g 1 as shown in fig 10 the adsorption capacity of the soot coated melamine sponge was found to be close to that of carbonized asphalt melamine sponge which was used for the removal of several oil types such as diesel 33 g g 1 soybean oil 37 g g 1 and pumping oil 41 g g 1 45 another carbon coated melamine sponge modified with silk fibroin graphene oxide also exhibited a sorption capacity of 55 g g 1 for the separation of silicon oil from water 48 moreover sorption capacities of 17 43 g g 1 were reported for carbon based magnetic superhydrophobic sponges for the adsorption of oils and organic solvents 49 as can be recognized compared to the previously reported oil adsorption capacities the soot coated melamine sponge showed an acceptable level of sorption capability the reusability of hydrophobic sponge materials is an important property for its utilization in the sorption processes 50 in this study the reusability of the soot coated sponge was tested by simply squeezing the sponge and drying it due to its high hydrophobicity and porous structure the prepared sponge allowed the oil to be squeezed out completely up to 19 times by cleaning the water surface fig 10 after 20 times of use the cleaning efficiency gradually decreased during the experiments this was also confirmed by the fact that an oily layer of yellow color remained on the surface of the water the rectangular prism shaped melamine sponge did not lose its shape during the absorption desorption cycles up to 5 times although the sponge lost its original shape after the 5th trial there was no decrease in its sorption ability and it cleaned the water surface properly when the sorption cycles are compared to that of other sponge samples reported in the literature it is seen that the soot coated hydrophobic sponge achieved a high repeated usage 50 51 in addition the average oil removal speed of the soot coated melamine sponge was determined to be 1 14 0 1 s as an average value of 25 adsorption cycles during the adsorption of petroleum oil on the soot coated melamine sponge multiple adsorption mechanisms may act together 52 since the sizes of the superhydrophobic carbonaceous soot are so small which creates a porous structure a probable combined mechanism of adsorption may be included these mechanisms are hydrophobic interaction capillary effect into interparticle intraparticle soot particles together with physical non covalent interactions such as van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding the presence of a hydrophobic structure with sp2 hybridized carbon may also present the possibility of π π bonding with the aromatic rings 53 of petroleum oil some fluctuations between the cycles may be attributed to the interlace effect in which the sponge acts as a network getting around the drops of petroleum oil and trapping them moreover accessible sorption sites may be blocked between cycles may cause a slight decline in the sorptive capacity of the sponge to test the acid and alkali resistance of the produced sponge hcl and naoh treated samples were subjected to various mechanical deformations including compressing bending and twisting as can be seen from fig 11 the sponges retained their original forms without any visible plastic deformation suggesting their good elasticity and recyclability furthermore the soot coated sponges captured dynamic water droplet shedding and retained their spherical shape after acid and alkali treatment the resultant soot coated sponge was also reasonable enough in acid and alkaline environments attributing to its stable carbonaceous networks the soot coated sponge had outstanding mechanical and hydrophobic stability in acidic and basic conditions which are crucial for feasible oil water separation applications that may include ph variations during the operation therefore it may hold a promising application for long term oil separation processes unless it is not subjected to higher loadings on the other hand mechanical test results showed that acidic and basic conditions behaved differently the tensile strength and elongation at break values were calculated for pristine melamine sponge as 0 04 mpa and 43 9 respectively while soot coated sponge yielded tensile strength of 0 07 mpa and elongation of 45 4 the results showed that the mechanical strength of the soot coated sponge was slightly higher than that of the melamine sponge when the product had been subjected to the acidic treatment its tensile strength decreased remarkably to 0 01 mpa and elongation at break was calculated as 38 8 on the other hand the tensile strength of the alkali treated soot coated sponge was found nearly the same compared to the product without any chemical treatment while the elongation value had increased up to 60 as a result the alkaline treated and coated sponge had shown the highest elongation among the pristine soot coated and acid treated melamine sponges the ph of the water or any pretreatment applied to the sponge prior to its usage affects the lifetime of the sorbent material which can be settled by a sensitive adjustment of the operating conditions of the sorption and hence the efficiency of the sorption process and as well as the stability of the sorbent material can be preserved even under mild changes in the process conditions the relevant studies on the oil removal processes by adsorption and their main findings are summarized in table 1 the researchers have focused on finding an effective sorbent with high oil sorption and low water uptake some studies investigated natural materials such as biomass and its modified forms while others aimed to synthesize sorbents using inorganic channeled structures such as zeolites as can be understood from the table the produced sponge is perceived to be attractive for the removal of petroleum oil spills among the sorbents identified in the literature for water treatment undoubtedly the reusability of a sorbent is one of the critical parameters in determining its effectiveness for wastewater treatment 54 as it can be seen the sorptive structure of the sponge obtained in this work is compatible with the sorbents that were produced with different precursors and production methods most importantly the reusability is found to be the highest among the studies including the removal of petroleum oil and its derivatives from water 4 conclusions this current study shows the effect of soot coating on a melamine sponge pointing to a useful technique for the production of highly effective materials for practical oil contaminant cleanup via adsorption processes the soot with a hydrophobic character was synthesized from a propane butane gas mixture and then a melamine sponge was coated with soot using the facile dip and dry method in this respect simple and cost effective procedures were used to prepare selective sorbent for petroleum oil the adsorption desorption cycles demonstrated that the sponge is highly efficient and stable the selectivity of soot coated melamine sponge towards oil was found to be excellent with a capacity of up to 24 times its weight along with recyclability of 19 times based on the characteristics soot coated sponges could be recycled and reused many times with considerable capacity retention towards petroleum oil moreover the sorption sites of the carbon material coated sponge were not destroyed by the acid and alkali environment and hydrophobicity retention with acceptable minor changes in the mechanical properties tensile strength of the sponge was maintained after these corrosive procedures as a result this material emerges as a promising high quality sorbent for the separation of petroleum oil from water and it can be advantageous in wastewater recovery in the industry an in depth assessment of factors affecting adsorption with optimization studies offers the potential to boost the capacity of the as prepared sponge even further declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12874,superhydrophobic materials like carbon coated sponges have been attracting attention due to their wide applicability in several industries one of the main applications of such materials is the efficient removal of various water pollutants such as oil by adsorption herein a flexible porous and hydrophilic melamine sponge was coated by superhydrophobic soot that was produced by incomplete combustion of the propane butane mixture characterization of the soot and the sponge was performed via several methods such as spectroscopy microscopy and thermogravimetry the product was tested in the petroleum oil removal process the superhydrophobic sponge repelled water well and at the same time perfectly sorbed oil products the wetting edge angle of soot coated sponge was found between 145 and 150 the sponge showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 24 g oil g for the selective separation of oil from water the entrapped oil was released simply by squeezing the sponge for cyclic use and about 95 5 wt of the oil was adsorbed and the soot coated sponge still maintained this capacity after 19 cycles hence this novel soot coated hydrophobic sponge is considered a promising candidate for oil polluted water treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords soot hydrophobicity hydrophobic sponge adsorption oil water separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water on earth is one of the most abundant natural resources but only about 1 of that resource is available for human consumption it is known that over 1 1 billion people lack a supply of adequate high quality water due to the growing population and a variety of climatic and environmental effects 1 3 the majority of the pollutants in drinking water are arising from industrial agricultural and mining activities that lead to an increase in toxic materials contamination 4 in addition to these inorganic contaminants organic pollutants from volatile organic compounds synthetic organic compounds oil spills and waste disposal are the main reasons for water pollution which have reprotoxic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects 5 especially spillage of petroleum hydrocarbons during exploration production transportation storage and utilization of oil causes serious environmental pollution 6 7 oil spills are known among the most extensive and environmentally damaging pollution problems 8 when petroleum oil is emulsified in water problems generate ecological changes and negative impacts on aquatic life such as threatening the lives of fauna and the food chain due to the destruction of arable farmlands and fishing areas the greatest concern of such spills is the long term effects of both acute and chronic contaminations that can cause diseases for decades or more 9 therefore significant research has been devoted to remedial technologies for oil water separation across the globe 10 currently several treatment processes for oil water separation have been investigated such as chemical methods dispersion solidification in situ burning bioremediation and mechanical recovery 11 however most of these methods are considered non viable due to their cost creation of secondary pollution having low selectivity and efficiency towards petroleum contaminants 3 11 the oil water separation process by physical sorption has always been the subject of active research since it is one of the most effective and inexpensive methods that offer good recyclability of the adsorbents various sorbent materials are aimed at removing and remediating oil spills which may be in the form of powders foams and fabrics 12 but some challenges remain in the adsorption technology such as improving expertise in developing selective sorbents and reducing the manufacturing cost using low cost precursors the important point is the production of adsorbents with superior capacity and selectivity which means they are capable of primary removal of petroleum oil rather than water moreover reusability and regeneration characteristics are the other factors that should be considered in the selection of sorbent materials there has been an increasing amount of research on the fabrication of oil adsorbing materials aiming at the separation of oils from water 11 at this point tailoring materials with specific wettability using the basics of chemistry and nanotechnology for oil water separation is essential to developing feasible water remediation processes 13 in the literature some natural sorbents have shown promising results making them potential candidates for oil adsorption from the aqueous medium on the other hand synthetic sorbents such as waste material or a side product of industrial processing have promising results 14 especially carbon based adsorbents have been considered to be the best candidates in the field of oil spill cleanup as they possess high surface area low density good chemical stability and large pore volume some carbon materials including carbon aerogels graphene or carbon nanotube coated sponges graphene foams or sponges activated carbon porous carbon nanoparticles and activated carbon fibers have already been successfully applied for adsorption based separation and purification processes 15 17 this is due to the existence of several physiochemical mechanisms forces such as van der waals hydrogen bonding dipole dipole interactions ion exchange covalent bonding and cation bridging and water bridging during the adsorption on the carbons 18 furthermore carbons with different morphology and functionality may be obtained by adjusting precursor production method and conditions together with post treatments such as modification 19 in this study special attention was paid to the use of carbonaceous soot to prepare a superhydrophobic material for the oil spill clean up process soot can be simply defined as a carbon material that is generated from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons it is well known that soot has remarkable advantages in the cost effectiveness and production scalability over other carbon materials like graphene carbon nanotube and activated carbons in their synthesis moreover when soot is examined in sorption processes it shows good adsorption capacity towards several pollutants and has good recyclability due to its chemical stability 20 21 in addition it can be easily modified to have magnetic properties to achieve better separation characteristics 22 24 a broad literature survey pointed out the applicability of the soot in such kinds of adsorption studies but to our knowledge there are no studies that formally test the ability of sponges in cyclic petroleum oil adsorption which incorporates soot of propane butane combustion flame into the melamine matrix the oil removal application of straightforward and easily producible soot coated sponges with a high capacity and reusability is the essential feature of this study within the scope of this study superhydrophobic soot was produced from propane butane mixture to obtain a hydrophobic sponge by coating technique due to having high strength low cost and lightweight features together with good chemical and thermal resistance the melamine sponge was selected as a template highly porous melamine sponge over 99 porosity commercially known as magic eraser and its composites can be utilized as adsorbents for several water cleaning purposes the hydrophilic character of melamine sponge is its drawback for water applications and therefore the properties of melamine sponge are modified to achieve more suitable materials among the several modification techniques of melamine sponge coating its surface with a carbon material via a simple dip and dry method seems to be a promising one for oil water separation processes typically graphene oxide or reduced graphene oxide nanoparticles are preferred as the coating material to enhance the mechanical strength of the pristine sponge and to obtain a hydrophobic structure 25 27 the novelty of this study is that it is the first to explicitly examine the oil sorption behavior of soot coated melamine sponge by employing cyclic adsorption tests which are combined with propane butane based soot production overall a method to critically understand the contribution of soot deposition to the sponge for water treatment which can guide rationally fabricating high capacity and easily regenerative adsorbents in the future is provided 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials for the synthesis of soot propane and butane gas 85 15 vol vol mixture manufacturer ushkyn universal gas all season was used melamine sponge was purchased from york company republic of belarus all the reagents and chemicals used in the synthesis are of analytical grade for the adsorption of oil petroleum from the zhanaozen region of kazakhstan is used without any pretreatment 2 2 synthesis of the soot the synthesis of superhydrophobic soot was carried out in the flame of a propane butane mixture by applying an electric field fig 1 shows a diagram of the synthesis apparatus a special generator drives a steel drum with a diameter of 12 5 cm and a length of 13 5 cm the principle of operation of the installation is based on the deposition of soot particles from the flame on the surface of a rotating drum cylinder and its automatic collection into a soot collector using a built in scraper the structure and properties of soot particles depend on the temperature in the flame volume since the formation of a soot particle does not occur instantly but through a sequence of reactions its structure and properties will also depend on the collection of soot at a certain level of its growth the distance between the drum and the burner normally 2 0 cm is an important operating condition and increasing the distance over 3 0 cm leads to an increase in the amount of forming soot the optimal mode of formation of soot having a superhydrophobic property is obtained at a collection distance of 2 0 cm with a contact angle of 150 in this work the soot was synthesized in the 1 kv current field under the action of incomplete

mixture was pressed into pellets under 8 10 tons of pressure for 10 s the scan time and spectral resolution were 32 and 4 cm 1 respectively the raman characterization of carbon based samples was performed on a raman spectrometer ntegra spectra raman λ 473 nm the area signals with a diameter of 80 nm the x ray diffractogram xrd of soot was recorded using an x ray diffractometer miniflex 600 w rigaku with cu kα radiation 1 5436 å 40 kv 15 ma the diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10 90 with an increment of 2 min 1 the graphitization degree of the sample was calculated according to the following equation 28 30 1 graphitization degree 0 3440 d 002 0 3440 0 3354 100 where 0 3440 nm and 0 3354 nm are the interlayer spacing of fully non graphite crystals and the ideal graphite crystals respectively d002 is the interlaying spacing and can be calculated by bragg s law 28 29 2 d 002 nλ 2 sin θ where n is the order of the diffraction n 1 λ is the emission wavelength 0 15406 nm and θ is the peak position in radians for 002 peak 2 4 preparation and characterization of superhydrophobic sponge 25 mg of the soot was dispersed in a 20 ml solution of dichloroethane after which a 60 minute ultrasound treatment was performed then the melamine sponge which was cleaned with acetone and dried in an oven at 80 c was immersed in the soot dispersion the sponge covered with soot was dried again in the oven at a temperature of 80 c for 2 h after coating the melamine sponge with superhydrophobic soot its water flotation behavior was tested and compared with the as received melamine sponge as shown in fig 2 the coated melamine sponge with superhydrophobic soot seemed to float easily on the surface of the water which can be an indication of its applicability for the liquid phase selective adsorption processes the wetting contact angle was measured using a drop shape analyzer dsa25 krüss gmbh kruss device the accuracy of the device is 0 1 the experiments were carried out at 25 c under 931 mpa and at a humidity of 60 80 distilled water was used for all the experiments a 2 00 μl drop of water was dosed on the sample after 5 s of stabilization the wetting angle of the sample surface was measured the effect of acid and alkali conditions on the mechanical characteristics of the soot coated sponge was studied in detail the product was placed into 1 m hcl and naoh solutions for 3 h of exposure cyclic compressing bending and twisting behaviors were tested together with tensile strength measurements to investigate the acid and alkali resistance of the soot coated sponges the tensile strength of the sponges at ambient temperature was measured using an electronic tensile machine jinan hensgrand wdw 50e for the samples prepared in the same dimensions 2 cm 2 cm 1 cm the drawing speed was 5 mm min 1 and the clamping distance was 200 mm 2 5 oil water separation for the oil water separation experiments petroleum from the zhanaozen deposit of the west kazakhstan region was used to study the adsorption properties the oil water mixture was prepared as follows 35 ml of distilled water was poured into a petri dish and 3 0 ml of petroleum oil was added a sponge with dimensions of 2 cm 2 cm 1 cm was placed on the surface of the water oil mixture and the sponge was allowed to fully adsorb the oil fig 3 to confirm the hydrophobic characteristic of the coated sponge for the adsorption of oil in the aqueous phase the adsorption capacity was tested in batch experiments the time required for the sorption was noted to calculate the adsorption rate desorption was carried out by simple compression of the sponge and then to completely remove the oil sponge was washed in benzene the adsorption desorption experiments were repeated until reaching a point where the oil sorption capacity decreased all adsorption desorption experiments were performed at least three times to ensure repeatability the weight of the superhydrophobic sponge was measured before and after sorption experiments to calculate the sorption capacity the equation used for the calculation of the oil sorption capacity is 3 oil sorption capacity weight of adsorbed oil g weight of sponge g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the soot the thermal characteristics of the soot were quantified with tga under both air and nitrogen atmospheres to determine the oxidation behavior and thermal stability respectively fig 4 as a function of temperature the thermogravimetric weight loss curve tg and the weight loss derivative curve dtg were recorded and compared during oxidation the soot sample exhibited a single broad mass loss within the temperature range of 460 700 c which is apparent on the dtg curve this single step oxidation reaction is similar to that of carbon black and graphite samples whereas typically two step oxidation was observed for diesel soot samples indicating the combustion of soluble and volatile organic fractions 31 after about 700 c the dtg curve reached an asymptotic value and the remaining mass was 3 1 of the initial sample mass at that temperature while it was 1 2 at 1000 c in other words complete oxidation of the carbonaceous soot was nearly accomplished at higher temperatures with a minor amount of residue the thermogram of the soot sample heated under nitrogen atmosphere is also displayed in fig 4 as seen the total mass loss was significantly low approximately 7 7 and no notable mass loss rate was observed in the dtg curve by comparison the mass losses for air and nitrogen atmosphere thermograms were recorded as 98 8 and 7 7 respectively considering the thermal stability of carbonaceous materials under inert atmosphere it could be admitted that the soot sample showed high stability against high temperatures which could be advantageous during its utilization for separation processes the particle size distribution of the soot sample by intensity volume and number percent is given in fig 5 according to rayleigh s approximation the intensity of scattering of a particle is proportional to the sixth power of its diameter 32 and hence dls is an effective tool to understand the particle size distribution the basic distribution obtained from dls is the intensity data and the others are generated from this the average particle size is recorded to be 835 nm and as can be seen from the number size distribution analysis the diameter of the particles is between 342 and 2000 nm with a major peak at approximately 531 nm repeated analyses showed consistent results among themselves which indicated soot particles retain their stability in size even after being subjected to sonification there are not any observed particle growth and agglomeration which increases the mean particle size to observe the surface morphology of the particles together with chemical analysis sem edx spectra of the produced soot were captured fig 6 irregularly shaped compact aggregates with a structure including almost spherical soot particles are obviously seen in the micrographs furthermore the irregular edges of the soot may indicate defects in the carbonaceous network arising from the presence of sp3 carbon 33 the particles with a heterogeneous surface may enhance the oil removal process by creating sites to adhere to the surface from sem edx analysis the carbon content of the soot is reported as 92 wt in addition minor amounts of oxygen and nitrogen are situated in the structure but pure carbon without any contamination is present during synthesis to characterize the porous structure of the soot n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained in the range of 0 001 and 0 9961 p po as given in fig 7 a brunauer emmett teller bet surface area 34 of the soot was quantitatively determined via selected points of the adsorption isotherm while pore size distribution was estimated with barrett joyner halenda bjh method 35 the obtained isotherm exhibited a shape that is characterized by a mesoporous structure the hysteresis loop non overlapping branches of adsorption and desorption branches of isotherm in fig 7 a indicate a mesoporous character of the synthesized soot 36 37 at the same time a progressive increase in volume adsorbed in the entire range of p po is an indicator of a mesoporous nature of the carbon 38 the isotherm has a hysteresis loop and its exact shape varies from one adsorption system to another due to capillary condensation according to the results the total nitrogen adsorbed was 910 1 cm3 g 1 while bet surface area was calculated to be 175 7 m2 g 1 accordingly the total pore volume was estimated to be 1 411 cm3 g 1 at p po 0 9961 fig 7 b shows the pore size distribution of the soot sample representing that the diameter of the majority of the pores lies in the range of 6 320 ǻ with a peak value of about 10 ǻ in addition to the n2 adsorption desorption analysis the real density of the soot was determined as 1 7783 0 0005 g cm 3 using the he pycnometer the functional group analysis of the soot sample was performed with an ft ir spectrometer and the spectrum is given in fig 8 a weak peaks of symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations attributed to the presence of ch2 and ch3 groups are observed for the sample between 2950 and 2860 cm 1 the band between 1566 and 1650 cm 1 is assigned to the presence of cc stretching vibrations arising from the alkene structure the characteristic strong peaks for co stretching vibrations appear between 1275 and 1200 cm 1 and 1075 1020 cm 1 revealing the fact that during the formation of soot minor amounts of oxygenated compounds also formed 39 moreover the plain spectrum showed that the soot sample does not contain overly complicated functional groups and the material is composed of amorphous carbon having sp2 and sp3 configurations as a result of the raman spectroscopy study of the sample fig 8 b the two characteristic bands g and d bands for amorphous carbon are observed the spectrum exhibits a strong peak g band with a maximum intensity at around 1570 cm 1 that can be assigned to the ideal graphitic lattice vibrations the second broadband d band which is noticed at around 1350 cm 1 is due to the disordered graphitic lattice the d peak is associated with defects in the sample structure whereas the g band refers to tangential cc valence oscillations the g band is sensitive to stress in the sample structure the third significant broadband in the range of about 2500 cm 1 to 3250 cm 1 is observed from the spectrum which can be attributed to the overlapping of second order bands resulting from the graphitic lattice vibration modes 40 the graphitic character of the soot sample was further investigated via xrd and pdxl software was used for the analysis of the profile fig 8 c the two main bragg diffraction peaks are observed the xrd peak around 2θ 26 23 indexed as c 002 represents the amorphous structure of carbon materials and the second peak around 2θ 42 21 indexed as 100 plane is an indication of the low crystalline structure icdd card 1200017 the interlayer spacing d002 equal to 0 3611 nm which is in the typical ranges 0 3591 0 3679 nm of soot samples prepared from different gases under different conditions was calculated using eq 2 41 43 the interlaying spacing of the soot sample is larger than the non graphitized crystal interlaying spacing and thus the graphitization degree is calculated to be 198 8 it is obvious that the amorphous structured soot sample showed a significantly low degree of graphitization 3 2 characteristics of soot coated hydrophobic sponge raw melamine sponge was used as the substrate material for soot particles foam like structured hydrophilic melamine sponge was coated with carbon soot to achieve a hydrophobic surface for its further utilization in oil water separation processes the attachment and well distribution of soot particles on the surface is an important phenomenon and can be carried out simply via the dip and dry method during the interaction of sponge and soot particles the three dimensional 3d structure of pristine melamine sponge with its interconnected network and high porosity of over 99 ensured the proper distribution of soot and prevented the agglomeration of the particles 25 44 it is evident from the photograph of the sponge that the melamine sponge initially white was completely covered with soot the final color is black after a successive dip and dry process fig 9 the surface morphology of the raw and soot coated sponge samples was carried out by sem and the images are also presented in fig 9 as described in previous papers 20 45 sem micrographs demonstrate the three dimensional hierarchical porous structure of the sponge the micrograph of the sorbent shows the available adsorption sites which may be accessible by the sorbate molecules 46 soot is strongly attached to the skeleton of the melamine sponge due to the van der waals interactions between the soot and the sponge the nanoscale porous surface and the hierarchical porous structure contribute to the hydrophobicity of the superhydrophobic sponge and thus provide high efficiency in adsorbing oil it is well known that sorbents need to have the ability to hold the sorbate oils in their voids once they are sucked up to maintain a better oil water separation therefore a hydrophobic preferably superhydrophobic and oleophilic surface is required to enhance the capacity and recyclability of the sorbent 47 compared with the raw sponge the sem image shows the soot coated sponge retained the microporous structured 3d framework although a noticeable thickening was observed in the framework struts after the soot coating a uniform distribution of soot was clearly monitored since there was no agglomeration on the edges or the struts the image obtained at higher magnifications also revealed the fact that soot nanoparticles were successfully attached to the framework struts the hydrophobicity of the surface of soot coated sponge was evaluated using the contact angle test results the water contact angle of the sponge surface was 145 150 indicating superior hydrophobicity fig 9 this is due to the high hydrophobicity of the soot prepared from the propane butane mixture on the other hand the raw melamine sponge was completely hydrophilic as given in fig 3 it adsorbed water in its pores and sank to the bottom immediately similar work was reported by gao et al 20 where the soot was prepared from ethylene combustion and the water contact angle of the soot coated sponge was determined between 140 and 145 3 3 oil adsorption performance of hydrophobic sponge the utilization of soot coated sponges in the adsorption processes was investigated through their oil adsorption performance for this purpose the raw melamine sponge after being washed with acetone and dried was used to remove oil residues from the water surface it was observed that the pure melamine sponge adsorbs oil since the sponge showed hydrophilic properties it simultaneously adsorbed water and was immersed in it not completely adsorbing the oil from the surface on the other hand as shown by the melamine sponge coated with soot in fig 3 the high contact angle hydrophobic character and low density made it float easily on the water surface and completely adsorbed oil residue from the surface the mass of oil adsorbed by the sponge was found by the difference between the mass of the sponge after and before sorption once the sponge has been placed over the surface of the oil water the floating sponge adsorbed the oil rapidly and completely during the experiments soot coated melamine sponge with a total surface area of 16 cm2 a volume of 4 cm3 and a mass of 0 086 g was used to adsorb about 2 08 0 50 g of petroleum oil which corresponds to an average adsorption capacity of 23 40 g g 1 as shown in fig 10 the adsorption capacity of the soot coated melamine sponge was found to be close to that of carbonized asphalt melamine sponge which was used for the removal of several oil types such as diesel 33 g g 1 soybean oil 37 g g 1 and pumping oil 41 g g 1 45 another carbon coated melamine sponge modified with silk fibroin graphene oxide also exhibited a sorption capacity of 55 g g 1 for the separation of silicon oil from water 48 moreover sorption capacities of 17 43 g g 1 were reported for carbon based magnetic superhydrophobic sponges for the adsorption of oils and organic solvents 49 as can be recognized compared to the previously reported oil adsorption capacities the soot coated melamine sponge showed an acceptable level of sorption capability the reusability of hydrophobic sponge materials is an important property for its utilization in the sorption processes 50 in this study the reusability of the soot coated sponge was tested by simply squeezing the sponge and drying it due to its high hydrophobicity and porous structure the prepared sponge allowed the oil to be squeezed out completely up to 19 times by cleaning the water surface fig 10 after 20 times of use the cleaning efficiency gradually decreased during the experiments this was also confirmed by the fact that an oily layer of yellow color remained on the surface of the water the rectangular prism shaped melamine sponge did not lose its shape during the absorption desorption cycles up to 5 times although the sponge lost its original shape after the 5th trial there was no decrease in its sorption ability and it cleaned the water surface properly when the sorption cycles are compared to that of other sponge samples reported in the literature it is seen that the soot coated hydrophobic sponge achieved a high repeated usage 50 51 in addition the average oil removal speed of the soot coated melamine sponge was determined to be 1 14 0 1 s as an average value of 25 adsorption cycles during the adsorption of petroleum oil on the soot coated melamine sponge multiple adsorption mechanisms may act together 52 since the sizes of the superhydrophobic carbonaceous soot are so small which creates a porous structure a probable combined mechanism of adsorption may be included these mechanisms are hydrophobic interaction capillary effect into interparticle intraparticle soot particles together with physical non covalent interactions such as van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding the presence of a hydrophobic structure with sp2 hybridized carbon may also present the possibility of π π bonding with the aromatic rings 53 of petroleum oil some fluctuations between the cycles may be attributed to the interlace effect in which the sponge acts as a network getting around the drops of petroleum oil and trapping them moreover accessible sorption sites may be blocked between cycles may cause a slight decline in the sorptive capacity of the sponge to test the acid and alkali resistance of the produced sponge hcl and naoh treated samples were subjected to various mechanical deformations including compressing bending and twisting as can be seen from fig 11 the sponges retained their original forms without any visible plastic deformation suggesting their good elasticity and recyclability furthermore the soot coated sponges captured dynamic water droplet shedding and retained their spherical shape after acid and alkali treatment the resultant soot coated sponge was also reasonable enough in acid and alkaline environments attributing to its stable carbonaceous networks the soot coated sponge had outstanding mechanical and hydrophobic stability in acidic and basic conditions which are crucial for feasible oil water separation applications that may include ph variations during the operation therefore it may hold a promising application for long term oil separation processes unless it is not subjected to higher loadings on the other hand mechanical test results showed that acidic and basic conditions behaved differently the tensile strength and elongation at break values were calculated for pristine melamine sponge as 0 04 mpa and 43 9 respectively while soot coated sponge yielded tensile strength of 0 07 mpa and elongation of 45 4 the results showed that the mechanical strength of the soot coated sponge was slightly higher than that of the melamine sponge when the product had been subjected to the acidic treatment its tensile strength decreased remarkably to 0 01 mpa and elongation at break was calculated as 38 8 on the other hand the tensile strength of the alkali treated soot coated sponge was found nearly the same compared to the product without any chemical treatment while the elongation value had increased up to 60 as a result the alkaline treated and coated sponge had shown the highest elongation among the pristine soot coated and acid treated melamine sponges the ph of the water or any pretreatment applied to the sponge prior to its usage affects the lifetime of the sorbent material which can be settled by a sensitive adjustment of the operating conditions of the sorption and hence the efficiency of the sorption process and as well as the stability of the sorbent material can be preserved even under mild changes in the process conditions the relevant studies on the oil removal processes by adsorption and their main findings are summarized in table 1 the researchers have focused on finding an effective sorbent with high oil sorption and low water uptake some studies investigated natural materials such as biomass and its modified forms while others aimed to synthesize sorbents using inorganic channeled structures such as zeolites as can be understood from the table the produced sponge is perceived to be attractive for the removal of petroleum oil spills among the sorbents identified in the literature for water treatment undoubtedly the reusability of a sorbent is one of the critical parameters in determining its effectiveness for wastewater treatment 54 as it can be seen the sorptive structure of the sponge obtained in this work is compatible with the sorbents that were produced with different precursors and production methods most importantly the reusability is found to be the highest among the studies including the removal of petroleum oil and its derivatives from water 4 conclusions this current study shows the effect of soot coating on a melamine sponge pointing to a useful technique for the production of highly effective materials for practical oil contaminant cleanup via adsorption processes the soot with a hydrophobic character was synthesized from a propane butane gas mixture and then a melamine sponge was coated with soot using the facile dip and dry method in this respect simple and cost effective procedures were used to prepare selective sorbent for petroleum oil the adsorption desorption cycles demonstrated that the sponge is highly efficient and stable the selectivity of soot coated melamine sponge towards oil was found to be excellent with a capacity of up to 24 times its weight along with recyclability of 19 times based on the characteristics soot coated sponges could be recycled and reused many times with considerable capacity retention towards petroleum oil moreover the sorption sites of the carbon material coated sponge were not destroyed by the acid and alkali environment and hydrophobicity retention with acceptable minor changes in the mechanical properties tensile strength of the sponge was maintained after these corrosive procedures as a result this material emerges as a promising high quality sorbent for the separation of petroleum oil from water and it can be advantageous in wastewater recovery in the industry an in depth assessment of factors affecting adsorption with optimization studies offers the potential to boost the capacity of the as prepared sponge even further declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
