14840,there is growing global concern that greenhouse gas ghg emissions from water bodies are increasing because of interactions between nutrient levels and climate warming this paper investigates key land cover seasonal and hydrological controls of ghgs by comparison of the semi natural agricultural and urban environments in a detailed source to sea study of the river clyde scotland riverine ghg concentrations were consistently oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere high riverine concentrations of methane ch4 were primarily associated with point source inflows from urban wastewater treatment abandoned coal mines and lakes with ch4 c concentrations between 0 1 44 µg l 1 concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 and nitrous oxide n2o were mainly driven by nitrogen concentrations dominated by diffuse agricultural inputs in the upper catchment and supplemented by point source inputs from urban wastewater in the lower urban catchment with co2 c concentrations between 0 1 2 6 mg l 1 and n2o n concentrations between 0 3 3 4 µg l 1 a significant and disproportionate increase in all ghgs occurred in the lower urban riverine environment in the summer compared to the semi natural environment where ghg concentrations were higher in winter this increase and change in ghg seasonal patterns points to anthropogenic impacts on microbial communities the loss of total dissolved carbon to the estuary is approximately 48 4 3 6 gg c yr 1 with the annual inorganic carbon export approximately double that of organic carbon and four times that of co2 with ch4 accounting for 0 03 with the anthropogenic impact of disused coal mines accelerating dic loss the annual loss of total dissolved nitrogen to the estuary is approximately 4 03 0 38 gg n yr 1 of which n2o represents 0 06 this study improves our understanding of riverine ghg generation and dynamics which can contribute to our knowledge of their release to the atmosphere it identifies where action could support reductions in aquatic ghg generation and emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane nitrous oxide carbon dioxide urban wastewater agriculture mine water data availability the data used for this manuscript has been published by the environmental information data centre at https eidc ac uk brown et al 2023 1 introductions greenhouse gas ghg evasion from inland waters is a significant source of atmospheric ghgs global carbon dioxide co2 evasion has been estimated as 1 8 0 25 pg c yr 1 from streams and rivers resulting in a global evasion rate from inland waters of 2 1 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 the contribution from streams and rivers is large relative to their surface area acting as hotspots for the exchange of gases with the atmosphere the major sources of co2 are direct input via groundwater inflow which transports co2 originating from soil respiration and in stream mineralization of organic carbon oc often from surface run off winterdahl et al 2016 riparian wetlands also contribute disproportionately to co2 emissions abril and borges 2019 the relative importance of these mechanisms changes with stream order as headwater streams have a larger soil water interface compared to lower reaches resulting in the proportion of co2 produced from aquatic metabolism increasing with stream size marx et al 2017 hotchkiss et al 2015 the magnitude of co2 riverine emissions is highly dependant on hydrology gómez gener et al 2016 in urban areas significantly higher nutrients organic matter content and riverine cyanobacteria impact co2 variation salgado et al 2022 global methane ch4 evasion from inland waters was estimated at 398 1 79 4 tg ch4 yr 1 with rivers evading 30 5 17 1 tg ch4 yr 1 with aquatic ecosystems contributing about half of total global ch4 emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources rosentreter et al 2021 total ch4 emissions were found to increase from natural to impacted and from coastal to freshwater ecosystems with emissions expected to increase due to urbanization eutrophication and positive climate feedbacks although there is significant uncertainty in the production transportation and consumption processes rosentreter et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 similarly the production and emission of nitrous oxide n2o from aquatic systems are uncertain 0 3 2 1 tg n2o n yr 1 with large spatial and temporal variability in emission estimates seitzinger and kroeze 1998 beaulieu et al 2011 ciais et al 2013 however n2o emissions from rivers reservoirs and estuaries have been estimated as 148 277 gg n yr 1 with anthropogenic perturbations to river systems resulting in a two to four fold increase in n2o emissions from inland waters maavara et al 2019 the dominance of n2o emissions emanating from nitrification or denitrification in inland waters is partly dependant on residence time zarnetske et al 2011 urban rivers and lakes are potential hotspots for ghg emissions and there is an increasing body of literature concerned with quantifying their contribution to aquatic ghg emissions zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 gu et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 martinez cruz et al 2017 and garnier et al 2009 in mexico city water quality indicators such as trophic state index and phosphorous level were positively correlated with ch4 emissions suggesting a reduction in untreated wastewater discharge could concurrently reduce ghg emissions fluxes of ch4 were highly variable both in and across ecosystem locations and seasons martinez cruz et al 2017 demonstrating the need for comprehensive studies to understand these temporal dynamics in water bodies around the city of berlin a combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth produced large ch4 emissions however dissolved oxygen and productivity were found to be poor predictors of ch4 emissions suggesting a complex combination of factors governed ch4 fluxes from urban surface waters herrero ortega et al 2019 conversely in rivers and lakes within the city of beijing high ch4 emissions were attributed to high dissolved and sediment organic carbon high aquatic primary production and shallow water depths although results were again highly variable wang et al 2021 in the chaohu lake basin in eastern china diffusive ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers were due to large nutrient supply and hypoxic environments with co2 impacted by temperature dependant rapid decomposition of organic matter zhang et al 2021 positive correlations between temperature and ghg concentrations have been routinely observed wang et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 and rosentreter et al 2021 the presence of ammonia entering inland water from agriculture or wastewater can inhibit ch4 oxidation resulting in elevated ch4 concentrations compared to low nitrogen systems and high evasion to atmosphere dunfield and knowles 1995 bosse et al 1993 cotovicz et al 2021 conversely in an investigation of n2o concentrations upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in an urban river in japan lower n2o concentrations were found in summer y zhou et al 2022 positive correlations between ghgs in surface waters and catchment agricultural landcover linked to higher levels of organic matter and dissolved inorganic nitrogen from the agricultural dominated areas have been found significant with increases in ghg levels during prolonged low water levels borges et al 2018 ghg emissions are difficult to attribute to sources due to multiple generation and consumption pathways and high spatial and temporal variability rosentreter et al 2021 their production results from the interplay of multiple drivers and is influenced by high between and within system variation with the causes of this variation unknown this variation causes difficulties in upscaling emissions from local scale studies resulting in a need for more detailed studies measuring more in water parameters across a large temporal and spatial scales it is hypothesised in this paper the reasons for the high variation and poor predictably include 1 ghgs are not conserved like dissolved nutrients but readily out gas especially in the riverine environment with flow intensity and high stream slopes the primary controls long et al 2015 maurice et al 2017 natchimuthu et al 2017 liu and raymond 2018 2 the number of different source types within the riverine environment including point diffuse and in water generation change with land use and need to be distinguished 3 the concentration of nutrients is only one aspect of ghg generation which changes with availability of electron donors and acceptors such that mixing of waters may stimulate ghg production wrage et al 2001 furukawa et al 2004 broder et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 4 different ghg sources and dynamics dominate in different types and sizes of water body dependant on land water interface depth hydraulic regime sediments water air interfaces residence time land use physio chemical properties microbial communities seasonality and anthropogenic impacts on seasonal patterns of changing water level and temperature the concentrations of ghgs in the riverine water column result from the balance between input consumption production and output fig 1 given the potential significance but inadequate quantification and characterisation of urban catchment fluvial ghg dynamics further insight into how to quantify and interpret riverine ghg concentration data could support improved estimates this study addressed the following key objectives 1 does using a source to sea investigative approach allows quantification of how changes in the nature and size of the riverine environment impact ghg concentrations 2 can the key controls on ghg generation be determined by comparison of the semi natural agricultural and urban environments including key land cover seasonal and hydrological controls and 3 can point source diffuse source and in water generation be distinguish for different ghgs a large temperate catchment was selected for the investigation where landcover transitioned from semi natural through pastoral and arable agricultural to urban including legacy industrial as representative of many urbanised catchments globally 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the river clyde is the third longest river in scotland 170 km with a total river network length of 4244 km and drains a of 1903 km2 clyde river foundation 2020 the river clyde together with the rivers kelvin white cart black cart and leven enter the clyde estuary with a catchment area of 3854 km2 nedwell et al 2002 which is home to 33 8 1 79 million of scotland s total population clyde river foundation 2020 surface water quality as assessed in accordance with the european water framework directive sepa 2018 and natural scotland 2015 ranges from high in some small tributaries to bad in some urban tributaries with much of the river clyde rated as moderate the groundwater quality is also rated as poor both in the upper catchment in the leadhills area and the lower urban catchment the river clyde s mean annual flows is 48 3 m3 s 1 with the maximum flow of 560 5 m3s 1 24th january 2018 as measured at daldowie gauging station supplementary data table a1 1 based on data between 1963 and 2019 uk centre of ecology hydrology ukceh 2020 the upper moorland catchment consists of steep rough ground with hill pasture and some forestry as the major land use in the middle catchment there is mixed farming including arable and pastoral and significant urbanisation in the lower catchment 2 2 sites description and data collections twenty six measurement locations were selected on the river clyde and its major tributaries the locations were distributed along the river clyde from near the source on daer water above daer reservoir to glasgow green just above the clyde tidal weir which separates two distinct habitats of fresh and salt water the sample locations are shown spatially against both the water network of the river clyde and tributaries fig 2 a and the catchment land cover fig 2b full details of the survey locations are provided in the supplementary information table a1 1 with photographs in figure a2 samples were collected monthly between january 2020 and december 2021 at all locations twenty one sampling campaigns were undertaken as no sampling was permitted during the period april to june 2020 due to covid 19 working restrictions each sampling campaign was undertaken over two consecutive days with samples collected at the upper catchment sites on day one and in the lower catchment on day two sample filtration and processing was undertaken on the same day as sample collection 2 3 field sampling and laboratory measurements dissolved gas samples were collected in triplicate at each location using the headspace method prior to the collected water being disturbed by other measurements together with ambient air samples billett and moore 2008 conductivity ec water temperature tw dissolved oxygen concentration do and ph were measured and a two litre water sample was retained for later analysis which was kept in a dark cool box until returned to the laboratory for processing to minimise biological activity full details of the data collection and laboratory measurement methodologies are described brown et al 2023 headspace samples were analysed using an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc and 7697a headspace auto sampler agilent santa clara california with co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations determined by running gas vials containing four mixed gas standards prepared in a consistent way to the ambient air samples the concentrations of the standards gases were 1 12 to 98 2 ppm for ch4 202 to 5253 ppm for co2 and 0 208 to 1 04 ppm for n2o water samples were filtered within 12 hrs of collection through a whatman gf f 0 7 µm under vacuum filtrate was then analysed for total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved carbon tdc and dissolved organic carbon doc anion cation concentration uv vis absorbence total phosphorus tp analysis was undertaken on unfiltered samples analysis for tdn tdc and doc were undertaken using a shimadzu toc l series total organic carbon analyser with all samples run within 36 hrs of collection the difference between tdc and doc was used to calculate dissolved inorganic carbon dic the filtration resulted in outgassing of gases including co2 raising the ph such that most dic measured by this method was in the form of bicarbonate and will underestimate the total dic in the original stream waters bicarbonate plus co2 absorbence at 254 nm indicative of aromaticity was measured using a perkin elmer lambda 365 uv vis spectrophotometer to evaluate the specific ultraviolet absorbence suva a low suva254 indicates a smaller portion of aromatic humic matter present in the water and can be used as an indicator of the anthropogenic impact williams et al 2016 ion chromatography using a metrohm 930 compact ic flex was undertaken to determine both anion and cation concentrations a mixed ion standard containing 11 000 ppm chloride cl 5000 ppm nitrate no3 4000 ppm sulphate so4 2 10 000 ppm sodium na 5000 ppm ammonium nh4 1000 ppm potassium k 1000 ppm calcium ca2 and 1000 ppm magnesium mg2 was diluted to make 7 standard solutions for calibration these included dilutions of 0 1 100 0 5 100 1 100 2 100 5 100 10 100 and 25 100 total phosphorous tp was measured using a seal aq2 analyser four standards were included in each run for calibration of between 0 025 to 0 20 mg p l 1 where concentrations exceeded the top standard the machine diluted and re measured the sample for all techniques all sample points from each survey were run together 2 4 gas partial pressures to calculate dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures from the headspace equilibration method the following mass balance equation was applied hamilton 2006 1 c 0 liq v ila c 0 gas v gas c liq v liq c gas v gas where c0 liq and c0 gas are the original gas concentration cliq and cgas are the concentrations in the liquid and gas phases after equilibration shaking and vliq and vgas are the volumes of the liquid and gas in the syringe assumed to be the same before and after shaking assuming equilibrium inside the vessel then cliq can be replace by 2 c liq p gas β t p bar where pbar is the barometric pressure at the measurement time and altitude pgas is the partial pressure in the gas phase βt is the bunsen solubility coefficient as a function of temperature this can be rearranged 3 c 0 liq p gas β t p bar c gas c 0 gas v gas v liq this gas concentration in μmoles l can be converted to units of ppmv using the ideal gas law where ppmv μmoles l rt where r is the gas constant and t is the temperature in kelvin this method is effective for ch4 and n2o but can lead to errors in co2 estimates as dissolved co2 is in dynamic chemical equilibrium with other carbonate species the error incurred by headspace analysis of co2 is less than 5 for typical samples from boreal systems which have low alkalinity 900 µmoll 1 with ph 7 5 and high pco2 1000 µatm this was the case for 98 of the samples here but errors in the lower clyde tributaries with both higher alkalinity and ph were estimated as reaching 10 koschorreck et al 2021 2 5 data sources and processing flow data measured by sepa at their various gauging stations was used for all hydraulic calculations details of the data applied at each location are provided in the supplementary information table a1 1 scottish environment protection agency 2020 and uk centre of ecology hydrology ukceh 2020 river flow over the period january 2020 to december 2021 for the sills of clyde in the upper catchment ranged between 2 5 and 345 m3 s 1 the survey captured a range of 3 3

and 100 km from source which would be expected to produce significant outgassing fig 3c and significant inputs from urban wastewater treatment uwwt and mine water outflows mw fig 3d data was analysed using a combination of approaches spatial analysis of all measured parameters was undertaken using quantum geographic information system qgis version 3 22 land cover analysis was undertaken by generation of the catchment area for each measurement point and applications of a land cover date uk centre for ecology hydrology ukceh 2020 also using qgis pearson s correlation was applied to determine relationships between the ghg concentrations water physiochemical properties and land cover locations were grouped using k cluster analysis to help investigate the impact of seasonality

or could be calculated the difference in the occurrence of point and diffuse sources is linked to the concentration flow relationship and can be calculated by using eq 4 where q is volumetric flow rate and cp and cd are the point and diffuse source concentrations respectively the constants a b c and d need to be calculated by iteration for each solute bowes et al 2008 the models for the point

where concentrations reached ch4 c 44 µgl 1 co2 c 2 6 mg l 1 and n2o n 3 4 µgl 1 with corresponding saturations of 130 400 1170 and 1310 respectively all ghg concentrations exhibited both strong spatial and temporal variability riverine dissolved ghgs ch4 co2 and n2o were typically supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere with 97 above the theoretical equilibrium value the lowest saturations occurred in areas of steep slope and high turbulence which included the head waters of the clyde c3 and the areas surrounding the falls of clyde c12 t13 c14 t15 c16 and t17 with ch4

different locations measured on the river clyde fig 4 a and its tributaries fig 4b all increased from source to sea in line with increasing percentage of both agricultural and urban land cover fig 4c average concentrations for all locations are included in supplementary data tables a3 1 and a3 2 3 2 land cover relationship with and methane and nitrous oxide dynamics to determine land cover influences on nutrient and ghg concentrations the land cover was correlated to the measured ghg concentrations and water physio chemical properties table 1 and supplementary data table a4 1 analysis was for the tributaries and clyde headwaters only to ensure all data was independent and points within the analysis were on a similar spatial scale catchment area 250km2 the measurements points in the lower urban river clyde catchments with the highest ghg concentrations are not included to avoid confounding of data conductivity ph tdn tp dic doc cl no3 so4 2 na nh4 k ca2 mg2 and n2o n were strongly negatively correlated with percentage cover of acid semi natural grassland and positively correlated with improved pasture grassland suggesting that acid grassland behaved as a nutrient sink while improved grassland behaved as a nutrient source arable horticulture arable cover was positively correlated with ec ph dic tdn tp cl no3 nh4 k ca2 mg2 and behaved as a nutrient source the area of arable horticulture cover is an order of magnitude lower than for improve grassland but correlations are similar table 1 and supplementary data table a4 1 urban suburban urban cover was strongly positively correlated with ec ph tdn tp dic cl no3 so4 2 na nh4 k ca2 mg2 ch4 c and n2o n suggesting that the urban cover acts as both a nutrient and ghg source urban land cover was negatively correlated with do while other land cover types had no statistically significant impact of river oxygenation improved grassland urban and arable cover were all negatively correlated with suva254 suggesting an anthropogenic influence as land cover linked to nutrient concentrations and human density have been found to impact humic composition williams et al 2016 no statistically significant correlations are detected for co2 table 1 and supplementary data table a4 2 3 3 ghg spatial heterogeneity the spatial patterns of ch4 n2o and co2 are similar with the lower urban catchment to the northwest having the highest concentrations fig 5 the concentrations of ch4 n2o and co2 in the middle catchment associated with the falls of clyde c12 c18 78 to 100 km from source an area of high turbulence with an elevation drop of 150 m were the lowest and are typically at or near atmospheric equilibrium likely associated with high evasion due to increased turbulence the upper more rural catchment has more variability between the different ghgs for example t10 has both high ch4 and co2 but lower relative n2o concentrations and was observed associated with mw inflows conversely the c9 has higher n2o but lower relative ch4 and co2 concentrations and has high agriculture land cover average suva254 values of 5 35 aromaticity occured in the upper catchment dropping to 3 20 aromaticity in the lower catchment the three most urban tributaries t19 t22 t23 consistently demonstrated the lowest suva254 values characteristic of high anthropogenic impact the spatial patterns for dic so4 2 ca2 mg2 and k supplementary data figure a5 are similar and exhibit high concentrations in the tributary measurements t10 t13 t19 t22 all of these catchments are influenced by legacy coal mines and outflows of mw fig 3d the tributary t23 also exhibited high so4 2 and na compared to other ions suggestive of a different industrial legacy waste history the ions cl no3 na and nh4 all increase with urbanisation of the catchment and are consistent with anthropogenic sources herlihy et al 1998 3 4 seasonal ghg distribution by land use characteristics locations were grouped using k cluster analysis based on measured water chemical properties the result with six clusters was selected and summarised in table 2 seasonal patterns for riverine dissolved ghgs ch4 co2 and n2o and water physiochemical properties tdn and tp were investigated using the clustering in table 2 and were found to be inconsistent throughout the catchment fig 6 in the upper and middle catchment for both the river clyde and its tributaries ch4 and tp concentrations exhibited low variability by season however in the lower urban catchments both the highest mean and maximum concentrations occured in summer and autumn concentrations of ch4 in the lower urban catchment increased by an order of magnitude and tp by at least four times conversely n2o co2 and tdn exhibited their lowest average values in summer with the highest values in spring and winter in the upper and middle catchments however in the lower urban catchment the seasonality pattern changes with the highest concentrations of n2o co2 and tdn in the summer the seasonal change in summer could be driven by temperature or reduced river flow temperature is correlated with reduced river flow and this correlation becomes more significant in the lower urban catchment at c9 upper catchment r2 0 5 p value 0 03 and at c24 lower catchment r2 0 61 p value 0 003 august 20 data excluded and log linear relationship applied the low river flow in summer would impact contaminant and nutrient concentrations particularly where these are linked to point rather than diffuse sources thus this seasonal impact could be driven by temperature and concentrations of nutrients from point sources 3 5 ghg nutrient and contaminant correlations correlations over the whole catchment show that both ch4 and n2o were significantly positively correlated with tp tdn no3 and nh4 with ch4 also significantly positively correlated with dic and mg2 and n2o significantly positively correlated with cl ch4 co2 and n2o are all negatively correlated with do table 3 and supplementary data table a4 2 in the urban sector l20 to c26 do values are lower supplementary data table a3 1 suggesting reduced water aeration conductivity dic cl so4 2 na k ca2 mg2 are all strongly inter correlated tdn is strongly correlated with no3 but also tp these correlations are not consistent across the whole the catchment and are investigated using the clustering from table 2 the correlations for clusters 1 3 4 and 6 are shown in fig 7 there are few significant correlations for ghgs in the upper catchment especially for ch4 n2o is positively correlated with tw no3 and tdn and co2 negatively correlated with do fig 7a and b however in the lower urban catchment strong correlations occured between almost all ghgs and physiochemical properties suggesting high ghg concentrations occured as contaminate concentrations increased and do decreased fig 7c and d the correlation between tdn and tp is high in the urban environment r2 0 76 both linked to uww this may result in some correlations which are unlikely to be causal in the urban area ch4 is highly correlated with tp and n2o with tdn associated with uww and ch4 with the dic so4 2 ca2 and mg2 grouping associated with mw suggesting different mechanisms for ch4 production compared to the semi natural environment in the urban area significant negative correlations occured between both do and suva254 and most physiochemical properties and ghg concentrations 3 6 drivers for greenhouse gas concentrations a load apportionment model was used to model the ghg and solute concentrations and the exponents b and d from the relationships for concentration as a function of flow eq 4 were estimated for point and diffuse sources and used to distinguish four source types 1 point sources which are fully independent of flow b 0 2 point sources where concentration appears influenced by flow or rainfall 0 b 1 3 diffuse sources where the concentration increases with flow d 1 and 4 diffuse sources where concentrations remain constant with flow d 1 the ions nutrients and ghgs are categorised for these four source types in table 4 and show different behaviours in the upper and lower catchment mean concentrations together with calculated point and diffuse concentrations for the river clyde from source to sea fig 8 and supplementary data figure a6 show the increasing significance of point source inputs in the lower urban river for both ghgs and nutrients in the upper catchment ghg concentrations were dominated by diffuse agricultural sources in the lower urban catchment point sources became dominant over diffuse sources for ch4 tp and nh4 and became significant for n2o co2 no3 and tdn additionally while no3 n2o and co2 are dominated by diffuse flow their concentrations remain constant with flow suggesting a reduced connection with their catchment generation of n2o and co2 would be in the water column with in water generation and out gassing approximately in balance n2o by de nitrification of dissolved nitrogen compounds and co2 by in stream mineralization of doc rather than input via groundwater the ch4 concentrations best reflect those of tp r2 0 5 p value 0 005 while tdn concentrations are reflected in n2o r2 0 65 p value 0 0005 and co2 r2 0 71 p value 0 0002 concentrations the locations c21 112 km from source and c26 134 km fig 8 show the highest concentrations of ch4 and n2o which are within 0 3 km and 3 4 km of uwwtp outfalls the tidal weir 400 m downstream of this c26 locally reduces flow and increases water residence times which may act to reduce do seen at this location the major point sources identified in the lower catchment included inflows from uwwtp and mw from abandoned coal mines fig 3d 3 7 carbon and nitrogen exports to the estuary data measured at c26 was used to estimate the carbon nitrogen and other direct riverine exports into the clyde estuary the horizontal flux models for these exports are included in table 5 based on volumetric flow rate q in m3 s 1 the annual export based on flow data for the survey period 1 jan 20 to 31 dec 21 is included in the final column of table 5 this estimate only includes fluxes attributed to continuous point or diffuse sources sporadic pollution from winter road salting or periodic agricultural fertiliser application is estimated separately storm events dominated riverine loading of doc and nutrients from agricultural run off and low water levels dominated inputs from point sources particularly those near to measurement locations variability in this relationship does arise due to hysteresis for example doc concentrations during storm events are related to the whether the doc source is plentiful or exhaustible vaughan et al 2017 vaughan and schroth 2019 and pohle et al 2021 in this study continuous measurements were not available resulting in the inability to quantify any hysteresis the annual loss of tdc from dic toc co2 and ch4 to the estuary was estimated as 48 39 3 6 gg c yr 1 with annual dic export approximately double that of doc and four times that of co2 with ch4 accounting for 0 03 the annual loss of total nitrogen from tdn and n2o to the estuary was estimated as 4 03 0 38 gg n yr 1 of which n2o represents 0 06 the largest exports are for tdc cl so4 2 ca2 all exceeding 40 gg yr 1 with na exceeding 36 gg yr 1 with road winter salting contributing an additional 10 mg yr 1 of cl and 5 6 mg yr 1 of na despite the focus on measuring doc in rivers a recent uk modelling study demonstrated that dic accounted for 80 of the tdc flux from the uk s 7 largest rivers jarvie et al 2017 and a one year study 2017 measured dic as 78 of the tdc flux for the same rivers tye et al 2022 table 6 provides a ranked comparison of dic and doc export from various uk rivers including the river clyde from this study based on river catchment area on a per annum basis showing the dominance of dic export over doc in the uk 4 discussion 4 1 urban nutrients and climate warming increase ghg emissions our study supports the growing global concern that ghg emissions from water bodies are increasing because of the interaction between nutrient levels and climate warming more specifically our study points to the largest increase in riverine ghgs coming from urban nutrients and the riverine climate stressors of low summer water levels resulting in increased water residence times and reduced river oxygenation our source to sea methodology showed clearly that seasonal patterns of ch4 co2 and n2o changed between the semi natural environment in the upper catchment and urban environment in the lower catchment in the semi natural upper catchment ghgs were higher in winter while in the lower urban catchment ghg were significantly higher in summer the ghgs from the urban catchment were dominated by point source inputs and their impact increased during low river flow and high temperature conditions in the agricultural middle catchment ghg concentrations increased slightly above those of the semi natural upper catchment but did not exhibit a change in seasonal pattern this seasonal change in ghg concentrations may be related to changes in microbial community composition and activities which have been observed downstream of uwwtp y zhou et al 2022 beaulieu et al 2010 the abundance of sediment microbial community have been found to be correlated with ec organic matter tp do and tn feng et al 2022 this suggests microbial adaptation to changing conditions riverine dissolved ghg nutrient and chemical concentrations all increased from source to sea in line with the increasing percentage of urban and agricultural land cover the increase in ghg concentrations between the semi natural and urban environment was on average three times higher for n2o and co2 but twenty times higher for ch4 suggesting the significant nature of ch4 as an urban marker while there were few significant correlations for any ghgs in the upper catchment in the lower urban catchment strong correlations occurred between all ghgs and water physiochemical properties suggesting that removal of contaminates from river systems could lower ghg concentrations three main anthropogenic sources were identified that increased ghgs these included 1 uww outflows as a major point source of both ch4 linked to tp and tdn and n2o linked to tdn 2 mw outflows as a major point source of ch4 and co2 emanating from groundwater interacting with disused coal mines and 3 agricultural activities as a major diffuse source of n2o linked to tdn additionally three major hydrological environmental interactions were found that increased ghg concentrations in addition to those directly attributed to the nutrient increases these included 1 low oxygen conditions 2 higher temperatures and 3 changes in river geometry linked to increased water residence times and made it challenging to attribute causes absolutely 4 2 high nutrient residence time interactions promote ghg generation once the availability of tdn is accounted for n2o tdn neither tw in the range 0 22⁰c or do 90 have significant effects on n2o concentration however where water residence time increases tw and do appear significant in low flow situations residence time is further increased decreasing do and providing more time for temperatures to increase in summer both this increased residence time zarnetske et al 2011 and low oxygen level frey et al 2020 rosamond et al 2012 will act to increase n2o by promoting dentification and increasing the proportion of n2o per unit tdn in the upper clyde catchment ch4 concentrations are low and highly variable with higher ch4 observed with elevated doc occurring in high flow events suggesting doc availability may be limiting ch4 however in the lower urban catchment ch4 is strongly positively correlated to tw tp tdn and dic and negatively correlated with flow and do this point source ch4 generation is over 20 times higher than that derived from diffuse sources generation of ch4 in the lower urban catchment may be linked to eutrophication nutrient enrichment our suva254 values show a shift in riverine oc sources toward a more microbial and algal origin as has been found as human disturbance increases lambert et al 2017 high ch4 in many shallow lakes is produced by eutrophication mostly driven by tp and tdn enrichment and sediment microbiome davidson et al 2018 aben et al 2017 nijman et al 2022 this mechanism is less likely in river ecosystem due to continual flushing but during low water levels increased residence times in combination with the high nutrient concentrations from uww appear responsible for eutrophication and significant ch4 generation this may be enabled by electron donor availability in the receiving waters this effect was most exacerbated when water residence times were further increased by the flow restriction at the tidal weir 4 3 main uncertainty in the causes of ghg variation greenhouse gas concentrations were inversely correlated with river oxygenation this correlation was influenced by several mechanisms where the dominance changed with position in the catchment high turbulence caused oxygenation of the water and outgassing of the supersaturated ghgs respiration photosynthesis and decomposition can create inverse relationships between oxygen and co2 dependant on their balance in the water column aho et al 2021 low oxygen conditions can result in anaerobic condition promoting both methanogenesis and denitrification which increase ch4 and n2o production respectively from the available resources while turbulence outgasses ghgs to atmosphere it also produces conditions less likely to promote ch4 and n2o production making it difficult to fully distinguish the mechanisms the lower urban river has the highest correlations with ghgs increasing exponentially with reducing oxygen levels the oxygen concentration primarily influences ch4 while co2 and n2o are influenced by the do ch4 r2 0 45 co2 r2 0 74 n2o r2 0 24 p value 0 001 suggesting ch4 generation is less influenced by temperature summer seasonal changes impact both temperature and rainfall which together impact ghg concentrations lower rainfall reduces river flow and diffuse nutrients inputs and increases the impact of point source inputs higher temperatures reduce the available oxygen due to reduced solubility and can increase microbial activity as flow and temperature are often highly correlated this can make distinguishing these mechanisms difficult many researchers suggest temperature is a major effect wang et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 and rosentreter et al 2021 however this study found that the size of the impact of flow and temperature on ghg concentrations is dependant on the location in the catchment and specifically the balance between diffuse and point source inputs the upper catchment is dominated by diffuse inputs which increase in higher flow and correspond to an increase in ghg concentrations the lower urban catchments is dominated by point source inputs and corresponds to an increase in ghg concentrations with low flow flow and hence nutrient concentrations being more significant than direct impact of temperature in accounting for ghg variability after flow tp is the major influence on ch4 and tdn on n2o the use of the load appointment model to distinguish between points and diffuse sources of ghgs and nutrients suggests that nutrients however they are delivered are dominating ghg production fully distinguishing between temperature and flow impacts would require longer data set with more instances of high flow during the summer changes in river geometry that reduce river velocity and increase water residence times also cause deposition of sediments and nutrients and reduce oxygen saturation river sections with increased residence time exhibited higher ghg concentrations with the largest increases occurring in low flow conditions however proportioning the cause of this increase between increased residence time reduced outgassing due to lower turbulence lower oxygen conditions or deposition of sediments and nutrients as a source of ghg production is challenging these higher residence time river sections act as point source locations for ghg generation compared to the surrounding river with ch4 concentrations showing the most significant increase suggesting the creation of anaerobic sediments may be the most significant impact our results show an increase in ghgs particularly ch4 in the receiving river after uwwtps with the riverine ch4 concentrations dominated by point source characteristics pointing to the uwwtp inflows as causal uwwtp generate ch4 in locations such as sewer pipes and primary sedimentation although ch4 was not noted as discharged in effluent water masuda et al 2018 we made measurements of ghg concentrations in some uwwtps outflows which were low in dissolved ghg including ch4 and this suggested that ch4 was generated within the receiving river due to changes in the river physicochemical properties including nutrient availability rather than transferred from the uwwtp however we made insufficient measurements in uwwtp outflows due to their inaccessibility to confirm this absolutely unexplained ch4 concentrations in the stream sections after uww treatments works in southwest germany were attributed to in water generation due to additional organic carbon load in the effluent water alshboul et al 2016 after hydrology was accounted for tp also dominated by point source characteristics had the highest correlation with unexplained ch4 concentrations tp r2 0 59 at c26 although this correlation changed with proximity to uwwtp other authors indicated correlations between tp and ch4 concentrations in urban settings usually by impacting microbial activity zhang et al 2021 martinez cruz et al 2017 hao et al 2021 4 4 carbon dioxide concentration variability reduced by carbonate buffering concentrations of co2 were less variable than those of n2o and ch4 mostly driven by diffuse sources with point source inflows associated with tributaries receiving mw causing short term co2 increases in stream mineralization of doc the most likely generation mechanism for the consistent super saturation of co2 would require a constant input of carbon to sustain co2 supersaturation levels winterdahl et al 2016 doc concentrations varied little through the catchment emanating from diffuse input while dic increased from source to sea dominated by mw inflows these mw inflows added significant amounts of dic from the dissolution of limestone producing high alkalinity and many dissolved contaminates the mw inflows are supersaturated with co2 which outgases very rapidly in treatment cascades or headwater streams this rapid outgassing was observed to shift the ph upwards creating a new carbonate equilibrium this changing equilibration would convert some of the remaining co2 to bicarbonate rather than emitting it to the atmosphere thus reducing the gradient of co2 across the air water interface stets et al 2017 aquatic primary productivity produces oxygen and consumes co2 however primary productivity can be maintained with diminished co2 in high alkalinity waters by converting bicarbonate to co2 to support productivity aho et al 2021 conversely mineralisation of doc to co2 would change the carbonate balance increasing bicarbonate concentrations it is likely that this significant carbonate buffering available in the clyde is responsible for the low variability in co2 concentrations and the reason why nutrients rather than carbon availability appear to influence co2 concentrations 4 5 acid mine inflows are a major source of ghg in the middle and lower catchment tributaries high concentrations of both co2 and ch4 occurred linked to outflows from disused coal mine adits where carbonate rock is present and much coal bearing strata in the uk is associated with carboniferous limestone british geological survey 2022 the sulphuric acid generated in the mine dissolves the calcium carbonate to produce co2 hedin and hedin 2016 vesper et al 2016 jarvis 2006 details of ch4 released in mw have not to our knowledge been published most ghgs from mw had out gassed before reaching the river clyde however high co2 and ch4 concentrations in t10 were traced back to several mw inflows these mw inflows had high concentrations of dic so4 2 ca2 mg2 and k which together acted as a marker for legacy coal mining many other mw sources were traced in the catchment with this marker although not included within this publication despite the focus on measuring doc in rivers our data suggest that for the river clyde carbon loss is dominated by dic with the annual dic export approximately double that for doc comparison with other riverine studies demonstrated that dic is the major component of the dissolved carbon in uk rivers with dic accounting for 70 to 80 of carbon loss table 6 our results suggest that the anthropogenic impacts of disused coal mines are accelerating carbon loss 4 6 legacy industry is still detectable in our rivers other increases in ion concentrations and ph were identified in the three most urban tributaries t19 t22 and t23 urban tributaries t19 and t22 had the highest concentrations of dic so4 2 ca2 mg2 and k attributed to inflows of mw from legacy coal mining both tributaries had legacy iron or steel making near to the rivers and may have iron slag buried within the catchment historic environment scotland 2022 steel slag is known to increase ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration riley and mayes 2015 the urban tributary t23 had the highest concentrations of na and so4 2 probably associated with leachate from legacy paper production skinner 1939 t22 also experienced the highest na and cl ion concentrations in the winter likely from winter road salting as this tributary has the biggest road network including a motorway data suggests that road drainage is entering the river directly adding an estimated 15 mg yr 1 of nacl 5 conclusions 5 1 benefits of a source to sea approach in interpreting riverine ghgs we have used the clyde catchment with its transitioning land cover from semi natural through agricultural and legacy industrial to highly urban as a source to sea study to support identification of ghg sources this source to sea investigative approach was found effective in tracing how changes in the nature and size of the riverine environment impacted ghg concentrations particularly as ghgs were not conserved but outgased in turbulent riverine sections this variable outgassing makes correlations on a catchment scale misleading and is probably one reason for the high variability in ghg to nutrient relationships reported in the literature a key aspect of ghg source identification included the use of load appointment modelling to distinguish point and diffuse sources by their degree of dependence on flow this was effective in confirming diffuse ghg sources from agriculture and point ghg sources from uww and mw this load appointment modelling approach enabled two main seasonal impacts high temperature and low water levels to be distinguished analysis suggested that the impact of low water levels dominated over temperature change and failure to account for changing water levels with their implications for oxygen and residence times may account for some of the variability in the impact of temperature on ghg generation reported in the literature measurement of a high number of water physiochemical properties allowed source fingerprinting of different inflows which enabled detection even when the inflows were not physically identified supporting identification of contamination from legacy industry results suggested that outflows from uww treatment plants caused generation of ghg within the riverine water column changes in the seasonal pattern of ghg generation associated with urban wastewater inflows could be due to changes in microbial community structure eutrophication at low water levels and supported by the availability of electron donors and acceptors in receiving waters this was not confirmed as part of this study and it is suggested that future surveys should be designed to quantify in water generation resulting from mixing of uww and riverine water the most important anthropogenic ghg from inland waters is ch4 rosentreter et al 2021 but ch4 outgases the most rapidly due to its high concentration to solubility ratio as such catchment scale analysis can be misleading improved methods to detect and quantify ch4 concentrations are required a drone mounted ch4 sensor might be effective in identifying point sources while continuous in situ ch4 measurements would better define source flow relationships although sensor reliability and sensitivity needs improvement where the source of nutrient pollution is unclear human tracers such as caffeine could be applied to support understanding of contributions to nutrient pollution mizukawa et al 2019 and chen et al 2002 5 2 implications and ideas for policy makers to effectively reduce anthropogenic ghgs from the riverine environment it is important to understand their sources for the river clyde uww outflows were a major point source of both anthropogenic ch4 and n2o mw outflows a major point source of anthropogenic ch4 and co2 and agricultural activities including field and farmyard run off and poorly maintained septic tanks septic tank are not effective in removing nitrogen and phosphorous o keeffe et al 2015 were a source of anthropogenic n2o all sources of ghgs were associated with high concentrations of nutrients hence reducing nutrient loading industrial and legacy contamination and agricultural run off would ultimately act to reduce ghgs within riverine environments pollution point sources are easier to tackle as the location of the inflows are known while many uwwtp in the clyde have phosphorous removal our measurements suggest that levels of effectiveness vary between plants suggesting improvement is possible additionally none of the uwwtp in this area have nitrogen removal european commission directorate general environment 2016 riverine environments with low oxygenation increased river residence times and high levels of nitrogen should be prioritised for nitrogen removal from uwwtp to have the largest impact on n2o reduction urban influences may have stimulated adaptation in microbial communities further increasing ghg production and further studies of microbial activity may support ghg reduction nitrogen capture at uwwtp could ultimately act as an important source of fertiliser avoiding outflows to the environment van der hoek et al 2018 mine water is more difficult to tackle in terms of ghg generation as ghgs are generated below ground with the generation mechanism poorly understood while agricultural pollution was primarily from diffuse sources additional measurements showed a significant proportion entered the clyde via the numerous field drainage ditches and small streams which could be treated as point sources approaches to reduce run off may include 1 use freshwater wetlands for nitrogen and phosphorus removal land et al 2016 and wetlands have been shown as effective for diffuse run off ockenden et al 2012 2 use of biochar filtration an effective technology for both cleaning of wastewater and run off water its capabilities include removal of pesticides organic chemicals and nutrients however a practical approach for application to small streams is needed after use the biochar could be redeployed onto farmland supporting carbon sequestration and a circular economy recycling nutrients and further preventing run off catizzone et al 2021 phillips et al 2022 kamali et al 2021 3 riparian buffer zones are recommended between crops and rivers in scotland general binding rule 20 requires a buffer strip at least 2 m wide to be left between surface waters and wetlands and cultivated land sepa 2009 this rule was not set with the objective of reducing nutrient leeching further research demonstrates that woody vegetation is more effective than shrubs or grass at preventing nutrient leaching to rivers with a 60 m buffer strip effectively removing all nutrients aguiar et al 2015 while this would take considerable agricultural land approximately 70 of nutrients are removed by a 12 m strip which would also stabilise river banks reduce erosion and sediment loss increase biodiversity and provide shade making the riverine system more robust to climate change cole et al 2020 declaration of competing

14840,there is growing global concern that greenhouse gas ghg emissions from water bodies are increasing because of interactions between nutrient levels and climate warming this paper investigates key land cover seasonal and hydrological controls of ghgs by comparison of the semi natural agricultural and urban environments in a detailed source to sea study of the river clyde scotland riverine ghg concentrations were consistently oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere high riverine concentrations of methane ch4 were primarily associated with point source inflows from urban wastewater treatment abandoned coal mines and lakes with ch4 c concentrations between 0 1 44 µg l 1 concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 and nitrous oxide n2o were mainly driven by nitrogen concentrations dominated by diffuse agricultural inputs in the upper catchment and supplemented by point source inputs from urban wastewater in the lower urban catchment with co2 c concentrations between 0 1 2 6 mg l 1 and n2o n concentrations between 0 3 3 4 µg l 1 a significant and disproportionate increase in all ghgs occurred in the lower urban riverine environment in the summer compared to the semi natural environment where ghg concentrations were higher in winter this increase and change in ghg seasonal patterns points to anthropogenic impacts on microbial communities the loss of total dissolved carbon to the estuary is approximately 48 4 3 6 gg c yr 1 with the annual inorganic carbon export approximately double that of organic carbon and four times that of co2 with ch4 accounting for 0 03 with the anthropogenic impact of disused coal mines accelerating dic loss the annual loss of total dissolved nitrogen to the estuary is approximately 4 03 0 38 gg n yr 1 of which n2o represents 0 06 this study improves our understanding of riverine ghg generation and dynamics which can contribute to our knowledge of their release to the atmosphere it identifies where action could support reductions in aquatic ghg generation and emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane nitrous oxide carbon dioxide urban wastewater agriculture mine water data availability the data used for this manuscript has been published by the environmental information data centre at https eidc ac uk brown et al 2023 1 introductions greenhouse gas ghg evasion from inland waters is a significant source of atmospheric ghgs global carbon dioxide co2 evasion has been estimated as 1 8 0 25 pg c yr 1 from streams and rivers resulting in a global evasion rate from inland waters of 2 1 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 the contribution from streams and rivers is large relative to their surface area acting as hotspots for the exchange of gases with the atmosphere the major sources of co2 are direct input via groundwater inflow which transports co2 originating from soil respiration and in stream mineralization of organic carbon oc often from surface run off winterdahl et al 2016 riparian wetlands also contribute disproportionately to co2 emissions abril and borges 2019 the relative importance of these mechanisms changes with stream order as headwater streams have a larger soil water interface compared to lower reaches resulting in the proportion of co2 produced from aquatic metabolism increasing with stream size marx et al 2017 hotchkiss et al 2015 the magnitude of co2 riverine emissions is highly dependant on hydrology gómez gener et al 2016 in urban areas significantly higher nutrients organic matter content and riverine cyanobacteria impact co2 variation salgado et al 2022 global methane ch4 evasion from inland waters was estimated at 398 1 79 4 tg ch4 yr 1 with rivers evading 30 5 17 1 tg ch4 yr 1 with aquatic ecosystems contributing about half of total global ch4 emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources rosentreter et al 2021 total ch4 emissions were found to increase from natural to impacted and from coastal to freshwater ecosystems with emissions expected to increase due to urbanization eutrophication and positive climate feedbacks although there is significant uncertainty in the production transportation and consumption processes rosentreter et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 similarly the production and emission of nitrous oxide n2o from aquatic systems are uncertain 0 3 2 1 tg n2o n yr 1 with large spatial and temporal variability in emission estimates seitzinger and kroeze 1998 beaulieu et al 2011 ciais et al 2013 however n2o emissions from rivers reservoirs and estuaries have been estimated as 148 277 gg n yr 1 with anthropogenic perturbations to river systems resulting in a two to four fold increase in n2o emissions from inland waters maavara et al 2019 the dominance of n2o emissions emanating from nitrification or denitrification in inland waters is partly dependant on residence time zarnetske et al 2011 urban rivers and lakes are potential hotspots for ghg emissions and there is an increasing body of literature concerned with quantifying their contribution to aquatic ghg emissions zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 gu et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 martinez cruz et al 2017 and garnier et al 2009 in mexico city water quality indicators such as trophic state index and phosphorous level were positively correlated with ch4 emissions suggesting a reduction in untreated wastewater discharge could concurrently reduce ghg emissions fluxes of ch4 were highly variable both in and across ecosystem locations and seasons martinez cruz et al 2017 demonstrating the need for comprehensive studies to understand these temporal dynamics in water bodies around the city of berlin a combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth produced large ch4 emissions however dissolved oxygen and productivity were found to be poor predictors of ch4 emissions suggesting a complex combination of factors governed ch4 fluxes from urban surface waters herrero ortega et al 2019 conversely in rivers and lakes within the city of beijing high ch4 emissions were attributed to high dissolved and sediment organic carbon high aquatic primary production and shallow water depths although results were again highly variable wang et al 2021 in the chaohu lake basin in eastern china diffusive ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers were due to large nutrient supply and hypoxic environments with co2 impacted by temperature dependant rapid decomposition of organic matter zhang et al 2021 positive correlations between temperature and ghg concentrations have been routinely observed wang et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 and rosentreter et al 2021 the presence of ammonia entering inland water from agriculture or wastewater can inhibit ch4 oxidation resulting in elevated ch4 concentrations compared to low nitrogen systems and high evasion to atmosphere dunfield and knowles 1995 bosse et al 1993 cotovicz et al 2021 conversely in an investigation of n2o concentrations upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in an urban river in japan lower n2o concentrations were found in summer y zhou et al 2022 positive correlations between ghgs in surface waters and catchment agricultural landcover linked to higher levels of organic matter and dissolved inorganic nitrogen from the agricultural dominated areas have been found significant with increases in ghg levels during prolonged low water levels borges et al 2018 ghg emissions are difficult to attribute to sources due to multiple generation and consumption pathways and high spatial and temporal variability rosentreter et al 2021 their production results from the interplay of multiple drivers and is influenced by high between and within system variation with the causes of this variation unknown this variation causes difficulties in upscaling emissions from local scale studies resulting in a need for more detailed studies measuring more in water parameters across a large temporal and spatial scales it is hypothesised in this paper the reasons for the high variation and poor predictably include 1 ghgs are not conserved like dissolved nutrients but readily out gas especially in the riverine environment with flow intensity and high stream slopes the primary controls long et al 2015 maurice et al 2017 natchimuthu et al 2017 liu and raymond 2018 2 the number of different source types within the riverine environment including point diffuse and in water generation change with land use and need to be distinguished 3 the concentration of nutrients is only one aspect of ghg generation which changes with availability

communities seasonality and anthropogenic impacts on seasonal patterns of changing water level and temperature the concentrations of ghgs in the riverine water column result from the balance between input consumption production and output fig 1 given the potential significance but inadequate quantification and characterisation of urban catchment fluvial ghg dynamics further insight into how to quantify and interpret riverine ghg concentration data could support improved estimates this study addressed the following key objectives 1 does using a source to sea investigative approach allows quantification of how changes in the nature and size of the riverine environment impact ghg concentrations 2 can the key controls on ghg generation be determined by comparison of the semi natural agricultural and urban environments including key land cover seasonal and hydrological controls and 3 can point source diffuse source and in water generation be distinguish for different ghgs a large temperate catchment was selected for the investigation where landcover transitioned from semi natural through pastoral and arable agricultural to urban including legacy industrial as representative of

samples were collected monthly between january 2020 and december 2021 at all locations twenty one sampling campaigns were undertaken as no sampling was permitted during the period april to june 2020 due to covid 19 working restrictions each sampling campaign was undertaken over two consecutive days with samples collected at the upper catchment sites on day one and in the lower catchment on day two sample filtration and processing was undertaken on the same day as sample collection 2 3 field sampling and laboratory measurements dissolved gas samples were collected in triplicate at each location using the headspace method prior to the collected water being disturbed by other measurements together with ambient air samples billett and moore 2008 conductivity ec water temperature tw dissolved oxygen concentration do and ph were measured and a two litre water sample was retained for later analysis which was kept in a dark cool box until returned to the laboratory for processing to minimise biological activity full details of the data collection and laboratory measurement methodologies are described brown et al 2023 headspace samples were analysed using an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc and 7697a headspace auto sampler agilent santa clara california with co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations determined by running gas vials containing four mixed gas standards prepared in a consistent way to the ambient air samples the concentrations of the standards gases were 1 12 to 98 2 ppm for ch4 202 to 5253 ppm for co2 and 0 208 to 1 04 ppm for n2o water samples were filtered

standard the machine diluted and re measured the sample for all techniques all sample points from each survey were run together 2 4 gas partial pressures to calculate dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures from the headspace equilibration method the following mass balance equation was applied hamilton 2006 1 c 0 liq v ila c 0 gas v gas c liq v liq c gas v gas where c0 liq and c0 gas are the original gas concentration cliq and cgas are the concentrations in the liquid and gas phases after equilibration shaking and vliq and vgas are the volumes of the liquid and gas in the syringe assumed to be the same before and after shaking assuming equilibrium inside the vessel then cliq can be replace by 2 c liq p gas β t p bar where pbar is the barometric pressure at the measurement time and altitude pgas is the partial pressure in the gas phase βt is the bunsen solubility coefficient as a function of temperature this can be rearranged 3 c 0 liq p gas β t p bar c gas c 0 gas v gas v liq this gas concentration in μmoles l can be converted to units of ppmv using the ideal gas law where ppmv μmoles l rt where r is the gas constant and t is the temperature in kelvin this method is effective for ch4 and n2o but can lead to errors in co2 estimates as dissolved co2 is in dynamic chemical equilibrium with other carbonate species the error incurred by headspace analysis of co2 is less than 5 for typical samples from boreal systems which have low alkalinity 900 µmoll 1 with ph 7 5 and high pco2 1000 µatm this was the case for 98 of the samples here but errors in the lower clyde

was for the tributaries and clyde headwaters only to ensure all data was independent and points within the analysis were on a similar spatial scale catchment area 250km2 the measurements points in the lower urban river clyde catchments with the highest ghg concentrations are not included to avoid confounding of data conductivity ph tdn tp dic doc cl no3 so4 2 na nh4 k ca2 mg2 and n2o n were strongly negatively correlated with percentage cover of acid semi natural grassland and positively correlated with improved pasture grassland suggesting that acid grassland behaved as a nutrient sink while improved grassland behaved as a nutrient source arable horticulture arable cover was positively correlated with ec ph dic tdn tp cl no3 nh4 k ca2 mg2 and behaved as a nutrient source the area of arable horticulture cover is an order of magnitude lower than for improve grassland but correlations are similar table 1 and supplementary data table a4 1 urban suburban urban cover was strongly positively correlated with ec ph tdn tp dic cl no3 so4 2 na nh4 k ca2 mg2 ch4 c and n2o n suggesting that the urban cover acts as both a nutrient and ghg source urban land cover was negatively correlated with do while other land cover types had no statistically significant impact of river oxygenation improved grassland urban and arable cover were all negatively correlated with suva254 suggesting an anthropogenic influence as land cover linked to nutrient concentrations and human density have been found to impact humic composition williams et al 2016 no statistically significant correlations are detected for co2 table 1 and supplementary data table a4 2 3 3 ghg spatial heterogeneity the spatial patterns of ch4 n2o and co2 are similar with the lower urban catchment to the northwest having the highest concentrations fig 5 the concentrations of ch4 n2o and co2 in the middle catchment associated with the falls of clyde c12 c18 78 to 100 km from source an area of high turbulence with an elevation drop of 150 m were the lowest and are typically at or near atmospheric equilibrium likely associated with high evasion due to increased turbulence the upper more rural catchment has more variability between the different ghgs for example t10 has both high ch4 and co2 but lower relative n2o concentrations and was observed associated with mw inflows conversely the c9 has higher n2o but lower relative ch4 and co2 concentrations and has high agriculture land cover average suva254 values of 5 35 aromaticity occured in the upper catchment dropping to 3 20 aromaticity in the lower catchment the three most urban tributaries t19 t22 t23 consistently demonstrated the lowest suva254 values characteristic of high anthropogenic impact the spatial patterns for dic so4 2 ca2 mg2 and k supplementary data figure a5 are similar and exhibit high concentrations in the tributary measurements t10 t13 t19 t22 all of these catchments are influenced by legacy coal mines and outflows of mw fig 3d the tributary t23 also exhibited high so4 2 and na compared to other ions suggestive of a different industrial legacy waste history the ions cl no3 na and nh4 all increase with urbanisation of the catchment and are consistent with anthropogenic sources herlihy et al 1998 3 4 seasonal ghg distribution by land use characteristics locations were grouped using k cluster analysis based on measured water chemical properties the result with six clusters was selected and summarised in table 2 seasonal patterns for riverine dissolved ghgs ch4 co2 and n2o and water physiochemical properties tdn and tp were investigated using the clustering in table 2 and were found to be inconsistent throughout the catchment fig 6 in the upper and middle catchment for both the river clyde and its tributaries ch4 and tp concentrations exhibited low variability by season however in the lower urban catchments both the highest mean and maximum concentrations occured in summer and autumn concentrations of ch4 in the lower urban catchment increased by an order of magnitude and tp by at least four times conversely n2o co2 and tdn exhibited their lowest average values in summer with the highest values in spring and winter in the upper and middle catchments however in the lower urban catchment the seasonality pattern changes with the highest concentrations of n2o co2 and tdn in the summer the seasonal change in summer could be driven by temperature or reduced river flow temperature is correlated with reduced river flow and this correlation becomes more significant in the lower urban catchment at c9 upper catchment r2 0 5 p value 0 03 and at c24 lower catchment r2 0 61 p value 0 003 august 20 data excluded and log linear relationship applied the low river flow in summer would impact contaminant and nutrient concentrations particularly where these are linked to point rather than diffuse sources thus this seasonal impact could be driven by temperature and concentrations of nutrients from point sources 3 5 ghg nutrient and contaminant correlations correlations over the whole catchment show that both ch4 and n2o were significantly positively correlated with tp tdn no3 and nh4 with ch4 also significantly positively correlated with dic and mg2 and n2o significantly positively correlated with cl ch4 co2 and n2o are all negatively correlated with do table 3 and supplementary data table a4 2 in the urban sector l20 to c26 do values are lower supplementary data table a3 1 suggesting reduced water aeration conductivity dic cl so4 2 na k ca2 mg2 are all strongly inter correlated tdn is strongly correlated with no3 but also tp these correlations are not consistent across the whole the catchment and are investigated using the clustering from table 2 the correlations for clusters 1 3 4 and 6 are shown in fig 7 there are few significant correlations for ghgs in the upper catchment especially for ch4 n2o is positively correlated with tw no3 and tdn and co2 negatively correlated with do fig 7a and b however in the lower urban catchment strong correlations occured between almost all ghgs and physiochemical properties suggesting high ghg concentrations occured as contaminate concentrations increased and do decreased fig 7c and d the correlation between tdn and tp is high in the urban environment r2 0 76 both linked to uww this may result in some correlations which are unlikely to be causal in the urban area ch4 is highly correlated with tp and n2o with tdn associated with uww and ch4 with the dic so4 2 ca2 and mg2 grouping associated with mw suggesting different mechanisms for ch4 production compared to the semi natural environment in the urban area significant negative correlations occured between both do and suva254 and most physiochemical properties and ghg concentrations 3 6 drivers for greenhouse gas concentrations a load apportionment model was used to model the ghg and solute concentrations and the exponents b and d from the relationships for concentration as a function of flow eq 4 were estimated for point and diffuse sources and used to distinguish four source types 1 point sources which are fully independent of flow b 0 2 point sources where concentration appears influenced by flow or rainfall 0 b 1 3 diffuse sources where the concentration increases with flow d 1 and 4 diffuse sources where concentrations remain constant with flow d 1 the ions nutrients and ghgs are categorised for these four source types in table 4 and show different behaviours in the upper and lower catchment mean concentrations together with calculated point and diffuse concentrations for the river clyde from source to sea fig 8 and supplementary data figure a6 show the increasing significance of point source inputs in the lower urban river for both ghgs and nutrients in the upper catchment ghg concentrations were dominated by diffuse agricultural sources in the lower urban catchment point sources became dominant over diffuse sources for ch4 tp and nh4 and became significant for n2o co2 no3 and tdn additionally while no3 n2o and co2 are dominated by diffuse flow their concentrations remain constant with flow suggesting a reduced connection with their catchment generation of n2o and co2 would be in the water column with in water generation and out gassing approximately in balance n2o by de nitrification of dissolved nitrogen compounds and co2 by in stream mineralization of doc rather than input via groundwater the ch4 concentrations best reflect those of tp r2 0 5 p value 0 005 while tdn concentrations are reflected in n2o r2 0 65 p value 0 0005 and co2 r2 0 71 p value 0 0002 concentrations the locations c21 112 km from source and c26 134 km fig 8 show the highest concentrations of ch4 and n2o which are within 0 3 km and 3 4 km of uwwtp outfalls the tidal weir 400 m downstream of this c26 locally reduces flow and increases water residence times which may act to reduce do seen at this location the major point sources identified in the lower catchment included inflows from uwwtp and mw from abandoned coal mines fig 3d 3 7 carbon and nitrogen exports to the estuary data measured at c26 was used to estimate the carbon nitrogen and other direct riverine exports into the clyde estuary the horizontal flux models for these exports are included in table 5 based on volumetric flow rate q in m3 s 1 the annual export based on flow data for the survey period 1 jan 20 to 31 dec 21 is included in the final column of table 5 this estimate only includes fluxes attributed to continuous point or diffuse sources sporadic pollution from winter road salting or periodic agricultural fertiliser application is estimated separately storm events dominated riverine loading of doc and nutrients from agricultural run off and low water levels dominated inputs from point sources particularly those near to measurement locations variability in this relationship does arise due to hysteresis for example doc concentrations during storm events are related to the whether the doc source is plentiful or exhaustible vaughan et al 2017 vaughan and schroth 2019 and pohle et al 2021 in this study continuous measurements were not available resulting in the inability to quantify any hysteresis the annual loss of tdc from dic toc co2 and ch4 to the estuary was estimated as 48 39 3 6 gg c yr 1 with annual dic export approximately double that of doc and four times that of co2 with ch4 accounting for 0 03 the annual loss of total nitrogen from tdn and n2o to the estuary was estimated as 4 03 0 38 gg n yr 1 of which n2o represents 0 06 the largest exports are for tdc cl so4 2 ca2 all exceeding 40 gg yr 1 with na exceeding 36 gg yr 1 with road winter salting contributing an additional 10 mg yr 1 of cl and 5 6 mg yr 1 of na despite the focus on measuring doc in rivers a recent uk modelling study demonstrated that dic accounted for 80 of the tdc flux from the uk s 7 largest rivers jarvie et al 2017 and a one year study 2017 measured dic as 78 of the tdc flux for the same rivers tye et al 2022 table 6 provides a ranked comparison of dic and doc export from various uk rivers including the river clyde from this study based on river catchment area on a per annum basis showing the dominance of dic export over doc in the uk 4 discussion 4 1 urban nutrients and climate warming increase ghg emissions our study supports the growing global concern that ghg emissions from water bodies are increasing because of the interaction between nutrient levels and climate warming more specifically our study points to the largest increase in riverine ghgs coming from urban nutrients and the riverine climate stressors of low summer water levels resulting in increased water residence times and reduced river oxygenation our source to sea methodology showed clearly that seasonal patterns of ch4 co2 and n2o changed between the semi natural environment in the upper catchment and urban environment in the lower catchment in the semi natural upper catchment ghgs were higher in winter while in the lower urban catchment ghg were significantly higher in summer the ghgs from the urban catchment were dominated by point source inputs and their impact increased during low river flow and high temperature conditions in the agricultural middle catchment ghg concentrations increased slightly above those of the semi natural upper catchment but did not exhibit a change in seasonal pattern this seasonal change in ghg concentrations may be related to changes in microbial community composition and activities which have been observed downstream of uwwtp y zhou et al 2022 beaulieu et al 2010 the abundance of sediment microbial community have been found to be correlated with ec organic matter tp do and tn feng et al 2022 this suggests microbial adaptation to changing conditions riverine dissolved ghg nutrient and chemical concentrations all increased from source to sea in line with the increasing percentage of urban and agricultural land cover the increase in ghg concentrations between the semi natural and urban environment was on average three times higher for n2o and co2 but twenty times higher for ch4 suggesting the significant nature of ch4 as an urban marker while there were few significant correlations for any ghgs in the upper catchment in the lower urban catchment strong correlations occurred between all ghgs and water physiochemical properties suggesting that removal of contaminates from river systems could lower ghg concentrations three main anthropogenic sources were identified that increased ghgs these included 1 uww outflows as a major point source of both ch4 linked to tp and tdn and n2o linked to tdn 2 mw outflows as a major point source of ch4 and co2 emanating from groundwater interacting with disused coal mines and 3 agricultural activities as a major diffuse source of n2o linked to tdn additionally three major hydrological environmental interactions were found that increased ghg concentrations in addition to those directly attributed to the nutrient increases these included 1 low oxygen conditions 2 higher temperatures and 3 changes in river geometry linked to increased water residence times and made it challenging to attribute causes absolutely 4 2 high nutrient residence time interactions promote ghg generation once the availability of tdn is accounted for n2o tdn neither tw in the range 0 22⁰c or do 90 have significant effects on n2o concentration however where water residence time increases tw and do appear significant in low flow situations residence time is further increased decreasing do and providing more time for temperatures to increase in summer both this increased residence time zarnetske et al 2011 and low oxygen level frey et al 2020 rosamond et al 2012 will act to increase n2o by promoting dentification and increasing the proportion of n2o per unit tdn in the upper clyde catchment ch4 concentrations are low and highly variable with higher ch4 observed with elevated doc occurring in high flow events suggesting doc availability may be limiting ch4 however in the lower urban catchment ch4 is strongly positively correlated to tw tp tdn and dic and negatively correlated with flow and do this point source ch4 generation is over 20 times higher than that derived from diffuse sources generation of ch4 in the lower urban catchment may be linked to eutrophication nutrient enrichment our suva254 values show a shift in riverine oc sources toward a more microbial and algal origin as has been found as human disturbance increases lambert et al 2017 high ch4 in many shallow lakes is produced by eutrophication mostly driven by tp and tdn enrichment and sediment microbiome davidson et al 2018 aben et al 2017 nijman et al 2022 this mechanism is less likely in river ecosystem due to continual flushing but during low water levels increased residence times in combination with the high nutrient concentrations from uww appear responsible for eutrophication and significant ch4 generation this may be enabled by electron donor availability in the receiving waters this effect was most exacerbated when water residence times were further increased by the flow restriction at the tidal weir 4 3 main uncertainty in the causes of ghg variation greenhouse gas concentrations were inversely correlated with river oxygenation this correlation was influenced by several mechanisms where the dominance changed with position in the catchment high turbulence caused oxygenation of the water and outgassing of the supersaturated ghgs respiration photosynthesis and decomposition can create inverse relationships between oxygen and co2 dependant on their balance in the water column aho et al 2021 low oxygen conditions can result in anaerobic condition promoting both methanogenesis and denitrification which increase ch4 and n2o production respectively from the available resources while turbulence outgasses ghgs to atmosphere it also produces conditions less likely to promote ch4 and n2o production making it difficult to fully distinguish the mechanisms the lower urban river has the highest correlations with ghgs increasing exponentially with reducing oxygen levels the oxygen concentration primarily influences ch4 while co2 and n2o are influenced by the do ch4 r2 0 45 co2 r2 0 74 n2o r2 0 24 p value 0 001 suggesting ch4 generation is less influenced by temperature summer seasonal changes impact both temperature and rainfall which together impact ghg concentrations lower rainfall reduces river flow and diffuse nutrients inputs and increases the impact of point source inputs higher temperatures reduce the available oxygen due to reduced solubility and can increase microbial activity as flow and temperature are often highly correlated this can make distinguishing these mechanisms difficult many researchers suggest temperature is a major effect wang et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 and rosentreter et al 2021 however this study found that the size of the impact of flow and temperature on ghg concentrations is dependant on the location in the catchment and specifically the balance between diffuse and point source inputs the upper catchment is dominated by diffuse inputs which increase in higher flow and correspond to an increase in ghg concentrations the lower urban catchments is dominated by point source inputs and corresponds to an increase in ghg concentrations with low flow flow and hence nutrient concentrations being more significant than direct impact of temperature in accounting for ghg variability after flow tp is the major influence on ch4 and tdn on n2o the use of the load appointment model to distinguish between points and diffuse sources of ghgs and nutrients suggests that nutrients however they are delivered are dominating ghg production fully distinguishing between temperature and flow impacts would require longer data set with more instances of high flow during the summer changes in river geometry that reduce river velocity and increase water residence times also cause deposition of sediments and nutrients and reduce oxygen saturation river sections with increased residence time exhibited higher ghg concentrations with the largest increases occurring in low flow conditions however proportioning the cause of this increase between increased residence time reduced outgassing due to lower turbulence lower oxygen conditions or deposition of sediments and nutrients as a source of ghg production is challenging these higher residence time river sections act as point source locations for ghg generation compared to the surrounding river with ch4 concentrations showing the most significant increase suggesting the creation of anaerobic sediments may be the most significant impact our results show an increase in ghgs particularly ch4 in the receiving river after uwwtps with the riverine ch4 concentrations dominated by point source characteristics pointing to the uwwtp inflows as causal uwwtp generate ch4 in locations such as sewer pipes and primary sedimentation although ch4 was not noted as discharged in effluent water masuda et al 2018 we made measurements of ghg concentrations in some uwwtps outflows which were low in dissolved ghg including ch4 and this suggested that ch4 was generated within the receiving river due to changes in the river physicochemical properties including nutrient availability rather than transferred from the uwwtp however we made insufficient measurements in uwwtp outflows due to their inaccessibility to confirm this absolutely unexplained ch4 concentrations in the stream sections after uww treatments works in southwest germany were attributed to in water generation due to additional organic carbon load in the effluent water alshboul et al 2016 after hydrology was accounted for tp also dominated by point source characteristics had the highest correlation with unexplained ch4 concentrations tp r2 0 59 at c26 although this correlation changed with proximity to uwwtp other authors indicated correlations between tp and ch4 concentrations in urban settings usually by impacting microbial activity zhang et al 2021 martinez cruz et al 2017 hao et al 2021 4 4 carbon dioxide concentration variability reduced by carbonate buffering concentrations of co2 were less variable than those of n2o and ch4 mostly driven by diffuse sources with point source inflows associated with tributaries receiving mw causing short term co2 increases in stream mineralization of doc the most likely generation mechanism for the consistent super saturation of co2 would require a constant input of carbon to sustain co2 supersaturation levels winterdahl et al 2016 doc concentrations varied little through the catchment emanating from diffuse input while dic increased from source to sea dominated by mw inflows these mw inflows added significant amounts of dic from the dissolution of limestone producing high alkalinity and many dissolved contaminates the mw inflows are supersaturated with co2 which outgases very rapidly in treatment cascades or headwater streams this rapid outgassing was observed to shift the ph upwards creating a new carbonate equilibrium this changing equilibration would convert some of the remaining co2 to bicarbonate rather than emitting it to the atmosphere thus reducing the gradient of co2 across the air water interface stets et al 2017 aquatic primary productivity produces oxygen and consumes co2 however primary productivity can be maintained with diminished co2 in high alkalinity waters by converting bicarbonate to co2 to support productivity aho et al 2021 conversely mineralisation of doc to co2 would change the carbonate balance increasing bicarbonate concentrations it is likely that this significant carbonate buffering available in the clyde is responsible for the low variability in co2 concentrations and the reason why nutrients rather than carbon availability appear to influence co2 concentrations 4 5 acid mine inflows are a major source of ghg in the middle and lower catchment tributaries high concentrations of both co2 and ch4 occurred linked to outflows from disused coal mine adits where carbonate rock is present and much coal bearing strata in the uk is associated with carboniferous limestone british geological survey 2022 the sulphuric acid generated in the mine dissolves the calcium carbonate to produce co2 hedin and hedin 2016 vesper et al 2016 jarvis 2006 details of ch4 released in mw have not to our knowledge been published most ghgs from mw had out gassed before reaching the river clyde however high co2 and ch4 concentrations in t10 were traced back to several mw inflows these mw inflows had high concentrations of dic so4 2 ca2 mg2 and k which together acted as a marker for legacy coal mining many other mw sources were traced in the catchment with this marker although not included within this publication despite the focus on measuring doc in rivers our data suggest that for the river clyde carbon loss is dominated by dic with the annual dic export approximately double that for doc comparison with other riverine studies demonstrated that dic is the major component of the dissolved carbon in uk rivers with dic accounting for 70 to 80 of carbon loss table 6 our results suggest that the anthropogenic impacts of disused coal mines are accelerating carbon loss 4 6 legacy industry is still detectable in our rivers other increases in ion concentrations and ph were identified in the three most urban tributaries t19 t22 and t23 urban tributaries t19 and t22 had the highest concentrations of dic so4 2 ca2 mg2 and k attributed to inflows of mw from legacy coal mining both tributaries had legacy iron or steel making near to the rivers and may have iron slag buried within the catchment historic environment scotland 2022 steel slag is known to increase ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration riley and mayes 2015 the urban tributary t23 had the highest concentrations of na and so4 2 probably associated with leachate from legacy paper production skinner 1939 t22 also experienced the highest na and cl ion concentrations in the winter likely from winter road salting as this tributary has the biggest road network including a motorway data suggests that road drainage is entering the river directly adding an estimated 15 mg yr 1 of nacl 5 conclusions 5 1 benefits of a source to sea approach in interpreting riverine ghgs we have used the clyde catchment with its transitioning land cover from semi natural through agricultural and legacy industrial to highly urban as a source to sea study to support identification of ghg sources this source to sea investigative approach was found effective in tracing how changes in the nature and size of the riverine environment impacted ghg concentrations particularly as ghgs were not conserved but outgased in turbulent riverine sections this variable outgassing makes correlations on a catchment scale misleading and is probably one reason for the high variability in ghg to nutrient relationships reported in the literature a key aspect of ghg source identification included the use of load appointment modelling to distinguish point and diffuse sources by their degree of dependence on flow this was effective in confirming diffuse ghg sources from agriculture and point ghg sources from uww and mw this load appointment modelling approach enabled two main seasonal impacts high temperature and low water levels to be distinguished analysis suggested that the impact of low water levels dominated over temperature change and failure to account for changing water levels with their implications for oxygen and residence times may account for some of the variability in the impact of temperature on ghg generation reported in the literature measurement of a high number of water physiochemical properties allowed source fingerprinting of different inflows which enabled detection even when the inflows were not physically identified supporting identification of contamination from legacy industry results suggested that outflows from uww treatment plants caused generation of ghg within the riverine water column changes in the seasonal pattern of ghg generation associated with urban wastewater inflows could be due to changes in microbial community structure eutrophication at low water levels and supported by the availability of electron donors and acceptors in receiving waters this was not confirmed as part of this study and it is suggested that future surveys should be designed to quantify in water generation resulting from mixing of uww and riverine water the most important anthropogenic ghg from inland waters is ch4 rosentreter et al 2021 but ch4 outgases the most rapidly due to its high concentration to solubility ratio as such catchment scale analysis can be misleading improved methods to detect and quantify ch4 concentrations are required a drone mounted ch4 sensor might be effective in identifying point sources while continuous in situ ch4 measurements would better define source flow relationships although sensor reliability and sensitivity needs improvement where the source of nutrient pollution is unclear human tracers such as caffeine could be applied to support understanding of contributions to nutrient pollution mizukawa et al 2019 and chen et al 2002 5 2 implications and ideas for policy makers to effectively reduce anthropogenic ghgs from the riverine environment it is important to understand their sources for the river clyde uww outflows were a major point source of both anthropogenic ch4 and n2o mw outflows a major point source of anthropogenic ch4 and co2 and agricultural activities including field and farmyard run off and poorly maintained septic tanks septic tank are not effective in removing nitrogen and phosphorous o keeffe et al 2015 were a source of anthropogenic n2o all sources of ghgs were associated with high concentrations of nutrients hence reducing nutrient loading industrial and legacy contamination and agricultural run off would ultimately act to reduce ghgs within riverine environments pollution point sources are easier to tackle as the location of the inflows are known while many uwwtp in the clyde have phosphorous removal our measurements suggest that levels of effectiveness vary between plants suggesting improvement is possible additionally none of the uwwtp in this area have nitrogen removal european commission directorate general environment 2016 riverine environments with low oxygenation increased river residence times and high levels of nitrogen should be prioritised for nitrogen removal from uwwtp to have the largest impact on n2o reduction urban influences may have stimulated adaptation in microbial communities further increasing ghg production and further studies of microbial activity may support ghg reduction nitrogen capture at uwwtp could ultimately act as an important source of fertiliser avoiding outflows to the environment van der hoek et al 2018 mine water is more difficult to tackle in terms of ghg generation as ghgs are generated below ground with the generation mechanism poorly understood while agricultural pollution was primarily from diffuse sources additional measurements showed a significant proportion entered the clyde via the numerous field drainage ditches and small streams which could be treated as point sources approaches to reduce run off may include 1 use freshwater wetlands for nitrogen and phosphorus removal land et al 2016 and wetlands have been shown as effective for diffuse run off ockenden et al 2012 2 use of biochar filtration an effective technology for both cleaning of wastewater and run off water its capabilities include removal of pesticides organic chemicals and nutrients however a practical approach for application to small streams is needed after use the biochar could be redeployed onto farmland supporting carbon sequestration and a circular economy recycling nutrients and further preventing run off catizzone et al 2021 phillips et al 2022 kamali et al 2021 3 riparian buffer zones are recommended between crops and rivers in scotland general binding rule 20 requires a buffer strip at least 2 m wide to be left between surface waters and wetlands and cultivated land sepa 2009 this rule was not set with the objective of reducing nutrient leeching further research demonstrates that woody vegetation is more effective than shrubs or grass at preventing nutrient leaching to rivers with a 60 m buffer strip effectively removing all nutrients aguiar et al 2015 while this would take considerable agricultural land approximately 70 of nutrients are removed by a 12 m strip which would also stabilise river banks reduce erosion and sediment loss increase biodiversity and provide shade making the riverine system more robust to climate change cole et al 2020 declaration of competing

14841,algal extracellular organic matter eom a major fraction of the dissolved organic matter found in eutrophic plateau lakes can act as a photosensitizer to drive the abiotic oxidation of mn ii this process has the potential to generate reactive mn iii and influence the fate of organic pollutants in this study the photodegradation of 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in the presence of mn ii and eom was investigated with emphasis on the photogeneration mechanism of mn iii the results indicated that mn ii can accelerate ee2 photodegradation in eom solution owing to the photogeneration of reactive mn iii and the enhancement was greater at higher mn ii concentrations the generation of reactive mn iii was mainly attributable to the action of superoxide radical generated by photosensitization of eom in addition the photodegradation of ee2 was slower at higher ph possibly because of the deactivation of mn iii under alkaline conditions single electron transfer was an indispensable process in the photodegradation the differences in fluorophore content ph and no3 concentrations are all important determinants for ee2 photodegradation in natural waters the information obtained in this research would contribute to the understanding of reactions between mn ii and eom and provide new insights into the behaviors of reactive mn iii in eutrophic water irradiated by sunlight graphical abstract

dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water eutrophication has become a worldwide environmental problem which usually occurs in estuarine coastal marine and lakes conley et al 2009 nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates over enriched can lead to algal blooms and ph changes cai et al 2011 cui et al 2021 generally the main bloom forming cyanobacteria in estuarine and marine ecosystems are nodularia spumigena and trichodesmium while in lakes it is often microcystis aeruginosa huisman et al 2018 these algae will increase turbidity deplete dissolved oxygen and secrete cyanotoxins that cause liver and digestive diseases in organisms merel et al 2013 scheffer et al 1993 also a large amount of algal organic matter aom including extracellular organic matter eom excreted through cell metabolism and intracellular organic matter from cell decay can be released into water environment fang et al 2010 that can also affect the migration and transformation of pollutants for example aom has a significant binding affinity for metals such as cd ii mn ii iii and fe iii freire nordi et al 2005 liu et al 2015 yan et al 2017 through ion exchange complexation and precipitation naveed et al 2019 the complexation of aom and organic pollutants such as estrogens can stimulate their biodegradation bai et al 2019 further eom exhibits pronounced photochemical activity zhang et al 2022 generating photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as triplet state 3eom hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 which effectively degrade organic pollutants estrogens for instance wu et al 2021 estrogens mostly enter surface waters in the effluent of sewage treatment plants desbrow et al 1998 however in typical eutrophic plateau lakes such as dianchi lake in yunnan china the estrogen content such as 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 was much lower than the level discharge from local sewage treatment plants would be expected to create huang et al 2013 some were being biodegraded and the photochemical activity of dissolved organic matter dom and other aquatic components was in part responsible zuo et al 2013 generally the dom in a eutrophic lake is most formed from the biota e g algae and aquatic plants in situ li et al 2020 suggesting that aom released by algal blooms is an important contributor to the composition and photochemical activity of dom additionally previous studies have documented an interaction between algal blooms and manganese content eom deposited in sediments can reduce any mn iv oxides present causing the release of soluble mn ii kowalski et al 2009 tang et al 2021 this process can form metal ligand complexes and affect the fate of pollutants wan et al 2022 since mn is an important redox active element it can participate in a wide range of redox reactions with inorganic and organic compounds butterfield et al 2013 myers and nealson 1988 which plays a prominent role in aquatic system photochemistry hu et al 2017 marafatto et al 2015 nico et al 2002 therefore the reactions of eom and soluble mn ii in eutrophic plateau lakes are a topic of practical as well as scientific importance mn ii is the most stable and widespread form of soluble manganese in natural waters luther 2005 with concentrations typically ranging from 0 01 to 58 7 μm madison et al 2013 malcolm williams et al 2012 nico et al 2002 oldham et al 2015 molecular orbital theory confirms that the electron donor orbital dx2 y2 and acceptor orbital dz2 of mn ii and mn iv are spatially distinct indicating that one electron transfer occurs in the oxidation of mn ii and the reduction of mn iv with the formation of mn iii as intermediate luther 2005 morgan 2005 natural mn iii can be produced by the biotic or abiotic oxidation of mn ii bacterial enzymes webb et al 2005 any humic substances present and light irradiation hansard et al 2011 nico et al 2002 can all be involved in the oxidation moreover mn iii has been directly detected in the black sea up to 5 0 μm and sediment porewaters of the lower st lawrence estuary up to 82 0 μm madison et al 2013 trouwborst et al 2006 notably intermediate mn iii can be rapidly stabilized by inorganic ligands e g pyrophosphate pp and organic ligands e g dom to form mn iii complexes oldham et al 2017 their ligand metal electron transfer processes can affect the fate of pollutants in natural waters in addition mn iii usually acts as an oxidant to oxidize organic pollutants and participates in the carbon cycle in natural water environments because of the similarity of its redox potential with that of dissolved oxygen hu et al 2017 kostka et al 1995 lu et al 2021 shao et al 2022 wang et al 2023 researchers have reported the enhanced removal of various phenolic pollutants by mn iii in the presence of dom and visible light wang et al 2018a yao et al 2020 however eom usually exhibits lower specific uv absorbance displays stronger fluorescence and contains more protein like and less humic substances than dom henderson et al 2008 tenorio et al 2017 suggesting a difference in photo reactivity whereas the importance of interaction between dom and metal ions in aquatic environments has long been recognized engebretson and von wandruszka 1994 gao et al 2015 yan and korshin 2014 the information about the photochemical processes involving eom and mn ii is still inadequate it is thus important to investigate the reactions between mn ii and eom and how mn ii may alter the environmental behavior of organic pollutants under sunlight irradiation in eutrophic plateau lakes this study aimed to explore the photodegradation of ee2 in the presence of mn ii and eom under irradiation with emphasis on the formation mechanisms of reactive mn iii and ppris firstly the degradation kinetics of ee2 were examined at environmentally relevant mn ii and eom concentrations the reaction mechanisms were investigated in reactive species quenching experiments secondly mn iii formation mechanism and the factors influencing the yield were also explored through quenching and condition experiments then the degradation intermediates of ee2 were identified by a liquid chromatograph quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer lc q tof ms to propose the possible reaction pathways finally mn ii and eom cooperatively mediating ee2 photodegradation was verified in natural water to better estimate the photochemical behavior of mn ii and eom under natural environmental conditions it is expected that the information obtained in this study would contribute to the understanding of the environmental behaviors of mn ii and trace organic pollutants in the eutrophic water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the eom used in this study was extracted from cultured microcystis aeruginosa the cultivation and extraction methods are detailed in text s1 ee2 c20h24o2 98 0 and sodium pyrophosphate tetrabasic 95 0 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa manganese sulfate monohydrate 99 0 was obtained from aladdin china additional reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 photochemical degradation of ee2 all the experiments involving illumination were performed in quartz tubes in an xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china equipped with cutoff filters λ 290 nm and a 300 w mercury lamp the effects of initial mn ii concentrations 0 50 0 μm and ph 6 0 9 0 on the photodegradation of ee2 1 0 mg l i e 3 37 μm mediated by eom were explored according to the concentration of dom in surface water 1 0 20 0 mgc l of eom was chosen to explore the influence on ee2 photodegradation gooddy and hinsby 2008 nogueira et al 2017 the effects of cl no3 and so4 2 5 0 50 0 mg l on ee2 photodegradation mediated by mn ii and eom were also investigated before each experiment the solution of mn ii and eom was thoroughly mixed by stirring for 12 h with exposure to air while kept in the dark at suitable intervals in the illumination experiments the reaction solution 0 5 ml was collected in brown sample vials for the determination of unreacted ee2 unless otherwise specified the experimental conditions were ee2 3 37 μm mn ii 25 0 μm eom 5 0 mgc l ph 6 0 all the experiments in this study were conducted in triplicate and the error bars were provided 2 2 2 identification of reactive species the major ppris were determined through scavenging experiments in mn ii and eom mixtures under irradiation first a series of concentrations of sorbic acid sa furfuryl alcohol ffa tert butyl alcohol tba and p benzoquinone bq were tested to identify their optimum concentrations these certain concentrations of scavengers were then used to investigate the effects of 3eom 1o2 oh and o2 buxton et al 1988 greenstock and ruddock 1976 haag and hoigne 1986 on ee2 degradation second the concentrations of 3eom 1o2 and oh were determined using 40 0 μm 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp 50 0 μm ffa and 150 0 μm terephthalic acid tpa respectively moreover to trap o2 50 0 μm of 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium 5 carboxanilide xtt was utilized as described in previous studies sutherland and learmonth 1997 to identify the role of reactive mn iii on ee2 degradation pp 5 0 mm was utilized to scavenge and complex mn iii since pp can preferentially complex with mn iii to form a stable mn iii pp complex log kapp 31 35 which is strongly colored in the uv visible region λ 258 nm ε 6750 m 1 webb et al 2005 results are shown in fig s1 in addition it has been confirmed that pp does not participate in the reaction and only tends to form a stable mn iii pp complex see figs s2 and s3 in this study 2 2 3 photogeneration mechanism of mn iii in mn ii and eom mixture three types of scavengers 200 0 μm ffa 50 0 μm tba and 30 0 μm bq were added to solutions that contained mn ii eom and pp to identify the formation mechanism of soluble mn iii the effects of initial ph 6 0 9 0 and no3 concentration on mn iii generation were also explored the reaction solution was sampled at suitable time intervals and their absorbances at 258 nm were immediately measured using a uv 2600 spectrograph from shimadzu japan the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 100 0 mm was used to examine o2 and oh in the mixtures of mn ii and eom burns et al 2012 after irradiation the signals of dmpo and o2 adduct dmpo ooh or dmpo and oh adduct dmpo oh were determined using a bruker a300 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer germany an agent 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 200 0 μm was applied to trap 1o2 haag and hoigne 1986 in the mn ii and eom mixtures which can form a temp and 1o2 adduct tempo 2 2 4 photodegradation of ee2 in natural waters three different types of natural water matrixes including lake water dianchi lake kunming china river water panlong river kunming and effluent kunming no 4 sewage treatment plant were used to examine ee2 photodegradation behavior these water matrixes were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber membranes waterman maidstone uk before use the water quality parameters are listed in table 1 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of ee2 tmp ffa and 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2h tpa formed from tpa were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 1260 series agilent usa equipped with a c18 reversed phase separation column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size and a fluorescence or an ultraviolet detector the concentration of the xtt formazan was measured using uv vis spectra at 475 nm the detailed detection methods and the calculation of ppris are explained in text s2 and the mobile phase settings for the reagents are shown in table s1 the concentration of eom was quantified using a total organic carbon toc analyzer elementar vario toc cube elementar germany acid base titration of eom was used to calculate the content of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eems f 7000 hitachi limited japan and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir varian 640 ir usa were used to characterize the properties of the eom the mn ii and eom mixture that after 120 min reaction was freeze dried to measure the valence states of manganese by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha usa and epr was used to detect o2 oh and 1o2 the lc q tof ms agilent 6500 series usa was used to identify the products of ee2 and the gradient elution conditions are listed in table s2 the contents of anions and toc in natural water samples were measured by an ion chromatography ic 2800 east and west analysis china and a toc analyzer respectively further inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icap 6300 thermo scientific usa was used to measure the metal ions in natural water samples all the details of these analyses are set out in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of coexisting mn ii and eom on ee2 photodegradation initially the individual effects of mn ii and eom on ee2 photodegradation were evaluated see fig 1a the results indicated that soluble mn ii alone caused no significant ee2 degradation under irradiation whereas eom alone led to a considerable enhancement of ee2 degradation this observation corroborates the findings of zhang s group 2022 the combined effects of mn ii and eom on ee2 photodegradation by varying their concentrations were further investigated and some interesting phenomena appear see figs 1a and 1b when 5 0 50 0 μm mn ii and 5 0 mgc l eom were simultaneously present the photodegradation of ee2 was enhanced over the rate with eom alone by 15 5 1 3 to 48 4 4 5 calculated by specific kobs fig 1a the photogenerated reactive mn iii was probably the cause the eom ligands serve to stabilize mn iii resulting in the formation of relatively long lived mn iii eom complexes these complexes may act as important oxidants in the degradation of ee2 while solid mno2 phases have often been assumed to be common oxidation products of mn ii previous studies have shown that in the presence of organic ligands mn ii is primarily oxidized to form ligand bound mn iii complexes rather than mn iv kostka et al 1995 nico et al 2002 this suggests that mn ii is expected to undergo oxidation to form mn iii eom in the current system notably the fastest decay of ee2 was observed with the simultaneous presence of 25 0 μm mn ii and 5 0 mgc l eom while the observed enhancement decreased as mn ii concentrations exceeded 25 0 μm it can be predicted that there may have a critical concentration of mn ii in the enhanced degradation of ee2 as wang et al 2018a reported the quenching effect of triplet state dom by mn ii may be negligible at a concentration less than 25 0 μm but high concentrations of mn ii 100 0 μm can obviously quench triplet state dom thereby inhibiting the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species moreover as shown in fig 1b it was observed that the rate of ee2 photodegradation decreased with the increase of the mixtures eom concentrations 5 0 mgc l this could be due to the quenching effect of high eom concentrations leading to the deactivation of ppris such as 3eom oh and 1o2 janssen et al 2014 taken together these results suggest synergy among irradiation mn ii and eom in promoting ee2 photodegradation fig 1c illustrates the dependence of ee2 photodegradation on the initial ph the photodegradation proceeded faster in acidic conditions than in alkaline conditions potentially attributed to the higher reactivity of mn iii in acidic environments relative to alkaline environments qin et al 2021 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2014 further the solutions ph dropped more during irradiation under alkaline conditions see fig s4 an additional experiment confirmed that the ph drops primarily resulted from the oxidation of mn ii and photolysis of eom fig s5 mn iii is known to be unstable in solution and prone to hydrolysis eq 1 wells and davies 1965 and higher rates of disproportionation for mn iii eq 2 davies 1969 have been observed under alkaline conditions sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 also the consumption of mn iii by ee2 may produce mn ii and hydrogen ions wang et al 2018b leading to decreasing ph values 1 mn iii 2 h 2 o mnoh aq 2 h 3 o k 0 88 0 04 2 2 mn iii 2 h 2 o mn ii mn o 2 s 4 h log k 7 9 generally ubiquitous anions such as cl no3 and so4 2 may affect ee2 degradation mediated by mn ii and eom mixture as shown in fig 1d so4 2 and cl have negligible effects on the photodegradation but the higher concentration of no3 the faster decay of ee2 no3 can promote the photochemical oxidation of trace organic compounds in natural water by generating ppris through its absorption at long wavelength bands barat et al 1970 zepp et al 1987 thus it can be inferred that any no3 present can affect the photodegradation of ee2 and the oxidation of mn ii in eutrophic water 3 2 reactive species in irradiated mn ii and eom mixtures 3 2 1 identification of ppris the possible ppris that caused ee2 photodegradation in the mixtures of mn ii and eom were recognized with the assistance of the quenchers fig 2a the optimum concentrations of sa 150 0 μm ffa 200 0 μm tba 50 0 μm and bq 30 0 μm were determined through scavenging experiments figs s6 to s9 the concentrations of ppris were calculated through fig s10 and the results are shown in fig 2b as illustrated in fig 2a the addition of sa ffa or bq significantly inhibited ee2 photodegradation ffa had more impact than sa which was more inhibiting than bq indicating that 1o2 3eom and o2 were the main ppris involved tba caused a comparatively minor decrease suggesting that oh was not primarily responsible for ee2 degradation further fig 2b shows the high concentrations of 1o2 2 31 10 7 μm 3eom 1 49 10 7 μm and oh 1 35 10 7 μm in the eom solutions they indicate the strong photo reactivity of eom which cannot be ignored in eutrophic water it is worth noting that the concentrations of these ppris decreased with mn ii present indicating they were possibly consumed by mn ii to form reactive mn iii 3 2 2 reactive mn iii since the presence of mn ii can enhance ee2 photodegradation in eom solutions predicting that considerable reactive mn iii may be generated as is confirmed in fig 2a the addition of pp can significantly suppress ee2 photodegradation also indicating that reactive mn iii played a considerable role in the reaction mn iii formed gradually during irradiation at ph 6 0 fig 2c with a maximum conversion of 57 20 however the formation of mn iii was quite different in the presence or absence of ee2 a lower concentration of mn iii was measured in the presence of ee2 fig 2c this observation was further supported by additional experiments see fig s11 which revealed a minor degradation of ee2 in mn iii pp and eom mixtures these results suggest that an outer sphere electron transfer klewicki and morgan 1998 between mn iii pp and ee2 may occur leading to a bit lower concentration of mn iii moreover there was no mn iii generated without a photosensitizer eom in this case during irradiation fig 2c since all the d orbitals of mn ii are single electron occupied diem and stumm 1984 which is spin forbidden in quantum mechanical principles that stable configuration is rather difficult to destroy without a photosensitizer lu et al 2021 xps experiments showed that the partitioning of manganese in the irradiated mn ii and eom mixtures was 51 09 mn ii 43 33 mn iii and 5 58 mn iv fig 2d the presence of mn iv can be considered as evidence of the hydrolysis of mn iii and it could be speculated that more mn iv would be generated without strong ligands and with longer irradiation 3 3 reactive mn iii formation mechanisms 3 3 1 effects of ppris on mn iii generation to explore the mechanisms of reactive mn iii generation three scavengers were added to mn ii and eom mixtures the control group was the mixture without any scavengers as indicated in fig 3a the presence of the scavengers inhibited mn iii formation adding ffa suppressed mn iii generation slightly indicating a minor contribution of 1o2 tba and bq reduced mn iii concentration by 25 4 and 77 3 respectively these results indicated that o2 was mainly responsible for mn ii oxidation followed by oh and 1o2 further the influence of dissolved oxygen on mn iii generation are shown in fig 3b the mn iii concentration generated under air was much higher than that under nitrogen given the crucial role of dissolved oxygen in photochemical processes and its reaction with 3eom can generate various reactive oxygen species amon and benner 1996 cooper et al 1988 it is unsurprising that there is a notable accumulation of mn iii under air condition however it is worth noting that the level of mn iii remains relatively high even under nitrogen potentially owing to the influence of 3eom in this instance the 3eom may serve as an electron acceptor ma et al 2020 and facilitate the electron transfer process with mn ii directly rather than engaging in a reaction with dissolved oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species that subsequently react with mn ii wang et al 2018a therefore it can be predicted that in eutrophic shallow waters considerable reactive mn iii would be produced under sunlight irradiation which can affect the fate of trace organic pollutants 3 3 2 reactions between mn ii and o2 or oh probe dmpo was used to explain the possible reaction between mn ii and o2 or oh in the epr experiments the signals of the dmpo ooh peak dmpo oh peak and tempo peak were detected fig 4a in the eom solution after irradiation all three peaks were attenuated with the addition of mn ii fig 4b although the direct reaction between mn ii and 1o2 has not been reported the decreased tempo peak intensity 1o2 steady state concentration fig 2b after adding mn ii and mn iii concentration after quenching 1o2 fig 3a indicated that 1o2 may participate in mn iii generation indirectly through other pathways furthermore the decrease in the intensity of the dmpo ooh peak and the concentration of xtt formazan shown in fig s10d demonstrated that mn ii can react with o2 previous studies have reported rate constants for the reaction of mn ii with o2 1 08 107 m 1 s 1 learman et al 2013 and with oh k 3 40 107 m 1 s 1 pick kaplan and rabani 1976 were of the same order of magnitude but the much longer diffusion length and half life of o2 seconds compared to oh nanoseconds levy et al 2019 may be responsible for its larger contribution to mn iii generation the observed phenomena suggest that the generation of mn iii in this study was mainly attributed to o2 followed by oh and 1o2 which is consistent with the previous discussion 3 3 3 effects of initial ph on mn iii photogeneration since the ph of natural waters will be significantly affected by algal blooming cui et al 2021 huisman et al 2018 the influence of initial ph on mn iii generation in the mn ii and eom mixtures was also explored see fig 5a the formation rate of mn iii varied at different ph but the mn iii concentrations eventually achieved were the same speculating that some sort of dynamic balance was achieved with increased irradiation time some scholars have also reported that mn iii generation in the presence of ligands was not ph dependent wang et al 2018b furthermore the presence of pp was observed to stabilize the ph of the reaction solutions compared fig 5b with fig s4 which supported the view that the decrease in solution ph was due primarily to the hydrolysis of mn iii or the consumption of mn iii by ee2 in the previous discussion 3 3 4 effects of no3 on mn iii photogeneration based on previous discussion it was found that no3 can promote ee2 photodegradation mediated by mn ii and eom mixtures predicting that no3 may also affect the generation of mn iii fig 6a confirms that no3 can promote the photogeneration of mn iii in mn ii and eom mixtures and such promotion increases with no3 concentration an additional experiment was performed to further understand the promotion effect of no3 as shown in fig 6b the absorbance of the reaction solution at 258 nm increased gradually with irradiation time indicating the formation of the mn iii pp complex resulting from no3 photolysis with the formed mn iii being approximately 4 3 μm a previous study reported that no3 photolysis generates o2 which can assist the fast abiotic oxidation of mn ii to mn iv oxide with mn iii as an intermediate jung et al 2017 therefore it seems that no3 plays an important role in the photodegradation of ee2 and the oxidation of mn ii in eutrophic water 3 3 5 responsible photosensitive substances of eom on mn iii generation 3d eems ftir and acid base titration were used to identify the possible substances or functional groups of eom involved in mn iii generation as is confirmed in fig s12 the eom mainly contained tryptophan and protein like substances ex 275 em 330 nm and small amounts of tyrosine ex 230 em 330 nm xu and jiang 2013 all fluorescence intensities of these substances decreased significantly after irradiation indicating the consumption of potential photosensitive substances in eom fig s12a and c together show no fluorescence quenching effect of eom by 25 0 μm mn ii additionally the fluorescence intensity of the mixture was higher than that of the eom solution after irradiation fig s12b and d suggesting that mn ii may protect eom from photobleaching the ftir spectra show that the absorbance of c oh extension 1153 cm 1 and c o extension 1780 cm 1 minor and stephens 2008 decreased after the reaction fig 7a indicating the consumption of phenolic hydroxyl from 33 00 to 31 00 μmol mgc and carboxyl from 50 50 to 47 50 μmol mgc fig 7b perhaps the consumption of these functional groups suggested that they were the potential photosensitive groups or were degraded in the strongly oxidizing system 3 3 6 proposed mn iii photogeneration mechanism the irradiation of eom can generate ppris like 3eom eom 1o2 o2 hydrogen peroxide and oh clark and zika 2000 dalrymple et al 2010 gao et al 2022 zafiriou 1977 scheme 1 summarizes some possible generation pathways of the ppris and mn iii by either energy transfer or charge electron transfer reactions eom can be excited by photon absorption and transformed into an excited singlet state 1eom step 1 3eom was then generated by the 1eom via intersystem crossing step 2 through step 3 the 3eom can oxidize h2o to form oh as well as through the chain reactions from o2 to h2o2 and then the photolysis of h2o2 to oh step 10 moreover the formed 3eom can also react with o2 to form 1o2 through energy transfer step 5 and 1o2 could be further converted to o2 by step 6 as for the charge transfer processes the direct charge transfer that occurred in eom under irradiation can form an intramolecular charge transfer state eom eom step 8 eom can also be produced by intramolecular electron transfer from 1eom and 3eom steps 11 and 12 then the reaction between eom and o2 produces o2 via electron transfer step 9 although there were various pathways to generate ppris from eom the direct ones that were responsible for the oxidation of mn ii to form mn iii were mainly through o2 and oh steps 4 and 7 3 4 proposed ee2 photodegradation pathways the intermediate products of ee2 degraded by the mn ii and eom mixture under irradiation were identified through lc q tof ms which allowed proposing their structures because of the accurate mass determinations for the molecular ions the difference between the theoretical and experimental masses was 5 0 ppm or less the extracted ion current chromatograms of ee2 and different intermediates at different reaction times are displayed in fig s13 and their errors with theoretical masses are calculated in table s3 according to the reactive species and products identified in the reaction system three main possible reaction pathways including hydroxylation dehydrogenation and single electron transfer of ee2 were proposed as detailed in fig 8 the loss of the hydroxyl group from c17 of ee2 formed product a the hydroxylation that occurred in the c2 position of ee2 was initiated by oh to form product b in pathway i sun et al 2010 it can be oxidized by mn iii to form the free radical intermediate b 1 and then formed product c followed by ring cleavage carp et al 2004 the addition of oh formed intermediate c 1 form which a photo kolbe reaction generated the aliphatic product d carp et al 2004 product d was then oxidized to product e due to dehydrogenation similarly the addition of oh may form intermediate e 1 with which a photo kolbe reaction may occur after that the insertion of oxygen can lead to carbon carbon bond cleavage to form a ketone group which was product f with further oxidation product g may be formed from product f after another ring cleavage turning to pathway ii an analogue of ee2 product h was initially formed by losing a c2h2 moiety he et al 2022 product h is susceptible to three possible degradation pathways in one hydroxylation by oh at the c9 and c11 positions formed product i which was further converted to intermediate i 1 by single electron transfer and then oxidized to product j the addition of hydrogen atoms to the benzene ring can lead to the formation of product k frontistis et al 2012 which can be further oxidized by mn iii through single electron transfer to form product l the five membered ring has a higher tension in such structure β cleavage with hydrogen rearrangement may occur and form product m chen et al 2016 alternatively reactive mn iii can transform product h into intermediate h 1 which can then form product n an isomer of product l in the subsequent reactions product o was formed by the addition of oh to product n after losing a cyclopropanone moiety product p was formed which can be further degraded to product q chen et al 2016 a third possibility is that mn iii may convert ee2 into free radicals by single electron transfer wang et al 2018b for further oxidation as fig 8 shows three types of phenoxyl radicals may be formed by mn iii abstracting an electron from ee2 however the high concentrations of reactive species in the reaction system of this study mean that such single electron transfer and subsequent oxidation need further verification in any case it is safe to say that mn iii plays an important role in the degradation of estrogens and other such products in aquatic environments 3 5 natural water experiments the photodegradation of ee2 was also tested in lake water river water and sewage treatment effluent table 1 lists the water quality parameters the concentrations of ee2 do mn and other metal ions among three natural water samples showed no significant differences which may be negligible for the experiments as is confirmed in fig 9 ee2 photodegradation rate was observed in the order of lake water effluent water river water the presence of mn ii had a promoting effect particularly in lake water since so4 2 and cl were negligible contributors these observations can be attributed to the higher no3 concentration table 1 and fluorophore content fig s14 of the lake water followed by effluent and river water what cannot be denied was that all three types of natural water had a high toc content see table 1 but the quite weak fluorescence intensity fig s14 compared with fresh extracted eom fig s12a indicated their relatively low chromophore content generally uv disinfection in sewage treatment plants or sunlight irradiation reduces the chromophore and fluorophore content mcneill and canonica 2016 wan et al 2020 forming inert dissolved organic carbon species feng et al 2022 given that it seems reasonable that the degradation of ee2 is not high in the presence or absence of mn ii in natural water samples it was eom that accelerated ee2 photodegradation substantially with the presence of mn ii accelerated more both the effectiveness followed the order lake water effluent river water fig 9 the relatively effective removal from the lake water can be attributed primarily to higher fluorophore and no3 content produces more ppris however the total ee2 degraded by the coexistence of mn ii and eom was smaller than the sum of that in the two single systems in natural water possible explanations could be that certain substances in the water compete with ee2 for photogenerated mn iii and or the inert dissolved organic carbon species quench some ppris produced by the eom in addition the ph was always 6 0 in the initial experiments but in natural waters the ph can range from 7 8 to 8 6 table 1 as has been mentioned ee2 in mn ii and eom mixtures degrades faster in acidic conditions see fig 1c in summary then differences in fluorophore content ph and no3 concentration are important determinants of the effectiveness photodegradation in eutrophic plateau lakes while mn ii acts as a facilitated factor 4 conclusions the generation of reactive mn iii was mainly attributed to the fact that eom provides enough o2 to active this process under irradiation the oh and 1o2 meanwhile were also found to be important contributors mn iii was formed gradually in the irradiated mixtures with a maximum conversion of 57 20 and whether dissolved oxygen is present or not mn iii can be generated perhaps due to the presence of other charge transferring substances eom can generate ppris to accelerate the photodegradation of ee2 and if mn ii was also present this process was further enhanced by the photogeneration of reactive mn iii ubiquitous no3 in eutrophic lakes can promote mn iii photogeneration and thus ee2 photodegradation the fluorophore content ph value and no3 concentration were the main determinants of the rate of ee2 photodegradation in eutrophic plateau lakes future studies are warranted to test the algal aom from various sources or different growth periods to explore their effect on the photogeneration and stabilization of mn iii and to further understand this important environmental chemical process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14841,algal extracellular organic matter eom a major fraction of the dissolved organic matter found in eutrophic plateau lakes can act as a photosensitizer to drive the abiotic oxidation of mn ii this process has the potential to generate reactive mn iii and influence the fate of organic pollutants in this study the photodegradation of 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in the presence of mn ii and eom was investigated with emphasis on the photogeneration mechanism of mn iii the results indicated that mn ii can accelerate ee2 photodegradation in eom solution owing to the photogeneration of reactive mn iii and the enhancement was greater at higher mn ii concentrations the generation of reactive mn iii was mainly attributable to the action of superoxide radical generated by photosensitization of eom in addition the photodegradation of ee2 was slower at higher ph possibly because of the deactivation of mn iii under alkaline conditions single electron transfer was an indispensable process in the photodegradation the differences in fluorophore content ph and no3 concentrations are all important determinants for ee2 photodegradation in natural waters the information obtained in this research would contribute to the understanding of reactions between mn ii and eom and provide new insights into the behaviors of reactive mn iii in eutrophic water irradiated by sunlight graphical abstract

et al 2011 cui et al 2021 generally the main bloom forming cyanobacteria in estuarine and marine ecosystems are nodularia spumigena and trichodesmium while in lakes it is often microcystis aeruginosa huisman et al 2018 these algae will increase turbidity deplete dissolved oxygen and secrete cyanotoxins that cause liver and digestive diseases in organisms merel et al 2013 scheffer et al 1993 also a large amount of algal organic matter aom including extracellular organic matter eom excreted through cell metabolism and intracellular organic matter from cell decay can be released into water environment fang et al 2010 that can also affect the migration and transformation of pollutants for example aom has a significant binding affinity for metals such as cd ii mn ii iii and fe iii freire nordi et al 2005 liu et al 2015 yan et al 2017 through ion exchange complexation and precipitation naveed et al 2019 the complexation of aom and organic pollutants such as estrogens can stimulate their biodegradation bai et al 2019 further eom exhibits pronounced photochemical activity zhang et al 2022 generating photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as triplet state 3eom hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 which effectively degrade organic pollutants estrogens for instance wu et al 2021 estrogens mostly enter surface waters in the effluent of sewage treatment plants desbrow et al 1998 however in typical eutrophic plateau lakes such as dianchi lake in yunnan china the estrogen content such as 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 was much lower than the level discharge from local sewage treatment plants would be expected to create huang et al 2013 some were being biodegraded and the photochemical activity of dissolved organic matter dom and other aquatic components was in part responsible zuo et al 2013 generally the dom in a eutrophic lake is most formed from the biota e g algae and aquatic plants in situ li et al 2020 suggesting that aom released by algal blooms is an important contributor to the composition and photochemical activity of dom additionally previous studies have documented an interaction between algal blooms and manganese content eom deposited in sediments can reduce any mn iv oxides present causing the release of soluble mn ii kowalski et al 2009 tang et al 2021 this process can form metal ligand complexes and affect the fate of pollutants wan et al 2022 since mn is an important redox active element it can participate in a wide range of redox reactions with inorganic and organic compounds butterfield et al 2013 myers and nealson 1988 which plays a prominent role in aquatic system photochemistry hu et al 2017 marafatto et al 2015 nico et al 2002 therefore the reactions of eom and soluble mn ii in eutrophic plateau lakes are a topic of practical as well as scientific importance mn ii is the most stable and widespread form of soluble manganese in natural waters luther 2005 with concentrations typically ranging from 0 01 to 58 7 μm madison et al 2013 malcolm williams et al 2012 nico et al 2002 oldham et al 2015 molecular orbital theory confirms that the electron donor orbital dx2 y2 and acceptor orbital dz2 of mn ii and mn iv are spatially distinct indicating that one electron transfer occurs in the oxidation of mn ii and the reduction of mn iv with the formation of mn iii as intermediate luther 2005 morgan 2005 natural mn iii can be produced by the biotic or abiotic oxidation of mn ii bacterial enzymes webb et al 2005 any humic substances present and light irradiation hansard et al 2011 nico et al 2002 can all be involved in the oxidation moreover mn iii has been directly detected in the black sea up to 5 0 μm and sediment porewaters of the lower st lawrence estuary up to 82 0 μm madison et al 2013 trouwborst et al 2006 notably intermediate mn iii can be rapidly stabilized by inorganic ligands e g pyrophosphate pp and organic ligands e g dom to form mn iii complexes oldham et al 2017 their ligand metal electron transfer processes can affect the fate of pollutants in natural waters in addition mn iii usually acts as an oxidant to oxidize organic pollutants and participates in the carbon cycle in natural water environments because of the similarity of its redox potential with that of dissolved oxygen hu et al 2017 kostka et al 1995 lu et al 2021 shao et al 2022 wang et al 2023 researchers have reported the enhanced removal of various phenolic pollutants by mn iii in the presence of dom and visible light wang et al 2018a yao et al 2020 however eom usually exhibits lower specific uv absorbance displays stronger fluorescence and contains more protein like and less humic substances than dom henderson et al 2008 tenorio et al 2017 suggesting a difference in photo reactivity whereas the importance of interaction between dom and metal ions in aquatic environments has long been recognized engebretson and von wandruszka 1994 gao et al 2015 yan and korshin 2014 the information about the photochemical processes involving eom and mn ii is still inadequate it is thus important to investigate the reactions between mn ii and eom and how mn ii may alter the environmental behavior of organic pollutants under sunlight irradiation in eutrophic plateau lakes this study aimed to explore the photodegradation of ee2 in the presence of mn ii and eom under irradiation with emphasis on the formation mechanisms of reactive mn iii and ppris firstly the degradation kinetics of ee2 were examined at environmentally relevant mn ii and eom concentrations the reaction mechanisms were investigated in reactive species quenching experiments secondly mn iii formation mechanism and the factors influencing the yield were also explored through quenching and condition experiments then the degradation intermediates of ee2 were identified by a liquid chromatograph quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer lc q tof ms to propose the possible reaction pathways finally mn ii and eom cooperatively mediating ee2 photodegradation was verified in natural water to better estimate the photochemical behavior of mn ii and eom under natural environmental conditions it is expected that the information obtained in this study would contribute to the understanding of the environmental behaviors of mn ii and trace organic pollutants in the eutrophic water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the eom used in this study was extracted from cultured microcystis aeruginosa the cultivation and extraction methods are detailed in text s1 ee2 c20h24o2 98 0 and sodium pyrophosphate tetrabasic 95 0 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa manganese sulfate monohydrate 99 0 was obtained from aladdin china additional reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 photochemical degradation of ee2 all the experiments involving illumination were performed in quartz tubes in an xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china equipped with cutoff filters λ 290 nm and a 300 w mercury lamp the effects of initial mn ii concentrations 0 50 0 μm and ph 6 0 9 0 on the photodegradation of ee2 1 0 mg l i e 3 37 μm mediated by eom were explored according to the concentration of dom in surface water 1 0 20 0 mgc l of eom was chosen to explore the influence on ee2 photodegradation gooddy and hinsby 2008 nogueira et al 2017 the effects of cl no3 and so4 2 5 0 50 0 mg l on ee2 photodegradation mediated by mn ii and eom were also investigated before each experiment the solution of mn ii and eom was thoroughly mixed by stirring for 12 h with exposure to air while kept in the dark at suitable intervals in the illumination experiments the reaction solution 0 5 ml was collected in brown sample vials for the determination of unreacted ee2 unless otherwise specified the experimental conditions were ee2 3 37 μm mn ii 25 0 μm eom 5 0 mgc l ph 6 0 all the experiments in this study were conducted in triplicate and the error bars were provided 2 2 2 identification of reactive species the major ppris were determined through scavenging experiments in mn ii and eom mixtures under irradiation first a series of concentrations of sorbic acid sa furfuryl alcohol ffa tert butyl alcohol tba and p benzoquinone bq were tested to identify their optimum concentrations these certain concentrations of scavengers were then used to investigate the effects of 3eom 1o2 oh and o2 buxton et al 1988 greenstock and ruddock 1976 haag and hoigne 1986 on ee2 degradation second the concentrations of 3eom 1o2 and oh were determined using 40 0 μm 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp 50 0 μm ffa and 150 0 μm terephthalic acid tpa respectively moreover to trap o2 50 0 μm of 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium 5 carboxanilide xtt was utilized as described in previous studies sutherland and learmonth 1997 to identify the role of reactive mn iii on ee2 degradation pp 5 0 mm was utilized to scavenge and complex mn iii since pp can preferentially complex with mn iii to form a stable mn iii pp complex log kapp 31 35 which is strongly colored in the uv visible region λ 258 nm ε 6750 m 1 webb et al 2005 results are shown in fig s1 in addition it has been confirmed that pp does not participate in the reaction and only tends to form a stable mn iii pp complex see figs s2 and s3 in this study 2 2 3 photogeneration mechanism of mn iii in mn ii and eom mixture three types of scavengers 200 0 μm ffa 50 0 μm tba and 30 0 μm bq were added to solutions that contained mn ii eom and pp to identify the formation mechanism of soluble mn iii the effects of initial ph 6 0 9 0 and no3 concentration on mn iii generation were also explored the reaction solution was sampled at suitable time intervals and their absorbances at 258 nm were immediately measured using a uv 2600 spectrograph from shimadzu japan the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 100 0 mm was used to examine o2 and oh in the mixtures of mn ii and eom burns et al 2012 after irradiation the signals of dmpo and o2 adduct dmpo ooh or dmpo and oh adduct dmpo oh were determined using a bruker a300 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer germany an agent 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 200 0 μm was applied to trap 1o2 haag and hoigne 1986 in the mn ii and eom mixtures which can form a temp and 1o2 adduct tempo 2 2 4 photodegradation of ee2 in natural waters three different types of natural water matrixes including lake water dianchi lake kunming china river water panlong river kunming and effluent kunming no 4 sewage treatment plant were used to examine ee2 photodegradation behavior these water matrixes were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber membranes waterman maidstone uk before use the water quality parameters are listed in table 1 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of ee2 tmp ffa and 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2h tpa formed from tpa were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 1260 series agilent usa equipped with a c18 reversed phase separation column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size and a fluorescence or an ultraviolet detector the concentration of the xtt formazan was measured using uv vis spectra at 475 nm the detailed detection methods and the calculation of ppris are explained in text s2 and the mobile phase settings for the reagents are shown in table s1 the concentration of eom was quantified using a total organic carbon toc analyzer elementar vario toc cube elementar germany acid base titration of eom was used to calculate the content of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eems f 7000 hitachi limited japan and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir varian 640 ir usa were used to characterize the properties of the eom the mn ii and eom mixture that after 120 min reaction was freeze dried to measure the valence states of manganese by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha usa and epr was used to detect o2 oh and 1o2 the lc q tof ms agilent 6500 series usa was used to identify the products of ee2 and the gradient elution conditions are listed in table s2 the contents of anions and toc in natural water samples were measured by an ion chromatography ic 2800 east and west analysis china and a toc analyzer respectively further inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icap 6300 thermo scientific usa was used to measure the metal ions in natural water samples all the details of these analyses are set out in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of coexisting mn ii and eom on ee2 photodegradation initially the individual effects of mn ii and eom on ee2 photodegradation were evaluated see fig 1a the results indicated that soluble mn ii alone caused no significant ee2 degradation under irradiation whereas eom alone led to a considerable enhancement of ee2 degradation this observation corroborates the findings of zhang s group 2022 the combined effects of mn ii and eom on ee2 photodegradation by varying their concentrations were further investigated and some interesting phenomena appear see figs 1a and 1b when 5 0 50 0 μm mn ii and 5 0 mgc l eom were simultaneously present the photodegradation of ee2 was enhanced over the rate with eom alone by 15 5 1 3 to 48 4 4 5 calculated by specific kobs fig 1a the photogenerated reactive mn iii was probably the cause the eom ligands serve to stabilize mn iii resulting in the formation of relatively long lived mn iii eom complexes these complexes may act as important oxidants in the degradation of ee2 while solid mno2 phases have often been assumed to be common oxidation products of mn ii previous studies have shown that in the presence of organic ligands mn ii is primarily oxidized to form ligand bound mn iii complexes rather than mn iv kostka et al 1995 nico et al 2002 this suggests that mn ii is expected to undergo oxidation to form mn iii eom in the current system notably the fastest decay of ee2 was observed with the simultaneous presence of 25 0 μm mn ii and 5 0 mgc l eom while the observed enhancement decreased as mn ii concentrations exceeded 25 0 μm it can be predicted that there may have a critical concentration of mn ii in the enhanced degradation of ee2 as wang et al 2018a reported the quenching effect of triplet state dom by mn ii may be negligible at a concentration less than 25 0 μm but high concentrations of mn ii 100 0 μm can obviously quench triplet state dom thereby inhibiting the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species moreover as shown in fig 1b it was observed that the rate of ee2 photodegradation decreased with the increase of the mixtures eom concentrations 5 0 mgc l this could be due to the quenching effect of high eom concentrations leading to the deactivation of ppris such as 3eom oh and 1o2 janssen et al 2014 taken together these results suggest synergy among irradiation mn ii and eom in promoting ee2 photodegradation fig 1c illustrates the dependence of ee2 photodegradation on the initial ph the photodegradation proceeded faster in acidic conditions than in alkaline conditions potentially attributed to the higher reactivity of mn iii in acidic environments relative to alkaline environments qin et al 2021 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2014 further the solutions ph dropped more during irradiation under alkaline conditions see fig s4 an additional experiment confirmed that the ph drops primarily resulted from the oxidation of mn ii and photolysis of eom fig s5 mn iii is known to be unstable in solution and prone to hydrolysis eq 1 wells and davies 1965 and higher rates of disproportionation for mn iii eq 2 davies 1969 have been observed under alkaline conditions sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 also the consumption of mn iii by ee2 may produce mn ii and hydrogen ions wang et al 2018b leading to decreasing ph values 1 mn iii 2 h 2 o mnoh aq 2 h 3 o k 0 88 0 04 2 2 mn iii 2 h 2 o mn ii mn o 2 s 4 h log k 7 9 generally ubiquitous anions such as cl no3 and so4 2 may affect ee2 degradation mediated by mn ii and eom mixture as shown in fig 1d so4 2 and cl have negligible effects on the photodegradation but the higher concentration of no3 the faster decay of ee2 no3 can promote the photochemical oxidation of trace organic compounds in natural water by generating ppris through its absorption at long wavelength bands barat et al 1970 zepp et al 1987 thus it can be inferred that any no3 present can affect the photodegradation of ee2 and the oxidation of mn ii in eutrophic water 3 2 reactive species in irradiated mn ii and eom mixtures 3 2 1 identification of ppris the possible ppris that caused ee2 photodegradation in the mixtures of mn ii and eom were recognized with the assistance of the quenchers fig 2a the optimum concentrations of sa 150 0 μm ffa 200 0 μm tba 50 0 μm and bq 30 0 μm were determined through scavenging experiments figs s6 to s9 the concentrations of ppris were calculated through fig s10 and the results are shown in fig 2b as illustrated in fig 2a the addition of sa ffa or bq significantly inhibited ee2 photodegradation ffa had more impact than sa which was more inhibiting than bq indicating that 1o2 3eom and o2 were the main ppris involved tba caused a comparatively minor decrease suggesting that oh was not primarily responsible for ee2 degradation further fig 2b shows the high concentrations of 1o2 2 31 10 7 μm 3eom 1 49 10 7 μm and oh 1 35 10 7 μm in the eom solutions they indicate the strong photo reactivity of eom which cannot be ignored in eutrophic water it is worth noting that the concentrations of these ppris decreased with mn ii present indicating they were possibly consumed by mn ii to form reactive mn iii 3 2 2 reactive mn iii since the presence of mn ii can enhance ee2 photodegradation in eom solutions predicting that considerable reactive mn iii may be generated as is confirmed in fig 2a the addition of pp can significantly suppress ee2 photodegradation also indicating that reactive mn iii played a considerable role in the reaction mn iii formed gradually during irradiation at ph 6 0 fig 2c with a maximum conversion of 57 20 however the formation of mn iii was quite different in the presence or absence of ee2 a lower concentration of mn iii was measured in the presence of ee2 fig 2c this observation was further supported by additional experiments see fig s11 which revealed a minor degradation of ee2 in mn iii pp and eom mixtures these results suggest that an outer sphere electron transfer klewicki and morgan 1998 between mn iii pp and ee2 may occur leading to a bit lower concentration of mn iii moreover there was no mn iii generated without a photosensitizer eom in this case during irradiation fig 2c since all the d orbitals of mn ii are single electron occupied diem and stumm 1984 which is spin forbidden in quantum mechanical principles that stable configuration is rather difficult to destroy without a photosensitizer lu et al 2021 xps experiments showed that the partitioning of manganese in the irradiated mn ii and eom mixtures was 51 09 mn ii 43 33 mn iii and 5 58 mn iv fig 2d the presence of mn iv can be considered as evidence of the hydrolysis of mn iii and it could be speculated that more mn iv would be generated without strong ligands and with longer irradiation 3 3 reactive mn iii formation mechanisms 3 3 1 effects of ppris on mn iii generation to explore the mechanisms of reactive mn iii generation three scavengers were added to mn ii and eom mixtures the control group was the mixture without any scavengers as indicated in fig 3a the presence of the scavengers inhibited mn iii formation adding ffa suppressed mn iii generation slightly indicating a minor contribution of 1o2 tba and bq reduced mn iii concentration by 25 4 and 77 3 respectively these results indicated that o2 was mainly responsible for mn ii oxidation followed by oh and 1o2 further the influence of dissolved oxygen on mn iii generation are shown in fig 3b the mn iii concentration generated under air was much higher than that under nitrogen given the crucial role of dissolved oxygen in photochemical processes and its reaction with 3eom can generate various reactive oxygen species amon and benner 1996 cooper et al 1988 it is unsurprising that there is a notable accumulation of mn iii under air condition however it is worth noting that the level of mn iii remains relatively high even under nitrogen potentially owing to the influence of 3eom in this instance the 3eom may serve as an electron acceptor ma et al 2020 and facilitate the electron transfer process with mn ii directly rather than engaging in a reaction with dissolved oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species that subsequently react with mn ii wang et al 2018a therefore it can be predicted that in eutrophic shallow waters considerable reactive mn iii would be produced under sunlight irradiation which can affect the fate of trace organic pollutants 3 3 2 reactions between mn ii and o2 or oh probe dmpo was used to explain the possible reaction between mn ii and o2 or oh in the epr experiments the signals of the dmpo ooh peak dmpo oh peak and tempo peak were detected fig 4a in the eom solution after irradiation all three peaks were attenuated with the addition of mn ii fig 4b although the direct reaction between mn ii and 1o2 has not been reported the decreased tempo peak intensity 1o2 steady state concentration fig 2b after adding mn ii and mn iii concentration after quenching 1o2 fig 3a indicated that 1o2 may participate in mn iii generation indirectly through other pathways furthermore the decrease in the intensity of the dmpo ooh peak and the concentration of xtt formazan shown in fig s10d demonstrated that mn ii can react with o2 previous studies have reported rate constants for the reaction of mn ii with o2 1 08 107 m 1 s 1 learman et al 2013 and with oh k 3 40 107 m 1 s 1 pick kaplan and rabani 1976 were of the same order of magnitude but the much longer diffusion length and half life of o2 seconds compared to oh nanoseconds levy et al 2019 may be responsible for its larger contribution to mn iii generation the observed phenomena suggest that the generation of mn iii in this study was mainly attributed to o2 followed by oh and 1o2 which is consistent with the previous discussion 3 3 3 effects of initial ph on mn iii photogeneration since the ph of natural waters will be significantly affected by algal blooming cui et al 2021 huisman et al 2018 the influence of initial ph on mn iii generation in the mn ii and eom mixtures was also explored see fig 5a the formation rate of mn iii varied at different ph but the mn iii concentrations eventually achieved were the same speculating that some sort of dynamic balance was achieved with increased irradiation time some scholars have also reported that mn iii generation in the presence of ligands was not ph dependent wang et al 2018b furthermore the presence of pp was observed to stabilize the ph of the reaction solutions compared fig 5b with fig s4 which supported the view that the decrease in solution ph was due primarily to the hydrolysis of mn iii or the consumption of mn iii by ee2 in the previous discussion 3 3 4 effects of no3 on mn iii photogeneration based on previous discussion it was found that no3 can promote ee2 photodegradation mediated by mn ii and eom mixtures predicting that no3 may also affect the generation of mn iii fig 6a confirms that no3 can promote the photogeneration of mn iii in mn ii and eom mixtures and such promotion increases with no3 concentration an additional experiment was performed to further understand the promotion effect of no3 as shown in fig 6b the absorbance of the reaction solution at 258 nm increased gradually with irradiation time indicating the formation of the mn iii pp complex resulting from no3 photolysis with the formed mn iii being approximately 4 3 μm a previous study reported that no3 photolysis generates o2 which can assist the fast abiotic oxidation of mn ii to mn iv oxide with mn iii as an intermediate jung et al 2017 therefore it seems that no3 plays an important role in the photodegradation of ee2 and the oxidation of mn ii in eutrophic water 3 3 5 responsible photosensitive substances of eom on mn iii generation 3d eems ftir and acid base titration were used to identify the possible substances or functional groups of eom involved in mn iii generation as is confirmed in fig s12 the eom mainly contained tryptophan and protein like substances ex 275 em 330 nm and small amounts of tyrosine ex 230 em 330 nm xu and jiang 2013 all fluorescence intensities of these substances decreased significantly after irradiation indicating the consumption of potential photosensitive substances in eom fig s12a and c together show no fluorescence quenching effect of eom by 25 0 μm mn ii additionally the fluorescence intensity of the mixture was higher than that of the eom solution after irradiation fig s12b and d suggesting that mn ii may protect eom from photobleaching the ftir spectra show that the absorbance of c oh extension 1153 cm 1 and c o extension 1780 cm 1 minor and stephens 2008 decreased after the reaction fig 7a indicating the consumption of phenolic hydroxyl from 33 00 to 31 00 μmol mgc and carboxyl from 50 50 to 47 50 μmol mgc fig 7b perhaps the consumption of these functional groups suggested that they were the potential photosensitive groups or were degraded in the strongly oxidizing system 3 3 6 proposed mn iii photogeneration mechanism the irradiation of eom can generate ppris like 3eom eom 1o2 o2 hydrogen peroxide and oh clark and zika 2000 dalrymple et al 2010 gao et al 2022 zafiriou 1977 scheme 1 summarizes some possible generation pathways of the ppris and mn iii by either energy transfer or charge electron transfer reactions eom can be excited by photon absorption and transformed into an excited singlet state 1eom step 1 3eom was then generated by the 1eom via intersystem crossing step 2 through step 3 the 3eom can oxidize h2o to form oh as well as through the chain reactions from o2 to h2o2 and then the photolysis of h2o2 to oh step 10 moreover the formed 3eom can also react with o2 to form 1o2 through energy transfer step 5 and 1o2 could be further converted to o2 by step 6 as for the charge transfer processes the direct charge transfer that occurred in eom under irradiation can form an intramolecular charge transfer state eom eom step 8 eom can also be produced by intramolecular electron transfer from 1eom and 3eom steps 11 and 12 then the reaction between eom and o2 produces o2 via electron transfer step 9 although there were various pathways to generate ppris from eom the direct ones that were responsible for the oxidation of mn ii to form mn iii were mainly through o2 and oh steps 4 and 7 3 4 proposed ee2 photodegradation pathways the intermediate products of ee2 degraded by the mn ii and eom mixture under irradiation were identified through lc q tof ms which allowed proposing their structures because of the accurate mass determinations for the molecular ions the difference between the theoretical and experimental masses was 5 0 ppm or less the extracted ion current chromatograms of ee2 and different intermediates at different reaction times are displayed in fig s13 and their errors with theoretical masses are calculated in table s3 according to the reactive species and products identified in the reaction system three main possible reaction pathways including hydroxylation dehydrogenation and single electron transfer of ee2 were proposed as detailed in fig 8 the loss of the hydroxyl group from c17 of ee2 formed product a the hydroxylation that occurred in the c2 position of ee2 was initiated by oh to form product b in pathway i sun et al 2010 it can be oxidized by mn iii to form the free radical intermediate b 1 and then formed product c followed by ring cleavage carp et al 2004 the addition of oh formed intermediate c 1 form which a photo kolbe reaction generated the aliphatic product d carp et al 2004 product d was then oxidized to product e due to dehydrogenation similarly the addition of oh may form intermediate e 1 with which a photo kolbe reaction may occur after that the insertion of oxygen can lead to carbon carbon bond cleavage to form a ketone group which was product f with further oxidation product g may be formed from product f after another ring cleavage turning to pathway ii an analogue of ee2 product h was initially formed by losing a c2h2 moiety he et al 2022 product h is susceptible to three possible degradation pathways in one hydroxylation by oh at the c9 and c11 positions formed product i which was further converted to intermediate i 1 by single electron transfer and then oxidized to product j the addition of hydrogen atoms to the benzene ring can lead to the formation of product k frontistis et al 2012 which can be further oxidized by mn iii through single electron transfer to form product l the five membered ring has a higher tension in such structure β cleavage with hydrogen rearrangement may occur and form product m chen et al 2016 alternatively reactive mn iii can transform product h into intermediate h 1 which can then form product n an isomer of product l in the subsequent reactions product o was formed by the addition of oh to product n after losing a cyclopropanone moiety product p was formed which can be further degraded to product q chen et al 2016 a third possibility is that mn iii may convert ee2 into free radicals by single electron transfer wang et al 2018b for further oxidation as fig 8 shows three types of phenoxyl radicals may be formed by mn iii abstracting an electron from ee2 however the high concentrations of reactive species in the reaction system of this study mean that such single electron transfer and subsequent oxidation need further verification in any case it is safe to say that mn iii plays an important role in the degradation of estrogens and other such products in aquatic environments 3 5 natural water experiments the photodegradation of ee2 was also tested in lake water river water and sewage treatment effluent table 1 lists the water quality parameters the concentrations of ee2 do mn and other metal ions among three natural water samples showed no significant differences which may be negligible for the experiments as is confirmed in fig 9 ee2 photodegradation rate was observed in the order of lake water effluent water river water the presence of mn ii had a promoting effect particularly in lake water since so4 2 and cl were negligible contributors these observations can be attributed to the higher no3 concentration table 1 and fluorophore content fig s14 of the lake water followed by effluent and river water what cannot be denied was that all three types of natural water had a high toc content see table 1 but the quite weak fluorescence intensity fig s14 compared with fresh extracted eom fig s12a indicated their relatively low chromophore content generally uv disinfection in sewage treatment plants or sunlight irradiation reduces the chromophore and fluorophore content mcneill and canonica 2016 wan et al 2020 forming inert dissolved organic carbon species feng et al 2022 given that it seems reasonable that the degradation of ee2 is not high in the presence or absence of mn ii in natural water samples it was eom that accelerated ee2 photodegradation substantially with the presence of mn ii accelerated more both the effectiveness followed the order lake water effluent river water fig 9 the relatively effective removal from the lake water can be attributed primarily to higher fluorophore and no3 content produces more ppris however the total ee2 degraded by the coexistence of mn ii and eom was smaller than the sum of that in the two single systems in natural water possible explanations could be that certain substances in the water compete with ee2 for photogenerated mn iii and or the inert dissolved organic carbon species quench some ppris produced by the eom in addition the ph was always 6 0 in the initial experiments but in natural waters the ph can range from 7 8 to 8 6 table 1 as has been mentioned ee2 in mn ii and eom mixtures degrades faster in acidic conditions see fig 1c in summary then differences in fluorophore content ph and no3 concentration are important determinants of the effectiveness photodegradation in eutrophic plateau lakes while mn ii acts as a facilitated factor 4 conclusions the generation of reactive mn iii was mainly attributed to the fact that eom provides enough o2 to active this process under irradiation the oh and 1o2 meanwhile were also found to be important contributors mn iii was formed gradually in the irradiated mixtures with a maximum conversion of 57 20 and whether dissolved oxygen is present or not mn iii can be generated perhaps due to the presence of other charge transferring substances eom can generate ppris to accelerate the photodegradation of ee2 and if mn ii was also present this process was further enhanced by the photogeneration of reactive mn iii ubiquitous no3 in eutrophic lakes can promote mn iii photogeneration and thus ee2 photodegradation the fluorophore content ph value and no3 concentration were the main determinants of the rate of ee2 photodegradation in eutrophic plateau lakes future studies are warranted to test the algal aom from various sources or different growth periods to explore their effect on the photogeneration and stabilization of mn iii and to further understand this important environmental chemical process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14842,anaerobic biological treatment was regarded as one of promising options for realizing concurrent was reduction stabilization and bioenergy bioresource recycle but the relatively low treatment efficiency limited its spreading application toward larger scale considerably in china aimed at such barrier this study offered a novel enhancing strategy for achieving high efficiency of bioenergy bioresource recycle from was anaerobic treatment via improving bioelectrogenesis acidogenesis using sludge source redox mediators ssrms ssrms not only facilitated bioeletrogenesis with an increasing efficiency of 36 for voltage output and 39 for bioelectricity bioconversion but also enhanced acidogenesis of was with a mean elevating efficiency of 37 5 of volatile fatty acids vfas production within 5 d mechanistic investigations indicated that ssrms had a potential influence on improving the protein and carbohydrate metabolisms related genes expression for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis moreover ssrms exerted roles of electrochemical catalysts or as terminal electron acceptors with affecting functional proteins of complexes of ⅰ and ⅳ in electron transfer chains for improving electron transfer efficiency meanwhile the core members abundance microbial diversity and community distributive evenness were prompted concurrently for carrying out superior bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis a schematic illustration was established for demonstrating the mechanism of ssrms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis via changing microbial metabolism functions enhancing electron transfer efficiency and regulating functional genes expression of functional proteins up regulating cytochrome c oxidase and down regulating nadh dehydrogenase this study provided an effective enhancing strategy for facilitating was bioconversion to bioenergy bioresource with well process sustainability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge sludge source redox mediators bioelectrogenesis acidogenic fermentation electron transfer efficiency microbial mechanisms data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction as a main byproduct generated from traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps with using activated sludge method the waste activated sludge was was produced rapidly with an estimate of 66 64 million tonnes in 2020 in china dai et al 2022 which contained ca 30 million tonnes of organic substances assessed by the volatile solid vs total solid ts of 50 roughly chen et al 2020 dai et al 2022 liao and li 2015 however the bioresource or bioenergy recycling efficiency from such huge organic matters are at relatively low levels presently less than 20 waste sludge anaerobic digestion plants can be operated normally in china with below 3 of waste sludge anaerobic treatment efficiency chen et al 2020 due to its complex composition and low biodegradability thus numerous pretreatments e g mechanical thermal chemical biological or combined pretreatments ariunbaatar et al 2014 were applied for realizing was solubilization and enhancing anaerobic fermentation efficiency for obtaining biogas volatile fatty acids vfas huang et al 2019 medium chain carboxylic acids wu et al 2021 pha synthesis rodriguez perez et al 2018 plant growth biostimulants tang et al 2022 or high value products of medium chain fatty acids mcfas and long chain alcohols lcas luo et al 2022 consequentially such pretreatments added the total cost of was treatment which accounted for more than 40 of total operating expense in wwtps wu et al 2021 on the other hand improving microbial metabolic functions in anaerobic treatment bioprocess via triggering rates of redox reactions by catalytically accelerating electron transport efficiency with using redox mediators rms would be another effective stimulating strategy for boosting was treatment efficiency hsueh et al 2019 some exogenous rms have been confirmed to be popularly used in cellular respiratory systems metabolisms in organisms and widely applied to support global lives such as neutral red phenoxazine 2 aminophenol quinones series etc hsueh et al 2019 some decolorized intermediates e g 2 aminophenol amine phenolic compounds and plant derived substances e g scutellaria baicalensis georgi and ingredients anthocyanin abundant plant extracts and microalgal metabolites could act as exogenous electron shuttles to promote anaerobic bioprocess e g bioelectrogenesis with a higher organics degradation efficiency chen et al 2013a 2013b zhang et al 2019a xu et al 2019a 2019b but the disadvantages of this enhancing way couldn t be ignored on one hand such exogenous electron shuttles would be lost completely after the utilization which couldn t be reused any more on the other hand the extraction or obtainment of these exogenous rms increased the total operation cost inevitably xu et al 2019b comparatively the endogenous ones displayed superior advantages in terms of source of generation e g could be produced via mfcs nawaz et al 2020 yousaf et al 2017 and electron transferring capabilities for promoting organic matters biodegradation malvankar and lovley 2012 shen et al 2014 thus considerable emphasis has been shifted to endogenous rms with huge applicative potentials up to present the humic substances hss were capable to play roles of terminal electron acceptors tea or electron transferring chains etc by functional groups e g quinone groups as endogenous rms for stimulating anaerobic acidogenesis and promoting vfas production liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 it suggested that the endogenous rms used for enhancing anaerobic bioprocess might be one of effective ways for realizing high efficiency bioenergy bioresource recycling with relatively low cost supported previously xin et al 2020 more noticeably the endogenous rms e g hss were enriched abundantly in solid phase of was which accounted for ca 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss li et al 2019 and ca 10 15 of the total dissolved organic matter dom of was xiao et al 2020 furthermore a recent study indicated that the lignins could mediate electron transfer for enhancing was acidogenesis acted as electron shuttles he et al 2022 which occupied a relative proportion of ca 3 5 in dom of was xiao et al 2020 however the spontaneous release efficiency of such endogenous rms from solid phase into liquid phase of was was at a relatively low level during the normal hydrolysis because of the stable structure of extracellular polymeric substance eps as well as the dynamic limits recently the rapid development of bioelectrochemical systems bes e g microbial fuel cells mfcs offered an effective option for obtaining such endogenous rms from sludge based on two kinds of key cooperators of fermentative bacteria e g acidogens and exoelectrogens for degrading biodegradable organics and remaining rms e g hss etc supported by our previous studies with stating that mfcs could be used as a producer for obtaining endogenous rms from sludge infinitely xin et al 2020 2022 such viewpoint was supported previously as well yousaf et al proposed that the endogenous rm of 5 methyl 1 hydroxy phenazine could be produced in mfcs and positively correlated with power generation yousaf et al 2017 moreover the soluble electron shuttles of pyocyanins flavins and quinones could be secreted by functional microbes and accumulated within mfcs which acted as soluble rms and interacted with cytochromes for prompting extracellular electron transfer process malvankar and lovley 2012 nawaz et al 2020 shen et al 2014 based on aforesaid background harvesting endogenous rms i e sludge source rms ssrms via mfcs for enhancing anaerobic bioprocess with expectations of high efficiency bioenergy bioresource recycle would be a promising way for realizing was proper treatment management however scarce emphasis has been focused sufficiently on this topic while the microbial mechanisms have been barely revealed up to present in terms of functional genes expression and activity changes of membrane functional proteins related to electron transfer in anaerobic bioprocess according to such thread the main aim of this study was to investigate the availability of ssrms harvested by mfcs for improving bioelectricity and bioresource i e vfas recycle efficiency from waste sludge via boosting bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis exhaustively on one hand the stimulating characteristics of bioelectrogenesis voltage output power density bioelectricity generation efficiency etc and acidogenesis vfas promotion vs ts reduction etc were demonstrated sufficiently on the other hand the microbial mechanism of ssrms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis were clarified comprehensively 2 materials and methods 2 1 was source and pretreatments the raw was used in this study was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank of a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp in songshan lake district of dongguan city in pr china prior to the practical pretreatments the raw was was filtered with screen 1 0 mm 1 0 mm to remove impurities and concentrated by settling at 4 c for 24 h finally the detailed properties of the collected was were total solid ts 13 48 0 32 g l volatile

operations were listed in the supplementary materials 2 2 experiment protocol and operations the whole experiment protocol in this study was divided into three phases which contained the ssrms harvest phase ⅰ bioelectrogenesis process enhancement phase ⅱ and anaerobic acidogenic fermentation boost by ssrms phase ⅲ respectively 2 2 1 endogenous rms obtainment through mfcs phase ⅰ the typical cylinder type single chamber air cathode microbial fuel cells mfcs devices were used in this study with an effective volume of 28 0 ml which was made of polymethyl methacrylate as depicted previously xin et al 2020 2022 the anode was fabricated from carbon brush with an effective working area of 7 8 cm2 installed on one side of mfcs while a 3 cm diameter air cathode made of plain carbon cloth e tek usa coupled with a platinum catalyst 0 35 mg cm2 was installed on the other side of the mfcs the external circuit of each mfc were established using a titanium wire from the cathode to the anode across an external resistor r 1 0 kω a data acquisition card usbdaq 580i china linked with a computer was adopted for recording the mfcs output voltage every 10 min such one group of mfcs was used to treat was supernatants generated from the three kinds of pretreatments above for achieving soluble organics biodegradation and gathering the remaining substances including ssrms while one of the mfcs was fed with pure glucose with a similar influent cod level as a control test labeled as r1 with an influent cod content level of 1 067 g l based on a previous study xin et al 2019 the mfcs fed with was supernatants from the mc pretreatment h pretreatment and f t pretreatment were labeled as r2 r3 and r4 with influent cod levels of 0 917 g l 0 964 g l 1 043 g l respectively table 1 all mfcs were operated in batch fed mode with a 3 d operation as a running cycle after one stable operational cycle the remaining liquid in mfcs were collected for the next exploration when the output voltage was less than 0 05 v according to previous studies xin et al 2019 2020 2022 the operation of these sequential batch mfcs was performed at 30 c in a lab scale thermostat while this experiment period was marked as phase ⅰ the other solutions of phosphate buffered saline pbs vitamin solution and mineral solution were listed in supplementary materials according to a previous study xin et al 2022 2 2 2 bioelectrogenesis process enhancement by ssrms phase ⅱ another group of mfcs r5 r8 similar mfcs like the ones used in phase ⅰ were used for revealing the bioelectrogenesis enhancement by the ssrms obtained in phase ⅰ all mfcs were fed with identical substrate of pure glucose with an equal influent cod level of ca 1 0 g l the effluents rich in ssrms of r2 r3 and r4 generated in phase ⅰ were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min the corresponding supernatant after centrifugation was added into r6 r7 and r8 respectively ca 5 0 ml for each stable running cycle the r5 was supplied with identical volume 5 0 ml of sterile purified water as the control reactor the remaining operations of r5 r8 were identical completely with the mfcs operations in phase ⅰ the output voltage was monitored and recorded by a data acquisition card usbdaq 580i china linked with a computer while the mfcs were operated in sequence batch mode as well when the output voltage was less than 0 05 v after a 3 d running cycle the mfcs would be emptied and started the next running cycle subsequently this experiment of bioelectrogenesis enhancement by ssrms was marked as phase ⅱ 2 2 3 anaerobic acidogenic fermentation boost by ssrms phase ⅲ a group of anaerobic bottles working volume of 100 ml for each was adopted for investigating the acidogenic fermentation improvement by ssrms the detailed composition of each anaerobic bottle contained 70 ml of raw was without being pretreated ca 20 ml of inoculum and 10 ml of ssrms i e the effluents of r2 r3 and r4 generated in phase ⅰ respectively while one of them added identical volume of sterile purified water instead of ssrms as the control test the inoculum for the start up of acidogenic fermentations were taken from a full scale waste sludge anaerobic digestion tank in songshan lake district of dongguan city in pr china with detailed properties ts of 11 14 0 85 g l vs of 6 45 0 32 g l and ph of 6 8 0 1 all anaerobic fermentation bottles were sealed up by using rubber stoppers in a constant temperature shaker at 35 1 c with a rotating speed of 120 r min the acidogenic fermentation experiments were conducted in triplicate each anaerobic fermentation period was ca 8 d while ca 50 ml of fermentative sludge was taken out for further analysis at an interval of 2 d according to similar studies pang et al 2022 xie et al 2022 2 3 general analysis the soluble cod total cod ts and vs of was were measured according to a previous standard method rice et al 2012 the soluble protein was analyzed lowry folin method with using bsa as the reference standard oliver et al 1951 while the soluble carbohydrate content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method michel et al 1956 the dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured by a multifunctional instrument hanna italy the 3 dimensional fluorescence intensity analysis of soluble organics changes in sludge supernatant before after mfc treatment was conducted with using an excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi the emission em wavelength was ranged from 200 nm to 750 nm with a rising interval of 5 nm while the excitation ex wavelength was set as from 200 nm to 700 nm with a 10 nm sampling interval and a scanning speed of 10 000 nm min the cyclic voltammetry cv measurement of mfcs influent and effluent for depicting the redox property changes was conducted via an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua of china the working electrodes consisted of a glassy carbon electrode 0 03 cm2 a platinum electrode 1 0 cm2 and a reference electrode hg hgcl filled with saturated kcl aq the scanning rate was set as 10 mv s with a range from 1 5 to 1 5 v ca ten cv scanning cycles were implemented in this study for oxidizing or reducing electrochemically unstable chemical species sufficiently which ensured the reductive and oxidative potential peaks emergence with stable electrochemical properties accordingly xu et al 2019a xin et al 2022 the vfas analysis was implemented via a gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc2030 japan with a flame ionization detector the chromatographic conditions were as follows injector temperature of 250 c column temperature of 240 c oven temperature increased to 170 c with a gradient of 20 c for 2 min carrier gas of n2 50 ml min and h2 55 ml min prior to entering the gc the was fermentation liquid samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane and then collected in a 1 5 ml gas chromatography vial the formic acid was added to adjust the ph to approximately 4 0 the gc ms analysis was used to identify the chemical substances changes of was supernatant before and after mfcs treatment with various pretreatments in phase ⅰ via an agilent 7890b 5977b gc ms agilent usa all supernatant samples of mfcs influent and effluent were extracted with dichloromethane under neutral ph condition and then dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and finally concentrated to a ultimate volume of ca 2 0 ml by a rotary evaporation equipment in a water bath at 38 c li et al 2015 subsequently the concentrated liquid entered the gc ms system for the chemical species identification the separation of chemical matters was realized using a fused silica capillary column sh rtx 5 30 0 m 250 µm 0 25 µm shimadzu usa the column temperature change procedure was set as follows about 40 c for 3 min and then increased to 300 c with a 30 c min increment with a final maintenance of 5 min the sample volume was controlled at 1 0 μl the ms ion source temperature was set as 230 c and the electron energy was 70 ev helium was used as the carrier gas the hydrolytic enzymes protease and α glucosidase activities during acidogenic fermentation of was were analyzed as reported previously xie et al 2022 2 4 microbial community characterization microbial diversity sequencing and metatranscriptome analysis were conducted in this study the detailed operations were listed in supplementary materials 2 5 data analysis regarding the bioelectricity generating performance of mfcs in this study the current density i and power density p could be evaluated by the following eq 1 and eq 2 1 i u r a 2 p u 2 r a where u a and r stood for the mfc output voltage v the effective anode working area m2 and the external resistance ω respectively the bioelectricity conversion efficiency bce in kw h kg cod of mfcs fed with various substrates in phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ could be calculated roughly by the following eq 3 as mentioned previously xin and qiu 2021 3 bce u 2 r t 1 0 10 3 kg cod l r 0 028 l 10 3 where t stood for the sustained voltage output time h i e 48 h in phase ⅰ and 36 h in phase ⅱ and r was the average cod revoval efficiency of mfcs i e 83 in phase ⅰ and 88 in phase ⅱ accordingly additionally the polarization and power density curves were plotted through shifting the mfcs external resistance rising from 0 5 kω to 5 kω at a constant interval of 0 5 kω the electron transfer et efficiency in each acidogenic fermenter was calculated using eq 4 luo et al 2022 4 et efficiency total vfas mmol e fermentation substrates mmol e 100 where the number of electrons contained in the substrates i e was and total vfas i e acetate propionate butyrate and valerate are 8 8 14 20 and 26 respectively the vfas increase efficiency in different acidogenic fermentations with various endogenous rms

contents of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and valeric acid in acidogenic fermentation on day 5 and day 1 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis the operations and analysis in phase ⅰ phase ⅱ and phase ⅲ were conducted in triplicate spss 20 0 statistical software was used for analysis of variance anova one way anova was used to evaluate the significant difference between various samples and the confidence interval was 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 was pretreatments and endogenous rms deriving via mfcs 3 1 1 was pretreatments and mfcs running characteristics the was could be solubilized obviously with the scod release to 917 25 6 mg l including soluble protein of 484 38 14 53 mg l and carbohydrate of 130 06 3 91 mg l by mc pretreatment 964 21 6 mg l containing soluble protein of 522 18 15 67 mg l and carbohydrate of 140 21 4 21 mg l by h pretreatment and 1043 27 4 mg l covering soluble protein of 563 22 16 89 mg l and carbohydrate of 151 23 4 54 mg l by f t pretreatment shown in fig 1 a and b after the mfcs treatment i e phase ⅰ ca 83 of soluble organic matrix in was supernatants could be biodegraded within 48 h with effluent cod values of 166 32 12 89 mg l in mc pretreatment was supernatant fed mfc 149 34 11 45 mg l in h pretreatment was supernatant fed mfc and 163 42 11 22 mg l in f t pretreatment was supernatant fed mfc fig 1 b together with 0 56 0 61 v voltage output 0 80 0 95 w m2 power density and 1 26 1 50 kwh kg cod bioelectricity generation table 1 which were consistent with similar studies previously el chakhtoura et al 2014 chandrasekhar and ahn 2017 xin and qiu 2021 and supported by the results of 3d eem spectra fig 1 c in terms of dynamic changes of organic matters during the pretreatments and mfcs treatment in phase ⅰ shown in tables s1 s3 and table s6 in supplementary material file the species and relative content of ssrms emerged gradually after the pretreatments and mfcs treatment respectively just 11 organic compounds could be detected in the original supernatant of raw was without any potential capability of shuttling electrons in table s6 however such situation changed obviously with 21 21 and 31 organic matters being monitored clearly after f t mc and h pretreatment and the subsequent mfcs treatment shown in tables s1 s3 meanwhile the organic compounds with potentials of electron shuttling increased distinctly after mfcs treatment such results indicated that ssrms could be harvested by mfcs effectively supported previously xin et al 2020 xu et al 2019b yousaf et al 2017 3 1 2 ssrms deriving and characteristics the main peaks of a ex em 260 280 nm 330 380 nm and b ex em 200 240 nm 320 390 nm were emerged simultaneously in influents of mfcs i e was supernatants after pretreatments shown in fig 1c ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ however such peaks disappeared obviously in their corresponding effluents fig 1c ⅳ ⅴ and ⅵ but a new weak peak c occurred interestingly located at ex em 280 320 nm 380 450 nm in general the peaks located at ex less than 250 nm and em less than 350 nm peak b in this study were associated with simple aromatic proteins e g tyrosine while the ones located at ex of 250 280 nm and em less than 380 nm peak a in this study were related to soluble microbial byproduct like material which were highly degradable organic substances for microorganisms consumption chen et al 2003 he et al 2011 the peaks at longer ex of surpassing 280 nm and longer em of over 380 nm i e peak c were related to humic acid like substances he et al 2011 moreover the cv profiles changes of was supernatants from pretreatments indicated the redox property as electron shuttles was improved obviously after mfcs treatment shown in fig 2 which was supported by xu et al s similar finding with stating that the cv profiles changed by the exogenous electron shuttles of microalgal extracellular metabolites secreted by chlorella sp an3 and chlorella sp an6 xu et al 2019a furthermore some refractory macromolecules e g humus and lignocellulose produced or accumulated from the decay and transformation of organic substances in wastewater or excess sludge contained active functional groups of carboxylic acid phenolic alcoholic hydroxyls quinone and ketone groups with a high degree of aromaticity yuan et al 2017 he et al 2022 such multiple functional groups endowed these macromolecules with electron transferring capability etc i e electrons shuttling due to quinone and ketone groups for enhancing organics acidification yuan et al 2017 li et al 2019 regarding on the functions elucidation of rms their chemical structures played a vital role in shaping the chemical or physical characteristics e g polar or non polar and functions e g lewis acids electrophiles oxidants or lewis bases nucleophiles reductants and reactivities hsueh et al 2019 generally there were three factors of chemical structures endowing rms with electron shuttling transferring via delocalizing electrons and radicals during the redox reactions ⅰ the aromaticity the resonance effects by the aromaticity i e substances with aromatic ring s gave the rms capabilities of forming the structures that could delocalize electrons and radicals during the redox reactions which resulted in significant redox reversibility greater electrochemical stability and enhancing the reversible redox mediating capabilities mcmurry 2015 hsueh et al 2019 ⅱ substituent effects on benzenes polybenzenes chen et al found that the suitably placed hydroxyl and amino substituents e g ortho and para resulted in typical reduction and oxidation peaks characteristic of rms chen et al 2013a the atoms of o and n were bounded on the aromatic rings would cause the lone pair electrons on o or n which was capable to act as electron donors via resonance effects in the reduced forms i e higher electron densities and more electrochemically active mcmurry 2015 moreover the rms with hydroxyl substituents presented more stable characteristics than amino groups by the electrochemical redox behaviors comparison chen et al 2013a ⅲ the substituent position the substitutional patterns of meta ortho or para of functional groups on an aromatic ring influenced the reactivity and regioselectivity of electrophilic nucleophilic aromatic substitutions via inductive and resonance effects mcmurry 2015 hsueh et al 2019 some highly visible redox peaks could be detected in the cv profiles of benzene based rms with hydroxyl or amino groups arranged at ortho and para positions previously such as 2 ap 4 ap 1 2 diaminobenzene catechol hydroquinone caffeic acid and paracetamol chen et al 2013a 2013b sýs et al 2017 it could be attributed to the ortho and para positioned hydroxyl amino groups on the aromatic ring could stabilize the radicals and charges in the intermediates or transition states during the redox reactions of rms via resonance effects due to the lone pairs on oxygen and nitrogen and then mediating accelerating such redox process mcmurry 2015 farhoosh et al 2016 hsueh et al 2019 accordingly the dissolved organic matters dom of sludge contained the following apportions 40 50 of proteinaceous compounds 10 15 of carbohydrates 10 15 of humic substance 3 5 of lipids 3 5 of lignins 2 5 of organic acids and 1 2 of organic micropollutants xiao et al 2020 from the eem spectra changes fig 1c and the gc ms results in tables s1 s3 in supplementary material more substances with aromatic ring and nh2 and oh groups could be enriched after the mfcs treatment as compared with the corresponding influent it could be concluded that the mfcs treatment played a substrate screening role sufficiently by removing degradable ones and remaining endogenous rms substances from sludge e g humic substance lignins or other macromoleculars e g high aromatic compounds as a high efficiency selector for obtaining ssrms supported previously xin et al 2020 2022 among them the humic acid was capable to promote the electron transferring efficiency for organics rapid conversion in the acidogenic phase and also changed the oxidation reduction quality of the acidogenic fermentation system li et al 2019 moreover the lignins enhanced the acidogenesis process possibly by perfecting the electron transfer chain in the fermentation system with the assistance of its quinone structure he et al 2022 thus the ssrms with electron transferring capabilities could be harvested feasibly via mfcs from sludge solid phase regarding the practical application the electrode material played a vital role in the feasibility of using mfcs in practice electrode material should have some merits of non corrosive biocompatible high porosity and surface area good electrical conductivity stability good mechanical strength and cost effective while the nanomaterials 3d structuring bio cathode conductive polymers and composite materials presented great potential for developing better electrodes and improving performance of mfcs nawaz et al 2020 subsequently an effective method of coating individual bacterial cells with conjugated polymers on as electrodes in mfcs which showed a 14 1 times higher power density output comparatively song et al 2017 moreover immobilization of rms i e neutral red on carbon surface of electrodes would significantly increase the power output of mfcs and low cost effectiveness wang et al 2011 besides ge and he operated a 200 l modularized microbial fuel cell for treating wastewater with stating that the capital cost of the mfc system could be comparable to that of small wastewater treatment facilities which encouraged the further development of mfc technology with reducing costs and improving performance towards sustainable operation ge and he 2016 accordingly it was reasonable to anticipate that high performance mfcs would sooner be possible for practical applications with the rapid development of materials science 3 2 ssrms enhancing bioelectrogenesis 3 2 1 bioelectrogenesis enhancing properties the bioelectrogenesis properties of voltage output power density and bioelectricity conversion efficiency bce in mfcs were boosted obviously with adding ssrms in phase ⅱ shown in fig 3 the maximum voltage output of these mfcs increased by 19 36 and 26 improved to 0 63 v 0 72 v and 0 67 v with the mc h and f t pretreatment ssrms addition respectively as compared with the control test fig 3a meanwhile the peak power density increased to 1 02 w cm2 1 33 w cm2 and 1 15 w cm2 respectively fig 3b accordingly the bioelectricity conversion efficiency could be elevated by 6 7 39 and 20 with the ssrms additions comparatively fig 3c such mfcs running properties exceeded the ones fed with similar feeds previously such as organic fraction of municipal solid waste el chakhtoura et al 2014 kitchen garbage moqsud et al 2014 and food waste jia et al 2013 moreover the cod removal efficiency surpassed 85 with less running time used i e 36 h such results inferred that the ssrms addition boosted the bioelectricity conversion and organic substrates biodegradation by triggering extracellular electron transfer eet capabilities with forming more active electroactive biofilms chen et al 2013a yuan et al 2017 3 2 2 bioelectrogenesis enhancement related microbial profiles by ssrms the pca analysis indicated that ssrms addition reduced the anodic microbial community dissimilarity by shortening the distance among r6 r7 and r8 as compared with that with r5 in fig 4a supported by the bray curtis distance coefficients changes between samples in fig s1 in which the bray curtis distance coefficients among r6 r7 and r8 ranged at 0 0 43 and 0 5 whereas such coefficients increased to 0 8 0 82 and 0 84 between r5 with samples added ssrms r6 r7 and r8 in terms of anodic microbial profiles the α diversity indexes of shannon index from 3 156 in r5 to 4 732 in r8 chao1 index from 567 in r5 to 689 in r8 and ace index from 563 827 in r5 to 685 820 in r8 were improved obviously in anodic biofilms samples with adding ssrms table 2 moreover the microbial distributive evenness within the anodic community increased clearly i e relatively high evenness with the ssrms addition by the shannoneven index increase from 0 509 r5 to 0 727 r8 which indicated that the ssrms addition was conducive to form a higher diversity and more even anodic microbial community with enhancing the stability of good running performance supported previously marzorati et al 2008 carballa et al 2015 meanwhile the anodic microbial community structure and abundance shifted clearly with ssrms addition as shown in fig 4b in r5 the dyella 19 62 enterobacter 15 90 related to bioelectrogenesis logan et al 2019 burkholderia 11 03 responsible for organic matters bioconversion to electric energy patil et al 2009 pandoraea 1 47 and acidocella 2 52 contributing to complex organic matters degradation eze et al 2021 were the dominant members while more genera emerged in the mfcs r6 r7 and r8 with rms addition of pseudomonas 9 71 in r6 7 01 in r7 and 6 02 in r8 as one kind of electro active microorganisms and responsible for electrogenesis

and zoogloea were responsible for complicated organics biodegradation and biotransformation to bioavailable small molecular organics which were further utilized for completing bioelectrogenesis by exoelectrogens of enterobacter burkholderia pseudomonas and geobacter etc with the ssrms addition the ssrms addition played an important role in reshaping anodic microbial community for establishing functions with robust and well performing characteristics supported by results of table 2 and fig 3 3 2 3 mechanism clarification fig 4c depicted the relative frequency changes of anodic microbial functional genes related to organic matters biodegradation and bioelectrogenesis in mfcs with adding ssrms the genes relative abundances related to translation function were improved clearly ca 8 5 9 0 in the ssrms mfcs t1 t2 and t3 vs control tests ca 7 0 7 5 in c1 c2 and c3 moreover the total gene relative abundances of ten classes of functions listed in fig 4c presented a higher degree in t group than those in c group more specifically the relative frequency of genes with functions of signal transduction transport and catabolism environmental adaptation cell motility translation energy metabolism transcription amino acid metabolism etc were boosted significantly in t group than those in c group i e the red box part in fig s2 the exogenous biodegradation and metabolism transport and catabolism energy metabolism were associated with the degradation of various organic matters deng et al 2021 meanwhile the amino acid metabolic pathways mainly were associated with proteins and amino acids biodegradation and bioconversion xia et al 2019 previous studies also found that the exogenous rms of riboflavin lawsone and anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs were capable to elevate the abundance of genes related to transport and metabolism of carbohydrate amino acid and energy production for better biotransformation of waste sludge huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 such results indicated that ssrms were capable to elevate the relative abundance of functional genes expression and enhance the metabolic activities of anodic members which played a positive role in enhancing bioelectrogenesis via accelerating organics matters biodegradation and bioconversion based on metatranscriptome analysis the specific function genes expression changes during bioelectrogenesis process prompted by ssrms were listed in table 3 the up regulated differentially expressed genes degs were related to putative abc transporter substrate binding protein a gene id of unigene 551730 ko of k01999 and log2fc of 7 46 acetyl coa c acyltransferase a gene id of unigene 183288 ko of k000626 and log2fc of 9 48 6 phosphofructokinase a gene id of unigene 3000243 ko of k21071 and log2fc of 6 08 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 homolog bacteroid a gene id of unigene 2991548 ko of k00404 and log2fc of 6 52 while the down regulated genes were linked with nadh dehydrogenase subunit 7 a gene id of unigene 1912273 ko of k03935 and log2fc of 6 98 the abc transporter substrate binding protein a was responsible for the transports of sugars amino acids peptides metal ions iron carriers and vitamins khandavilli et al 2008 while the acetyl coa c acyltransferase a was related to the β oxidation of fatty acids zhang et al 2019b the 6 phosphofructokinase a was a rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis process and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 homolog was associated with electrons transfer to the terminal electron acceptors thom 2008 moreover the down regulation of genes related to nadh dehydrogenase subunit 7 a meant a reduction in expression of nadh dehydrogenase would be consistent with a physiological shift to fermentation and away from oxidative phosphorylation loftie eaton et al 2013 more specifically fig 5 further displayed the detailed degs during bioelectrogenesis process affected by ssrms which showed that the nuo j subunit coding gene of nadh dehydrogenase i e complex ⅰ was down regulated green color while the b subunit ⅰ coding gene of cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase was up regulated red color comparatively the subunit nuo j was capable to interweave between subunits of nuo k a and n and stabilized the complex ⅰ efremov and sazanov 2011 moreover the subunit nuo j could act the proton pumping function by conformational changes between discontinuous transmembrane helices baradaran et al 2013 meanwhile cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase was generally thought to endow the bacterium with adaptive and competitive advantage over other microorganisms for supporting the biofilm growth and contributing to atp production barco et al 2015 kučera and sedláček 2020 overall the proton pumping function of complex ⅰ was weakened and cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase for atp synthase was improved by the influence of ssrms during the bioelectrogenesis process 3 3 ssrms enhancing was acidogenic fermentation 3 3 1 vfas improvement in was acidogenic fermentation during the was acidogenic fermentation phase ⅲ the vfas production could be improved clearly with ssrms addition as shown in fig 6 around 18 60 of acetic acid 19 30 of propionic acid 3 50 of butyric acid and 25 35 of valeric acid could be boosted simultaneously with rms addition generated from various was pretreatments comparatively fig 6a d more noticeably the relative proportion of acetic and butyric acids reduced obviously from the initial fermentation state day 1 to the vfas rapid increase stage day 5 ca 50 to 20 for acetic acid and ca 25 to 10 for butyric acid fig 6e meanwhile the propionic acid increased clearly from ca 20 day 1 to 60 day 5 such results indicated that ssrms addition not only triggered more vfas generation but also changed the individual vfa accumulation efficiency via the role they played as active terminal electron acceptors teas or the electron transferring chains etc by their functional groups e g quinone etc of humic acid li et al 2019 and confirmed by the electron transfer efficiency improvements in fig 7a and fig s3 the proportion of individual vfa might be attributed to two reasons ⅰ the vfa bioconversion efficiency enhanced by the ssrms addition acted as electron acceptors e g the acetate acid generation efficiency of glyceradehyde 3p d glycerate 1 3 diphosphate and pyruvate acetyl coa was strengthened with humic acid addition liu et al 2015 ⅱ the β oxidation of butyric acid by butyrate oxidizing bacterium also contributed to the individual vfa changes meng et al 2022 the vfas increase efficiency presented a positive correlation with the electron transfer increase efficiency by ssrms furthermore the vs ts reduction efficiency in was fermentation also was enhanced around 7 48 11 37 fig 7b and the key hydrolytic enzymes activities i e protease and α glucosidase in fig 7c were elevated slightly with ssrms addition which suggested that ssrms strengthened the sludge organics remove efficiency and contributed to the sludge hydrolysis positively in acidogenic fermentation for a higher vfas bioconversion efficiency supported by huang et al s study with proposing that the rms of riboflavin and lawsone boosted the hydrolyric enzymes of protease and promoted protein dependent fermentation for increasing maximum vfas accumulation by 43 9 and 42 5 respectively huang et al 2019 3 3 2 anaerobic acidogenesis enhancement related microbial profiles microbial α diverisity indexes in was acidogenic fermentations with adding ssrms on day1 initial fermentation stage and day 5 vfas rapid accumulation stage were listed in table 4 it was interesting that the ssrms addition prompted microbial diversity from day 1 to day 5 shannon index increase from 5 45 to 5 55 in f t group 5 48 to 5 58 in mc group and 5 36 to 5 58 in h group chao1 index increase from 2193 90 to 2200 17 in f t group 2165 39 to 2208 01 in mc group and 2243 16 to 2274 61 in h group as compared with the control test shannon index of 5 69 and 5 65 and chao1 index of 2224 19 and 2201 44 meanwhile the shannoneven index increased slightly from day 1 to day 5 0 72 to 0 73 in f t and mc groups and 0 70 to 0 73 in h group by the comparison of control group around 0 74 on day 1 and day 5 such finding was consistent with the community evenness changes in anodic biofilms affected by ssrms i e table 2 in this study which further inferred that higher diversity was capable to steer a running stability with good performing properties while the good evenness offered a circumstance that both key completing a big fraction of functioning and team microbial members exploiting all metabolic pathways mostly to guarantee well performance i e higher vfas generation within the microbial community carballa et al 2015 microbial community dissimilarity was increased in the was acidogenic fermentation process with adding ssrms fig 8 the pca analysis indicated that ssrms enlarged the acidogenic community dissimilarity by separating the samples on day 1 and day 5 into two parts clearly fig 8a moreover the balloon diagram fig 8b and table s4 further reveal the microbial community composition differences on day 1 and day 5 in was acidogenesis with adding ssrms as compared with the main microbial members at initial fermentation stage the relative abundance of below main members increased clearly for vfas production at vfas rapid accumulation stage clostridium 5 923 6 380 on day 5 vs 5 071 6 328 on day 1 associated with fermentation and acetogenesis processes to generate acetate rao et al 2018 huang et al 2019 acinetobacter 5 249 7 875 on day 5 vs 1 916 4 118 on day 1 responsible for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins pang et al 2020 anaerolineaceae 11 763 11 866 on day 5 vs 8 773 12 741 on day 1 with a fermentative metabolism by utilizing carbohydrates and proteinaceous carbon sources under anaerobic conditions mcllroy et al 2017 prolixibacteraceae 8 952 11 146 on day 5 vs 5 690 7 025 on day 1 with saccharolytic and proteolytic metabolisms podosokorskaya et al 2020 betaproteobacteria 3 513 3 873 on day 5 vs 3 129 3 956 on day 1 rhodocyclaceae 2 812 3 331 on day 5 vs 2 317 2 508 on day 1 comamonadaceae 1 679 1 842 on day 5 vs

chloroflexi 1 121 1 411 on day 5 vs 1 034 1 113 on day 1 responsible for the degradation of soluble microbial products smp and other complicated substrates hu et al 2020 and clostridiales 1 183 1 436 on day 5 vs 0 895 1 001 on day 1 contributing to hydrolysis of complex substances azman et al 2017 such key members played a synergic role in prompting vfas production in was acidogenic fermentation whose relative abundance correlated positively with adding ssrms 3 3 3 mechanism elucidations the relative abundances of genes expression of metabolic functions based on kegg database in anaerobic acidogenesis with ssrms addition in phase ⅲ were listed in table 5 it was obvious that the relevant genes encoding main metabolisms of amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism enzyme families environmental information processing of membrane transport genetic information processing of transcription and translation presented a higher relative proportion on day 5 vs those on day 1 and control tests respectively moreover the functional heatmap suggested that the metabolic functions of nitrogen respiration nitrate respiration sulfate respiration nitrogen fixation nitrification methylotrophy and nitrite respiration presented higher abundances on fermentation day 5 than those on day 1 and control test fig s4 which indicated that ssrms triggered the protein dependent fermentation for more vfas bioconversion by enhancing amino acids bioconversion and organic nitrogen respiration supported previously liu et al 2015 huang et al 2019 based on the aforesaid results figs 3 8 figs s1 s4 tables 2 5 and tables s1 s4 a schematic diagram for illustrating the microbial mechanism for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis by ssrms was established in fig 9 in the hydrolysis step the key hydrolytic enzymes of protease and α glucosidase could be increased slightly due to the redox reactions between pairs of amino acids stickland reaction huang et al 2019 and glycolysis and the greater hydrophobic property of humic acids rms for sludge solubilization liu et al 2015 the monomer molecules of momosaccharides and amino acids were delivered into inside of microbial cells via transmembrane transport for initiating the acidogenesis the ssrms played dual roles in enhancing acidogenesis and bioelectrogenesis ⅰ presented a potential influence on boosting the functional genes expression of dominant acidogens during fermentation e g genetic information processing of transcription and translation and increasing amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism etc supported by the results of tables 4 and s4 figs 4 6 and s4 and previous studies with stating that the rms of riboflavin lawsone and anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs increased the abundance of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of carbohydrate amino acid and energy production during the anaerobic fermentation of waste sludge huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 ⅱ acted as terminal electron acceptors teas or electron shuttles by the functional groups for accepting or transferring the surplus electrons generated by the fermenting process to other substrates in normal acidogenic process when the hydrogen pressure would no longer be a decisive factor li et al 2019 e g β oxidation of butyric acid or acetic acid oxidation by fatty acids utilizing bacteria in fig 9 such surplus electrons could be further transferred to electron acceptor microorganisms e g electro active microorganisms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis supported by the results of figs 3 5 7 s2 and s3 tables 3 and 5 and other previous studies li et al proposed that the functional groups quinone and other nitrogen sulfur groups etc of humic acid ha a main component of ssrms were capable to make good electron transferring chains etc and contributed to the acidogenesis as electron transport agents li et al 2019 liu et al found that a commercially available humic acid of shha showed a strong electron accepting capacity for more acetic acid production liu et al 2015 the quinone redox mediators were capable to strengthen the syntrophic metabolism of interspecies electron transfer for enhancing the biotransformation or bioelectrogenesis efficiency chen et al 2013b zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 meanwhile the transcription of genes encoding membrane functional proteins of exoelectrogens were influenced significantly with diminishing the nadh dehydrogenase activity and elevating cytochrome c oxidase activity supported by table 3 such results inferred that ssrms might undertake partial function of nadh dehydrogenase reactions as a competitor and improved cytochrome c oxidase effect for better bioenergy generation and substrates biodegradation supported previously hsueh et al 2019 xu et al 2019a 2019b 3 4 finding implications based on the bioelectrogenesis prompting efficiency of 0 47 kwh kg cod 1 67 kwh kg cod 1 20 kwh kg cod 0 47 kwh kg cod in fig 3c a total potential bioelectricity of ca 20 billion kwh could be further generated assisted by ssrms according to the total production of 60 million tonnes in 2020 in china wu et al 2021 under vs ts of 50 and the conversion coefficient of 1 42 g cod g vss between cod and vs assessed by c5h7no2 xin et al 2018 furthermore according to the acidogenesis enhancing efficiency of acetic acid of 160 propionic acid of 125 butyric acid of 130 and valeric acid of 135 by ssrms in fig 6 a mean vfas boosting efficiency of 37 5 160 125 130 135 400 400 100 37 5 could be reached in this study based on the initial was with ts of 11 14 0 85 g l and vs of 6 45 0 32 g l meanwhile the vs ts enhancement reduction efficiency of 11 37 would led to a further was reduction of 6 82 million tonnes based on the total was production of 60 million tonnes in 2020 in china wu et al 2021 more importantly the ssrms like substances were extensively enriched in was solid phase which could be regarded as a huge rms reservoir with infinite applicative potentials this study offered a novel and promising enhancing strategy for boosting was to bioenergy bioresource efficiency with well process sustainability 4 conclusion this study investigated the availability of ssrms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis by deciphering characteristics and mechanisms ssrms obtained via mfcs were capable to boost 36 and 39 increases of voltage output and bioelectricity bioconversion efficiency respectively meanwhile the acidogenesis could be improved by a mean value of 37 5 of vfas production within five fermentation days comparatively mechanically the ssrms exerted roles of electron transferring or as terminal electron acceptors with presenting an enhancing function by affecting functional proteins in complex ⅰ and ⅳ for enhancing electron transferring efficiency in biolectrogenesis and acidogenesis moreover ssrms assisted microbial metabolism functions by shifting function genes expression degree with improving protein and carbohydrate metabolisms related functions consequently ssrms shifted microbial community structure with enriching key members abundance increasing microbial

14842,anaerobic biological treatment was regarded as one of promising options for realizing concurrent was reduction stabilization and bioenergy bioresource recycle but the relatively low treatment efficiency limited its spreading application toward larger scale considerably in china aimed at such barrier this study offered a novel enhancing strategy for achieving high efficiency of bioenergy bioresource recycle from was anaerobic treatment via improving bioelectrogenesis acidogenesis using sludge source redox mediators ssrms ssrms not only facilitated bioeletrogenesis with an increasing efficiency of 36 for voltage output and 39 for bioelectricity bioconversion but also enhanced acidogenesis of was with a mean elevating efficiency of 37 5 of volatile fatty acids vfas production within 5 d mechanistic investigations indicated that ssrms had a potential influence on improving the protein and carbohydrate metabolisms related genes expression for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis moreover ssrms exerted roles of electrochemical catalysts or as terminal electron acceptors with affecting functional proteins of complexes of ⅰ and ⅳ in electron transfer chains for improving electron transfer efficiency meanwhile the core members abundance microbial diversity and community distributive evenness were prompted concurrently for carrying out superior bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis a schematic illustration was established for demonstrating the mechanism of ssrms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis via changing microbial metabolism functions enhancing electron transfer efficiency and regulating functional genes expression of functional proteins up regulating cytochrome c oxidase and down regulating nadh dehydrogenase this study provided an effective enhancing strategy for facilitating was bioconversion to bioenergy bioresource with well process sustainability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge sludge source redox mediators bioelectrogenesis acidogenic fermentation electron transfer efficiency microbial mechanisms data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction as a main byproduct generated from traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps with using activated sludge method the waste activated sludge was was produced rapidly with an estimate of 66 64 million tonnes in 2020 in china dai et al 2022 which contained ca 30 million tonnes of organic substances assessed by the volatile solid vs total solid ts of 50 roughly chen et al 2020 dai et al 2022 liao and li 2015 however the bioresource or bioenergy recycling efficiency from such huge organic matters are at relatively low levels presently less than 20 waste sludge anaerobic digestion plants can be operated normally in china with below 3 of waste sludge anaerobic treatment efficiency chen et al 2020 due to its complex composition and low biodegradability thus numerous pretreatments e g mechanical thermal chemical biological or combined pretreatments ariunbaatar et al 2014 were applied for realizing was solubilization and enhancing anaerobic fermentation efficiency for obtaining biogas volatile fatty acids vfas huang et al 2019 medium chain carboxylic acids wu et al 2021 pha synthesis rodriguez perez et al 2018 plant growth biostimulants tang et al 2022 or high value products of medium chain fatty acids mcfas and long chain alcohols lcas luo et al 2022 consequentially such pretreatments added the total cost of was treatment which accounted for more than 40 of total operating expense in wwtps wu et al 2021 on the other hand improving microbial metabolic functions in anaerobic treatment bioprocess via triggering rates of redox reactions by catalytically accelerating electron transport efficiency with using redox mediators rms would be another effective stimulating strategy for boosting was treatment efficiency hsueh et al 2019 some exogenous rms have been confirmed to be popularly used in cellular respiratory systems metabolisms in organisms and widely applied to support global lives such as neutral red phenoxazine 2 aminophenol quinones series etc hsueh et al 2019 some decolorized intermediates e g 2 aminophenol amine phenolic compounds and plant derived substances e g scutellaria baicalensis georgi and ingredients anthocyanin abundant plant extracts and microalgal metabolites could act as exogenous electron shuttles to promote anaerobic bioprocess e g bioelectrogenesis with a higher organics degradation efficiency chen et al 2013a 2013b zhang et al 2019a xu et al 2019a 2019b but the disadvantages of this enhancing way couldn t be ignored on one hand such exogenous electron shuttles would be lost completely after the utilization which couldn t be reused any more on the other hand the extraction or obtainment of these exogenous rms increased the total operation cost inevitably xu et al 2019b comparatively the endogenous ones displayed superior advantages in terms of source of generation e g could be produced via mfcs nawaz et al 2020 yousaf et al 2017 and electron transferring capabilities for promoting organic matters biodegradation malvankar and lovley 2012 shen et al 2014 thus considerable emphasis has been shifted to endogenous rms with huge applicative potentials up to present the humic substances hss were capable to play roles of terminal electron acceptors tea or electron transferring chains etc by functional groups e g quinone groups as endogenous rms for stimulating anaerobic acidogenesis and promoting vfas production liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 it suggested that the endogenous rms used for enhancing anaerobic bioprocess might be one of effective ways for realizing high efficiency bioenergy bioresource recycling with relatively low cost supported previously xin et al 2020 more noticeably the endogenous rms e g hss were enriched abundantly in solid phase of was which accounted for ca 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss li et al 2019 and ca 10 15 of the total dissolved organic matter dom of was xiao et al 2020 furthermore a recent study indicated that the lignins could mediate electron transfer for enhancing was acidogenesis acted as electron shuttles he et al 2022 which occupied a relative proportion of ca 3 5 in dom of was xiao et al 2020 however the spontaneous release efficiency of such endogenous rms from solid phase into liquid phase of was was at a relatively low level during the normal hydrolysis because of the stable structure of extracellular polymeric substance eps as well as the dynamic limits recently the rapid development of bioelectrochemical systems bes e g microbial fuel cells mfcs offered an effective option for obtaining such endogenous rms from sludge based on two kinds of key cooperators of fermentative bacteria e g acidogens and exoelectrogens for degrading biodegradable organics and remaining rms e g hss etc supported by our previous studies with stating that mfcs could be used as a producer for obtaining endogenous rms from sludge infinitely xin et al 2020 2022 such viewpoint was supported previously as well yousaf et al proposed that the endogenous rm of 5 methyl 1 hydroxy phenazine could be produced in mfcs and positively correlated with power generation yousaf et al 2017 moreover the soluble electron shuttles of pyocyanins flavins and quinones could be secreted by functional microbes and accumulated within mfcs which acted as soluble rms and interacted with cytochromes for prompting extracellular electron transfer process malvankar and lovley 2012 nawaz et al 2020 shen et al 2014 based on aforesaid background harvesting endogenous rms i e sludge source rms ssrms via mfcs for enhancing anaerobic bioprocess with expectations of high efficiency bioenergy bioresource recycle would be a promising way for realizing was proper treatment management however scarce emphasis has been focused sufficiently on this topic while the microbial mechanisms have been barely revealed up to present in terms of functional genes expression and activity changes of membrane functional proteins related to electron transfer in anaerobic bioprocess according to such thread the main aim of this study was to investigate the availability of ssrms harvested by mfcs for improving bioelectricity and bioresource i e vfas recycle efficiency from waste sludge via boosting bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis exhaustively on one hand the stimulating characteristics of bioelectrogenesis voltage output power density bioelectricity generation efficiency etc and acidogenesis vfas promotion vs ts reduction etc were demonstrated sufficiently on the other hand the microbial mechanism of ssrms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis were clarified comprehensively 2 materials and methods 2 1 was source and pretreatments the raw was used in this study was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank of a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp in songshan lake district of dongguan city in pr china prior to the practical pretreatments the raw was was filtered with screen 1 0 mm 1 0 mm to remove impurities and concentrated by settling at 4 c for 24 h finally the detailed properties of the collected was were total solid ts 13 48 0 32 g l volatile

operations were listed in the supplementary materials 2 2 experiment protocol and operations the whole experiment protocol in this study was divided into three phases which contained the ssrms harvest phase ⅰ bioelectrogenesis process enhancement phase ⅱ and anaerobic acidogenic fermentation boost by ssrms phase ⅲ respectively 2 2 1 endogenous rms obtainment through mfcs phase ⅰ the typical cylinder type single chamber air cathode microbial fuel cells mfcs devices were used in this study with an effective volume of 28 0 ml which was made of polymethyl methacrylate as depicted previously xin et al 2020 2022 the anode was fabricated from carbon brush with an effective working area of 7 8 cm2 installed on one side of mfcs while a 3 cm diameter air cathode made of plain carbon cloth e tek usa coupled with a platinum catalyst 0 35 mg cm2 was installed on the other side of the mfcs the external circuit of each mfc were established using a titanium wire from the cathode to the anode across an external resistor r 1 0 kω a data acquisition card usbdaq 580i china linked with a computer was adopted for recording the mfcs output voltage every 10 min such one group of mfcs was used to treat was supernatants generated from the three kinds of pretreatments above for achieving soluble organics biodegradation and gathering the remaining substances including ssrms while one of the mfcs was fed with pure glucose with a similar influent cod level as a control test labeled as r1 with an influent cod content level of 1 067 g l based on a previous study xin et al 2019 the mfcs fed with was supernatants from the mc pretreatment h pretreatment and f t pretreatment were labeled as r2 r3 and r4 with influent cod levels of 0 917 g l 0 964 g l 1 043 g l respectively table 1 all mfcs were operated in batch fed mode with a 3 d operation as a running cycle after one stable operational cycle the remaining liquid in mfcs were collected for the next exploration when the output voltage was less than 0 05 v according to previous studies xin et al 2019 2020 2022 the operation of these sequential batch mfcs was performed at 30 c in a lab scale thermostat while this experiment period was marked as phase ⅰ the other solutions of phosphate buffered saline pbs vitamin solution and mineral solution were listed in supplementary materials according to a previous study xin et al 2022 2 2 2 bioelectrogenesis process enhancement by ssrms phase ⅱ another group of mfcs r5 r8 similar mfcs like the ones used in phase ⅰ were used for revealing the bioelectrogenesis enhancement by the ssrms obtained in phase ⅰ all mfcs were fed with identical substrate of pure glucose with an equal influent cod level of ca 1 0 g l the effluents rich in ssrms of r2 r3 and r4 generated in phase ⅰ were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min the corresponding supernatant after centrifugation was added into r6 r7 and r8 respectively ca 5 0 ml for each stable running cycle the r5 was supplied with identical volume 5 0 ml of sterile purified water as the control reactor the remaining operations of r5 r8 were identical completely with the mfcs operations in phase ⅰ the output voltage was monitored and recorded by a data acquisition card usbdaq 580i china linked with a computer while the mfcs were operated in sequence batch mode as well when the output voltage was less than 0 05 v after a 3 d running cycle the mfcs would be emptied and started the next running cycle subsequently this experiment of bioelectrogenesis enhancement by ssrms was marked as phase ⅱ 2 2 3 anaerobic acidogenic fermentation boost by ssrms phase ⅲ a group of anaerobic bottles working volume of 100 ml for each was adopted for investigating the acidogenic fermentation improvement by ssrms the detailed composition of each anaerobic bottle contained 70 ml of raw was without being pretreated ca 20 ml of inoculum and 10 ml of ssrms i e the effluents of r2 r3 and r4 generated in phase ⅰ respectively while one of them added identical volume of sterile purified water instead of ssrms as the control test the inoculum for the start up of acidogenic fermentations were taken from a full scale waste sludge anaerobic digestion tank in songshan lake district of dongguan city in pr china with detailed properties ts of 11 14 0 85 g l vs of 6 45 0 32 g l and ph of 6 8 0 1 all anaerobic fermentation bottles were sealed up by using rubber stoppers in a constant temperature shaker at 35 1 c with a rotating speed of 120 r min the acidogenic fermentation experiments were conducted in triplicate each anaerobic fermentation period was ca 8 d while ca 50 ml of fermentative sludge was taken out for further analysis at an interval of 2 d according to similar studies pang et al 2022 xie et al 2022 2 3 general analysis the soluble cod total cod ts and vs of was were measured according to a previous standard method rice et al 2012 the soluble protein was analyzed lowry folin method with using bsa as the reference standard oliver et al 1951 while the soluble carbohydrate content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method michel et al 1956 the dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured by a multifunctional instrument hanna italy the 3 dimensional fluorescence intensity analysis of soluble organics changes in sludge supernatant before after mfc treatment was conducted with using an excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi the emission em wavelength was ranged from 200 nm to 750 nm with a rising interval of 5 nm while the excitation ex wavelength was set as from 200 nm to 700 nm with a 10 nm sampling interval and a scanning speed of 10 000 nm min the cyclic voltammetry cv measurement of mfcs influent and effluent for depicting the redox property changes was conducted via an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua of china the working electrodes consisted of a glassy carbon electrode 0 03 cm2 a platinum electrode 1 0 cm2 and a reference electrode hg hgcl filled with saturated kcl aq the scanning rate was set as 10 mv s with a range from 1 5 to 1 5 v ca ten cv scanning cycles were implemented in this study for oxidizing or reducing electrochemically unstable chemical species sufficiently which ensured the reductive and oxidative potential peaks emergence with stable electrochemical properties accordingly xu et al 2019a xin et al 2022 the vfas analysis was implemented via a gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc2030 japan with a flame ionization detector the chromatographic conditions were as follows injector temperature

liquid samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane and then collected in a 1 5 ml gas chromatography vial the formic acid was added to adjust the ph to approximately 4 0 the gc ms analysis was used to identify the chemical substances changes of was supernatant before and after mfcs treatment with various pretreatments in phase ⅰ via an agilent 7890b 5977b gc ms agilent usa all supernatant samples of mfcs influent and effluent were extracted with dichloromethane under neutral ph condition and then dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and finally concentrated to a ultimate volume of ca 2

ev helium was used as the carrier gas the hydrolytic enzymes protease and α glucosidase activities during acidogenic fermentation of was were analyzed as reported previously xie et al 2022 2 4 microbial community characterization microbial diversity sequencing and metatranscriptome analysis were conducted in this study the detailed operations were listed in supplementary materials 2 5 data analysis regarding the bioelectricity generating performance of mfcs in this study the current density i and power density p could be evaluated by the following eq 1 and eq 2 1 i u r a 2 p u 2 r a where u a and r stood for the mfc output voltage v the effective anode working area m2 and the external resistance ω respectively the bioelectricity conversion efficiency bce in kw h kg cod of mfcs fed with various substrates in phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ could be calculated roughly by the following eq 3 as mentioned previously xin and qiu 2021 3 bce u 2 r t 1 0 10 3 kg cod l r 0 028 l 10 3 where t stood for the sustained voltage output time h i e 48 h in phase ⅰ and 36 h in phase ⅱ and r was the average cod revoval efficiency of mfcs i e 83 in phase ⅰ and 88 in phase ⅱ accordingly additionally the polarization and power density curves were plotted through shifting the mfcs external resistance rising from 0 5 kω to 5 kω at a constant interval of 0 5 kω the electron transfer et efficiency in

and the confidence interval was 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 was pretreatments and endogenous rms deriving via mfcs 3 1 1 was pretreatments and mfcs running characteristics the was could be solubilized obviously with the scod release to 917 25 6 mg l including soluble protein of 484 38 14 53 mg l and carbohydrate of 130 06 3 91 mg l by mc pretreatment 964 21 6 mg l containing soluble protein of 522 18 15 67 mg l and carbohydrate of 140 21 4 21 mg l by h pretreatment and 1043 27 4 mg l covering soluble protein of 563 22 16 89 mg l and carbohydrate of 151 23 4 54 mg l by f t pretreatment shown in fig 1 a and b after the mfcs treatment i e phase ⅰ ca 83 of soluble organic matrix in was supernatants could be biodegraded within 48 h with effluent cod values of 166 32 12 89 mg l in mc pretreatment was supernatant fed mfc 149 34 11 45 mg l in h pretreatment was supernatant fed mfc and 163 42 11 22 mg l in f t pretreatment was supernatant fed mfc fig 1 b together with 0 56 0 61 v voltage output 0 80 0 95 w m2 power density and 1 26 1 50 kwh kg cod bioelectricity generation table 1 which were consistent with similar studies previously el chakhtoura et al 2014 chandrasekhar and ahn 2017 xin and qiu 2021 and supported by the results of 3d eem spectra fig 1 c in terms of dynamic changes of organic matters during the pretreatments and mfcs treatment in phase ⅰ shown in tables s1 s3 and table s6 in supplementary material file the species and relative content of ssrms emerged gradually after the pretreatments and mfcs treatment respectively just 11 organic compounds could be detected in the original supernatant of raw was without any potential capability of shuttling electrons in table s6 however such situation changed obviously with 21 21 and 31 organic matters being monitored clearly after f t mc and h pretreatment and the subsequent mfcs treatment shown in tables s1 s3 meanwhile the organic compounds with potentials of electron shuttling increased distinctly after mfcs treatment such results indicated that ssrms could be harvested by mfcs effectively supported previously xin et al 2020 xu et al 2019b yousaf et al 2017 3 1 2 ssrms deriving and characteristics the main peaks of a ex em 260 280 nm 330 380 nm and b ex em 200 240 nm 320 390 nm were emerged simultaneously in influents of mfcs i e was supernatants after pretreatments shown in fig 1c ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ however such peaks disappeared obviously in their corresponding effluents fig 1c ⅳ ⅴ and ⅵ but a new weak peak c occurred interestingly located at ex em 280 320 nm 380 450 nm in general the peaks located at ex less than 250 nm and em less than 350 nm peak b in this study were associated with simple aromatic proteins e g tyrosine while the ones located at ex of 250 280 nm and em less than 380 nm peak a in this study were related to soluble microbial byproduct like material which were highly degradable organic substances for microorganisms consumption chen et al 2003 he et al 2011 the peaks at longer ex of surpassing 280 nm and longer em of over 380 nm i e peak c were related to humic acid like substances he et al 2011 moreover the cv profiles changes of was supernatants from pretreatments indicated the redox property as electron shuttles was improved obviously after mfcs treatment shown in fig 2 which was supported by xu et al s similar finding with stating that the cv profiles changed by the exogenous electron shuttles of microalgal extracellular metabolites secreted by chlorella sp an3 and chlorella sp an6 xu et al 2019a furthermore some refractory macromolecules e g humus and lignocellulose produced or accumulated from the decay and transformation of organic substances in wastewater or excess sludge contained active functional groups of carboxylic acid phenolic alcoholic hydroxyls quinone and ketone groups with a high degree of aromaticity yuan et al 2017 he et al 2022 such multiple functional groups endowed these macromolecules with electron transferring capability etc i e electrons shuttling due to quinone and ketone groups for enhancing organics acidification yuan et al 2017 li et al 2019 regarding on the functions elucidation of rms their chemical structures played a vital role in shaping the chemical or physical characteristics e g polar or non polar and functions e g lewis acids electrophiles oxidants or lewis bases nucleophiles reductants and reactivities hsueh et al 2019 generally there were three factors of chemical structures endowing rms with electron shuttling transferring via delocalizing electrons and radicals during the redox reactions ⅰ the aromaticity the resonance effects by the aromaticity i e substances with aromatic ring s gave the rms capabilities of forming the structures that could delocalize electrons and radicals during the redox reactions which resulted in significant redox reversibility greater electrochemical stability and enhancing the reversible redox mediating capabilities mcmurry 2015 hsueh et al 2019 ⅱ substituent effects on benzenes polybenzenes chen et al found that the suitably placed hydroxyl and amino substituents e g ortho and para resulted in typical reduction and oxidation peaks characteristic of rms chen et al 2013a the atoms of o and n were bounded on the aromatic rings would cause the lone pair electrons on o or n which was capable to act as electron donors via resonance effects in the reduced forms i e higher electron densities and more electrochemically active mcmurry 2015 moreover the rms with hydroxyl substituents presented more stable characteristics than amino groups by the electrochemical redox behaviors comparison chen et al 2013a ⅲ the substituent position the substitutional patterns of meta ortho or para of functional groups on an aromatic ring influenced the reactivity and regioselectivity of electrophilic nucleophilic aromatic substitutions via inductive and resonance effects mcmurry 2015 hsueh et al 2019 some highly visible redox peaks could be detected in the cv profiles of benzene based rms with hydroxyl or amino groups arranged at ortho and para positions previously such as 2 ap 4 ap 1 2 diaminobenzene catechol hydroquinone caffeic acid and paracetamol chen et al 2013a 2013b sýs et al 2017 it could be attributed to the ortho and para positioned hydroxyl amino groups on the aromatic ring could stabilize the radicals and charges in the intermediates or transition states during the redox reactions of rms via resonance effects due to the lone pairs on oxygen and nitrogen and then mediating accelerating such redox process mcmurry 2015 farhoosh et al 2016 hsueh et al 2019 accordingly the dissolved organic matters dom of sludge contained the following apportions 40 50 of proteinaceous compounds 10 15 of carbohydrates 10 15 of humic substance 3 5 of lipids 3 5 of lignins 2 5 of organic acids and 1 2 of organic micropollutants xiao et al 2020 from the eem spectra changes fig 1c and the gc ms results in tables s1 s3 in supplementary material more substances with aromatic ring and nh2 and oh groups could be enriched after the mfcs treatment as compared with the corresponding influent it could be concluded that the mfcs treatment played a substrate screening role sufficiently by removing degradable ones and remaining endogenous rms substances from sludge e g humic substance lignins or other macromoleculars e g high aromatic compounds as a high efficiency selector for obtaining ssrms supported previously xin et al 2020 2022 among them the humic acid was capable to promote the electron transferring efficiency for organics rapid conversion in the acidogenic phase and also changed the oxidation reduction quality of the acidogenic fermentation system li et al 2019 moreover the lignins enhanced the acidogenesis process possibly by perfecting the electron transfer chain in the fermentation system with the assistance of its quinone structure he et al 2022 thus the ssrms with electron transferring capabilities could be harvested feasibly via mfcs from sludge solid phase regarding the practical application the electrode material played a vital role in the feasibility of using mfcs in practice electrode material should have some merits of non corrosive biocompatible high porosity and surface area good electrical conductivity stability good mechanical strength and cost effective while the nanomaterials 3d structuring bio cathode conductive polymers and composite materials presented great potential for developing better electrodes and improving performance of mfcs nawaz et al 2020 subsequently an effective method of coating individual bacterial cells with conjugated polymers on as electrodes in mfcs which showed a 14 1 times higher power density output comparatively song et al 2017 moreover immobilization of rms i e neutral red on carbon surface of electrodes would significantly increase the power output of mfcs and low cost effectiveness wang et al 2011 besides ge and he operated a 200 l modularized microbial fuel cell for treating wastewater with stating that the capital cost of the mfc system could be comparable to that of small wastewater treatment facilities which encouraged the further development of mfc technology with reducing costs and improving performance towards sustainable operation ge and he 2016 accordingly it was reasonable to anticipate that high performance mfcs would sooner be possible for practical applications with the rapid development of materials science 3 2 ssrms enhancing bioelectrogenesis 3 2 1 bioelectrogenesis enhancing properties the bioelectrogenesis properties of voltage output power density and bioelectricity conversion efficiency bce in mfcs were boosted obviously with adding ssrms in phase ⅱ shown in fig 3 the maximum voltage output of these mfcs increased by 19 36 and 26 improved to 0 63 v 0 72 v and 0 67 v with the mc h and f t pretreatment ssrms addition respectively as compared with the control test fig 3a meanwhile the peak power density increased to 1 02 w cm2 1 33 w cm2 and 1 15 w cm2 respectively fig 3b accordingly the bioelectricity conversion efficiency could be elevated by 6 7 39 and 20 with the ssrms additions comparatively fig 3c such mfcs running properties exceeded the ones fed with similar feeds previously such as organic fraction of municipal solid waste el chakhtoura et al 2014 kitchen garbage moqsud et al 2014 and food waste jia et al 2013 moreover the cod removal efficiency surpassed 85 with less running time used i e 36 h such results inferred that the ssrms addition boosted the bioelectricity conversion and organic substrates biodegradation by triggering extracellular electron transfer eet capabilities with forming more active electroactive biofilms chen et al 2013a yuan et al 2017 3 2 2 bioelectrogenesis enhancement related microbial profiles by ssrms the pca analysis indicated that ssrms addition reduced the anodic microbial community dissimilarity by shortening the distance among r6 r7 and r8 as compared with that with r5 in fig 4a supported by the bray curtis distance coefficients changes between samples in fig s1 in which the bray curtis distance coefficients among r6 r7 and r8 ranged at 0 0 43 and 0 5 whereas such coefficients increased to 0 8 0 82 and 0 84 between r5 with samples added ssrms r6 r7 and r8 in terms of anodic microbial profiles the α diversity indexes of shannon index from 3 156 in r5 to 4 732 in r8 chao1 index from 567 in r5 to 689 in r8 and ace index from 563 827 in r5 to 685 820 in r8 were improved obviously in anodic biofilms samples with adding ssrms table 2 moreover the microbial distributive evenness within the anodic community increased clearly i e relatively high evenness with the ssrms addition by the shannoneven index increase from 0 509 r5 to 0 727 r8 which indicated that the ssrms addition was conducive to form a higher diversity and more even anodic microbial community with enhancing the stability of good running performance supported previously marzorati et al 2008 carballa et al 2015 meanwhile the anodic microbial community structure and abundance shifted clearly with ssrms addition as shown in fig 4b in r5 the dyella 19 62 enterobacter 15 90 related to bioelectrogenesis logan et al 2019 burkholderia 11 03 responsible for organic matters bioconversion to electric energy patil et al 2009 pandoraea 1 47 and acidocella 2 52 contributing to complex organic matters degradation eze et al 2021 were the dominant members while more genera emerged in the mfcs r6 r7 and r8 with rms addition of pseudomonas 9 71 in r6 7 01 in r7 and 6 02 in r8 as one kind of electro active microorganisms and responsible for electrogenesis croese et al 2014 ignavibacterium 16 86 in r7 and 3 63 in r8 responsible for heterotrophic denitrification yang et al 2018 bdellovibrio 12 37 in r7 and 6 17 in r8 associated with polysaccharide production britt marie et al 2018 geothrix 6 96 in r6 2 14 in r7 and 2 93 in r8 related to oxidation of organic matters in electrically conductive environment aguirre sierra et al 2016 zoogloea 5 96 in r6 2 99 in r7 and 1 86 in r8 related to biofilm formation and maintenance gao et al 2014 saccharibacteria 2 84 in r7 and 4 27 in r8 geobacter 2 79 in r6 1 91 in r7 and 3 38 in r8 as a kind of model exoelectrogens logan et al 2019 dokdonella 3 51 in r6 2 41 in r7 and 1 21 in r8 responsible for n removal yang et al 2018 and vampirovibrio 6 53 in r8 in genetal the acidocella bdellovibrio geothrix and zoogloea were responsible for complicated organics biodegradation and biotransformation to bioavailable small molecular organics which were further utilized for completing bioelectrogenesis by exoelectrogens of enterobacter burkholderia pseudomonas and geobacter etc with the ssrms addition the ssrms addition played an important role in reshaping anodic microbial community for establishing functions with robust and well performing characteristics supported by results of table 2 and fig 3 3 2 3 mechanism clarification fig 4c depicted the relative frequency changes of anodic microbial functional genes related to organic matters biodegradation and bioelectrogenesis in mfcs with adding ssrms the genes relative abundances related to translation function were improved clearly ca 8 5 9 0 in the ssrms mfcs t1 t2 and t3 vs control tests ca 7 0 7 5 in c1 c2 and c3 moreover the total gene relative abundances of ten classes of functions listed in fig 4c presented a higher degree in t group than those in c group more specifically the relative frequency of genes with functions of signal transduction transport and catabolism environmental adaptation cell motility translation energy metabolism transcription amino acid metabolism etc were boosted significantly in t group than those in c group i e the red box part in fig s2 the exogenous biodegradation and metabolism transport and catabolism energy metabolism were associated with the degradation of various organic matters deng et al 2021 meanwhile the amino acid metabolic pathways mainly were associated with proteins and amino acids biodegradation and bioconversion xia et al 2019 previous studies also found that the exogenous rms of riboflavin lawsone and anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs were capable to elevate the abundance of genes related to transport and metabolism of carbohydrate amino acid and energy production for better biotransformation of waste sludge huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 such results indicated that ssrms were capable to elevate the relative abundance of functional genes expression and enhance the metabolic activities of anodic members which played a positive role in enhancing bioelectrogenesis via accelerating organics matters biodegradation and bioconversion based on metatranscriptome analysis the specific function genes expression changes during bioelectrogenesis process prompted by ssrms were listed in table 3 the up regulated differentially expressed genes degs were related to putative abc transporter substrate binding protein a gene id of unigene 551730 ko of k01999 and log2fc of 7 46 acetyl coa c acyltransferase a gene id of unigene 183288 ko of k000626 and log2fc of 9 48 6 phosphofructokinase a gene id of unigene 3000243 ko of k21071 and log2fc of 6 08 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 homolog bacteroid a gene id of unigene 2991548 ko of k00404 and log2fc of 6 52 while the down regulated genes were linked with nadh dehydrogenase subunit 7 a gene id of unigene 1912273 ko of k03935 and log2fc of 6 98 the abc transporter substrate binding protein a was responsible for the transports of sugars amino acids peptides metal ions iron carriers and vitamins khandavilli et al 2008 while the acetyl coa c acyltransferase a was related to the β oxidation of fatty acids zhang et al 2019b the 6 phosphofructokinase a was a rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis process and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 homolog was associated with electrons transfer to the terminal electron acceptors thom 2008 moreover the down regulation of genes related to nadh dehydrogenase subunit 7 a meant a reduction in expression of nadh dehydrogenase would be consistent with a physiological shift to fermentation and away from oxidative phosphorylation loftie eaton et al 2013 more specifically fig 5 further displayed the detailed degs during bioelectrogenesis process affected by ssrms which showed that the nuo j subunit coding gene of nadh dehydrogenase i e complex ⅰ was down regulated green color while the b subunit ⅰ coding gene of cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase was up regulated red color comparatively the subunit nuo j was capable to interweave between subunits of nuo k a and n and stabilized the complex ⅰ efremov and sazanov 2011 moreover the subunit nuo j could act the proton pumping function by conformational changes between discontinuous transmembrane helices baradaran et al 2013 meanwhile cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase was generally thought to endow the bacterium with adaptive and competitive advantage over other microorganisms for supporting the biofilm growth and contributing to atp production barco et al 2015 kučera and sedláček 2020 overall the proton pumping function of complex ⅰ was weakened and cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase for atp synthase was improved by the influence of ssrms during the bioelectrogenesis process 3 3 ssrms enhancing was acidogenic fermentation 3 3 1 vfas improvement in was acidogenic fermentation during the was acidogenic fermentation phase ⅲ the vfas production could be improved clearly with ssrms addition as shown in fig 6 around 18 60 of acetic acid 19 30 of propionic acid 3 50 of butyric acid and 25 35 of valeric acid could be boosted simultaneously with rms addition generated from various was pretreatments comparatively fig 6a d more noticeably the relative proportion of acetic and butyric acids reduced obviously from the initial fermentation state day 1 to the vfas rapid increase stage day 5 ca 50 to 20 for acetic acid and ca 25 to 10 for butyric acid fig 6e meanwhile the propionic acid increased clearly from ca 20 day 1 to 60 day 5 such results indicated that ssrms addition not only triggered more vfas generation but also changed the individual vfa accumulation efficiency via the role they played as active terminal electron acceptors teas or the electron transferring chains etc by their functional groups e g quinone etc of humic acid li et al 2019 and confirmed by the electron transfer efficiency improvements in fig 7a and fig s3 the proportion of individual vfa might be attributed to two reasons ⅰ the vfa bioconversion efficiency enhanced by the ssrms addition acted as electron acceptors e g the acetate acid generation efficiency of glyceradehyde 3p d glycerate 1 3 diphosphate and pyruvate acetyl coa was strengthened with humic acid addition liu et al 2015 ⅱ the β oxidation of butyric acid by butyrate oxidizing bacterium also contributed to the individual vfa changes meng et al 2022 the vfas increase efficiency presented a positive correlation with the electron transfer increase efficiency by ssrms furthermore the vs ts reduction efficiency in was fermentation also was enhanced around 7 48 11 37 fig 7b and the key hydrolytic enzymes activities i e protease and α glucosidase in fig 7c were elevated slightly with ssrms addition which suggested that ssrms strengthened the sludge organics remove efficiency and contributed to the sludge hydrolysis positively in acidogenic fermentation for a higher vfas bioconversion efficiency supported by huang et al s study with proposing that the rms of riboflavin and lawsone boosted the hydrolyric enzymes of protease and promoted protein dependent fermentation for increasing maximum vfas accumulation by 43 9 and 42 5 respectively huang et al 2019 3 3 2 anaerobic acidogenesis enhancement related microbial profiles microbial α diverisity indexes in was acidogenic fermentations with adding ssrms on day1 initial fermentation stage and day 5 vfas rapid accumulation stage were listed in table 4 it was interesting that the ssrms addition prompted microbial diversity from day 1 to day 5 shannon index increase from 5 45 to 5 55 in f t group 5 48 to 5 58 in mc group and 5 36 to 5 58 in h group chao1 index increase from 2193 90 to 2200 17 in f t group 2165 39 to 2208 01 in mc group and 2243 16 to 2274 61 in h group as compared with the control test shannon index of 5 69 and 5 65 and chao1 index of 2224 19 and 2201 44 meanwhile the shannoneven index increased slightly from day 1 to day 5 0 72 to 0 73 in f t and mc groups and 0 70 to 0 73 in h group by the comparison of control group around 0 74 on day 1 and day 5 such finding was consistent with the community evenness changes in anodic biofilms affected by ssrms i e table 2 in this study which further inferred that higher diversity was capable to steer a running stability with good performing properties while the good evenness offered a circumstance that both key completing a big fraction of functioning and team microbial members exploiting all metabolic pathways mostly to guarantee well performance i e higher vfas generation within the microbial community carballa et al 2015 microbial community dissimilarity was increased in the was acidogenic fermentation process with adding ssrms fig 8 the pca analysis indicated that ssrms enlarged the acidogenic community dissimilarity by separating the samples on day 1 and day 5 into two parts clearly fig 8a moreover the balloon diagram fig 8b and table s4 further reveal the microbial community composition differences on day 1 and day 5 in was acidogenesis with adding ssrms as compared with the main microbial members at initial fermentation stage the relative abundance of below main members increased clearly for vfas production at vfas rapid accumulation stage clostridium 5 923 6 380 on day 5 vs 5 071 6 328 on day 1 associated with fermentation and acetogenesis processes to generate acetate rao et al 2018 huang et al 2019 acinetobacter 5 249 7 875 on day 5 vs 1 916 4 118 on day 1 responsible for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins pang et al 2020 anaerolineaceae 11 763 11 866 on day 5 vs 8 773 12 741 on day 1 with a fermentative metabolism by utilizing carbohydrates and proteinaceous carbon sources under anaerobic conditions mcllroy et al 2017 prolixibacteraceae 8 952 11 146 on day 5 vs 5 690 7 025 on day 1 with saccharolytic and proteolytic metabolisms podosokorskaya et al 2020 betaproteobacteria 3 513 3 873 on day 5 vs 3 129 3 956 on day 1 rhodocyclaceae 2 812 3 331 on day 5 vs 2 317 2 508 on day 1 comamonadaceae 1 679 1 842 on day 5 vs

chloroflexi 1 121 1 411 on day 5 vs 1 034 1 113 on day 1 responsible for the degradation of soluble microbial products smp and other complicated substrates hu et al 2020 and clostridiales 1 183 1 436 on day 5 vs 0 895 1 001 on day 1 contributing to hydrolysis of complex substances azman et al 2017 such key members played a synergic role in prompting vfas production in was acidogenic fermentation whose relative abundance correlated positively with adding ssrms 3 3 3 mechanism elucidations the relative abundances of genes expression of metabolic functions based on kegg database in anaerobic acidogenesis with ssrms addition in phase ⅲ were listed in table 5 it was obvious that the relevant genes encoding main metabolisms of amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism enzyme families environmental information processing of membrane transport genetic information processing of transcription and translation presented a higher relative proportion on day 5 vs those on day 1 and control tests respectively moreover the functional heatmap suggested that the metabolic functions of nitrogen respiration nitrate respiration sulfate respiration nitrogen fixation nitrification methylotrophy and nitrite respiration presented higher abundances on fermentation day 5 than those on day 1 and control test fig s4 which indicated that ssrms triggered the protein dependent fermentation for more vfas bioconversion by enhancing amino acids bioconversion and organic nitrogen respiration supported previously liu et al 2015 huang et al 2019 based on the aforesaid results figs 3 8 figs s1 s4 tables 2 5 and tables s1 s4 a schematic diagram for illustrating the microbial mechanism for enhancing bioelectrogenesis and acidogenesis by ssrms was established in fig 9 in the hydrolysis step the key hydrolytic enzymes of protease and α glucosidase could be increased slightly due to the redox reactions between pairs of amino acids stickland reaction huang et al 2019 and glycolysis and the greater hydrophobic property of humic acids rms for sludge solubilization liu et al 2015 the monomer molecules of momosaccharides and amino acids were delivered into inside of microbial cells via transmembrane transport for initiating the acidogenesis the ssrms played dual roles in enhancing acidogenesis and bioelectrogenesis ⅰ presented a potential influence on boosting the functional genes expression of dominant acidogens during fermentation e g genetic information processing of transcription and translation and increasing amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism etc supported by the results of tables 4 and s4 figs 4 6 and s4 and previous studies with stating that the rms of riboflavin lawsone and anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs increased the abundance of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of carbohydrate amino acid and energy production during the anaerobic fermentation of waste sludge huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 ⅱ acted as terminal electron acceptors teas or electron shuttles by the functional groups for accepting or transferring the surplus electrons generated by the fermenting process to other substrates in normal acidogenic process when the hydrogen pressure would no longer be a decisive factor li et al 2019 e g β oxidation of butyric acid or acetic acid oxidation by fatty acids utilizing bacteria in fig 9 such surplus electrons could be further transferred to electron acceptor microorganisms e g electro active microorganisms for enhancing bioelectrogenesis supported by the results of figs 3 5 7 s2 and s3 tables 3 and 5 and other previous studies li et al proposed that the functional groups quinone and other nitrogen sulfur groups etc of humic acid ha a main component of ssrms were capable to make good electron transferring chains etc and contributed to the acidogenesis as electron transport agents li et al 2019 liu et al found that a commercially available humic acid of shha showed a strong electron accepting capacity for more acetic acid production liu et al 2015 the quinone redox mediators were capable to strengthen the syntrophic metabolism of interspecies electron transfer for enhancing the biotransformation or bioelectrogenesis efficiency chen et al 2013b zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 meanwhile the transcription of genes encoding membrane functional proteins of exoelectrogens were influenced significantly with diminishing the nadh dehydrogenase activity and elevating cytochrome c oxidase activity supported by table 3 such results inferred that ssrms might undertake partial function of nadh dehydrogenase reactions as a competitor and improved cytochrome c oxidase effect for better bioenergy generation and substrates biodegradation supported

14843,although nutrient reduction has been used for lake eutrophication mitigation worldwide the use of this practice alone has been shown to be less effective in combatting cyanobacterial blooms primarily because of climate change in addition quantifying the climate change contribution to cyanobacterial blooms is difficult further complicating efforts to set nutrient reduction goals for mitigating blooms in freshwater lakes this study employed a continuous variable bayesian modeling framework to develop a model to predict spring cyanobacterial bloom areas and frequencies the responses using nutrient levels and climatic factors as predictors our results suggested that both spring climatic factors e g increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed and nutrients e g total phosphorus played vital roles in spring blooms in lake taihu with climatic factors being the primary drivers for both bloom areas and frequencies climate change in spring had a 90 probability of increasing the bloom area from 35 km2 to 180 km2 during our study period while nutrient reduction limited the bloom area to 170 km2 which helped mitigate expansion of cyanobacterial blooms for lake management to ensure a 90 probability of the mean spring bloom areas remaining under 154 km2 the 75th percentile of the bloom areas in spring the total phosphorus should be maintained below 0 073 mg l 1 under current climatic conditions which is a 46 3 reduction from the current level our modeling approach is an effective method for deriving dynamic nutrient thresholds for lake management under different climatic scenarios and management goals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords global warming cyanobacterial blooms internal loading shallow lakes data intensive statistical models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the nutrient enrichment of lakes from human activity is known as cultural eutrophication and ultimately leads to algal blooms in freshwater smith and schindler 2009 many attempts have been made to restore deteriorated ecosystems to combat eutrophication in shallow lakes by reducing allochthonous nutrient inputs janssen et al 2019 unfortunately restoration by reducing nutrient loadings has only been partly successful jeppesen et al 2005 2017 paerl et al 2016 and freshwater eutrophication with blooms remains a challenge to address to achieve the united nation s un s sustainable development goals e g sdg6 griggs et al 2013 eutrophication and bloom responses to the reduction of external nutrients differ among lakes and are influenced by other environmental factors fu et al 2022 as indicated by remote sensing even with extensive global restoration efforts the bloom intensity has increased since the 2000s worldwide revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions ho et al 2019 even worse blooms have recently reoccurred in some restored lakes for instance in lake erie between canada and the us where eutrophication was controlled for a decade after restoration kane et al 2014 blooms returned in the 2000s and caused drinking water supply interruption in 2014 steffen et al 2017 another example is lake taihu in may 2007 a massive bloom overwhelmed the lake s drinking water plants leading to a highly publicized crisis leaving millions of local residents without potable water for nearly a week stone 2011 after that intense restoration efforts were implemented to control blooms although nutrient loadings were reduced during the first few years a record bloom occurred again ten years later in 2017 qin et al 2019 climate change during recent decades including increased temperatures reduced wind speeds deng et al 2018 vautard et al 2010 and altered precipitation patterns has been considered the major driver of global bloom exacerbation winder 2012 climate change may play a more important role in cyanobacterial blooms in lakes than do other factors such as external nutrient loading smucker et al 2021 song et al 2021 cyanobacteria have a higher growth rate at warmer temperatures than other taxa carey et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 warming in combination with calm winds also increases the strength and duration of stratification in lakes which benefits cyanobacteria or blooms janatian et al 2020 wu et al 2015 because they have a competitive advantage of regulating their buoyancy to acquire nutrients and optimal light conditions carey et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 with data from 1000 u s lakes cyanobacteria appear to be more sensitive to the climate in eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes rigosi et al 2014 nutrient concentrations in oligotrophic lakes are the more important predictor of cyanobacterial biovolume rigosi et al 2014 however climate change may also promote cyanobacterial dominance in nutrient poor northern lakes freeman et al 2020 in other words climate change may also increase the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in oligotrophic lakes that are otherwise considered to have a lower risk of blooms as a result in setting nutrient thresholds for combatting blooms the effects of a warmer climate in the future should also be considered paerl et al 2019 and stricter nutrient control strategies are needed under future warming climate however the exact targets for nutrient reduction under different climate scenarios are not very clear yet because quantifying the climate change effect on bloom potential is difficult due to the complex interaction between phytoplankton proliferation nutrient requirements and climatic conditions a multitude of potential methods have been developed for blooms modelling and forecasting del giudice et al 2021 jackson blake et al 2022 simple models have generally focused on interannual nutrient variation and the variability of bloom e g chlorophyll a chla xu et al 2015 with a novel modelling approach called spatial ecosystem bifurcation analysis seba janssen et al 2017 evaluated the impact of the lake s total external nutrient load on the local lake dynamics resulting in a map of critical nutrient loads for different locations throughout the lake in recent years data driven machine learning has also been gradually applied to the numerical simulation of cyanobacterial blooms the bayesian network model was used to evaluate the nutrient threshold of cyanobacteria blooms and concluded that critical nutrient thresholds are lake dependent and the effects of nutrient reduction on blooms might be counteracted by temperature warming rigosi et al 2015 shan et al 2020 previously mainly based on traditional mathematical statistics we concluded that climate change might played a more important role than human activities did on the eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms in lake taihu e g deng et al 2014a 2018 2020 in this paper to further provide nutrient reduction targets for controlling cyanobacteria bloom under different climate change scenarios we followed the statistical modeling framework based on a continuous bayesian network model by using lake taihu as an example more specially to propose future management thresholds by developing data intensive models we 1 quantitatively evaluated the contribution of climate change and human activities to the increased bloom area and frequency in lake taihu and 2 proposed nutrient reduction targets to control blooms under different climatic scenarios in the lake 2 materials 2 1 study area lake taihu is a large 2338 km2 shallow mean depth 2 7 m eutrophic subtropical lake situated in the changjiang yangtze delta the most industrialized and densely populated region in china qin 2008 cyanobacterial blooms have been observed since the 1980s in the northern part of the lake and have spread to almost two thirds of the lake since the 2010s qin et al 2021 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 climatic data meteorological data included daily records of wind speed air temperature sunshine hours and precipitation daily meteorological data from the dongshan wuxi and huzhou stations which are located around lake taihu fig 1 were used to evaluate the long term climatic variation around the lake daily observational data from 1992 to 2020 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn for consistency with the frequency of water quality monitoring data the meteorological data were aggregated to monthly means for temperature and wind speed and to monthly sums for sunshine hours and precipitation the winter seasons included december january and february while the spring seasons included march april and may 2 2 2 water quality and bloom events routine monthly monitoring of lake taihu has been conducted since 1992 surface water samples 0 2 m under the water surface were collected at each sampling site from 1992 to 2004 and samples from three water depths 0 2 m below surface mid depth and 0 2 m above the bottom of the lake were collected from 2005 to 2020 nutrient concentrations total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were analyzed following standard methods in china jin and tu 1990 chla concentrations were calculated from spectrophotometric measurements after extraction in 90 hot ethanol chen et al 2003 totally there were 32 sampling sites in the long term monitoring while 13 of the sites in the northern part were sampled monthly and others were sampled seasonally since 2005 in this study the sites sampled monthly were used fig 1 the weighted mean values of nutrient and chla concentrations were used in our study to address spatial heterogeneity lake taihu was divided into 32 sections using the thiessen polygon method zhu et al 2014 and a weight factor was calculated for each site as the area of each polygon relative to the total area of the lake the sampling sites and other details can be found in deng et al 2020 daily algal bloom information from lake taihu between 2003 and 2020 was extracted from modis aqua images shi et al 2017 specifically the bloom frequency for each grid 250 m 250 m during a season was calculated as the ratio of the number of images with blooms to the total number of available images in the season the mean ratio of all grids was used as the bloom frequency for the season 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 long term trends of water quality and climatic variables temporal trends were visualized using weighted regression with bootstrapped smoothers this function calculates smoothers from 1000 bootstraps of the original samples followed by calculation of density estimates for each vertical cut through the bootstrapped smoothers which are then visualized by shade color and intensity kovalenko et al 2018 different trends of temperature and wind speed in both winter and spring were found deng et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 and both of them were significantly related to phytoplankton in lake taihu deng et al 2020 to avoid the collinearity of the independent variables the ratio of temperature to wind speed which is defined as the climatic factor was used in the analysis 2 3 2 continuous variable bayesian network models bayesian inferential methods perform well with small sample sizes and limited data leading to their ecological application qian 2016 and are increasingly used in environmental modeling that is used to support management decisions jiang et al 2021 qian et al 2022 bayesian networks bns for instance were used to determine the probability of cyanobacterial blooms in multiple lake systems rigosi et al 2015 however a bn model is limited to using categorical variables currently we can take advantage of both the causal relationship and the available data to build a modified bayesian network model using continuous variables cbn qian et al 2021 qian and miltner 2015 which borrows the basic model construction strategy used in a bn model jensen 2001 the basic idea of the cbn modeling approach is to replace the conditional probability tables for factor variables in a bn model with a series of conditional probability distributions for continuous variables with these conditional probability tables the conditional probability formula is used to quantify the functional relations among variables and the formula can be readily programmed qian et al 2021 when using continuous conditional probability distributions the computation can be implemented using the gibbs sampler qian et al 2003 which was more detailly described in supplementary materials according to our previous studies spring is a very sensitive season in which blooms were found to increase during the last two decades and inhibiting algal growth during the spring season would be beneficial for bloom control qu et al 2014 hence our analysis mainly focused on the spring season fig 2 a climate warming was found to have short term memory in our previous study deng et al 2020 thus the effects of winter conditions were also taken into account in our conceptual model finally four empirical regressions were built to develop the conceptual model of cbn fig 2b the detailed procedure for model development was provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 3 application of the cbn model the model setup first established a connection between the blooms and drivers to estimate the relative contributions of winter and spring environmental factors to the spring blooms then the model was further used to derive the bloom area distributions under different environmental conditions i e different tp concentrations and climatic factors finally the model was used to derive the nutrient distributions associated with desired bloom areas and frequencies e g bloom area 154 km2 or frequency 0 137 which are the 75th percentile of the bloom areas or frequency in spring respectively for the first application the two model input variables to be compared were set as values from a uniform distribution that was defined by the data for instance when the contributions of winter wind speed and spring climatic factor were compared they were assigned to a series of equal interval values between the maximum to minimum observed values the other input variables were set to constant values based on their mean values the predicted probabilities of a bloom area 154 km2 and a frequency 0 137 were then calculated as a function of winter wind speed and spring climatic factor for the second application the spring tp and climatic factor were assigned to a series of equal interval values between the range of the data and the other variables were set as constants using the mean values of the data then the probability of different bloom areas was estimated by the cbn model developed the predicted bloom area with a high probability of occurrence e g 90 was recorded and presented by a contour plot for the third application three simulations were carried out according to different spring climatic factors among the three decades the mean spring climatic factor from 1992 to 2000 was set as scenario 1 in which the temperatures were low and wind speeds were high compared to the other two scenarios and the mean spring climatic factor from 2001 to 2010 was set as scenario 2 the mean spring climatic factor from 2011 to 2020 was set as scenario 3 which involved higher temperatures and lower wind speeds than the other two scenarios then the predicted probability of a bloom area 154 km2 and a frequency 0 137 under different tp values were estimated all analyses and visualizations were carried out in r 4 1 1 r core team 2022 the packages and code for models development could be found at https github com songsqian nceflow 3 results 3 1 long term water quality and blooms in lake taihu the mean winter tp from 1992 to 2020 was 0 118 0 03 mg l 1 it was low before 2000 increased from 0 11 mg l 1 to 0 15 mg l 1 in 2011 and then significantly decreased to 0 10 mg l 1 until 2020 fig 3 a the mean spring tp from 1992 to 2020 was 0 120 0 04 mg l 1 which was slightly higher than that in winter however the spring tp showed an increasing trend from 1992 to 2010 and then decreased slightly with a rebounding trend in recent years fig 3b the mean spring tp from 2017 to 2020 was 0 13 mg l 1 in spring the mean bloom area from 2003 to 2020 was 137 107 km2 the bloom areas were lower than 100 km2 before 2005 and significantly increased to 250 km2 until 2007 fig 3c afterward there was a short decreasing process from 2007 to 2011 then the spring bloom area increased again from 2011 to 2020 recently the bloom areas were approximately 300 km2 the mean spring bloom frequency was 0 12 0 05 from 1992 to 2020 the long term trends of the spring bloom frequency presented the same pattern as that of the spring bloom areas the frequency was low before 2005 and increased to 0 2 in 2007 then the frequency declined to lower than 0 05 in 2011 the spring bloom frequency significantly increased again from 0 05 to 0 21 during 2011 and 2020 fig 3d 3 2 climate is becoming warmer and calmer the mean winter temperature in lake taihu was approximately 5 5 c and significantly increased from 2011 to 2020 fig 4 a the mean spring temperature was 16 c and significantly increased from 15 to 17 c from 1992 to 2020 which indicated that the increasing rate was equivalent to 0 71 c decade fig 4b both the winter and spring wind speeds in lake taihu showed the same declining pattern fig 4b c the climatic factors significantly increased in winter and spring fig 4e f 3 3 climate change and nutrient reduction affect bloom events as indicated by scatter plots linear regression models were generally suitable in lake taihu fig s1 finally four empirical regressions were built to develop the conceptual model of cbn table s1 the first model was the winter chla in the water column which was positively related to tp and negatively related to wind speed r 2 0 334 the second model was spring tp the spring tp was positively related to winter chla and conductivity r 2 0 361 the third and fourth models were bloom area and frequency in spring both of which were highly positively related to spring tp and spring climatic factors the results of the cross validation indicated that both the simulated bloom areas and frequency were in good agreement with the observed values r 2 0 6 and p 0 01 for both bloom areas and frequency estimation and slopes were both approximate equal to 1 fig s2 in addition root mean square error rmse for bloom areas and frequency estimation were 0 16 equal to 39 8 km2 while mean value was 109 0 km2 and 0 02 while mean value was 0 12 and mean absolute error mae were 0 13 equal to 20 0 km2 and 0 02 respectively for illustration purposes we used the 75th percentile values of the bloom area and frequency in our data 154 km2 and 0 137 respectively as the threshold values for large bloom areas and high frequencies the spring bloom areas and frequencies were sensitive to both winter wind speed and spring climatic factor due to the decreasing winter wind speed and the changing spring climate toward warmer and calmer conditions the probability for large bloom areas fig 5 a and high frequencies fig 5b significantly increased from less than 0 05 to 1 i e under current climatic conditions the probability of large bloom occurrences was 100 in spring in lake taihu the probability of a large bloom area was slightly related to the winter tp in recent decades fig 5c under spring climate change the probability for high bloom frequency increased from less than 0 05 in 2006 2010 to 0 85 fig 5d as estimated by the bayesian model the annual bloom area at a probability of 90 was much more sensitive to the spring climatic factor than to the spring tp from 1992 to 2020 fig 6 under the climate and tp conditions during 2006 2010 the mean annual bloom area at a 90 probability was approximately 35 km2 which was low and the mean bloom area increased to more than 180 km2 due to spring climate change during 2016 2020 if the nutrients did not change the reduction in tp during the past decade reduced the estimated bloom area to approximately 170 km2 3 4 evaluation of nutrient control targets to set nutrient criteria the bayesian model was further used to evaluate the spring tp thresholds required to achieve the management targets e g bloom area 154 km2 or frequency 0 137 in fig 7 under different climatic conditions under the climatic conditions of the early 1990s the spring tp threshold needed to ensure at a probability greater than 90 that a large bloom did not occur was 0 188 mg l 1 and the tp needed to be reduced by 16 0 158 mg l 1 for the same probability under the climatic conditions of the early 2010s a further reduction of 45 2 which was 0 073 mg l 1 was needed to ensure that there would be no large blooms in spring under the climatic conditions of the late 2010s using the mean tp values in 2019 and 2020 as examples reductions of as much as 0 063 mg l 1 46 3 were needed to ensure at a 90 probability that there would be no large blooms the thresholds of tp needed to ensure at a probability higher than 90 that a high bloom frequency would not occur also decreased with climate change from the early 1990s to the late 2010s currently 30 1 of the tp still needs to be reduced to 0 095 mg l 1 to ensure a bloom frequency of less than 0 137 in spring which was the 75th percentile of the bloom frequency during our study period 4 discussion our study used cbn to estimate the long term variation of spring cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu the cbn performed very well for both cyanobacterial bloom areas and frequencies predictions fig s2 according to the model the nutrients should be further reduced by 46 to control the blooms fig 7 the using of cbn could provide a very useful tool to estimate the nutrients reduction in different climate scenarios and under management goals 4 1 comparation cbn results with others the current analysis confirmed the contributions from both nutrients and climate warming to enhanced blooms in lake taihu fig 5 and the blooms in the lake might have been more sensitive to climatic conditions than to nutrients during the last two decades fig 6 the conclusion consisted with previous studies with different analysis methods previous study with structural equation model sem also proved that climatic factor e g wind speed is the main factor for phytoplankton proliferation deng et al 2018 the random forest model indicated that winter and spring chla were mainly correlated with climatic factors e g temperature and sunshine hours zou et al 2021 in addition study based on ordination analysis also showed that the impact of climatic factors on phytoplankton community in lake taihu has become increasingly important guo et al 2019 the conclusions were also confirmed by early indoor experiments that warming significantly promoted the cyanobacterial competitive advantage deng et al 2014b meanwhile our results were also consistent with the study using cbn which based on short term data among three lakes shan et al 2020 our previous studies mainly qualitatively analyzed the impact of climate change and human activities on the eutrophication of the lake taihu in this paper by using the bayesian model proposed by shan et al 2020 and qian et al 2021 we quantitatively analyzed the impact of climate change and human activities on cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu with the cbn results in our study climate change including both of warming and wind speed decreasing has increased cyanobacterial bloom areas by 414 from 35 km2 to 180 km2 under probability of 90 and nutrient reduction mitigated the expansion of cyanobacterial bloom areas by 5 6 the result was consistent with our knowledge although lake taihu has undergone vast restoration measures it still experienced a record cyanobacterial bloom in may 2017 qin et al 2019 4 2 climate change counteracts eutrophication management efforts in lake taihu though not all the examined parameters improved in the water column in lake taihu the water quality improvement in the lake might have also been confirmed by the significantly reduction in conductivity both in spring and in winter since 2007 fig s3 which can be used as a water quality indicator in the taihu basin deng et al 2014a wu et al 2020 the winter tp values have also significantly decreased with a four year lag since 2007 and delayed recovery has often been observed in other restoration cases jeppesen et al 2007 although the tp in spring did not decrease as expected the trends remained nearly stable after 2010 fig 3b the different patterns of tp between winter and spring might be related to the positive feedback among heavy blooms and internal nutrient release as explained by qin et al 2021 spring was the start of the growing season in lake taihu and heavy blooms enhanced tp release by increasing the ph and reducing the dissolved oxygen do in the water column qin et al 2021 hence the water column tp in spring was highly dependent on bloom events in spring the bloom events in lake taihu including bloom area and frequency however did not respond to the water quality improvement as excepted the chla data in spring in lake taihu also presented a similar pattern with blooms which continued to increase after 2010 qin et al 2019 lake chaohu a typical large shallow lake approximately 200 km2 away from lake taihu also showed an increase in surface algal bloom coverage frequency and duration with a trend toward earlier bloom formation zhang et al 2021 2015 bloom forming cyanobacteria have been observed with increasing frequency in poyang lake in china since 2000 liu et al 2016 the increasing trends of the blooms in these three subtropical lakes were also consistent with blooms all over the word that have presented increasing trends during the last two decades ho et al 2019 the climate around lake taihu has also undergone significant changes zhang et al 2018 increased temperatures and reduced wind speeds have also been widely reported especially in the northern hemisphere o reilly et al 2015 vautard et al 2010 the changing climate has been considered the major driver of blooms both globally ho et al 2019 and in china song et al 2021 hence climate change might be the major factor exacerbating cyanobacterial blooms under water quality improving in lake taihu and maybe other lakes as well 4 3 management targets under different climatic conditions our results indicated that although the external loading reduction effects were offset by climate warming fig 6 they should still be controlled to finally eliminate algal blooms since it tends to be the second important driver in the lake fig 7 which can be controlled by human in lake taihu the mean tp from 2006 to 2010 was 0 14 mg l 1 and it decreased to 0 13 mg l 1 from 2016 to 2020 if it were not for a 7 14 reduction in tp the area with a 90 probability of cyanobacterial blooms due to climate change would have increased from 35 km2 to 180 km2 compared to the current area of 170 km2 fig 6 the decrease in bloom areas following nutrient reduction could also be found in temperate shallow lakes where the phytoplankton biomass decreased after external loading was reduced jeppesen et al 2007 at present nutrient reduction targets must be specified for lake management and nutrient thresholds for bloom control must first be developed to establish bloom area targets in addition to quantitatively analyzed the impact of different drivers we further estimated the threshold values of nutrient concentrations for blooms control under different climate scenarios although it is widely accepted that bloom control needs to be even more stringent in the future our analysis is the first to the best of our knowledge to provide dynamic nutrient targets for bloom control in lake taihu in our study we primarily took the 75 quantile 154 km2 value of the annual mean blooms to define large blooms in lake taihu under the climatic conditions of the early 1990s with lower temperatures and windier conditions the estimated tp threshold required to ensure a high probability 90 of no large blooms occurring was 0 188 mg l 1 with the climatic conditions of the early 2010s the tp should be reduced to 0 158 mg l 1 and it should be further reduced to 0 073 mg l 1 under the current climatic conditions of higher temperature and lower wind speeds this indicates that tp reductions of more than 46 3 are needed to ensure a low probability of large blooms which is closer to the conclusion of xu et al 2015 that was estimated using the mass balance model our target tp value was also close to the critical tp concentration range 0 070 0 215 mg l 1 for controlling cyanobacterial proliferation in temperate lakes wagner and adrian 2009 and in the nutrient addition experiments conducted in lake taihu xu et al 2010 our results as well results from jiang et al 2021 implied that the bayesian model can effectively estimate corresponding critical nutrient reduction targets for controlling cyanobacterial blooms under different climatic scenarios and depend on management goals which could be easily apply to other lakes 5 conclusions continuous bayesian network model was developed to simulate spring bloom areas and frequencies in lake taihu as the model estimated during the period from 2003 to 2020 climate change expanded the area of cyanobacteria bloom with a probability of 90 from 35 km2 to 180 km2 while nutrient reduction mitigated the expansion of cyanobacterial blooms caused by climate change by 5 6 if want to control spring cyanobacterial bloom areas below 154 km2 under the current climate conditions the concentration of total phosphorus in the lake should be controlled below 0 073 mg l i e 46 of total phosphorus still needs to be reduced our study helps to provide an effective tool for estimating

janssen et al 2019 unfortunately restoration by reducing nutrient loadings has only been partly successful jeppesen et al 2005 2017 paerl et al 2016 and freshwater eutrophication with blooms remains a challenge to address to achieve the united nation s un s sustainable development goals e g sdg6 griggs et al 2013 eutrophication and bloom responses to the reduction of external nutrients differ among lakes and are influenced by other environmental factors fu et al 2022 as indicated by remote sensing even with extensive global restoration efforts the bloom intensity has increased since the 2000s worldwide revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions ho et al 2019 even worse blooms have recently reoccurred in some restored lakes for instance in lake erie between canada and the us where eutrophication was controlled for a decade after restoration kane et al 2014 blooms returned in the 2000s and caused drinking water supply interruption in 2014 steffen et al 2017 another example is lake taihu in may 2007 a massive bloom overwhelmed the lake s drinking water plants leading to a highly publicized crisis leaving millions of local residents without potable water for nearly a week stone 2011 after that intense restoration efforts were implemented to control blooms although nutrient loadings were reduced during the first few years a record bloom occurred again ten years later in 2017 qin et al 2019 climate change during recent decades including increased temperatures reduced wind speeds deng et al 2018 vautard et al 2010 and altered precipitation patterns has been considered the major driver of global bloom exacerbation winder 2012 climate change may play a more important role in cyanobacterial blooms in lakes than do other factors such as external nutrient loading smucker et al 2021 song et al 2021 cyanobacteria have a higher growth rate at warmer temperatures than other taxa carey et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 warming in combination with calm winds also increases the strength and duration of stratification in lakes which benefits cyanobacteria or blooms janatian et al 2020 wu et al 2015 because they have a competitive advantage of regulating their buoyancy to acquire nutrients and optimal light conditions carey et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 with data from 1000 u s lakes cyanobacteria appear to be more sensitive to the climate in eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes rigosi et al 2014 nutrient concentrations in oligotrophic lakes are the more important predictor of cyanobacterial biovolume rigosi et al 2014 however climate change may also promote cyanobacterial dominance in nutrient poor northern lakes freeman et al 2020 in other words climate change may also increase the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in oligotrophic lakes that are otherwise considered to have a lower risk of blooms as a result in setting nutrient thresholds for combatting blooms the effects of a warmer climate in the future should also be considered paerl et al 2019 and stricter nutrient control strategies are needed under future warming climate however the exact targets for nutrient reduction under different climate scenarios are not very clear yet because quantifying the climate change effect on bloom potential is difficult due to the complex interaction between phytoplankton proliferation nutrient requirements and climatic conditions a multitude of potential methods have been developed for blooms modelling and forecasting del giudice et al 2021 jackson blake et al 2022 simple models have generally focused on interannual nutrient variation and the variability of bloom e g chlorophyll a chla xu et al 2015 with a novel modelling approach called spatial ecosystem bifurcation analysis seba janssen et al 2017 evaluated the impact of the lake s total external nutrient load on the local lake dynamics resulting in a map of critical nutrient loads for different locations throughout the lake in recent years data driven machine learning has also been gradually applied to the numerical simulation of cyanobacterial blooms the bayesian network model was used to evaluate the nutrient threshold of cyanobacteria blooms and concluded that critical nutrient thresholds are lake dependent and the effects of nutrient reduction on blooms might be counteracted by temperature warming rigosi et al 2015 shan et al 2020 previously mainly based on traditional mathematical statistics we concluded that climate change might played a more important role than human activities did on the eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms in lake taihu e g deng et al 2014a 2018 2020 in this paper to further provide nutrient reduction targets for controlling cyanobacteria bloom under different climate change scenarios we followed the statistical modeling framework based on a continuous bayesian network model by using lake taihu as an example more specially to propose future management thresholds by developing data intensive models we 1 quantitatively evaluated the contribution of climate change and human activities to the increased bloom area and frequency in lake taihu and 2 proposed nutrient reduction targets to control blooms under different climatic scenarios in the lake 2 materials 2 1 study area lake taihu is a large 2338 km2 shallow mean depth 2 7 m eutrophic subtropical lake situated in the changjiang yangtze delta the most industrialized and densely populated region in china qin 2008 cyanobacterial blooms have been observed since the 1980s in the northern part of the lake and have spread to almost two thirds of the lake since the 2010s qin et al 2021 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 climatic data meteorological data included daily records of wind speed air temperature sunshine hours and precipitation daily meteorological data from the dongshan wuxi and huzhou stations which are located around lake taihu fig 1 were used to evaluate the long term climatic variation around the lake daily observational data from 1992 to 2020 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn for consistency with the frequency of water quality monitoring data the meteorological data were aggregated to monthly means for temperature and wind speed and to monthly sums for sunshine hours and precipitation the winter seasons included december january and february while the spring seasons included march april and may 2 2 2 water quality and bloom events routine monthly monitoring of lake taihu has been conducted since 1992 surface water samples 0 2 m under the water surface were collected at each sampling site from 1992 to 2004 and samples from three water depths 0 2 m below surface mid depth and 0 2 m above the bottom of the lake were collected from 2005 to 2020 nutrient concentrations total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were analyzed following standard methods in china jin and tu 1990 chla concentrations were calculated from spectrophotometric measurements after extraction in 90 hot ethanol chen et al 2003 totally there were 32 sampling sites in the long term monitoring while 13 of the sites in the northern part were sampled monthly and others were sampled seasonally since 2005 in this study the sites sampled monthly were used fig 1 the weighted mean values of nutrient and chla concentrations were used in our study to address spatial heterogeneity lake taihu was divided into 32 sections using the thiessen polygon method zhu et al 2014 and a weight factor was calculated for each site as the area of each polygon relative to the total area of the lake the sampling sites and other details can be found in deng et al 2020 daily algal bloom information from lake taihu between 2003 and 2020 was extracted from modis aqua images shi et al 2017 specifically the bloom frequency for each grid 250 m 250 m during a season was calculated as the ratio of the number of images with blooms to the total number of available images in the season the mean ratio of all grids was used as the bloom frequency for the season 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 long term trends of water quality and climatic variables temporal trends were visualized using weighted regression with bootstrapped smoothers this function calculates smoothers from 1000 bootstraps of the original samples followed by calculation of density estimates for each vertical cut through the bootstrapped smoothers which are then visualized by shade color and intensity kovalenko et al 2018 different trends of temperature and wind speed in both winter and spring were found deng et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 and both of them were significantly related to phytoplankton in lake taihu deng et al 2020 to avoid the collinearity of the independent variables the ratio of temperature to wind speed which is defined as the climatic factor was used in the analysis 2 3 2 continuous variable bayesian network models bayesian inferential methods perform well with small sample sizes and limited data leading to their ecological application qian 2016 and are increasingly used in environmental modeling that is used to support management decisions jiang et al 2021 qian et al 2022 bayesian networks bns for instance were used to determine the probability of cyanobacterial blooms in multiple lake systems rigosi et al 2015 however a bn model is limited to using categorical variables currently we can take advantage of both the causal relationship and the available data to build a modified bayesian network model using continuous variables cbn qian et al 2021 qian and miltner 2015 which borrows the basic model construction strategy used in a bn model jensen 2001 the basic idea of the cbn modeling approach is to replace the conditional probability tables for factor variables in a bn model with a series of conditional probability distributions for continuous variables with these conditional probability tables the conditional probability formula is used to quantify the functional relations among variables and the formula can be readily programmed qian et al 2021 when using continuous conditional probability distributions the computation can be implemented using the gibbs sampler qian et al 2003 which was more detailly described in supplementary materials according to our previous studies spring is a very sensitive season in which blooms were found to increase during the last two decades and inhibiting algal growth during the spring season would be beneficial for bloom control qu et al 2014 hence our analysis mainly focused on the spring season fig 2 a climate warming was found to have short term memory in our previous study deng et al 2020 thus the effects of winter conditions were also taken into account in our conceptual model finally four empirical regressions were built to develop the conceptual model of cbn fig 2b the detailed procedure for model development was provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 3 application of the cbn model the model setup first established a connection between the blooms and drivers to estimate the relative contributions of winter and spring environmental factors to the spring blooms then the model was further used to derive the bloom area distributions under different environmental conditions i e different tp concentrations and climatic factors finally the model was used to derive the nutrient distributions associated with desired bloom areas and frequencies e g bloom area 154 km2 or frequency 0 137 which are the 75th percentile of the bloom areas or frequency in spring respectively for the first application the two model input variables to be compared were set as values from a uniform distribution that was defined by the data for instance when the contributions of winter wind speed and spring climatic factor were compared they were assigned to a series of equal interval values between the maximum to minimum observed values the other input variables were set to constant values based on their mean values the predicted probabilities of a bloom area 154 km2 and a frequency 0 137 were then calculated as a function of winter wind speed and spring climatic factor for the second application the spring tp and climatic factor were assigned to a series of equal interval values between the range of the data and the other variables were set as constants using the mean values of the data then the probability of different bloom areas was estimated by the cbn model developed the predicted bloom area with a high probability of occurrence e g 90 was recorded and presented by a contour plot for the third application three simulations were carried out according to different spring climatic factors among the three decades the mean spring climatic factor from 1992 to 2000 was set as scenario 1 in which the temperatures were low and wind speeds were high compared to the other two scenarios and the mean spring climatic factor from 2001 to 2010 was set as scenario 2 the mean spring climatic factor from 2011 to 2020 was set as scenario 3 which involved higher temperatures and lower wind speeds than the other two scenarios then the predicted probability of a bloom area 154 km2 and a frequency 0 137 under different tp values were estimated all analyses and visualizations were carried out in r 4 1 1 r core team 2022 the packages and code for models development could be found at https github com songsqian nceflow 3 results 3 1 long term water quality and blooms in lake taihu the mean winter tp from 1992 to 2020 was 0 118 0 03 mg l 1 it was low before 2000 increased from 0 11 mg l 1 to 0 15 mg l 1 in 2011 and then significantly decreased to 0 10 mg l 1 until 2020 fig 3 a the mean spring tp from 1992 to 2020 was 0 120 0 04 mg l 1 which was slightly higher than that in winter however the spring tp showed an increasing trend from 1992 to 2010 and then decreased slightly with a rebounding trend in recent years fig 3b the mean spring tp from 2017 to 2020 was 0 13 mg l 1 in spring the mean bloom area from 2003 to 2020 was 137 107 km2 the bloom areas were lower than 100 km2 before 2005 and significantly increased to 250 km2 until 2007 fig 3c afterward there was a short decreasing process from 2007 to 2011 then the spring bloom area increased again from 2011 to 2020 recently the bloom areas were approximately 300 km2 the mean spring bloom frequency was 0 12 0 05 from 1992 to 2020 the long term trends of the spring bloom frequency presented the same pattern as that of the spring bloom areas the frequency was low before 2005 and increased to 0 2 in 2007 then the frequency declined to lower than 0 05 in 2011 the spring bloom frequency significantly increased again from 0 05 to 0 21 during 2011 and 2020 fig 3d 3 2 climate is becoming warmer and calmer the mean winter temperature in lake taihu was approximately 5 5 c and significantly increased from 2011 to 2020 fig 4 a the mean spring temperature was 16 c and significantly increased from 15 to 17 c from 1992 to 2020 which indicated that the increasing rate was equivalent to 0 71 c decade fig 4b both the winter and spring wind speeds in lake taihu showed the same declining pattern fig 4b c the climatic factors significantly increased in winter and spring fig 4e f 3 3 climate change and nutrient reduction affect bloom events as indicated by scatter plots linear regression models were generally suitable in lake taihu fig s1 finally four empirical regressions were built to develop the conceptual model of cbn table s1 the first model was the winter chla in the water column which was positively related to tp and negatively related to wind speed r 2 0 334 the second model was spring tp the spring tp was positively related to winter chla and conductivity r 2 0 361 the third and fourth models were bloom area and frequency in spring both of which were highly positively related to spring tp and spring climatic factors the results of the cross validation indicated that both the simulated bloom areas and frequency were in good agreement with the observed values r 2 0 6 and p 0 01 for both bloom areas and frequency estimation and slopes were both approximate equal to 1 fig s2 in addition root mean square error rmse for bloom areas and frequency estimation were 0 16 equal to 39 8 km2 while mean value was 109 0 km2 and 0 02 while mean value was 0 12 and mean absolute error mae were 0 13 equal to 20 0 km2 and 0 02 respectively for illustration purposes we used the 75th percentile values of the bloom area and frequency in our data 154 km2 and 0 137 respectively as the threshold values for large bloom areas and high frequencies the spring bloom areas and frequencies were sensitive to both winter wind speed and spring climatic factor due to the decreasing winter wind speed and the changing spring climate toward warmer and calmer conditions the probability for large bloom areas fig 5 a and high frequencies fig 5b significantly increased from less than 0 05 to 1 i e under current climatic conditions the probability of large bloom occurrences was 100 in spring in lake taihu the probability of a large bloom area was slightly related to the winter tp in recent decades fig 5c under spring climate change the probability for high bloom frequency increased from less than 0 05 in 2006 2010 to 0 85 fig 5d as estimated by the bayesian model the annual bloom area at a probability of 90 was much more sensitive to the spring climatic factor than to the spring tp from 1992 to 2020 fig 6 under the climate and tp conditions during 2006 2010 the mean annual bloom area at a 90 probability was approximately 35 km2 which was low and the mean bloom area increased to more than 180 km2 due to spring climate change during 2016 2020 if the nutrients did not change the reduction in tp during the past decade reduced the estimated bloom area to approximately 170 km2 3 4 evaluation of nutrient control targets to set nutrient criteria the bayesian model was further used to evaluate the spring tp thresholds required to achieve the management targets e g bloom area 154 km2 or frequency 0 137 in fig 7 under different climatic conditions under the climatic conditions of the early 1990s the spring tp threshold needed to ensure at a probability greater than 90 that a large bloom did not occur was 0 188 mg l 1 and the tp needed to be reduced by 16 0 158 mg l 1 for the same probability under the climatic conditions of the early 2010s a further reduction of 45 2 which was 0 073 mg l 1 was needed to ensure that there would be no large blooms in spring under the climatic conditions of the late 2010s using the mean tp values in 2019 and 2020 as examples reductions of as much as 0 063 mg l 1 46 3 were needed to ensure at a 90 probability that there would be no large blooms the thresholds of tp needed to ensure at a probability higher than 90 that a high bloom frequency would not occur also decreased with climate change from the early 1990s to the late 2010s currently 30 1 of the tp still needs to be reduced to 0 095 mg l 1 to ensure a bloom frequency of less than 0 137 in spring which was the 75th percentile of the bloom frequency during our study period 4 discussion our study used cbn to estimate the long term variation of spring cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu the cbn performed very well for both cyanobacterial bloom areas and frequencies predictions fig s2 according to the model the nutrients should be further reduced by 46 to control the blooms fig 7 the using of cbn could provide a very useful tool to estimate the nutrients reduction in different climate scenarios and under management goals 4 1 comparation cbn results with others the current analysis confirmed the contributions from both nutrients and climate warming to enhanced blooms in lake taihu fig 5 and the blooms in the lake might have been more sensitive to climatic conditions than to nutrients during the last two decades fig 6 the conclusion consisted with previous studies with different analysis methods previous study with structural equation model sem also proved that climatic factor e g wind speed is the main factor for phytoplankton proliferation deng et al 2018 the random forest model indicated that winter and spring chla were mainly correlated with climatic factors e g temperature and sunshine hours zou et al 2021 in addition study based on ordination analysis also showed that the impact of climatic factors on phytoplankton community in lake taihu has become increasingly important guo et al 2019 the conclusions were also confirmed by early indoor experiments that warming significantly promoted the cyanobacterial competitive advantage deng et al 2014b meanwhile our results were also consistent with the study using cbn which based on short term data among three lakes shan et al 2020 our previous studies mainly qualitatively analyzed the impact of climate change and human activities on the eutrophication of the lake taihu in this paper by using the bayesian model proposed by shan et al 2020 and qian et al 2021 we quantitatively analyzed the impact of climate change and human activities on cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu with the cbn results in our study climate change including both of warming and wind speed decreasing has increased cyanobacterial bloom areas by 414 from 35 km2 to 180 km2 under probability of 90 and nutrient reduction mitigated the expansion of cyanobacterial bloom areas by 5 6 the result was consistent with our knowledge although lake taihu has undergone vast restoration measures it still experienced a record cyanobacterial bloom in may 2017 qin et al 2019 4 2 climate change counteracts eutrophication management efforts in lake taihu though not all the examined parameters improved in the water column in lake taihu the water quality improvement in the lake might have also been confirmed by the significantly reduction in conductivity both in spring and in winter since 2007 fig s3 which can be used as a water quality indicator in the taihu basin deng et al 2014a wu et al 2020 the winter tp values have also significantly decreased with a four year lag since 2007 and delayed recovery has often been observed in other restoration cases jeppesen et al 2007 although the tp in spring did not decrease as expected the trends remained nearly stable after 2010 fig 3b the different patterns of tp between winter and spring might be related to the positive feedback among heavy blooms and internal nutrient release as explained by qin et al 2021 spring was the start of the growing season in lake taihu and heavy blooms enhanced tp release by increasing the ph and reducing the dissolved oxygen do in the water column qin et al 2021 hence the water column tp in spring was highly dependent on bloom events in spring the bloom events in lake taihu including bloom area and frequency however did not respond to the water quality improvement as excepted the chla data in spring in lake taihu also presented a similar pattern with blooms which continued to increase after 2010 qin et al 2019 lake chaohu a typical large shallow lake approximately 200 km2 away from lake taihu also showed an increase in surface algal bloom coverage frequency and duration with a trend toward earlier bloom formation zhang et al 2021 2015 bloom forming cyanobacteria have been observed with increasing frequency in poyang lake in china since 2000 liu et al 2016 the increasing trends of the blooms in these three subtropical lakes were also consistent with blooms all over the word that have presented increasing trends during the last two decades ho et al 2019 the climate around lake taihu has also undergone significant changes zhang et al 2018 increased temperatures and reduced wind speeds have also been widely reported especially in the northern hemisphere o reilly et al 2015 vautard et al 2010 the changing climate has been considered the major driver of blooms both globally ho et al 2019 and in china song et al 2021 hence climate change might be the major factor exacerbating cyanobacterial blooms under water quality improving in lake taihu and maybe other lakes as well 4 3 management targets under different climatic conditions our results indicated that although the external loading reduction effects were offset by climate warming fig 6 they should still be controlled to finally eliminate algal blooms since it tends to be the second important driver in the lake fig 7 which can be controlled by human in lake taihu the mean tp from 2006 to 2010 was 0 14 mg l 1 and it decreased to 0 13 mg l 1 from 2016 to 2020 if it were not for a 7 14 reduction in tp the area with a 90 probability of cyanobacterial blooms due to climate change would have increased from 35 km2 to 180 km2 compared to the current area of 170 km2 fig 6 the decrease in bloom areas following nutrient reduction could also be found in temperate shallow lakes where the phytoplankton biomass decreased after external loading was reduced jeppesen et al 2007 at present nutrient reduction targets must be specified for lake management and nutrient thresholds for bloom control must first be developed to establish bloom area targets in addition to quantitatively analyzed the impact of different drivers we further estimated the threshold values of nutrient concentrations for blooms control under different climate scenarios although it is widely accepted that bloom control needs to be even more stringent in the future our analysis is the first to the best of our knowledge to provide dynamic nutrient targets for bloom control in lake taihu in our study we primarily took the 75 quantile 154 km2 value of the annual mean blooms to define large blooms in lake taihu under the climatic conditions of the early 1990s with lower temperatures and windier conditions the estimated tp threshold required to ensure a high probability 90 of no large blooms occurring was 0 188 mg l 1 with the climatic conditions of the early 2010s the tp should be reduced to 0 158 mg l 1 and it should be further reduced to 0 073 mg l 1 under the current climatic conditions of higher temperature and lower wind speeds this indicates that tp reductions of more than 46 3 are needed to ensure a low probability of large blooms which is closer to the conclusion of xu et al 2015 that was estimated using the mass balance model our target tp value was also close to the critical tp concentration range 0 070 0 215 mg l 1 for controlling cyanobacterial proliferation in temperate lakes wagner and adrian 2009 and in the nutrient addition experiments conducted in lake taihu xu et al 2010 our results as well results from jiang et al 2021 implied that the bayesian model can effectively estimate corresponding critical nutrient reduction targets for controlling cyanobacterial blooms under different climatic scenarios and depend on management goals which could be easily apply to other lakes 5 conclusions continuous bayesian network model was developed to simulate spring bloom areas and frequencies in lake taihu as the model estimated during the period from 2003 to 2020 climate change expanded the area of cyanobacteria bloom with a probability of 90 from 35 km2 to 180 km2 while nutrient reduction mitigated the expansion of cyanobacterial blooms caused by climate change by 5 6 if want to control spring cyanobacterial bloom areas below 154 km2 under the current climate conditions the concentration of total phosphorus in the lake should be controlled below 0 073 mg l i e 46 of total phosphorus still needs to be reduced our study helps to provide an effective tool for estimating

14844,in the present study the infiltration and resuspension of microplastics mps in a slope substrate under the influence of repeated tidal forces were investigated using a tidal tank in the scenario in which mps were placed on the top of the slope increasing numbers of particles were observed on the water surface with the increase in tidal cycles more particles of smaller equivalent particle diameter dmp and low density floated to the water surface the horizontal positions positive toward the lower tide zone of mps showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c of mps mp density mp weight dmp and corey shape factor whereas they showed significant negative correlation with the rate of tidal level change and the longest length a of mps the vertical positions positive in the downward direction of mps showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c of mps mp density mp weight dmp and corey shape factor while they demonstrated significant negative correlation with the largest cross section area and surface tension of mps in the scenario in which mps were placed at the bottom of the tank the smaller and low density particles had a higher possibility of moving upward to the water surface under repeated tidal forces high density particles also migrated to the water surface due to the surface tension force further a lower rate of tidal level change contributed to more floating of particles the horizontal positions of mps showed significant positive correlation with mp density while they demonstrated significant negative correlation with the largest cross section area and surface tension of mps the vertical positions of mps showed significant positive correlation with the longest length a of mps mp density mp weight and dmp these results imply that large high density and less flatty particles tend to be distributed in the lower tidal zone and deeper substrate layers these findings can help understand the redistribution of mps and assess their risk in the shoreline environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics tide transport distribution substrate tidal tank data availability the data are included in the manuscript 1 introduction environmental pollution with plastic is a growing problem global plastic production has soared since the 1940s reaching approximately 400 million tonnes per year plasticseurope 2020 plastics enter the environment via a variety of pathways including runoff atmospheric transport littering sewage discharge aquaculture fisheries and shipping ocean and ocean sediment can serve as an ultimate sink for plastics martin et al 2022 based on the human development index hdi a study predicted that 57 000 265 000 mt of plastic would flow into the ocean from rivers in 2018 mai et al 2020 large plastic in the ocean can be fragmented into small pieces by waves and currents abrasion by solid particles photodegradation or biochemical degradation in marine environments wang et al 2022a these microplastics mps feature a small size high specific area high adsorption capacity high mobility and resistance posing long term potential threats to vegetation animals and human beings akhbarizadeh et al 2017 coastal areas offer a collection of services and goods such as water supply disturbance regulation waste processing carbon sequestration biodiversity maintenance and provisioning services the coastal tidal zones are home to a wide variety of plants and birds as well as benthic species which play significant ecological and socioeconomic roles french et al 1996 nevertheless the coastal zone is often characterized by a high population density and intense anthropogenic activities such as shipping industry fishery and commerce making it a hotspot for plastic pollution feng et al 2021 land based plastic debris is transported through the coastal zone to reach the open ocean a high abundance of mps has been recorded in tidal water sediment and biota a global scale meta analysis revealed that in coastal wetland sediments and marine animals the abundance of plastics reached 156 7 and 98 3 items kg respectively 200 times higher than in water 0 43 items kg ouyang et al 2022 li et al 2021 found that the abundance of mps during the rainy season reached 545 5 particles m3 in the pearl river estuary in the south china sea pazos et al 2018 observed that the mean density of mps reached 139 items m3 in the inner zone of the río de la plata estuary leads and weinstein 2019 reported that intertidal sediment subtidal sediment and sea surface microlayer mp concentrations ranged from 0 to 652 items m2 3 4375 items kg and 3 36 items l respectively within the charleston harbor estuary tributaries previous field studies mainly focused on water and the surface sediment layer while less attention has been paid to the subsurface layer the large chemically reactive area and porosity of sediments render them a considerable sink for pollutants wang et al 2021 sediments can also serve as a source of contaminants when they are disturbed thereby remobilizing contaminants into water columns the substrate is a habitat for many aquatic biotic communities hunt et al 2006 the presence of mps in sediment may fundamentally affect the surrounding ecosystem and the creatures that live there roche et al 2019 the infiltration retention periods and migration of mps in substrates are of great toxicological significance to organisms the occurrence of mps in sediments has been recorded in many field studies alomar et al 2016 bosker et al 2019 bridson et al 2020 in this regard the patterns of mp distribution in sediments differ tremendously in both temporal and spatial scales due to a variety of factors such as substrate and mp properties size shape aging stage color geographic factors climate and hydrodynamic forces however previous studies of mp distributions in tidal zones have primarily focused on a large spatial scale whereas an accurate and validated analysis of mp behavior under hydrodynamic forces has yet to be completed hydrodynamic forces play a major role in transporting inorganic substances in aquatic ecosystem wang et al 2018a khadanga et al 2022 for instance the tide in the severn estuary leads to highly mobile sediments up to 5000 mg l duquesne et al 2006 tidally driven resuspension can remobilize heavy metals from sediments jonas and millward 2010 currents and waves can flush plastics onto shores while plastic stranded in the shoreline substrate can be washed back into the sea however these studies are inconsistent concerning the impact of tidal forces on mp concentrations in water and sediments for instance rowley et al 2020 found more mps in water during ebb tide when compared to flood tide whereas stead et al 2020 and li et al 2023 claimed that mp abundance in water decreased from flood tide to ebb tide wu et al 2022 reported the abundance of fine mps 45 300 μm increased while the large mps 300 μm increased during the flood tide implying flood tide carried more fine mps into the estuary than large ones yin et al 2022 observed that tides had opposite effects on the inner and outer harbors as spring tides enriched mps in the outer harbor area additionally the effects of tidal cycles on mps have been examined by multiple studies with the consensus that concentrations of mps can vary significantly within or between tidal cycles leading to considerable uncertainties when interpreting field data moreira et al 2016 cohen et al 2019 balthazar silva et al 2020 in fact due to the complex interplay of various factors no concrete trend in mp concentration has been observed in response to tidal forces to date a limited number of studies have empirically investigated the transport of mps in coastal zones under dynamic boundaries only the influence of waves on mp transport has been investigated using a wave tank alsina et al 2020 kerpen et al 2020 guler et al 2022 schuster wallace et al 2022 it is still unclear how tides transport plastic furthermore most global numerical models that predict plastic fluxes do not explicitly account for plastic motion in coastal regions including plastic beaching neumann et al 2014 due to the lack of related information current coastal models are not suited for capturing small scale variability which is vital for monitoring and predicting mp distributions rodrigues et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study are to investigate 1 the infiltration of mps under the influence of tidal cycles combined with the rates of tidal level change and mp characteristics and 2 the upward movement of mps under the influence of tidal cycles combined with the rates of tidal level change and mp characteristics the obtained results can provide significant information for mp fate and guidance for cleanup in tidal zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 particle characteristics throughout the experiments 13 mp groups of various shapes densities and sizes were used including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe nylon polylactic acid pla and polyvinyl chloride pvc the plastic materials were purchased from amazon 90 of the synthetic plastic worldwide is one of the following types low and high density pe pp pvc ps and pet shah et al 2008 according to reviews conducted by ouyang et al 2022 and guo et al 2021 regarding global presence of mps in coastal wetland and global reservoirs pe and pp are the most abundant types the properties of all the particles are given in table 1 and fig 1 the particle dimension was based on the measurement of 10 particles each the selected mps varied in shape representing most of the typical particle shape in sphericity form diagram the equivalent particle diameter dmp was determined using the formula 1 d m p a b c 3 the corey shape factor csf used as a parameter for particle shape was determined by 2 c s f c a b where a b and c are the longest medium and shortest particle side lengths respectively for a cube or sphere cfs equals 1 and decreases with grain flatness capillary force withstanding gravity was calculated as follows 3 f c a p γ ξ s i n θ where γ is the surface tension of the fluid and ξ m a x is the maximal perimeter of the cross section area parallel to the water surface θ is the indentation angle between the horizontal water surface and the object when only vertical forces are present the capillary force is maximal all the mp particles were rinsed with deionized water and soaked in water for 24 h before the tank experiment the 15 82 mm diameter glass beads were used as an alternative to natural sediments to provide the exact grain size the glass beads were transparent which helped identify mp particles clearly the glass beads were placed in the tank at a 26 6 slope 2 2 experiment setup the physical model experiments were carried out in a tidal simulator as shown in fig 2 the simulator consists of a tidal tank 40 cm in length and 30 cm in width a control cabinet a feed tank and an effluent container metal mesh was placed at each side of the substrate to avoid the escape of particles in each run 30 particles per particle type were placed in the tank resulting in 360 mp particles cross shore coordinate x is defined as positive toward the lower tide zone and vertical coordinate z is defined as positive in the downward direction ten particles of each mp type were placed at the 5 cm 20 cm and 35 cm horizontal positions respectively during each cycle the tap water flooded the substrate and reached a high level of 20 cm then drained to 0 cm ten tidal cycles were implemented for each run three rates of tidal level change of 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 cm min were used for both scenarios the actual fluctuating velocity of tide in environment varied greatly for instance panchenko et al 2019 found the tidal current amplitude varied from about 0 16 to 1 2 m s in spring tide and 0 01 to 0 57 m s in neap tide zhang et al 2020 found that the tidal velocity ranged from 0 5 to 1 m s wu et al 2020 revealed that the tidal velocity ranged from 0 05 to 0 3 m s therefore the rates of tidal level change selected in the experiment mainly aimed to reveal the transport of mps along with the rate change two scenarios were conducted in the first scenario mps were placed on the top of the substrate slope at the 5 20 and 35 cm horizontal positions in the second scenario mps were placed at the bottom of the substrate at the 5 20 and 35 cm horizontal positions to avoid mps being pinned under the glass beads the bottom of the tank was first packed with one layer of glass beads and then the mps were placed in the void space among the glass beads the remaining glass beads were then packed following the bottom layer 2 3 mp quantification and distribution analysis during the tidal experiment when the water level increased to 20 cm height the number of each mp type floating on the water surface was counted the floating percentage was calculated as the ratio of the floating mp number to the initial added mp number in tank after 10 tidal cycles glass beads were carefully taken out in a 1 cm depth and 5 cm width interval for the whole substrate resulting in a total of 89 sampling fractions for determining the overall mp distribution in each sampling the glass beads taken from the tank were placed in a beaker the glass beads were then rinsed with water to adequately separate the mps for the quantification of each type of mp in each substrate fraction all tank experiments were conducted as duplicates and the batch with higher mp recovery rate was selected for analysis the detailed experiment design and recovery rate for each mp are presented in table s1 after counting all the mps in substrate the recovery rates of pp1 and pp2 ranged from 83 33 to 100 and 93 33 to 100 the recovery rates of pe1 pe2 pe3 ranged from 86 67 to 100 90 to 100 and 90 to 100 respectively the recovery rates of ny1 and ny2 ranged from 83 33 to 100 and 90 to 100 the recovery rates of pla1 pla2 pvc1 pvc2 v1 and v2 ranged from 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 and 90 00 to 100 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the infiltration of mps under the influence of tidal cycles schruff 2018 defined several infiltration behaviors according to the ratio of particle diameter to substrate diameter unimpeded static percolation could be observed when the ratio is smaller than 0 11 the ratios between 0 11 to 0 32 and 0 32 correspond to finite depth infiltration and fine surface sealing in the present study the ratio of dmp to substrate diameter ranged between 0 05 to 0 26 fig 3 shows the floating percentages of mps after each increase in tidal water levels more particles with smaller dmp floated on the water surface as the water level increased further 90 100 of the pp1 floated on the surface after 10 tidal cycles while the floating percentage was 77 90 for pp2 at different rates of tidal level change for pe particles more pe1 and pe2 floated on the surface after 10 tidal cycles compared to pe3 with regard to high density particles their presence on the surface water surprisingly increased with tidal cycles for instance the floated ny1 changed from 47 to 70 after 10 cycles under a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min whereas the floated ny2 changed from 37 to 43 the floated pla1 increased from 17 to 47 and the pla2 increased from 33 to 40 after 10 cycles the pvc1 observed on the surface increased from 43 to 73 and the pvc2 increased from 40 to 67 after 10 cycles the v1 on the surface increased from 30 to 53 and the v2 increased from 40 to 43 after 10 cycles we observed that larger particles floated to the surface at the first water level increase since large particles had more difficulty infiltrating the substrate however as the tidal cycles increased smaller particles floated on the water surface due to buoyance force or surface tension force with respect to particle density more particles with a density lower than water floated on the surface compared to the high density particles as suggested by the results it was hard for low density particles to infiltrate the sublayer of substrate under the influence of repeated water level changes the change in rates of tidal level did not change the particle floating greatly fig 3 the number of floated particles was similar among the tests with different rates of tidal level change an analysis was conducted to correlate the floating percentages of mps and indicators including the rate of tidal level change longest a medium b and shortest particle side lengths c of mps mp density mp weight dmp the largest cross section area perimeter and cfs considering all the mp particles the floating percentages increased significantly with the increase of b and the largest cross section area whereas decreased significantly with the increase of mp density and csf fig 4a accounting for only the low density particles the floating percentages showed a significantly negative correlation with rates of tidal level change c mp density weight dmp fig 4b the floating percentages of high density particles demonstrated a significant positive correlation with b whereas they showed a significant negative correlation with c and csf fig 4c the results imply that particles with a large cross section area low density and flatty particles had difficulty infiltrating the substrate and tended to float on the water surface with tidal movement lower rate of tidal level change contributed to higher floating percentage for low density mps the floating of low density particles results from buoyance force mp density smaller than aqueous phase density and surface tension whereas the floating of high density particles results mainly from surface tension as a result lower rates of tidal level change have longer inundation times allowing more time for low density particles to float the distribution of mp particles in the substrate after 10 tidal cycles is shown in fig 5 more small dmp particles such as pp1 pp2 ny1 and ny2 were distributed on the top of the substrate profile while large dmp particles were concentrated in the lower part of the profile fig 5 j k l presents the distribution of mps in the top 1 cm surface substrate only a small portion of the mps was retained on the surface layer more mps with small dmp such as pp1 pp2 ny1 and ny2 were retained on the surface layer compared to other mps with large dmp as shown in fig 5j more mps with small dmp remained in the high tidal zone whereas mps with large dmp in the surface layer tended to be distributed in the lower tidal zone fig 5l it should be noted that the tank experiment was assumed to be a closed system since the two sides of the substrate were intercepted by the meshes therefore if the mesh were not present mps retained in the lower substrate might have been transported further downward to further explore the underlying relationship between mp transport and its properties a correlation analysis was conducted between the positions of each mp and the mp properties fig s1a in the scenario in which mps were placed on top of the glass beads the horizontal location of mps x showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c mp density mp weight dmp and csf while it had significant negative correlation with the rate of tidal level change and the longest length a the vertical distribution of mps showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c mp density mp weight dmp and csf while demonstrating significant negative correlation with the medium length b largest cross section area perimeter and surface tension of mps the results imply that the large high density and less flatty particles tended to move downward along the beach slope and infiltrate the deep substrate layer under the influence of repeated tidal forces the one direction infiltration of mps has been investigated in previous studies suggesting that the depth of mp infiltration is influenced by the size and shape of mps as well as the permeability of sediments a smaller mp size and large substrate porosity support deep mp infiltration waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2020 nevertheless in the present study the particles with small dmp tended to retain in the surface layer and upper tidal zone under repeated water level changes indicating that the hydrodynamic forces in the natural environment greatly complicate mp transport only a few studies have used water tanks to study the transport of mps and have focused mainly on the effects of waves for instance kerpen et al 2020 found that during the formation of the bed profile particles with a density greater than that of water 1 25 g cm3 were partly confined to deeper layers of the sloping beach whereas particles with a density lower than that of water floated continuously in the surf zone or were deposited on the beach during wave action alsina et al 2020 found that floating particles stay near the water surface whereas nonfloating particles migrate close to the bed at slower velocities than floating particles these results are similar to the present study in that the high density particles tended to distribute in the deep substrate layer and low tidal zone the transport of particles in the substrate is distinctive from that of other substances for instance vandermeulen et al 1988 found that the depth of oil penetration increases with tidal cycles as the repeated downward movement of water carries viscous oil into deeper substrates and adheres to the substrate surface 3 2 the resuspension of mps under the influence of tidal cycles through sediment mixing or bioturbation surface sediments can be translocated into deeper layers taking plastic particles with them martinetto et al 2016 hence the transport of mps beneath the substrate under tidal influence was also studied in terms of particle size smaller particles floated on the water surface for instance in a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min 57 and 17 of pp1 and pp2 respectively floated to the surface after 10 tidal cycles fig 6a the floating percentages of pe1 pe2 and pe3 were 70 53 and 10 respectively fig 6b surprisingly high density particles at the bottom of the substrate were increasingly transported to the water surface under the influence of water level changes similarly high density particles with smaller particle size showed a higher probability of floating on the water surface taking the results of 0 25 cm min as an example 27 and 10 of ny1 and ny2 respectively floated to the surface after 10 tidal cycles pla2 did not float to the water surface whereas 33 of pla1 floated to the surface after 10 tidal cycles similarly 33 of pvc1 was moved to the surface although no pvc2 was seen on the water surface and 27 and 7 of v1 and v2 respectively were moved to the surface after 10 cycles with respect to particle density more low density particles were transported to surface water compared to high density particles ny1 and pp1 had similar dmp of 0 77 and 0 84 mm respectively however 57 and 27 of pp1 and ny1 respectively moved to the surface after 10 tidal cycles under a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min the dmp of pp2 and ny2 were 1 09 and 0 97 mm respectively but their floating percentages were 17 and 10 after 10 tidal cycles under a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min pla2 and pe1 had dmp of 2 44 and 2 56 mm respectively whereas their floating percentages were 0 and 70 the rate of tidal level change also affected the upward migration of particles a decrease in the change rate resulted in increased floating of particles especially small particles with increasing rates of tidal level change of 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 cm min 57 50 and 33 of the pp1 were moved to the water surface after 10 tidal cycles whereas 70 73 and 63 of pe1 respectively were observed on the water surface fig 6a f for high density particles the increase in the rate of tidal level change decreased the floating percentage from 27 to 17 for ny1 from 33 to 20 for pla1 and from 27 to 20 for v1 fig 6 g r however the floating percentages of larger particles did not vary greatly with the changed rate the floating of high density particles on the water surface is attributed to the balance between surface tension and gravity a small disturbance to such balance may lead to the settling of particles a higher flow rate may lead to an unsteady water surface and more disturbance to the particles however such disturbances do not interrupt the floating of low density particles the greater floating of low density particles is attributed to a longer submerge time for floating the correlation analysis considering all mp particles revealed floating percentages significantly decreased with the increase of mp density and perimeter fig 7a when only low density particles were considered the floating percentages decreased significantly with the increase of the longest length a the medium length b the largest cross section area perimeter and surface tension of mps while they showed a positive correlation with csf fig 7b the floating percentages of high density particles demonstrated a significant decrease with the increase of the rate of tidal level change the longest length a weight dmp and perimeter fig 7c the results suggest that the smaller low density and less flatty particles had a higher possibility of moving upward to the water surface under repeated tidal forces the distribution of various mp particles in the substrate profile is shown in fig 8 clearly demonstrating that both the low and high density mps moved upward similar to the results from the previous section smaller dmp particles were retained in the surface substrate layer compared to large dmp particles with a focus on the surface layer top 1 cm more mps were detected in the upper tidal zone fig 8j k l in the scenario in which mps were buried at the bottom of the substrate the horizontal positions x of various mps showed significant positive correlation with mp density whereas they demonstrated significant negative correlation with the medium length b the largest cross section area and surface tension of mps fig s1b the vertical positions z of mps showed significant positive correlation with the longest length a of mps mp density mp weight and dmp this result implies that high density and large particles tended to distribute in the lower tidal zone and deeper substrate layer 3 3 the significance of surface tension in determining the transport of mps most of the shore is free of hydrodynamic forces at low tide the water arrives at intermediate tidal levels and can crash directly onto particles where particles were previously present imposing impinging forces as the tide rises and the particles are fully submerged in water drag and lift forces take over and the impinging disappears during this repeated process in the tidal zone the impact of surface tension on mp behavior is evident but has not been noted extensively stolte et al 2015 discussed grain floating by surface tension during the density separation process for extracting mps from sediment samples after extraction by density separation hundreds of particles float on top of the deionized water these particles are stirred from the bottom and kept afloat by surface tension which counterbalances the gravity that causes nonfloating particles to sink stolte et al 2015 also proved that more particles are extracted from finer grained sediments indicating that finer particles are easier to support by surface tension thus more particles are extracted hydrostatic pressure and surface tension make up the force that counteracts gravity vella 2015 floating bodies with lateral dimensions much smaller than capillary length have negligible buoyancy and their floating is due to surface tension it is crucial to understand floating for a variety of biological and engineering problems vella 2015 assuming the indentation angle between the water surface and a sphere surface is 30 the surface tension can support a 3 mm diameter sphere particle with a density of 2500 kg m3 and around 5 mm sphere particles with a density of 1000 kg m3 fig 9 as a result most of the mps can float on the water surface with the support of surface tension force this is confirmed by the present study which found that not only the low density particles migrated upward under tidal influence but also the high density particles therefore it is necessary to reconsider the presumption that mp particles remain on the surface because their density is lower than that of water the aggregation of plastic particles was another commonly observed phenomenon on the water surface during the experiment fig 9b aggregates can form through attractive interactions depending on the forces and positions among the particles different floating particles with different wetting properties can repel each other while particles of the same properties always attract each other when particles come into contact with a liquid the slope of the liquid interface at the contact line decreases because the liquid rises between particles as a result the horizontal projection of tension force is greater between particles than on the outside resulting in an attractive force dalbe et al 2011 in a natural environment the aggregation of floating litter is named windrow irrespective of the force such as convergence wind tides or density driven currents cózar et al 2021 marine life interacts frequently with windrows however since litter windrows are dispersed small and ephemeral they are generally overlooked in research marine litter pollution can be prevented primarily by restricting litter from entering the sea followed by its collection high loads of patchy floating litter raise expectations for marine litter cleanup only a large quantity of litter can form litter windrows making it possible to mark zones and periods of heavy pollution by employing aerial surveys there has also been evidence that active fishing for windrows can effectively capture large amounts of litter for instance ruiz et al 2020 conducted 196 tows and collected 16 2 tons of floating marine litter most of the litter windrows were around 1 km in length and on average accumulated 77 75 kg of floating marine litter with plastic being the most common type of material accounting for 96 it may be worthwhile to conduct ocean cleanups when sensitive zones of high ecological and economic value such as tourist beaches marine protected areas aquaculture facilities or shipping routes are at risk of contamination prior to implementing these recommended actions it is imperative to conduct a proper environmental impact assessment although large mesh openings and slow tow speeds can help reduce fish turtles and mammals being caught mechanical cleanups on ocean surfaces may also remove drifting seaweed fish eggs or planktons cózar et al 2021 wang et al 2022b 3 4 implications for field sampling and data interpretation previous field sampling mainly focused on the top beach surface 0 5 cm as an indicator of plastic pollution in a specific area bissen and chawchai 2020 corcoran et al 2020 egessa et al 2020 exposito et al 2021 jaubet et al 2021 fred ahmadu et al 2022 as suggested in the present study only a small proportion of the added mps were retained on the surface layer the vertical distribution of mps was uneven among the various mp types more small particles were retained in the top 1 cm substrate and upper tidal zone compared to the large particles in the dmp substrate diameter range of the present study sampling depth is an important aspect in quantifying mp abundance however only a few studies sampled sediments deeper than 50 cm willis et al 2017 wang et al 2018b fan et al 2019 li et al 2020 belivermis et al 2021 culligan et al 2021 viet dung et al 2021 in general mp abundance declines from the surface to the deep layer which is in line with plastic production and consumption fan et al 2019 for a comprehensive understanding of mp inventory on shorelines it is essential to analyze deeper sediment layers as has been done for other contaminants in previous field studies exploring the litter or mp distribution along the beach the high tideline is generally selected as the sampling location since more litter or plastics were detected on the surface layer silva cavalcanti et al 2009 costa et al 2010 jayasiri et al 2013 prarat and hongsawat 2022 for instance bancin et al 2019 found that the concentration of plastic particles above the high tideline was higher than the intertidal zone and pe pp and ps were the primarily detected particle types heo et al 2013 recorded the mean abundance of small plastics to be 473 866 particles m2 at the cross section perpendicular to the shoreline and 976 405 particles m2 at the high strandline in the upper tidal zone specifically low density styrofoam spherules accounted for 96 3 in the cross section and 90 7 of the total plastic abundance in the high strandline the cross section distribution of styrofoam fragment and pellet was distinctive constant et al 2019 found that the high deposition line had the highest mp concentration with a mean concentration of 115 items kg compared to the overall mean of 30 items kg as indicated by the present study the low weight and low density mps have a higher possibility of being retained in the upper tidal zone while the high density high weight less flatty mps have a tendency to move along the beach slope with the receding water and are hard to move upward by water level increase previous tank studies proved that high density mps were confined to the deeper layer of the beach and moved close to the bed alsina et al 2020 therefore a large quantity of mps with high density may be retained in the deep substrate or at the bottom of the sea leading to an underestimation of mp loads in coastal zones in addition the density of mps can be increased through aggregation with natural suspended particles or through being covered by a biofilm of microorganisms yang et al 2021 2022 biofilms facilitate the aggregation of mps by producing sticky substances on mps and therefore play a crucial role in the vertical migration of mps currently the response and cleanup techniques of mps in the environment are still under development the m v x press pearl caught fire in may 2021 spilling 1680 tons of spherical plastic 5 mm white 18 km off the west coast of sri lanka mongabay 2021 the response techniques utilized were similar to oiled shoreline responses including manual removal handheld sieving floating trommel and large scale sieving however the separation of high density particles with sizes similar to those of sediments is still difficult in the present study glass beads were used as a model substrate owing to their transparency and easily measurable size however sediment in the natural environment is more complex given its variability in terms of surface morphology shape and density in this regard shen et al 2011 suggested that surface roughness plays a key role in colloid deposition finding that polystyrene latex microspheres were retained at higher concentrations in sand than in glass beads they also found that the sharp asperities on the surface of sand particles enhance particle deposition in primary minima by decreasing the energy barrier and that the presence of valleys on the surface of the sand particles increases attachment in secondary minima sand gravel or pebble notably could be much smaller or have an uneven grain distribution than the glass beads used in the present study as such a higher trapping efficiency can be expected for these materials in the natural environment the present study did not consider the groundwater and related process for instance the intertidal circulation cell geng and boufadel 2015 geng et al 2020 which require further investigation 4 conclusions this is the first study to investigate the transport of mps under dynamic boundary conditions using a tidal tank the effects of tidal level changes on the infiltration and resuspension of mps featured with various sizes densities and shapes were revealed dmp substrate diameter ranged from 0 05 to 0 26 our results confirmed that as tidal cycle increases the number of particles on the water surface also increased more particles of small dmp and low density floated to the water surface high density particles also migrated to water surface due to surface tension force further a lower rate of tidal level change contributed to more floating of particles the distribution of mps in substrate proved that large high density and less flatty particles tend to be distributed in the lower tidal zone and deeper substrate layers these findings can help understand the redistribution of mps and assess their risk in the shoreline environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14844,in the present study the infiltration and resuspension of microplastics mps in a slope substrate under the influence of repeated tidal forces were investigated using a tidal tank in the scenario in which mps were placed on the top of the slope increasing numbers of particles were observed on the water surface with the increase in tidal cycles more particles of smaller equivalent particle diameter dmp and low density floated to the water surface the horizontal positions positive toward the lower tide zone of mps showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c of mps mp density mp weight dmp and corey shape factor whereas they showed significant negative correlation with the rate of tidal level change and the longest length a of mps the vertical positions positive in the downward direction of mps showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c of mps mp density mp weight dmp and corey shape factor while they demonstrated significant negative correlation with the largest cross section area and surface tension of mps in the scenario in which mps were placed at the bottom of the tank the smaller and low density particles had a higher possibility of moving upward to the water surface under repeated tidal forces high density particles also migrated to the water surface due to the surface tension force further a lower rate of tidal level change contributed to more floating of particles the horizontal positions of mps showed significant positive correlation with mp density while they demonstrated significant negative correlation with the largest cross section area and surface tension of mps the vertical positions of mps showed significant positive correlation with the longest length a of mps mp density mp weight and dmp these results imply that large high density and less flatty particles tend to be distributed in the lower tidal zone and deeper substrate layers these findings can help understand the redistribution of mps and assess their risk in the shoreline environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics tide transport distribution substrate tidal tank data availability the data are included in the manuscript 1 introduction environmental pollution with plastic is a growing problem global plastic production has soared since the 1940s reaching approximately 400 million tonnes per year plasticseurope 2020 plastics enter the environment via a variety of pathways including runoff atmospheric transport littering sewage discharge aquaculture fisheries and shipping ocean and ocean sediment can serve as an ultimate sink for plastics martin et al 2022 based on the human development index hdi a study predicted that 57 000 265 000 mt of plastic would flow into the ocean from rivers in 2018 mai et al 2020 large plastic in the ocean can be fragmented into small pieces by waves and currents abrasion by solid particles photodegradation or biochemical degradation in marine environments wang et al 2022a these microplastics mps feature a small size high specific area high adsorption capacity high mobility and resistance posing long term potential threats to vegetation animals and human beings akhbarizadeh et al 2017 coastal areas offer a collection of services and goods such as water supply disturbance regulation waste processing carbon sequestration biodiversity maintenance and provisioning services the coastal tidal zones are home to a wide variety of plants and birds as well as benthic species which play significant ecological and socioeconomic roles french et al 1996 nevertheless the coastal zone is often characterized by a high population density and intense anthropogenic activities such as shipping industry fishery and commerce making it a hotspot for plastic pollution feng et al 2021 land based plastic debris is transported through the coastal zone to reach the open ocean a high abundance of mps has been recorded in tidal water sediment and biota a global scale meta analysis revealed that in coastal wetland sediments and marine animals the abundance of plastics reached 156 7 and 98 3 items kg respectively 200 times higher than in water 0 43 items kg ouyang et al 2022 li et al 2021 found that the abundance of mps during the rainy season reached 545 5 particles m3 in the pearl river estuary in the south china sea pazos et al 2018 observed that the mean density of mps reached 139 items m3 in the inner zone of the río de la plata estuary leads and weinstein 2019 reported that intertidal sediment subtidal sediment and sea surface microlayer mp concentrations ranged from 0 to 652 items m2 3 4375 items kg and 3 36 items l respectively within the charleston harbor estuary tributaries previous field studies mainly focused on water and the surface sediment layer while less attention has been paid to the subsurface layer the large chemically reactive area and porosity of sediments render them a considerable sink for pollutants wang et al 2021 sediments can also serve as a source of contaminants when they are disturbed thereby remobilizing contaminants into water columns the substrate is a habitat for many aquatic biotic communities hunt et al 2006 the presence of mps in sediment may fundamentally affect the surrounding ecosystem and the creatures that live there roche et al 2019 the infiltration retention periods and migration of mps in substrates are of great toxicological significance to organisms the occurrence of mps in sediments has been recorded in many field studies alomar et al 2016 bosker et al 2019 bridson et al 2020 in this regard the patterns of mp distribution in sediments differ tremendously in both temporal and spatial scales due to a variety of factors such as substrate and mp properties size shape aging stage color geographic factors climate and hydrodynamic forces however previous studies of mp distributions in tidal zones have primarily focused on a large spatial scale whereas an accurate and validated analysis of mp behavior under hydrodynamic forces has yet to be completed hydrodynamic forces play a major role in transporting inorganic substances in aquatic ecosystem wang et al 2018a khadanga et al 2022 for instance the tide in the severn estuary leads to highly mobile sediments up to 5000 mg l duquesne et al 2006 tidally driven resuspension can remobilize heavy metals from sediments jonas and millward 2010 currents and waves can flush plastics onto shores while plastic stranded in the shoreline substrate can be washed back into the sea however these studies are inconsistent concerning the impact of tidal forces on mp concentrations in water and sediments for instance rowley et al 2020 found more mps in water during ebb tide when compared to flood tide whereas stead et al 2020 and li et al 2023 claimed that mp abundance in water decreased from flood tide to ebb tide wu et al 2022 reported the abundance of fine mps 45 300 μm increased while the large mps 300 μm increased during the flood tide implying flood tide carried more fine mps into the estuary than large ones yin et al 2022 observed that tides had opposite effects on the inner and outer harbors as spring tides enriched mps in the outer harbor area additionally the effects of tidal cycles on mps have been examined by multiple studies with the consensus that concentrations of mps can vary significantly within or between tidal cycles leading to considerable uncertainties when interpreting field data moreira et al 2016 cohen et al 2019 balthazar silva et al 2020 in fact due to the complex interplay of various factors no concrete trend in mp concentration has been observed in response to tidal forces to date a limited number of studies have empirically investigated the transport of mps in coastal zones under dynamic boundaries only the influence of waves on mp transport has been investigated using a wave tank alsina et al 2020 kerpen et al 2020 guler et al 2022 schuster wallace et al 2022 it is still unclear how tides transport plastic furthermore most global numerical models that predict plastic fluxes do not explicitly account for plastic motion in coastal regions including plastic beaching neumann et al 2014 due to the lack of related information current coastal models are not suited for capturing small scale variability which is vital for monitoring and predicting mp distributions rodrigues et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study are to investigate 1 the infiltration of mps under the influence of tidal cycles combined with the rates of tidal level change and mp characteristics and 2 the upward movement of mps under the influence of tidal cycles combined with the rates of tidal level change and mp characteristics the obtained results can provide significant information for mp fate and guidance for cleanup in tidal zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 particle characteristics throughout the experiments 13 mp groups of various shapes densities and sizes were used including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe nylon polylactic acid pla and polyvinyl chloride pvc the plastic materials were purchased from amazon 90 of the synthetic plastic worldwide is one of the following types low and high density pe pp pvc ps and pet shah et al 2008 according to reviews conducted by ouyang et al 2022 and guo et al 2021 regarding global presence of mps in coastal wetland and global reservoirs pe and pp are the most abundant types the properties of all the particles are given in table 1 and fig 1 the particle dimension was based on the measurement of 10 particles each the selected mps varied in shape representing most of the typical particle shape in sphericity form diagram the equivalent particle diameter dmp was determined using the formula 1 d m p a b c 3 the corey shape factor csf used as a parameter for particle shape was determined by 2 c s f c a b where a b and c are the longest medium and shortest particle side lengths respectively for a cube or sphere cfs equals 1 and decreases with grain flatness capillary force withstanding gravity was calculated as follows 3 f c a p γ ξ s i n θ where γ is the surface tension of the fluid and ξ m a x is the maximal perimeter of the cross section area parallel to the water surface θ is the indentation angle between the horizontal water surface and the object when only vertical forces are present the capillary force is maximal all the mp particles were rinsed with deionized water and soaked in water for 24 h before the tank experiment the 15 82 mm diameter glass beads were used as an alternative to natural sediments to provide the exact grain size the glass beads were transparent which helped identify mp particles clearly the glass beads were placed in the tank at a 26 6 slope 2 2 experiment setup the physical model experiments were carried out in a tidal simulator as shown in fig 2 the simulator consists of a tidal tank 40 cm in length and 30 cm in width a control cabinet a feed tank and an effluent container metal mesh was placed at each side of the substrate to avoid the escape of particles in each run 30 particles per particle type were placed in the tank resulting in 360 mp particles cross shore coordinate x is defined as positive toward the lower tide zone and vertical coordinate z is defined as positive in the downward direction ten particles of each mp type were placed at the 5 cm 20 cm and 35 cm horizontal positions respectively during each cycle the tap water flooded the substrate and reached a high level of 20 cm then drained to 0 cm ten tidal cycles were implemented for each run three rates of tidal level change of 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 cm min were used for both scenarios the actual fluctuating velocity of tide in environment varied greatly for instance panchenko et al 2019 found the tidal current amplitude varied from about 0 16 to 1 2 m s in spring tide and 0 01 to 0 57 m s in neap tide zhang et al 2020 found that the tidal velocity ranged from 0 5 to 1 m s wu et al 2020 revealed that the tidal velocity ranged from 0 05 to 0 3 m s therefore the rates of tidal level change selected in the experiment mainly aimed to reveal the transport of mps along with the rate change two scenarios were conducted in the first scenario mps were placed on the top of the substrate slope at the 5 20 and 35 cm horizontal positions in the second scenario mps were placed at the bottom of the substrate at the 5 20 and 35 cm horizontal positions to avoid mps being pinned under the glass beads the bottom of the tank was first packed with one layer of glass beads and then the mps were placed in the void space among the glass beads the remaining glass beads were then packed following the bottom layer 2 3 mp quantification and distribution analysis during the tidal experiment when the water level increased to 20 cm height the number of each mp type floating on the water surface was counted the floating percentage was calculated as the ratio of the floating mp number to the initial added mp number in tank after 10 tidal cycles glass beads were carefully taken out in a 1 cm depth and 5 cm width interval for the whole substrate resulting in a total of 89 sampling fractions for determining the overall mp distribution in each sampling the glass beads taken from the tank were placed in a beaker the glass beads were then rinsed with water to adequately separate the mps for the quantification of each type of mp in each substrate fraction all tank experiments were conducted as duplicates and the batch with higher mp recovery rate was selected for analysis the detailed experiment design and recovery rate for each mp are presented in table s1 after counting all the mps in substrate the recovery rates of pp1 and pp2 ranged from 83 33 to 100 and 93 33 to 100 the recovery rates of pe1 pe2 pe3 ranged from 86 67 to 100 90 to 100 and 90 to 100 respectively the recovery rates of ny1 and ny2 ranged from 83 33 to 100 and 90 to 100 the recovery rates of pla1 pla2 pvc1 pvc2 v1 and v2 ranged from 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 93 33 to 100 and 90 00 to 100 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the infiltration of mps under the influence of tidal cycles schruff 2018 defined several infiltration behaviors according to the ratio of particle diameter to substrate diameter unimpeded static percolation could be observed when the ratio is smaller than 0 11 the ratios between 0 11 to 0 32 and 0 32 correspond to finite depth infiltration and fine surface sealing in the present study the ratio of dmp to substrate diameter ranged between 0 05 to 0 26 fig 3 shows the floating percentages of mps after each increase in tidal water levels more particles with smaller dmp floated on the water surface as the water level increased further 90 100 of the pp1 floated on the surface after 10 tidal cycles while the floating percentage was 77 90 for pp2 at different rates of tidal level change for pe particles more pe1 and pe2 floated on the surface after 10 tidal cycles compared to pe3 with regard to high density particles their presence on the surface water surprisingly increased with tidal cycles for instance the floated ny1 changed from 47 to 70 after 10 cycles under a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min whereas the floated ny2 changed from 37 to 43 the floated pla1 increased from 17 to 47 and the pla2 increased from 33 to 40 after 10 cycles the pvc1 observed on the surface increased from 43 to 73 and the pvc2 increased from 40 to 67 after 10 cycles the v1 on the surface increased from 30 to 53 and the v2 increased from 40 to 43 after 10 cycles we observed that larger particles floated to the surface at the first water level increase since large particles had more difficulty infiltrating the substrate however as the tidal cycles increased smaller particles floated on the water surface due to buoyance force or surface tension force with respect to particle density more particles with a density lower than water floated on the surface compared to the high density particles as suggested by the results it was hard for low density particles to infiltrate the sublayer of substrate under the influence of repeated water level changes the change in rates of tidal level did not change the particle floating greatly fig 3 the number of floated particles was similar among the tests with different rates of tidal level change an analysis was conducted to correlate the floating percentages of mps and indicators including the rate of tidal level change longest a medium b and shortest particle side lengths c of mps mp density mp weight dmp the largest cross section area perimeter and cfs considering all the mp particles the floating percentages increased significantly with the increase of b and the largest cross section area whereas decreased significantly with the increase of mp density and csf fig 4a accounting for only the low density particles the floating percentages showed a significantly negative correlation with rates of tidal level change c mp density weight dmp fig 4b the floating percentages of high density particles demonstrated a significant positive correlation with b whereas they showed a significant negative correlation with c and csf fig 4c the results imply that particles with a large cross section area low density and flatty particles had difficulty infiltrating the substrate and tended to float on the water surface with tidal movement lower rate of tidal level change contributed to higher floating percentage for low density mps the floating of low density particles results from buoyance force mp density smaller than aqueous phase density and surface tension whereas the floating of high density particles results mainly from surface tension as a result lower rates of tidal level change have longer inundation times allowing more time for low density particles to float the distribution of mp particles in the substrate after 10 tidal cycles is shown in fig 5 more small dmp particles such as pp1 pp2 ny1 and ny2 were distributed on the top of the substrate profile while large dmp particles were concentrated in the lower part of the profile fig 5 j k l presents the distribution of mps in the top 1 cm surface substrate only a small portion of the mps was retained on the surface layer more mps with small dmp such as pp1 pp2 ny1 and ny2 were retained on the surface layer compared to other mps with large dmp as shown in fig 5j more mps with small dmp remained in the high tidal zone whereas mps with large dmp in the surface layer tended to be distributed in the lower tidal zone fig 5l it should be noted that the tank experiment was assumed to be a closed system since the two sides of the substrate were intercepted by the meshes therefore if the mesh were not present mps retained in the lower substrate might have been transported further downward to further explore the underlying relationship between mp transport and its properties a correlation analysis was conducted between the positions of each mp and the mp properties fig s1a in the scenario in which mps were placed on top of the glass beads the horizontal location of mps x showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c mp density mp weight dmp and csf while it had significant negative correlation with the rate of tidal level change and the longest length a the vertical distribution of mps showed significant positive correlation with the shortest length c mp density mp weight dmp and csf while demonstrating significant negative correlation with the medium length b largest cross section area perimeter and surface tension of mps the results imply that the large high density and less flatty particles tended to move downward along the beach slope and infiltrate the deep substrate layer under the influence of repeated tidal forces the one direction infiltration of mps has been investigated in previous studies suggesting that the depth of mp infiltration is influenced by the size and shape of mps as well as the permeability of sediments a smaller mp size and large substrate porosity support deep mp infiltration waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2020 nevertheless in the present study the particles with small dmp tended to retain in the surface layer and upper tidal zone under repeated water level changes indicating that the hydrodynamic forces in the natural environment greatly complicate mp transport only a few studies have used water tanks to study the transport of mps and have focused mainly on the effects of waves for instance kerpen et al 2020 found that during the formation of the bed profile particles with a density greater than that of water 1 25 g cm3 were partly confined to deeper layers of the sloping beach whereas particles with a density lower than that of water floated continuously in the surf zone or were deposited on the beach during wave action alsina et al 2020 found that floating particles stay near the water surface whereas nonfloating particles migrate close to the bed at slower velocities than floating particles these results are similar to the present study in that the high density particles tended to distribute in the deep substrate layer and low tidal zone the transport of particles in the substrate is distinctive from that of other substances for instance vandermeulen et al 1988 found that the depth of oil penetration increases with tidal cycles as the repeated downward movement of water carries viscous oil into deeper substrates and adheres to the substrate surface 3 2 the resuspension of mps under the influence of tidal cycles through sediment mixing or bioturbation surface sediments can be translocated into deeper layers taking plastic particles with them martinetto et al 2016 hence the transport of mps beneath the substrate under tidal influence was also studied in terms of particle size smaller particles floated on the water surface for instance in a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min 57 and 17 of pp1 and pp2 respectively floated to the surface after 10 tidal cycles fig 6a the floating percentages of pe1 pe2 and pe3 were 70 53 and 10 respectively fig 6b surprisingly high density particles at the bottom of the substrate were increasingly transported to the water surface under the influence of water level changes similarly high density particles with smaller particle size showed a higher probability of floating on the water surface taking the results of 0 25 cm min as an example 27 and 10 of ny1 and ny2 respectively floated to the surface after 10 tidal cycles pla2 did not float to the water surface whereas 33 of pla1 floated to the surface after 10 tidal cycles similarly 33 of pvc1 was moved to the surface although no pvc2 was seen on the water surface and 27 and 7 of v1 and v2 respectively were moved to the surface after 10 cycles with respect to particle density more low density particles were transported to surface water compared to high density particles ny1 and pp1 had similar dmp of 0 77 and 0 84 mm respectively however 57 and 27 of pp1 and ny1 respectively moved to the surface after 10 tidal cycles under a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min the dmp of pp2 and ny2 were 1 09 and 0 97 mm respectively but their floating percentages were 17 and 10 after 10 tidal cycles under a rate of tidal level change of 0 25 cm min pla2 and pe1 had dmp of 2 44 and 2 56 mm respectively whereas their floating percentages were 0 and 70 the rate of tidal level change also affected the upward migration of particles a decrease in the change rate resulted in increased floating of particles especially small particles with increasing rates of tidal level change of 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 cm min 57 50 and 33 of the pp1 were moved to the water surface after 10 tidal cycles whereas 70 73 and 63 of pe1 respectively were observed on the water surface fig 6a f for high density particles the increase in the rate of tidal level change decreased the floating percentage from 27 to 17 for ny1 from 33 to 20 for pla1 and from 27 to 20 for v1 fig 6 g r however the floating percentages of larger particles did not vary greatly with the changed rate the floating of high density particles on the water surface is attributed to the balance between surface tension and gravity a small disturbance to such balance may lead to the settling of particles a higher flow rate may lead to an unsteady water surface and more disturbance to the particles however such disturbances do not interrupt the floating of low density particles the greater floating of low density particles is attributed to a longer submerge time for floating the correlation analysis considering all mp particles revealed floating percentages significantly decreased with the increase of mp density and perimeter fig 7a when only low density particles were considered the floating percentages decreased significantly with the increase of the longest length a the medium length b the largest cross section area perimeter and surface tension of mps while they showed a positive correlation with csf fig 7b the floating percentages of high density particles demonstrated a significant decrease with the increase of the rate of tidal level change the longest length a weight dmp and perimeter fig 7c the results suggest that the smaller low density and less flatty particles had a higher possibility of moving upward to the water surface under repeated tidal forces the distribution of various mp particles in the substrate profile is shown in fig 8 clearly demonstrating that both the low and high density mps moved upward similar to the results from the previous section smaller dmp particles were retained in the surface substrate layer compared to large dmp particles with a focus on the surface layer top 1 cm more mps were detected in the upper tidal zone fig 8j k l in the scenario in which mps were buried at the bottom of the substrate the horizontal positions x of various mps showed significant positive correlation with mp density whereas they demonstrated significant negative correlation with the medium length b the largest cross section area and surface tension of mps fig s1b the vertical positions z of mps showed significant positive correlation with the longest length a of mps mp density mp weight and dmp this result implies that high density and large particles tended to distribute in the lower tidal zone and deeper substrate layer 3 3 the significance of surface tension in determining the transport of mps most of the shore is free of hydrodynamic forces at low tide the water arrives at intermediate tidal levels and can crash directly onto particles where particles were previously present imposing impinging forces as the tide rises and the particles are fully submerged in water drag and lift forces take over and the impinging disappears during this repeated process in the tidal zone the impact of surface tension on mp behavior is evident but has not been noted extensively stolte et al 2015 discussed grain floating by surface tension during the density separation process for extracting mps from sediment samples after extraction by density separation hundreds of particles float on top of the deionized water these particles are stirred from the bottom and kept afloat by surface tension which counterbalances the gravity that causes nonfloating particles to sink stolte et al 2015 also proved that more particles are extracted from finer grained sediments indicating that finer particles are easier to support by surface tension thus more particles are extracted hydrostatic pressure and surface tension make up the force that counteracts gravity vella 2015 floating bodies with lateral dimensions much smaller than capillary length have negligible buoyancy and their floating is due to surface tension it is crucial to understand floating for a variety of biological and engineering problems vella 2015 assuming the indentation angle between the water surface and a sphere surface is 30 the surface tension can support a 3 mm diameter sphere particle with a density of 2500 kg m3 and around 5 mm sphere particles with a density of 1000 kg m3 fig 9 as a result most of the mps can float on the water surface with the support of surface tension force this is confirmed by the present study which found that not only the low density particles migrated upward under tidal influence but also the high density particles therefore it is necessary to reconsider the presumption that mp particles remain on the surface because their density is lower than that of water the aggregation of plastic particles was another commonly observed phenomenon on the water surface during the experiment fig 9b aggregates can form through attractive interactions depending on the forces and positions among the particles different floating particles with different wetting properties can repel each other while particles of the same properties always attract each other when particles come into contact with a liquid the slope of the liquid interface at the contact line decreases because the liquid rises between particles as a result the horizontal projection of tension force is greater between particles than on the outside resulting in an attractive force dalbe et al 2011 in a natural environment the aggregation of floating litter is named windrow irrespective of the force such as convergence wind tides or density driven currents cózar et al 2021 marine life interacts frequently with windrows however since litter windrows are dispersed small and ephemeral they are generally overlooked in research marine litter pollution can be prevented primarily by restricting litter from entering the sea followed by its collection high loads of patchy floating litter raise expectations for marine litter cleanup only a large quantity of litter can form litter windrows making it possible to mark zones and periods of heavy pollution by employing aerial surveys there has also been evidence that active fishing for windrows can effectively capture large amounts of litter for instance ruiz et al 2020 conducted 196 tows and collected 16 2 tons of floating marine litter most of the litter windrows were around 1 km in length and on average accumulated 77 75 kg of floating marine litter with plastic being the most common type of material accounting for 96 it may be worthwhile to conduct ocean cleanups when sensitive zones of high ecological and economic value such as tourist beaches marine protected areas aquaculture facilities or shipping routes are at risk of contamination prior to implementing these recommended actions it is imperative to conduct a proper environmental impact assessment although large mesh openings and slow tow speeds can help reduce fish turtles and mammals being caught mechanical cleanups on ocean surfaces may also remove drifting seaweed fish eggs or planktons cózar et al 2021 wang et al 2022b 3 4 implications for field sampling and data interpretation previous field sampling mainly focused on the top beach surface 0 5 cm as an indicator of plastic pollution in a specific area bissen and chawchai 2020 corcoran et al 2020 egessa et al 2020 exposito et al 2021 jaubet et al 2021 fred ahmadu et al 2022 as suggested in the present study only a small proportion of the added mps were retained on the surface layer the vertical distribution of mps was uneven among the various mp types more small particles were retained in the top 1 cm substrate and upper tidal zone compared to the large particles in the dmp substrate diameter range of the present study sampling depth is an important aspect in quantifying mp abundance however only a few studies sampled sediments deeper than 50 cm willis et al 2017 wang et al 2018b fan et al 2019 li et al 2020 belivermis et al 2021 culligan et al 2021 viet dung et al 2021 in general mp abundance declines from the surface to the deep layer which is in line with plastic production and consumption fan et al 2019 for a comprehensive understanding of mp inventory on shorelines it is essential to analyze deeper sediment layers as has been done for other contaminants in previous field studies exploring the litter or mp distribution along the beach the high tideline is generally selected as the sampling location since more litter or plastics were detected on the surface layer silva cavalcanti et al 2009 costa et al 2010 jayasiri et al 2013 prarat and hongsawat 2022 for instance bancin et al 2019 found that the concentration of plastic particles above the high tideline was higher than the intertidal zone and pe pp and ps were the primarily detected particle types heo et al 2013 recorded the mean abundance of small plastics to be 473 866 particles m2 at the cross section perpendicular to the shoreline and 976 405 particles m2 at the high strandline in the upper tidal zone specifically low density styrofoam spherules accounted for 96 3 in the cross section and 90 7 of the total plastic abundance in the high strandline the cross section distribution of styrofoam fragment and pellet was distinctive constant et al 2019 found that the high deposition line had the highest mp concentration with a mean concentration of 115 items kg compared to the overall mean of 30 items kg as indicated by the present study the low weight and low density mps have a higher possibility of being retained in the upper tidal zone while the high density high weight less flatty mps have a tendency to move along the beach slope with the receding water and are hard to move upward by water level increase previous tank studies proved that high density mps were confined to the deeper layer of the beach and moved close to the bed alsina et al 2020 therefore a large quantity of mps with high density may be retained in the deep substrate or at the bottom of the sea leading to an underestimation of mp loads in coastal zones in addition the density of mps can be increased through aggregation with natural suspended particles or through being covered by a biofilm of microorganisms yang et al 2021 2022 biofilms facilitate the aggregation of mps by producing sticky substances on mps and therefore play a crucial role in the vertical migration of mps currently the response and cleanup techniques of mps in the environment are still under development the m v x press pearl caught fire in may 2021 spilling 1680 tons of spherical plastic 5 mm white 18 km off the west coast of sri lanka mongabay 2021 the response techniques utilized were similar to oiled shoreline responses including manual removal handheld sieving floating trommel and large scale sieving however the separation of high density particles with sizes similar to those of sediments is still difficult in the present study glass beads were used as a model substrate owing to their transparency and easily measurable size however sediment in the natural environment is more complex given its variability in terms of surface morphology shape and density in this regard shen et al 2011 suggested that surface roughness plays a key role in colloid deposition finding that polystyrene latex microspheres were retained at higher concentrations in sand than in glass beads they also found that the sharp asperities on the surface of sand particles enhance particle deposition in primary minima by decreasing the energy barrier and that the presence of valleys on the surface of the sand particles increases attachment in secondary minima sand gravel or pebble notably could be much smaller or have an uneven grain distribution than the glass beads used in the present study as such a higher trapping efficiency can be expected for these materials in the natural environment the present study did not consider the groundwater and related process for instance the intertidal circulation cell geng and boufadel 2015 geng et al 2020 which require further investigation 4 conclusions this is the first study to investigate the transport of mps under dynamic boundary conditions using a tidal tank the effects of tidal level changes on the infiltration and resuspension of mps featured with various sizes densities and shapes were revealed dmp substrate diameter ranged from 0 05 to 0 26 our results confirmed that as tidal cycle increases the number of particles on the water surface also increased more particles of small dmp and low density floated to the water surface high density particles also migrated to water surface due to surface tension force further a lower rate of tidal level change contributed to more floating of particles the distribution of mps in substrate proved that large high density and less flatty particles tend to be distributed in the lower tidal zone and deeper substrate layers these findings can help understand the redistribution of mps and assess their risk in the shoreline environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
