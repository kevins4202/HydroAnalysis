5475,recent advances in fully integrated and physically based hydrologic models as well as computational resources have increased interest for these models which seem most realistic for assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on water resources however their applications for most of the cases are carried out on relatively small scale 1 000 km2 and well instrumented watersheds the present study uses the fully integrated and physically based approach to evaluate surface and subsurface hydrodynamics in the boubo river watershed brw located in the southern part of côte d ivoire the brw is a large scale area 4 957 km2 lacking data and where local and transversal issues impacts on the hydrosystem are simultaneous and significant the conceptual model uses an equivalent porous medium for the 3d subsurface domain and the integrated modelling approach necessitated only three boundary conditions precipitation potential evapotranspiration and surface water outflow the simulations were conducted using two main calibration phases quasi steady state and transient conditions minor calibration effort was required and overall the results obtained seem quite plausible and would reflect the field reality however abnormally high surface water depths 15 mm observed at the land surface and the underestimation of simulated surface water flows rates compared to measured ones seem rather problematic these problematic results could be explained by a defect of drainage in the model this could be due to the weak representation in the model of particularly complex local surface features and low mesh resolution in relation to the large scale of the study area the transient phase simulation allowed observation of model response with respect to changes in forcing data this is encouraging in the context of assessing the possible impacts of climate change on water resources keywords fully integrated heavily agricultural large scale and low instrumented watershed boubo côte d ivoire 1 introduction the sustainable management of water resources requires the acquisition of accurate information i e field data and water balance from which development plans and strategies are elaborated the hydrological system is a complex whole composed of interdependent and constantly interacting processes these processes belong to both surface land surface and atmosphere and subsurface domains when one of the processes is affected the plausibility that the others will be impacted is evident particularly in regions with intense anthropogenic activities notably agricultural activities and marked by the negative impacts of climate change rainfall uncertainties associated with the degradation of the plant cover tend to disrupt the water cycle and functioning hydrosystems indeed the decrease in precipitation and the change in land use simultaneously induce changes in the fluxs of evapotranspiration surface and subsurface runoff infiltration kouadio et al 2015 and the interaction between surface water and groundwater thus the recharge of aquifers a key parameter in the groundwater study conditioned by the above mentioned processes is impacted this impact could have repercussions on surface waters especially in regions where the exchanges between surface waters and groundwater are significant banks et al 2009 mccallum et al 2014 yang et al 2014 in view of the natural functioning of all the processes governing the water cycle marked by interdependence and simultaneity surface water and groundwater would in reality be a single integrated continuum a numerical modeling study assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on water resources would require the use of a modelling approach that can adequately account for all relevant processes i e fully integrated and physically based hydrological models however most of these studies quilbé et al 2008 kouamé kan et al 2009 whitehead et al 2009 okkonen et al 2010 desroches et al 2014 kouassi et al 2014 rivard et al 2014 kouadio et al 2015 dwarakish and ganasri 2015 sun et al 2017 slaughter and mantel 2018 considered separately the surface water system and groundwater one table 1 discussions about the use of physically based hydrological models that integrate surface and subsurface flows have emerged in the literature panday and huyakorn 2004 li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 barthel and banzhaf 2015 maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 berg and sudicky 2019 in recent years with the development of understanding the physical processes computational efforts and data retrieving facilities islam 2011 also the need to assess with more realism the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on water resources favored the emergence of these discussions there are two types of integrated and physically based hydrologic models barthel and banzhaf 2015 i loosely integrated models composed of two or more individual models coupled via the exchange of model results where the output from one model forms the input of the other ii fully integrated models in which equations governing surface and subsurface flows are solved simultaneously within one software package one of the key benefits of integrated hydrologic models is that they are conceptually simpler to setup e g the upper boundary of the model is driven by precipitation and recharge is computed internally by the model berg and sudicky 2019 loosely coupled modeling approaches do not provide a sufficient level of realism because they do not solve for all the interdependent processes simultaneously goderniaux et al 2009 on the contrary fully integrated models which seem to better reflect the interdependence and simultaneity of processes would be more realistic however their applications fully integrated models for most of the cases have been focused on relatively well instrumented and small scale 1 000 km2 watersheds yet it is on a large scale 1 000 km2 that the interactions between environmental and human systems are fully developed and global change is linked to local actions barthel and banzhaf 2015 also policy decisions are often concerned with much larger scales e g political boundaries or large watersheds and basins berg and sudicky 2019 in several regions of sub saharan africa despite the efforts of actors public and private authorities research institutions communities for access to drinking water there is still a lack of effective water resources management policies based on an accurate assessment of the availability and pressures on these resources in these areas especially in forest areas watersheds for the most part are populated intensely agricultural and poorly instrumented this is the case in the southern forest region of côte d ivoire in west africa the present study uses a fully integrated and physically based approach to simulate water flows at a boubo river watershed brw scale in the southern forest area of côte d ivoire the brw is a vast 4 957 km2 and very little instrumented 1 synoptic station 5 climatic stations 1 hydrometric station no piezometer area where local and transversals problematics are simultaneous and significant indeed the area faces several challenges forest cover degradation frequent flooding phenomena water resources pollution risks and shortage of drinking water at certain times of the year especially during dry seasons however very few hydrological and hydrogeological studies have been carried out in the study area the purpose of this study is to evaluate surface and subsurface hydrodynamics in order to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water resources in the brw specifically the study aims to produce the long term average water balance and verifies the ability of the model to react to constraints over seasons and years this involves two calibration phases i a quasi steady state phase and ii a transient phase hydrogeosphere hgs a 3d simulator of the entire terrestrial portion of the hydrological cycle aquanty 2015 was used for simulations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geographical situation the boubo river watershed brw is located in the southern forest zone of côte d ivoire precisely in the divo oumé region between 5 and 6 west and between 5 and 6 40 north fig 1 this watershed of 4957 km2 has a dense and fast growing population over 3 8 year 2 1 2 agricultural activities almost 80 of the population practise agricultural activities which therefore represents the main socio economic actitity kouadio et al 2015 cash crops namely cocoa coffee oil palm and rubber occupy more than 60 of the cultivated area mpd 2015 table 2 presents figures on cultivated surface and agricultural production in the study area in 2012 the cocoa and oil palm areas were more than respectively 200 000 and 11 600 ha production was also 214 000 and 160 000 tonnes respectively the proportions of cocoa and oil palm production in the country s production were 13 and 9 respectively food crops such as rice plantain yams and cassava are also cultivated in the divo oumé area apart from agriculture mining activities are in full expansion 2 1 3 climatic seasons the climate consists of 4 seasons long dry season from december to march long rainy season from april to july short dry season between august and september and finally short rainy season from october to november 2 1 4 geological formations the geological formations mainly belong to paleoproterozoic however in the south a narrow strip of sedimentary basin attached to meso cenozoic and quaternary is observed geomines 1982a delor et al 1995 for delor et al 1995 paleoproterozoic formations are divided into two birimian domains i plutonic volcanic area ii the birimian sedimentary area fig 1 in the sedimentary birimian two main subsets of rocks with variable proportions of metaarenites and metasiltites are observed while in intrusive birimian domain biotite granites metagronodiorites and metatonalites are the most common rocks the volcanic rocks are composed of chloritoschists metagraywackes quartzites ampelites metarhyolites and metadacites 2 1 5 surface features the landscape is relatively flat with elevation decreasing from average 300 m above sea level asl in the north to less than 20 m asl near the coast in the south overall the surface features are dominated by i rivers and their important valleys ii plateaus more present in the western region and iii relief zones whose presence is more significant on volcano sedimentary rocks in the south and south east the n45 50 band of metatonalite rock imposes a large depression in the region 2 2 calculation code the calculation code used for the simulation of integrated surface water and variably saturated subsurface flow and evapotranspiration is hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2015 it is a physically based and fully integrated model that is it represents in detail the physical processes involved in the system and consists of equations governing surface and subsurface flows which are solved simultaneously in a globally implicit manner all key component of hydrologic cycle are taken into account in hgs and the dynamic interactions between all sub domains at each time step are simulated hgs uses the control volume finite element approach to simultaneously solve richards equation describing 3d variably saturated subsurface flow and a 2d depth averaged surface flow equation which is the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation goderniaux et al 2009 more information about hgs model mathematical and numerical concepts input parameters and calculated parameters are discussed in detail in the literature li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 aquanty 2015 successive monthly update version of hgs has been used for simulations the latest one used is from may 2018 2 3 data collection meteorological hydrological and hydrogeological data are used for the construction and calibration of the boubo river watershed brw model the instruments available to acquire these data are very few and consist of one synoptic station used to measure all meteorological data and located more than 10 km from the watershed five rainfall stations including two outside the basin one hydrometric station and no piezometer fig 2 the data from the measuring instruments are meteorological data consisting of monthly averages of temperatures and precipitation obtained from the company of exploitation and airport development aeronautics and meteorology sodexam and covering the period 1950 2005 for the gagnoa and divo stations and the period 1949 2000 for lakota guitry and oumé stations daily hydrometric data from 1983 to 2005 measured at the babokon gauging station the elevation values of static water levels recorded in 98 wells in the absence of installed piezometers these values could represent on average the piezometry of the study area spatial data have also been used and consist of 25 m resolution palsar 2 radar satellite images of the year 2015 free access and available on the website of the japan aerospace exploitation agency jaxa these images were used to produce the brw land use map a 30 m resolution dem image marked données altimétriques planetdem 30 plus planetobserver provided by planet observer a soil distribution map it was used to study the texture of the soil 2 4 simulation methods construction of the brw surface subsurface model was based on a characterization study of the fractured basement aquifer conducted prior to the flow modelling phase this study showed the high density and strong interconnection of fractures thus allowing the assimilation of the fractured basement aquifer to an equivalent porous medium the characterization study also demonstrated the superposition of hydrological and hydrogeological watersheds and the flow of groundwater to the southern zone and towards the rivers in addition the exploitation of data from various sources field observation wells capturing the regoliths water wells capturing the fractured basement aquifer and electrical soundings helped to define the layers within the model the vertical and horizontal extent of these layers and the average hydraulic conductivity of each layer 2 4 1 conceptual model the conceptual model includes the surface and the subsurface one advantage of using an integrated modelling approach is that the boundary conditions are conceptually simpler for example this approach does not require an estimation recharge across the land surface 2 4 1 1 conceptual surface model the contour of the brw constitutes the limit of the surface area the soil surface which represents the top of the simulation domain was defined using the 30 m resolution dem image a land use map was generated from the 25 m resolution palsar 2 radar image dating from 2015 six classes were defined in the land use map forest culture wetland settlement area bare soil and water for each class distinct properties of evapotranspiration and surface flow have been assigned a discretization of surface model the 2d grid of triangular elements is assigned to the surface domain the 2d mesh grid is used to simulate surface flows integrating the hydrographic network and all surface characteristics one of the advantages of the integrated hgs model is its ability to simulate stream flows without first defining the position of the drainage network however the discretization must capture topographic features including lakes rivers and other channels the minimum angle of the triangular elements was fixed at 25 the mesh is narrowed around the streams where the triangular elements have a maximum node spacing of 150 m b boundary conditions of surface model three types of boundary conditions have been assigned to the surface area critical depth rainfall source and evapotranspiration sink boundary conditions withdrawals from rivers and boreholes has not been taken into account in the model the critical depth conditions were implemented along the outer boundary of the surface area a critical depth boundary condition forces the water elevation at the boundary to be equal to the critical depth the critical depth is the water elevation for which the energy of the flowing water is relatively low hornberger et al 1998 goderniaux et al 2009 aquanty 2015 the rainfall and evapotranspiration boundary conditions have been assigned to the integrated surface subsurface domain with respect to rainfall given several stations the thiessen polygon approach was adopted for the evaluation of the mean annual and monthly rainfall values over the brw the average rainfall was evaluated according to the expression 1 p moy i 1 p i a i a where p moy refers to the average precipitation over the basin a represents the total area of the basin p i is the precipitation recorded at station i a i is the area of influence of station i calculated from the thiessen approach in accordance with available data thornthwaite s approach was used for calculating evapotranspiration the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet are 1228 1 mm year and 1127 9 mm year respectively 2 4 1 2 subsurface conceptual model the brw aquifer has been assimilated to an equivalent porous medium the extreme south is occupied by about 80 km2 of the coastal sedimentary basin the model consists of five 5 layers that are from bottom to top fissured basement 2 fb2 fissured basement 1 fb1 isalterite i alloterite a and soil s a layers generation in the model the subsurface layers fb2 fb1 isalterite alloterite and soil were reconstructed in the model from the raster files of the elevations of the different contact surfaces between layers and from the dem raster files were generated within a rectangular contour using the kriging method and 541 points wells distributed over the study area fig 3 for each point the elevation of each contact surface was evaluated the calculation of the contact surface elevation between layers was based on previous work of characterization of the fractured basement aquifer this aquifer is composed of an alterite part and a fractured basement part located below the alterites the soil alloterite and isalterite layers belong to the alterite component while the fb2 and fb1 layers are in the fractured basement component the thicknesses of alloterite and isalterite layers were evaluated from wells data these data provide a good distribution of the total thickness of the alterite however most data do not distinguish the alloterite layer from the isalterite one taking into account the available data and knowing that the thickness of alloterite varies positively with the altitude z areas of equal proportion of alloterite and isalterite thickness aepait have been defined fig 3 within aepait 1 2 3 and 4 alloterite thicknesses are respectivelly estimated to 56 53 59 and 68 of correspondant alterites thicknesses table 2 these proportions have been defined from average values of alterite alloterite and isalterite thichnesses within each area for every point in each area the thickness of the alloterite layer is defined knowing the total thickness of the alterite mantle at that point the calculation of contacts surface elevations in the model according to each geological formation group intrusive volcanic and sedimentary is shown in fig 4 the elevation of the land surface is defined by the 30 m dem image the elevations of the contact surfaces between the layers of the alterites compartment are calculated through the following relations 2 top a l l o t e r i t e d e m 0 5 3 top i s a l t e r i t e z t h i a l l 4 top f b 1 z t h i a l t where top alloterite refers to the elevation of the roof of the alloterite layer dem is the raster file of the elevation of the land surface top isalterite is the roof elevation of the alloterite layer z is the elevation of the land surface at the point considered thi all is the thickness of the alloterite layer top fb1 represents the roof elevation of the fissured basement 1 layer and thi alt refers to the thickness of the alterite layer in the fractured basement zone two fissured levels fb1 and fb2 are been individualized to take into account the decrease of conductive fissures density with the depth the thicknesses of the layers fb1 and fb2 differ according to the geological formation group at the fb1 layer a thickness of 40 m 30 m and 20 m is attributed to intrusive volcanic and sedimentary rocks respectively a thickness of 30 m was confered to the fb2 layer both on intrusive and volcanic rocks on sedimentary formations fb2 extends over 20 m these different thicknesses made it possible to calculate the elevation of the contact surfaces top fb2 and top fresh basement for each group of rocks fig 3 the following relationships calculate the contact surfaces elevations between the fissured basement compartment layers 5 top f b 2 z t h i a l t 40 6 top f b 2 z t h i a l t 30 7 top f b 2 z t h i a l t 20 8 top f r e s h b a s e m e n t z t h i a l

fresh basement represents the elevation of the root of fresh basement layer eq 5 eq 6 and eq 7 refers to intrusive rocks volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks respectively similarly eq 8 eq 9 and eq 10 correspond to intrusive rocks volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks respectively top alloterite is a raster file obtained from the dem image from each of the 541 points the raster files of the top isalterite and top fb1 top fb2 and top fresh basement elevations were generated by the kriging method all these files have been integrated into the boubo river watershed brw model to generate the layers as shown in fig 5 this approach accurately represents the layer s thicknesses and thus better reflects the reality of the terrain in the model b discretization of subsurface domain the 3d meshes composed of prismatic elements served to discretize the subsurface domain these 3d meshes have been generated by hgs from a 2d grid the 5 main layers were subdivided into 16 sub layers of which 1 in the soil s 6 in alloterite a 2 in isaterite i 4 in fb1 and 3 in fb2 fig 6 c boundary conditions of subsurface domain the hydrogeological basin and the hydrological one are superimposed no flow boundary conditions have been applied to all model boundaries north east west south and model base groundwater is expected to exit the 3d porous media via rivers since the model integrates the surface and subsurface domains rainfall and evapotranspiration boundary conditions have been assigned from the surface of the domain 2 4 2 assignment of parameters the parameters are classified in three 3 groups subsurface surface and evapotranspiration 2 4 2 1 subsurface parameters for the properties assignment seven 7 zones namely soil alloterite isalterite fb1 fb2 coastal sedimentary 1 cs1 coastal sedimentary 2 cs2 have been defined indeed 5 zones correspond to the 5 layers fb2 fb1 isalterite alloterite and soil in addition within the fb2 and fb1 layers in the area occupied by the coastal sedimentary basin the coastal sedimentary 2 cs2 and coastal sedimentary 1 cs1 zones were individualized respectively the subsurface parameters are presented in table 3 for each layer the parameters were assigned taking into account the material texture the dominant textures in the soil alloterite isalterite sc1 and sc2 layers are respectively sandy clay loam clay sandy loam and sandy clay a loamy sand texture has been assigned to fissured basement layers fb1 and fb2 as suggested by guarracino and monachesi 2010 van genuchten s van genuchten 1980 parameters and residual saturation were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 specific storage was set at 10 3 m 1 for each layer of alterite formations and at 5 5 10 4 m 1 for fissured rocks according to biemi 1992 the total porosity parameters assigned to each layer took into account the texture and guideline values in the literature also the hydraulic conductivity values of the layers soil sc2 and sc1 have been assigned in accordance with the indicative values contained in the literature on the other hand the hydraulic conductivities of the alloterite isalterite fb1 and fb2 layers were calculated from the pumping test method using wells data 2 4 2 2 surface parameters the distinct properties of surface flow and evapotranspiration were assigned to each of the forest culture wetland settlement area bare soil and water classes surface flow parameters were defined using values found in the literature downer and ogden 2004 li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 aquanty 2015 graf 2015 and these values are presented in table 4 the coupling length was set to 0 1 m for all classes except for the water class which has given a value of 0 05 m the assigned manning roughness coefficients are 0 4 0 36 0 2 0 09 and 0 05 for forest culture settlement area bare soil wetland and water respectively the values of the evapotranspiration parameters table 5 have also been borrowed from the literature canadell et al 1996 asner et al 2003 downer and ogden 2004 panday and huyakorn 2004 li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 pfeifer et al 2011 berezowski and chormański 2014 graf 2015 applied leaf area index lai does not change over time since in the humid tropics area the loss of foliage from one season to another is not significant 2 4 3 model calibration procedure the simulations were conducted in two main stages which constitute two calibration phases the first step consisted of a long term simulation 1 e20 s of the system with the aim of reaching a quasi steady state condition the main interannual values of precipitation rate 1228 10 mm year and potential evapotranspiration pet rate 1126 9 mm year over the period 1970 2000 are uniformly applied to the integrated surface subsurface flow domain then the value of the pet has been adjusted to have an actual evapotranspiration aep greater than 80 of precipitation as is the case across the study area the simulated hydraulic head values were compared to the elevation values of the static water levels which reflect the average piezometric values the result of the long term simulation is used as initial condition for transient simulation the second calibration step was conducted under transient conditions based on the initial condition established during the long term simulation phase the model was calibrated to the surface water flows rate observed at the babokon gauging station monthly stress were applied to the models using the monthly precipitation and pet averages for two ten year periods 1983 1992 and 1993 2002 for the first 10 year period 1983 1992 the simulations were performed by revising progressively the surface parameter values particularly manning roughness parameters values in order to adjust simulated surface waters flow rates to the measured ones at the babokon gauging station then surface parameters values for which the best adjustment was obtained were used for the second 10 year simulation period so this second 10 year period served as transient phase calibration verification 3 results and discussion 3 1 quasi steady state simulation 3 1 1 subsurface domain the establishment of the initial condition for the brw hydrologic model produced the long term average water balance at the basin scale the main terms of the water balance are presented in table 6 on average 84 21 of precipitation is used for surface evaporation subsurface evaporation and plant transpiration the other part of the long term water balance 16 62 would include the following components abstractions for the coverage of the needs surface discharges into streams and groundwater discharges into streams the error on the water balance is 0 05 fig 7 which compares simulated hydraulic heads with measured ones obtained from static levels indicates a relatively strong positive correlation between these two sets of values r 0 95 the spatial distribution of simulated hydraulic heads is presented in fig 8 a these values varying between 400 m and less than 10 m drop regularly from the northwest to the southern coast where the lowest heads are observed at the outlet these hydraulic heads are generally higher in high altitude areas whereas they are lower in low altitude ones the spatial distribution of the saturation values shows that the saturation is almost total fig 8b this seems reasonable because the quasi steady state simulation regime is reached saturation is more significant along streams and in valleys the least saturated areas are mostly in the form of isolated points hills and outcrops the geomorphological features such as outcrops plateaus valleys and especially the hydrographic network are better reproduced on the map of the spatial distribution of the depth separating the land surface from the groundwater table depth ls gwt fig 8c these depths are between 0 m and a little more than 250 m the spatial distribution of the depth ls gwt makes it possible to observe a perfect restoration of the hydrographic network 3 1 2 surface domain fig 9 a presents the spatial distribution of surface water depth the smallest surface water depth are located in areas of high elevation outcrops hills and spaces at the watershed boundary the highest water depths 15 mm are found in valleys and especially on rivers particularly in the north eastern part of the watershed there is a local basin area where surface water depths are greater than 7 m the surface water depths are generally abnormally high greater than 15 mm and reach 14 m in some places the exchange flux spatial distribution is also highlighted in fig 9b the exchanged flux makes it possible to distinguish the potential zones of recharge flux exchanged less than 0 of the potential zones of exfiltration flux exchanged greater than 0 high elevation spaces and areas at the watershed boundary are potential recharge zones in contrast low elevation spaces valleys and watercourse beds represent potential areas for exfiltration exfiltrations are more significant along streams the spatial distribution of the exchanged flux allows a good restitution of the hydrographic network overall the quasi steady state results for surface and subsurface domains seem quite plausible and would faithfully reproduce the terrain reality however abnormally high surface water depths are quite problematic 3 2 transient simulation fig 10 shows the monthly change in measured and simulated surface water flow rate at the babokon gauging station first the simulations were carried out with the surface parameters initial values table 4 for the period 1983 1992 fig 10 a the two curves seem to have the same appearance however the differences between the measured values and those simulated are quite significant the simulated values which do not exceed 0 57 m3 s are much lower than the measured values average value 10 20 m3 s high value 48 7 m3 s the calibration was therefore mainly based on the downward revision of the manning roughness coefficients the simulations with increasingly smaller values of manning roughness coefficient allowed to increase somewhat the surface water flows rate simulated at babokon reaching 1 2 m3 s and to adjust at best the two curves fig 10b and c the similarity of shape of the two curves is clearer for the period 1983 1992 fig 10b and the period 1993 2002 verification period fig 10c however the measured surface water flow rates remain overall higher than the calculated ones especially with respect to peak flow rates the revised values of the surface parameters are shown in table 7 where manning roughness parameters are on average thirty 30 times inferior to the initial ones in order to observe with a little more detail a two year simulation 1995 and 1996 is presented in fig 11 the flow rates which are relatively weak for the months of january february and march initiate a considerable growth starting from april and reach their highest levels in june or july from july there is a decline in the flow rate until september before a second peak in october relatively weaker than the previous one a gradual fall in flows is observed between october and december the evolution of the simulated and measured flow rates seems to be correlated with the evolution of rainfall and the succession of climatic seasons indeed the flow rates growth periods and their peaks would correspond to the two rainy seasons april to july and october to november and the decline period and the lowest flow rates would be in relation with the two dry seasons december to march and august to september overall the similarity between the measured and simulated flow curves seems to indicate that the brw s surface subsurface model is sensitive to forcing data rainfall and evapotranspiration and would be conducive to a study of potential impacts of climate change on water resources 3 3 discussion the simulations conducted in a physically based and fully integrated surface subsurface approach provided fairly plausible results for the two simulation phases quasi steady state and transient phases indeed the model gave a realistic long term water balance distributed the flux of water in a natural way across the different domains and spaces and showed a fairly positive reactivity to the forcing data however the abnormally high surface water depth and the underestimation of simulated water flow rates are rather problematic results these problematic results are due to poor drainage within the model this would be related to a weak representation of the drainage channels in the model because of the mesh low resolution indeed a relatively coarse mesh seems not to favor an accurate representation of surface features while a fine mesh would be more favorable the mesh resolution is related to the spatial scale of the study area the sizes of the surface features and in addition is conditioned by obtaining a reasonable simulation time the brw has an area of around 5 000 km2 at this scale finding a balance between the mesh resolution and the simulation time represents a real challenge especially because of the constraints related to computing resources in this study the finest meshes were represented along the streams where 150 m were allocated alongside the triangular elements this value is exaggeratedly high compared to river s widths which would be 30 m at most if a length of 30 m or less had been assigned to the sides of the triangular mesh this would certainly have improved the drainage in the model however given the large scale of the brw such a resolution would have involved the generation of an extremely large number of meshes thus increasing the simulation time excessively which could have been prohibitive with 150 m as the mesh length at the rivers the simulation lasts 15 to 20 days on a computer equipped with a 3 20 ghz itel core i7 processor with a capacity of 16 gb of ram and using 3 cpus another approach that can be used to improve drainage in the model is to modify the dem image by incising the channels located along the nodes representing the streams this approach would not result in an increase in simulation time however it is quite delicate and could distort the image especially when the study area is large scale such as the brw in addition we noted that surface subsurface integrated modeling work from hwang et al 2018 hwang et al 2019 and erler et al 2019 conducted at large scales 1000 km2 on watersheds in canada and using the hgs model did not report the problematic results we observed this suggests a better representation of the surface features in their respective models for each of these works the mesh resolution is practically the same as that of the brw model for example erler et al 2019 have indicated that the horizontal mesh resolution ranges from a maximum of 1000 to 250 m or less along surface flow features in the grand river model in ontario in the case of the brw model in average 150 m separates the nodes along the rivers these observations could mean that the large scale of the study would not be a hindrance to a faithful representation of the surface features in an integrated model simulating flows with hgs certainly in the case of the brw model the local particularities marked by numerous surface irregularities would be very little represented in the model indeed according to avenard 1971 the drainage system in divo oume area is not hierarchical it is made of fragments often favoring stagnant water the waters are concentrated in marshy and depressed areas also very often they follow a large density of dry thalwegs the problematic results observed could be solved by numerical approaches certainly the forthcoming versions of hgs will integrate these approaches of solutions all the more that this model is in full dynamism and periodically a monthly frequency new instructions intended to solve the problems posed are added in the model the discrepancies noted between the hydraulic head values calculated by hgs and the avarage piezometric values calculated from field data are related to several causes these causes are on the one hand the potential errors in the brw model and on the other hand possible errors in the field data used for calculating the avarage piezometric values these data are the static water levels in the boreholes and the elevations z at the drilling location the brw model did not require major calibration efforts the initial input parameters relative to each domain surface evapotranspiration and subsurface generated quite realistic results the input parameters readjustment was done at two levels revision of the potential evapotranspiration pet flux so as to simulate an actual evapotranspiration aet flux greater than 80 of the precipitation flux quasi steady state phase and the revision of manning roughness coefficient so as to increase the simulated water flow rates values at the babokon gauging station transient phase for this readjustment in the transient phase it was later discussed that the problematic results the high surface water depth and underestimation of simulated water flow rates would not be due to the parameters values but to the resolution of the mesh and the complex configuration of the local surface features thus although most of the parameter values were taken from the literature the model practically did not require major calibration this observation seems to highlight the robustness of the physically based and fully integrated modeling approach 4 conclusion the brw s physically based fully integrated surface subsurface model practically required minimal calibration efforts and the results obtained are quite conclusive however abnormally high surface water depth and the underestimation of surface water flow rates appear to be problematic this problematic result would be due to a drainage defect within the model related to

5475,recent advances in fully integrated and physically based hydrologic models as well as computational resources have increased interest for these models which seem most realistic for assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on water resources however their applications for most of the cases are carried out on relatively small scale 1 000 km2 and well instrumented watersheds the present study uses the fully integrated and physically based approach to evaluate surface and subsurface hydrodynamics in the boubo river watershed brw located in the southern part of côte d ivoire the brw is a large scale area 4 957 km2 lacking data and where local and transversal issues impacts on the hydrosystem are simultaneous and significant the conceptual model uses an equivalent porous medium for the 3d subsurface domain and the integrated modelling approach necessitated only three boundary conditions precipitation potential evapotranspiration and surface water outflow the simulations were conducted using two main calibration phases quasi steady state and transient conditions minor calibration effort was required and overall the results obtained seem quite plausible and would reflect the field reality however abnormally high surface water depths 15 mm observed at the land surface and the underestimation of simulated surface water flows rates compared to measured ones seem rather problematic these problematic results could be explained by a defect of drainage in the model this could be due to the weak representation in the model of particularly complex local surface features and low mesh resolution in relation to the large scale of the study area the transient phase simulation allowed observation of model response with respect to changes in forcing data this is encouraging in the context of assessing the possible impacts of climate change on water resources keywords fully integrated heavily agricultural large scale and low instrumented watershed boubo côte d ivoire 1 introduction the sustainable management of water resources requires the acquisition of accurate information i e field data and water balance from which development plans and strategies are elaborated the hydrological system is a complex whole composed of interdependent and constantly interacting processes these processes belong to both surface land surface and atmosphere and subsurface domains when one of the processes is affected the plausibility that the others will be impacted is evident particularly in regions with intense anthropogenic activities notably agricultural activities and marked by the negative impacts of climate change rainfall uncertainties associated with the degradation of the plant cover tend to disrupt the water cycle and functioning hydrosystems indeed the decrease in precipitation and the change in land use simultaneously induce changes in the fluxs of evapotranspiration surface and subsurface runoff infiltration kouadio et al 2015 and the interaction between surface water and groundwater thus the recharge of aquifers a key parameter in the groundwater study conditioned by the above mentioned processes is impacted this impact could have repercussions on surface waters especially in regions where the exchanges between surface waters and groundwater are significant banks et al 2009 mccallum et al 2014 yang et al 2014 in view of the natural functioning of all the processes governing the water cycle marked by interdependence and simultaneity surface water and groundwater would in reality be a single integrated continuum a numerical modeling study assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on water resources would require the use of a modelling approach that can adequately account for all relevant processes i e fully integrated and physically based hydrological models however most of these studies quilbé et al 2008 kouamé kan et al 2009 whitehead et al 2009 okkonen et al 2010 desroches et al 2014 kouassi et al 2014 rivard et al 2014 kouadio et al 2015 dwarakish and ganasri 2015 sun et al 2017 slaughter and mantel 2018 considered separately the surface water system and groundwater one table 1 discussions about the use of physically based hydrological models that integrate surface and subsurface flows have emerged in the literature panday and huyakorn 2004 li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 barthel and banzhaf 2015 maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 berg and sudicky 2019 in recent years with the development of understanding the physical processes computational efforts and data retrieving facilities islam 2011 also the need to assess with more realism the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on water resources favored the emergence of these discussions there are two types of integrated and physically based hydrologic models barthel and banzhaf 2015 i loosely integrated models composed of two or more individual models coupled via the exchange of model results where the output from one model forms the input of the other ii fully integrated models in which equations governing surface and subsurface flows are solved simultaneously within one software package one of the key benefits of integrated hydrologic models is that they are conceptually simpler to setup e g the upper boundary of the model is driven by precipitation and recharge is computed internally by the model berg and sudicky 2019 loosely coupled modeling approaches do not provide a sufficient level of realism because they do not solve for all the interdependent processes simultaneously goderniaux et al 2009 on the contrary fully integrated models which seem to better reflect the interdependence and simultaneity of processes would be more realistic however their applications fully integrated models for most of the cases have been focused on relatively well instrumented and small scale 1 000 km2 watersheds yet it is on a large scale 1 000 km2 that the interactions between environmental and human systems are fully developed and global change is linked to local actions barthel and banzhaf 2015 also policy decisions are often concerned with much larger scales e g political boundaries or large watersheds and basins berg and sudicky 2019 in several regions of sub saharan africa despite the efforts of actors public and private authorities research institutions communities for access to drinking water there is still a lack of effective water resources management policies based on an accurate assessment of the availability and pressures on these resources in these areas especially in forest areas watersheds for the most part are populated intensely agricultural and poorly instrumented this is the case in the southern forest region of côte d ivoire in west africa the present study uses a fully integrated and physically based approach to simulate water flows at a boubo river watershed brw scale in the southern forest area of côte d ivoire the brw is a vast 4 957 km2 and very little instrumented 1 synoptic station 5 climatic stations 1 hydrometric station no piezometer area where local and transversals problematics are simultaneous and significant indeed the area faces several challenges forest cover degradation frequent flooding phenomena water resources pollution risks and shortage of drinking water at certain times of the year especially during dry seasons however very few hydrological and hydrogeological studies have been carried out in the study area the purpose of this study is to evaluate surface and subsurface hydrodynamics in order to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water resources in the brw specifically the study aims to produce the long term average water balance and verifies the ability of the model to react to constraints over seasons and years this involves two calibration phases i a quasi steady state phase and ii a transient phase hydrogeosphere hgs a 3d simulator of the entire terrestrial portion of the hydrological cycle aquanty 2015 was used for simulations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geographical situation the boubo river watershed brw is located in the southern forest zone of côte d ivoire precisely in the divo oumé region between 5 and 6 west and between 5 and 6 40 north fig 1 this watershed of 4957 km2 has a dense and fast growing population over 3 8 year 2 1 2 agricultural activities almost 80 of the population practise agricultural activities which therefore represents the main socio economic actitity kouadio et al 2015 cash crops namely cocoa coffee oil palm and rubber occupy more than 60 of the cultivated area mpd 2015 table 2 presents figures on cultivated surface and agricultural production in the study area in 2012 the cocoa and oil palm areas were more than respectively 200 000 and 11 600 ha production was also 214 000 and 160 000 tonnes respectively the proportions of cocoa and oil palm production in the country s production were 13 and 9 respectively food crops such as rice plantain yams and cassava are also cultivated in the divo oumé area apart from agriculture mining activities are in full expansion 2 1 3 climatic seasons the climate consists of 4 seasons long dry season from december to march long rainy season from april to july short dry season between august and september and finally short rainy season from october to november 2 1 4 geological formations the geological formations mainly belong to paleoproterozoic however in the south a narrow strip of sedimentary basin attached to meso cenozoic and quaternary is observed geomines 1982a delor et al 1995 for delor et al 1995 paleoproterozoic formations are divided into two birimian domains i plutonic volcanic area ii the birimian sedimentary area fig 1 in the sedimentary birimian two main subsets of rocks with variable proportions of metaarenites and metasiltites are observed while in intrusive birimian domain biotite granites metagronodiorites and metatonalites are the most common rocks the volcanic rocks are composed of chloritoschists metagraywackes quartzites ampelites metarhyolites and metadacites 2 1 5 surface features the landscape is relatively flat with elevation decreasing from average 300 m above sea level asl in the north to less than 20 m asl near the coast in the south overall the surface features are dominated by i rivers and their important valleys ii plateaus more present in the western region and iii relief zones whose presence is more significant on volcano sedimentary rocks in the south and south east the n45 50 band of metatonalite rock imposes a large depression in the region 2 2 calculation code the calculation code used for the simulation of integrated surface water and variably saturated subsurface flow and evapotranspiration is hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2015 it is a physically based and fully integrated model that is it represents in detail the physical processes involved in the system and consists of equations governing surface and subsurface flows which are solved simultaneously in a globally implicit manner all key component of hydrologic cycle are taken into account in hgs and the dynamic interactions between all sub domains at each time step are simulated hgs uses the control volume finite element approach to simultaneously solve richards equation describing 3d variably saturated subsurface flow and a 2d depth averaged surface flow equation which is the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation goderniaux et al 2009 more information about hgs model mathematical and numerical concepts input parameters and calculated parameters are discussed in detail in the literature li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 aquanty 2015 successive monthly update version of hgs has been used for simulations the latest one used is from may 2018 2 3 data collection meteorological hydrological and hydrogeological data are used for the construction and calibration of the boubo river watershed brw model the instruments available to acquire these data are very few and consist of one synoptic station used to measure all meteorological data and located more than 10 km from the watershed five rainfall stations including two outside the basin one hydrometric station and no piezometer fig 2 the data from the measuring instruments are meteorological data consisting of monthly averages of temperatures and precipitation obtained from the company of exploitation and airport development aeronautics and meteorology sodexam and covering the period 1950 2005 for the gagnoa and divo stations and the period 1949 2000 for lakota guitry and oumé stations daily hydrometric data from 1983 to 2005 measured at the babokon gauging station the elevation values of static water levels recorded in 98 wells in the absence of installed piezometers these values could represent on average the piezometry of the study area spatial data have also been used and consist of 25 m resolution palsar 2 radar satellite images of the year 2015 free access and available on the website of the japan aerospace exploitation agency jaxa these images were used to produce the brw land use map a 30 m resolution dem image marked données altimétriques planetdem 30 plus planetobserver provided by planet observer a soil distribution map it was used to study the texture of the soil 2 4 simulation methods construction of the brw surface subsurface model was based on a characterization study of the fractured basement aquifer conducted prior to the flow modelling phase this study showed the high density and strong interconnection of fractures thus allowing the assimilation of the fractured basement aquifer to an equivalent porous medium the characterization study also demonstrated the superposition of hydrological and hydrogeological watersheds and the flow of groundwater to the southern zone and towards the rivers in addition the exploitation of data from various sources field observation wells capturing the regoliths water wells capturing the fractured basement aquifer and electrical soundings helped to define the layers within the model the vertical and horizontal extent of these layers and the average hydraulic conductivity of each layer 2 4 1 conceptual model the conceptual model includes the surface and the subsurface one advantage of using an integrated modelling approach is that the boundary conditions are conceptually simpler for example this approach does not require an estimation recharge across the land surface 2 4 1 1 conceptual surface model the contour of the brw constitutes the limit of the surface area the soil surface which represents the top of the simulation domain was defined using the 30 m resolution dem image a land use map was generated from the 25 m resolution palsar 2 radar image dating from 2015 six classes were defined in the land use map forest culture wetland settlement area bare soil and water for each class distinct properties of evapotranspiration and surface flow have been assigned a discretization of surface model the 2d grid of triangular elements is assigned to the surface domain the 2d mesh grid is used to simulate surface flows integrating the hydrographic network and all surface characteristics one of the advantages of the integrated hgs model is its ability to simulate stream flows without first defining the position of the drainage network however the discretization must capture topographic features including lakes rivers and other channels the minimum angle of the triangular elements was fixed at 25 the mesh is narrowed around the streams where the triangular elements have a maximum node spacing of 150 m b boundary conditions of surface model three types of boundary conditions have been assigned to the surface area critical depth rainfall source and evapotranspiration sink boundary conditions withdrawals from rivers and boreholes has not been taken into account in the model the critical depth conditions were implemented along the outer boundary of the surface area a critical depth boundary condition forces the water elevation at the boundary to be equal to the critical depth the critical depth is the water elevation for which the energy of the flowing water is relatively low hornberger et al 1998 goderniaux et al 2009 aquanty 2015 the rainfall and evapotranspiration boundary conditions have been assigned to the integrated surface subsurface domain with respect to rainfall given several stations the thiessen polygon approach was adopted for the evaluation of the mean annual and monthly rainfall values over the brw the average rainfall was evaluated according to the expression 1 p moy i 1 p i a i a where p moy refers to the average precipitation over the basin a represents the total area of the basin p i is the precipitation recorded at station i a i is the area of influence of station i calculated from the thiessen approach in accordance with available data thornthwaite s approach was used for calculating evapotranspiration the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet are 1228 1 mm year and 1127 9 mm year respectively 2 4 1 2 subsurface conceptual model the brw aquifer has been assimilated to an equivalent porous medium the extreme south is occupied by about 80 km2 of the coastal sedimentary basin the model consists of five 5 layers that are from bottom to top fissured basement 2 fb2 fissured basement 1 fb1 isalterite i alloterite a and soil s a layers generation in the model the subsurface layers fb2 fb1 isalterite alloterite and soil were reconstructed in the model from the raster files of the elevations of the different contact surfaces between layers and from the dem raster files were generated within a rectangular contour using the kriging method and 541 points wells distributed over the study area fig 3 for each point the elevation of each contact surface was evaluated the calculation of the contact surface elevation between layers was based on previous work of characterization of the fractured basement aquifer this aquifer is composed of an alterite part and a fractured basement part located below the alterites the soil alloterite and isalterite layers belong to the alterite component while the fb2 and fb1 layers are in the fractured basement component the thicknesses of alloterite and isalterite layers were evaluated from wells data these data provide a good distribution of the total thickness of the alterite however most data do not distinguish the alloterite layer from the isalterite one taking into account the available data and knowing that the thickness of alloterite varies positively with the altitude z areas of equal proportion of alloterite and isalterite thickness aepait have been defined fig 3 within aepait 1 2 3 and 4 alloterite thicknesses are respectivelly estimated to 56 53 59 and 68 of correspondant alterites thicknesses table 2 these proportions have been defined from average values of alterite alloterite and isalterite thichnesses within each area for every point in each area the thickness of the alloterite layer is defined knowing the total thickness of the alterite mantle at that point the calculation of contacts surface elevations in the model according to each geological formation group intrusive volcanic and sedimentary is shown in fig 4 the elevation of the land surface is defined by the 30 m dem image the elevations of the contact surfaces between the layers of the alterites compartment are calculated through the following relations 2 top a l l o t e r i t e d e m 0 5 3 top i s a l t e r i t e z t h i a l l 4 top f b 1 z t h i a l t where top alloterite refers to the elevation of the roof of the alloterite layer dem is the raster file of the elevation of the land surface top isalterite is the roof elevation of the alloterite layer z is the elevation of the land surface at the point considered thi all is the thickness of the alloterite layer top fb1 represents the roof elevation of the fissured basement 1 layer and thi alt refers to the thickness of the alterite layer in the fractured basement zone two fissured levels fb1 and fb2 are been individualized to take into account the decrease of conductive fissures density with the depth the thicknesses of the layers fb1 and fb2 differ according to the geological formation group at the fb1 layer a thickness of 40 m 30 m and 20 m is attributed to intrusive volcanic and sedimentary rocks respectively a thickness of 30 m was confered to the fb2 layer both on intrusive and volcanic rocks on sedimentary formations fb2 extends over 20 m these different thicknesses made it possible to calculate the elevation of the contact surfaces top fb2 and top fresh basement for each group of rocks fig 3 the following relationships calculate the contact surfaces elevations between the fissured basement compartment layers 5 top f b 2 z t h i a l t 40 6 top f b 2 z t h i a l t 30 7 top f b 2 z t h i a l t 20 8 top f r e s h b a s e m e n t z t h i a l

fresh basement represents the elevation of the root of fresh basement layer eq 5 eq 6 and eq 7 refers to intrusive rocks volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks respectively similarly eq 8 eq 9 and eq 10 correspond to intrusive rocks volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks respectively top alloterite is a raster file obtained from the dem image from each of the 541 points the raster files of the top isalterite and top fb1 top fb2 and top fresh basement elevations were generated by the kriging method all these files have been integrated into the boubo river watershed brw model to generate the layers as shown in fig 5 this approach accurately represents the layer s thicknesses and thus better reflects the reality of the terrain in the model b discretization of subsurface domain the 3d meshes composed of prismatic elements served to discretize the subsurface domain these 3d meshes have been generated by hgs from a 2d grid the 5 main layers were subdivided into 16 sub layers of which 1 in the soil s 6 in alloterite a 2 in isaterite i 4 in fb1 and 3 in fb2 fig 6 c boundary conditions of subsurface domain the hydrogeological basin and the hydrological one are superimposed no flow boundary conditions have been applied to all model boundaries north east west south and model base groundwater is expected to exit the 3d porous media via rivers since the model integrates the surface and subsurface domains rainfall and evapotranspiration boundary conditions have been assigned from the surface of the domain 2 4 2 assignment of parameters the parameters are classified in three 3 groups subsurface surface and evapotranspiration 2 4 2 1 subsurface parameters for the properties assignment seven 7 zones namely soil alloterite isalterite fb1 fb2 coastal sedimentary 1 cs1 coastal sedimentary 2 cs2 have been defined indeed 5 zones correspond to the 5 layers fb2 fb1 isalterite alloterite and soil in addition within the fb2 and fb1 layers in the area occupied by the coastal sedimentary basin the coastal sedimentary 2 cs2 and coastal sedimentary 1 cs1 zones were individualized respectively the subsurface parameters are presented in table 3 for each layer the parameters were assigned taking into account the material texture the dominant textures in the soil alloterite isalterite sc1 and sc2 layers are respectively sandy clay loam clay sandy loam and sandy clay a loamy sand texture has been assigned to fissured basement layers fb1 and fb2 as suggested by guarracino and monachesi 2010 van genuchten s van genuchten 1980 parameters and residual saturation were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 specific storage was set at 10 3 m 1 for each layer of alterite formations and at 5 5 10 4 m 1 for fissured rocks according to biemi 1992 the total porosity parameters assigned to each layer took into account the texture and guideline values in the literature also the hydraulic conductivity values of the layers soil sc2 and sc1 have been assigned in accordance with the indicative values contained in the literature on the other hand the hydraulic conductivities of the alloterite isalterite fb1 and fb2 layers were calculated from the pumping test method using wells data 2 4 2 2 surface parameters the distinct properties of surface flow and evapotranspiration were assigned to each of the forest culture wetland settlement area bare soil and water classes surface flow parameters were defined using values found in the literature downer and ogden 2004 li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 aquanty 2015 graf 2015 and these values are presented in table 4 the coupling length was set to 0 1 m for all classes except for the water class which has given a value of 0 05 m the assigned manning roughness coefficients are 0 4 0 36 0 2 0 09 and 0 05 for forest culture settlement area bare soil wetland and water respectively the values of the evapotranspiration parameters table 5 have also been borrowed from the literature canadell et al 1996 asner et al 2003 downer and ogden 2004 panday and huyakorn 2004 li et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2009 pfeifer et al 2011 berezowski and chormański 2014 graf 2015 applied leaf area index lai does not change over time since in the humid tropics area the loss of foliage from one season to another is not significant 2 4 3 model calibration procedure the simulations were conducted in two main stages which constitute two calibration phases the first step consisted of a long term simulation 1 e20 s of the system with the aim of reaching a quasi steady state condition the main interannual values of precipitation rate 1228 10 mm year and potential evapotranspiration pet rate 1126 9 mm year over the period 1970 2000 are uniformly applied to the integrated surface subsurface flow domain then the value of the pet has been adjusted to have an actual evapotranspiration aep greater than 80 of precipitation as is the case across the study area the simulated hydraulic head values were compared to the elevation values of the static water levels which reflect the average piezometric values the result of the long term simulation is used as initial condition for transient simulation the second calibration step was conducted under transient conditions based on the initial condition established during the long term simulation phase the model was calibrated to the surface water flows rate observed at the babokon gauging station monthly stress were applied to the models using the monthly precipitation and pet averages for two ten year periods 1983 1992 and 1993 2002 for the first 10 year period 1983 1992 the simulations were performed by revising progressively the surface parameter values particularly manning roughness parameters values in order to adjust simulated surface waters flow rates to the measured ones at the babokon gauging station then surface parameters values for which the best adjustment was obtained were used for the second 10 year simulation period so this second 10 year period served as transient phase calibration verification 3 results and discussion 3 1 quasi steady state simulation 3 1 1 subsurface domain the establishment of the initial condition for the brw hydrologic model produced the long term average water balance at the basin scale the main terms of the water balance are presented in table 6 on average 84 21 of precipitation is used for surface evaporation subsurface evaporation and plant transpiration the other part of the long term water balance 16 62 would include the following components abstractions for the coverage of the needs surface discharges into streams and groundwater discharges into streams the error on the water balance is 0 05 fig 7 which compares simulated hydraulic heads with measured ones obtained from static levels indicates a relatively strong positive correlation between these two sets of values r 0 95 the spatial distribution of simulated hydraulic heads is presented in fig 8 a these values varying between 400 m and less than 10 m drop regularly from the northwest to the southern coast where the lowest heads are observed at the outlet these hydraulic heads are generally higher in high altitude areas whereas they are lower in low altitude ones the spatial distribution of the saturation values shows that the saturation is almost total fig 8b this seems reasonable because the quasi steady state simulation regime is reached saturation is more significant along streams and in valleys the least saturated areas are mostly in the form of isolated points hills and outcrops the geomorphological features such as outcrops plateaus valleys and especially the hydrographic network are better reproduced on the map of the spatial distribution of the depth separating the land surface from the groundwater table depth ls gwt fig 8c these depths are between 0 m and a little more than 250 m the spatial distribution of the depth ls gwt makes it possible to observe a perfect restoration of the hydrographic network 3 1 2 surface domain fig 9 a presents the spatial distribution of surface water depth the smallest surface water depth are located in areas of high elevation outcrops hills and spaces at the watershed boundary the highest water depths 15 mm are found in valleys and especially on rivers particularly in the north eastern part of the watershed there is a local basin area where surface water depths are greater than 7 m the surface water depths are generally abnormally high greater than 15 mm and reach 14 m in some places the exchange flux spatial distribution is also highlighted in fig 9b the exchanged flux makes it possible to distinguish the potential zones of recharge flux exchanged less than 0 of the potential zones of exfiltration flux exchanged greater than 0 high elevation spaces and areas at the watershed boundary are potential recharge zones in contrast low elevation spaces valleys and watercourse beds represent potential areas for exfiltration exfiltrations are more significant along streams the spatial distribution of the exchanged flux allows a good restitution of the hydrographic network overall the quasi steady state results for surface and subsurface domains seem quite plausible and would faithfully reproduce the terrain reality however abnormally high surface water depths are quite problematic 3 2 transient simulation fig 10 shows the monthly change in measured and simulated surface water flow rate at the babokon gauging station first the simulations were carried out with the surface parameters initial values table 4 for the period 1983 1992 fig 10 a the two curves seem to have the same appearance however the differences between the measured values and those simulated are quite significant the simulated values which do not exceed 0 57 m3 s are much lower than the measured values average value 10 20 m3 s high value 48 7 m3 s the calibration was therefore mainly based on the downward revision of the manning roughness coefficients the simulations with increasingly smaller values of manning roughness coefficient allowed to increase somewhat the surface water flows rate simulated at babokon reaching 1 2 m3 s and to adjust at best the two curves fig 10b and c the similarity of shape of the two curves is clearer for the period 1983 1992 fig 10b and the period 1993 2002 verification period fig 10c however the measured surface water flow rates remain overall higher than the calculated ones especially with respect to peak flow rates the revised values of the surface parameters are shown in table 7 where manning roughness parameters are on average thirty 30 times inferior to the initial ones in order to observe with a little more detail a two year simulation 1995 and 1996 is presented in fig 11 the flow rates which are relatively weak for the months of january february and march initiate a considerable growth starting from april and reach their highest levels in june or july from july there is a decline in the flow rate until september before a second peak in october relatively weaker than the previous one a gradual fall in flows is observed between october and december the evolution of the simulated and measured flow rates seems to be correlated with the evolution of rainfall and the succession of climatic seasons indeed the flow rates growth periods and their peaks would correspond to the two rainy seasons april to july and october to november and the decline period and the lowest flow rates would be in relation with the two dry seasons december to march and august to september overall the similarity between the measured and simulated flow curves seems to indicate that the brw s surface subsurface model is sensitive to forcing data rainfall and evapotranspiration and would be conducive to a study of potential impacts of climate change on water resources 3 3 discussion the simulations conducted in a physically based and fully integrated surface subsurface approach provided fairly plausible results for the two simulation phases quasi steady state and transient phases indeed the model gave a realistic long term water balance distributed the flux of water in a natural way across the different domains and spaces and showed a fairly positive reactivity to the forcing data however the abnormally high surface water depth and the underestimation of simulated water flow rates are rather problematic results these problematic results are due to poor drainage within the model this would be related to a weak representation of the drainage channels in the model because of the mesh low resolution indeed a relatively coarse mesh seems not to favor an accurate representation of surface features while a fine mesh would be more favorable the mesh resolution is related to the spatial scale of the study area the sizes of the surface features and in addition is conditioned by obtaining a reasonable simulation time the brw has an area of around 5 000 km2 at this scale finding a balance between the mesh resolution and the simulation time represents a real challenge especially because of the constraints related to computing resources in this study the finest meshes were represented along the streams where 150 m were allocated alongside the triangular elements this value is exaggeratedly high compared to river s widths which would be 30 m at most if a length of 30 m or less had been assigned to the sides of the triangular mesh this would certainly have improved the drainage in the model however given the large scale of the brw such a resolution would have involved the generation of an extremely large number of meshes thus increasing the simulation time excessively which could have been prohibitive with 150 m as the mesh length at the rivers the simulation lasts 15 to 20 days on a computer equipped with a 3 20 ghz itel core i7 processor with a capacity of 16 gb of ram and using 3 cpus another approach that can be used to improve drainage in the model is to modify the dem image by incising the channels located along the nodes representing the streams this approach would not result in an increase in simulation time however it is quite delicate and could distort the image especially when the study area is large scale such as the brw in addition we noted that surface subsurface integrated modeling work from hwang et al 2018 hwang et al 2019 and erler et al 2019 conducted at large scales 1000 km2 on watersheds in canada and using the hgs model did not report the problematic results we observed this suggests a better representation of the surface features in their respective models for each of these works the mesh resolution is practically the same as that of the brw model for example erler et al 2019 have indicated that the horizontal mesh resolution ranges from a maximum of 1000 to 250 m or less along surface flow features in the grand river model in ontario in the case of the brw model in average 150 m separates the nodes along the rivers these observations could mean that the large scale of the study would not be a hindrance to a faithful representation of the surface features in an integrated model simulating flows with hgs certainly in the case of the brw model the local particularities marked by numerous surface irregularities would be very little represented in the model indeed according to avenard 1971 the drainage system in divo oume area is not hierarchical it is made of fragments often favoring stagnant water the waters are concentrated in marshy and depressed areas also very often they follow a large density of dry thalwegs the problematic results observed could be solved by numerical approaches certainly the forthcoming versions of hgs will integrate these approaches of solutions all the more that this model is in full dynamism and periodically a monthly frequency new instructions intended to solve the problems posed are added in the model the discrepancies noted between the hydraulic head values calculated by hgs and the avarage piezometric values calculated from field data are related to several causes these causes are on the one hand the potential errors in the brw model and on the other hand possible errors in the field data used for calculating the avarage piezometric values these data are the static water levels in the boreholes and the elevations z at the drilling location the brw model did not require major calibration efforts the initial input parameters relative to each domain surface evapotranspiration and subsurface generated quite realistic results the input parameters readjustment was done at two levels revision of the potential evapotranspiration pet flux so as to simulate an actual evapotranspiration aet flux greater than 80 of the precipitation flux quasi steady state phase and the revision of manning roughness coefficient so as to increase the simulated water flow rates values at the babokon gauging station transient phase for this readjustment in the transient phase it was later discussed that the problematic results the high surface water depth and underestimation of simulated water flow rates would not be due to the parameters values but to the resolution of the mesh and the complex configuration of the local surface features thus although most of the parameter values were taken from the literature the model practically did not require major calibration this observation seems to highlight the robustness of the physically based and fully integrated modeling approach 4 conclusion the brw s physically based fully integrated surface subsurface model practically required minimal calibration efforts and the results obtained are quite conclusive however abnormally high surface water depth and the underestimation of surface water flow rates appear to be problematic this problematic result would be due to a drainage defect within the model related to the mesh resolution the large scale of the brw and the weak representation of the complex surface features in the model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

5476,during rainfall events a wide range of contaminants generated by urban areas are transferred into rivers modelling tools are increasingly required by decision makers to assess the effects of urban development and mitigation measures on urban runoff quality however representing the spatial heterogeneity of urban land cover in water quality modelling is a real challenge this study presents a methodology to analyze and characterize the land cover of an urban catchment within a water quality model the application site is the urban river verdanson located in montpellier city france where the climate is mediterranean firstly a time effective original method of identifying homogeneous urban surfaces in terms of build up wash off processes from an existing land use map and aerial photo interpretation is presented secondly the sensitivity of model outputs to the discretization of a catchment into homogeneous land cover types called water quality response units wqrus is tested the results reveal that discretizing the catchment into wqrus enhances the relevance of hydrological outputs and provide more flexibility for a calibration of total suspended solids wash off parameters the findings open interesting opportunities to integrate catchment scale land cover data into the modelling of wash off processes and allow urban runoff managers to assess the influence of urban land use planning scenarios on water quality keywords hydrological model mediterranean climate swmm urbanized catchment total suspended solids wash off 1 introduction urban areas have been widely shown to impact the water quality of urban rivers during rainfall events by transferring a wide range of contaminants accumulated on impervious surfaces and released into drainage and sewage networks gasperi et al 2014 mancini et al 2005 since cities are unceasingly expanding as in the european union where 75 of the population live in urban areas aquatic ecosystems are increasingly threatened consequently decision makers need clear and effective tools to manage water quality in urban areas and reach the objectives set by the water framework directive such supporting tools must be adapted to climatic conditions particularly under a mediterranean climate where extreme rainfall intensities strengthen the transfer of contaminants into the receiving environment rio et al 2017 urban storm water modelling is an increasing field of interest aiming to support decision makers in managing water quantity and quality in urban areas semi distributed models such as canoe mike urban or the storm water management model swmm are widely used niazi et al 2017 zoppou 2001 these models allow the user to represent a collection of subcatchments which generate runoff and contaminant loads into a drainage system the land use within each subcatchment is defined as a fraction of impervious area conceptual models such as non linear reservoirs are used for runoff generation from precipitation data and the transfer of runoff to the outlet is performed by solving the saint venant equations build up and wash off of contaminants are complex processes influenced by numerous factors such as storm event characteristics particle size distribution and catchment features hong et al 2016 liu et al 2012 wijesiri et al 2016 in semi distributed hydrological models wash off processes are generally represented by three empirical models exponential wash off rating curve wash off and event mean concentration wash off rossman 2010 several researchers performed small scale experiments and showed that the exponential equation can be used to describe the wash off of total suspended solids tss and heavy metals on roof and road surfaces egodawatta et al 2009 hossain et al 2010 luo et al 2018 wicke et al 2012 many authors attempted to calibrate the parameters associated to the exponential wash off at catchment scale barco et al 2004 di modugno et al 2015 temprano et al 2006 however more recent research emphasized the difficulty to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of contaminant concentrations when calibrating the model over a long time period within a heterogeneous catchment bonhomme and petrucci 2017 sandoval et al 2018 to better represent the spatial variability of wash off processes at catchment scale the exponential wash off model must be applied on homogeneous land cover types it is commonly accepted to distinguish land cover as the biophysical conditions of the earth from land use that links land cover to human activities the convention is to define land use as urban landscapes eg residential commercial areas and land cover as land use components eg roof vegetation previous works showed that storm water pollutant concentrations can t be directly related to land use classification fletcher et al 2013 in their study liu et al 2013 showed that the land use classification as industrial commercial and residential areas isn t appropriate for water quality modelling they found that site specific characteristics such as the type of urban surface roof road or garden have an important influence on both build up and wash off processes and therefore should be taken into account into the modelling process moreover petrucci and bonhomme 2014 tested the influence of geographical data on the modelling of tss concentration the predictive capability of the model was increased when the subcatchments were represented as homogeneous units of land cover such as green areas roads and roofs consequently a deep analysis of urban land cover at catchment scale is currently identified as a major concern among water quality modellers besides decision makers increasingly need water quality models based on an appropriate description of urban land cover as supporting tools to assess the impacts of land use planning scenarios and effectively implement best management practices bmps recent research focused on improving hydrological models by discretizing a catchment at the scale of a land cover type tuomela et al 2019 discretized an 11 4 ha catchment into 600 subcatchments representing vegetation roofs asphalt sand gravel stone tile pavers or open rock similarly niemi et al 2019 developed an automated tool to delineate adaptive subcatchments with homogeneous land cover high resolution land cover and topography data are required for such catchment discretization however in large urban areas the delineation of homogeneous land cover types is rarely available various digital remote sensing approaches can be undertaken to analyse urban land cover from satellite imagery automated extraction methods are complex to implement and their accuracy is affected by shadow and image distortion weng 2012 manual photointerpretation of large urban areas is laborious and highly time consuming consequently simple and reliable tools are needed to analyse land cover in large urban areas for water quality modelling purposes the purpose of this work is to open opportunities to represent urban land cover into water quality models at catchment scale and further allow the assessment of the impacts of bmps on runoff volumes and tss loads this paper develops a reliable and transposable methodology to analyse and integrate land cover data in the modelling of discharges and tss concentrations firstly a time effective original method is presented to classify the urban land cover accordingly to runoff generation and contaminant wash off processes secondly the sensitivity of model outputs to the representation of land cover is investigated the particularity of the model structure is that homogeneous land cover surfaces are aggregated into water quality response units wqrus the method is exemplified within a mediterranean urban catchment 2 materials and methods there are two main stages to the analysis firstly urban land cover types are identified according to a relevant nomenclature in terms of hydrological and build up wash off processes by adapting classical rules of remote sensing a sampling strategy is developed from an existing land use map secondly two representations of land cover are integrated into the modelling process and compared by hydrological and water quality outputs the application of the method to a mediterranean urban catchment illustrates its performances the limitations and uncertainties associated to the modelling approach are discussed in the next section 2 1 land cover classification according to hydrological and build up wash off processes 2 1 1 relevant nomenclature it has been showed that pollutant build up and wash off are highly influenced by the types of urban land cover fraga et al 2016 however numerous nomenclatures of existing land use maps don t reflect the hydrological and build up wash off processes occurring on urban surfaces consequently the first step of this study is to classify the land cover according to a relevant nomenclature in terms of both water quantity and quality modelling the level 1 of the proposed nomenclature is based on the two hydrological covers generally defined to describe runoff processes i the pervious surfaces where infiltration takes place and ii the impervious surfaces with no infiltration these surfaces are considered in this study as hydrological response unit hrus a common concept used in hydrological modelling to combine areas of uniform soil and land use type salvadore et al 2015 from this classification the level 2 of the nomenclature is developed based on contaminant build up and wash off on the different urban surfaces forming water quality response units wqrus first of all the types and levels of released contaminants differ among several impervious surfaces roof surfaces are shown to release significant quantities of total suspended solids tss and trace metals charters et al 2016 road traffic is responsible for the transfer of tss but also trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to direct deposition of abrasion particles and fuel and lubricant leakages from vehicles on roads and car parks egodawatta et al 2007 further to the nature of the released contaminants build up and wash off are influenced by the processes leading to runoff generation that differs from a surface to another for example flat roofs can have a significant water storage capacity while no depression storage can be associated with sloped roofs moreover the average slope of roads is significantly different from the car parks that are generally flat to avoid accidents as no infiltration take place in swimming pools they can also be considered as impervious areas with important initial losses the remaining impervious surfaces with no road traffic and no particular hydrological characteristics can be called pedestrian areas finally the surfaces where infiltration can occur are clustered into pervious surfaces they represent natural areas such as forests grassed areas shrubs and hedgerow bare soils and banks as well as gardens squares parks and cemeteries although these surfaces present different runoff coefficients they are aggregated into one class in this study that focuses on the contributions of impervious surfaces to surface water contamination the resulting nomenclature is presented in table 1 2 1 2 time effective method of land cover analysis to further develop a hydrological model based on the previous nomenclature the surfaces of each class within a given catchment need to be known numerous remote sensing approaches are available for the identification of wqrus within urban areas chankon et al 2015 jacqueminet et al 2013 unless the area of interest is very small an aerial photo interpretation over a whole catchment would be highly time consuming besides automated extraction methods such as pixel based and object based image analysis are difficult to implement and associated with errors arising from shadow and image distortion weng 2012 consequently existing urban maps can be an interesting basis for land cover analysis in one hand high resolution land cover mappings classify vegetation tree or grass water shade and impervious area bright or dark weng 2012 in other hand existing land use maps classes correspond to homogeneous landscape units both are not directly useable for swmm because of classification and or spatial resolution the definition of a universal relationship between land use classes and impervious cover is very difficult ackerman and stein 2008 indeed this relationship is influenced by the different photointerpretation rules adopted to create land use maps and the specific features of urban areas consequently the method developed here consists in identifying wqrus from an existing land use map by defining on site sampled areas also called training sites within which the urban surfaces can be manually delineated by aerial photo interpretation as land use maps are generally produced by combining remote sensing technics surveys and expert rules it is acceptable as a consequence of an hypothesis of homogeneity in each land use class i e landscape that sampled areas for a given class have comparable metrics such as build surfaces percentage diversity index or main surface percentage the purpose isn t to find the initial rules but the initial spatial units that compose a given land use class the surface fractions obtained in the training sites are finally extended to the entire catchment for the analysis general rules of remote sensing are used a stratified sampling strategy is employed by defining a number of sampled areas associated to the classes of an existing nomenclature the number of training sites per land use class is defined proportionally to the size of each class the total surface of the sampled areas represents more than 4 of the catchment surface within each of the land use classes the sampled areas are defined as circles of 1 ha surface the shape and the surface of the training sites are defined to fit into the polygons corresponding to the land use classes of the existing map the sampled areas are randomly distributed within the land use classes although the delineation of the polygons associated to the existing nomenclature constrains their localizations regarding the classes scarcely represented the analysis is directly performed within the associated polygons then within each of the sampled areas the identification of the urban surfaces is completed by photo interpretation from available aerial photography finally the results obtained within the sampled areas are extended to the land use classes and eventually to the entire catchment when the land use classes are associated with only one training site the results of the photointerpretation performed within the training site are directly applied to the entire land use class when several training sites are associated to a land use class of the existing nomenclature the surfaces of each land cover types are summed over the total surface encompassed by the sampled areas within the considered land use class the proportions of land cover are then computed over the total surface represented by the training sites for example five 1 ha training sites are defined into a land use class called discontinuous mixed housing the surfaces of car parks obtained by photointerpretation are 0 08 0 11 0 06 0 04 and 0 08 ha within these 5 sampling sites consequently the proportion of car parks associated to the class discontinuous mixed housing is 100 0 08 0 11 0 06 0 04 0 08 5 7 4 the method of land cover analysis is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 land cover representation in modelling tss concentrations in this paper the influence of land cover representation on simulated tss concentrations is investigated using the storm water management model swmm swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff routing simulation model used to simulate runoff quantity and quality in urban areas a catchment is conceptualized as a rectangular surface with a uniform slope and width that drains to a single outlet rossman 2010 for runoff generation the principle of mass conservation is applied on three hydrological covers pervious characterized by infiltration parameters impervious and impervious with no depression storage concentrations of contaminants are computed using the water quality module divided into build up and wash off sub modules the build up and wash off models are associated to land cover categories defined within the catchment as percentages of the total area independently of the hydrological covering consequently the land cover defined in the water quality module doesn t impact the runoff generation but only the concentrations of pollutants that are computed for the whole catchment although previous studies showed good performances in terms of water quantity modelling when the catchments were defined by their hydrological covering some others emphasized the need of a more detailed description of the land cover in water quality modelling liu et al 2012 niazi et al 2017 consequently the method further developed consists in discretizing a catchment into water quality response units in order to improve the representation of wash off processes in the modelling process 2 2 1 discretization of a catchment into hrus and wqrus to illustrate the two model approaches investigated in this paper a schematic representation of a catchment is presented in fig 2 on the one hand fig 2a represents the catchment as one rectangle with geometrical dimensions surface width representative of the catchment characteristics this representation corresponds to the standard description of a catchment within the swmm the width is computed from the surface and the flow path length measured as the longest flow pathway across the catchment the three hydrological covers corresponding to the hydrological response units are represented the impervious surface corresponds to the sum of the flat roofs pedestrian areas car parks swimming pools and road surfaces the impervious surface with no depression storage is the area of sloped roofs whereas the pervious surface contains all the areas where infiltration occurs the runoff generated by each of the hydrological covers flows directly to the outlet on the other hand fig 2b illustrates the representation of the same catchment as water quality response units the flow path lengths are estimated specifically for each unit regarding the pedestrian areas car parks flat roofs and pervious areas no geometrical feature can be defined for these classes thus the ratio of the flow path length and width is conserved from the value computed for the entire catchment the sloped roofs are associated to the maximum length allowed by the legislation the flow path length of the catchment is chosen for the roads and a value of 10 m is defined for the swimming pools which don t contribute to runoff generation unless overflows occur the hydrologic parameters of the model are pre estimated according to physical considerations the links between the parameters associated to the hrus and the wqrus are presented in table 2 whereas the average slope of the subcatchment is chosen to characterize the roads pedestrian areas and natural fields a high value is attributed to the sloped roof as it is imposed by the regulation on the contrary the flat roofs are associated to a very low slope of 0 01 the car parks are generally flat to avoid accidents when it is possible according to the topography hence the slope is taken as one tenth of the average slope of the subcatchment regarding the manning coefficients attributed to the wqrus they are computed from estimates of materials roughness and the nikuradze darcy weisbach and manning strickler formulas the depression storage of the roads car parks and pedestrian areas are defined according to the roughness and degradation of the materials of the different land cover types in recently urbanized areas where integrated account of runoff issue concerns the flat roofs can be designed to store rainwater in this case a part of the rainfall is lost by evaporation while the other part is restituted to the drainage network consequently the associated depression storage is high in this study it is chosen as being 20 mm finally the widely used curve number method from the soil conservation service is chosen to model runoff generation the curve number cn varies with soil type and antecedent conditions within the application catchment the hydrologic soil group is c a unique value of 50 is attributed to all pervious areas according to available literature rossman 2010 2 2 2 validation and comparative analysis of hydrological outputs to assess the performances of the two modelling approaches hydrological outputs are compared with observed data an event based validation is undertaken by computing nash values from observed hydrographs widely used in urban hydrology the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is calculated as following equation 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 nse 1 t 1 n q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where qobs t is the observed flow at time t qsim t is the simulated flow q obs is the mean observed flow value over the simulation period of length n in addition the simulated runoff volume flow peak and time to peak are compared between the two model representations 2 2 3 exponential wash off model applied to hrus and wqrus the water quality model focuses on total suspended solids tss concentrations event based simulations are performed and the initial amount of tss is considered to reach its maximum between each rainfall event the mediterranean climate is characterized by intense rainfall events interspersed with long dry periods the initial amount of tss is chosen to be the same at the beginning of each event and its value is fixed according to the available literature chow et al 2012 fallah shorshani et al 2014 wicke et al 2012 only the wash off module sensitivity is tested for the simulations in the case of the hrus the wash off is computed at each time step from the runoff rate at the outlet of the catchment following the eq 2 given hereafter 2 w t k w 2 q t 2 m b t where w t kg h 1 is the rate of wash off at time t kw h mm 2 is a wash off coefficient q t mm h 1 is the runoff rate over the sub catchment at time t and mb t kg is the amount of build up remaining on the surface at time t when the catchment is discretized into wqrus the wash off is the sum of the wash off at the outlets of the wqrus according to the following eq 3 3 w t i 1 7 k wi q i t 2 m bi t where w t kg h 1 is the rate of wash off at time t i is the summation index ranging from 1 to 7 corresponding to the 7 wqrus kwi h mm 2 is a wash off coefficient associated to the i th wqru qi t mm h 1 is the runoff rate over the i th wqru at time t and mbi t kg is the amount of build up remaining on the i th wqru at time t in this study the computation time step is 1 s q t 2 represents the kinetic energy of the runoff the wash off coefficient kwi is identical among the wqrus and to the value of kw associated to the hrus the simulations are run with values of the wash off coefficient kw being 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 1 the range of kw values is chosen according to the available literature chow et al 2012 fallah shorshani et al 2014 rossman 2010 wicke et al 2012 the wide range of kw values doesn t aim at calibrating the model but assessing the sensitivity of model outputs to the representation of land cover independently of the value assigned to the wash off coefficient kw 2 3 application site and available data the verdanson canal is a 7 5 km long watercourse flowing across the city of montpellier located in the south of france the climate is mediterranean presenting semi arid conditions with average rainfall of 676 mm year the majority of rainfall is recorded in autumn and flash floods are observed during intense and local storms that occur after long dry periods perrin and tournoud 2009 the catchment presented in fig 3 is entirely urbanized and its surface is 16 02 km2 the land use is mainly shared between residential areas 48 and major infrastructures 16 such as hospitals and universities the existing land use map presented in fig 3 is provided by montpellier méditerranée métropole the map layer was produced in 2015 based on the spot thema nomenclature with a multi spatial resolution from 1 25000 to 1 5000 other gis data used in the analysis come from the bd ortho which notably contains aerial photographies with a 0 5 m resolution and the bd topo which provides the delineations of buildings produced in 2015 and roads produced from 2012 to 2017 in this study the land cover analysis is performed over the 23 subcatchments of the verdanson catchment their delineation and geographical characteristics are determined using the 5 m resolution digital elevation model produced from 2008 to 2015 provided by the rge alti database among them the chateau d o subcatchment is chosen to perform the comparative analysis of the two land cover representations in water quality modelling with a surface of 1 25 km2 this catchment is an entirely separate storm water sewer system as showed in fig 4 five subcatchments are delineated within this catchment which includes two large retention ponds rainfall measurements are produced by an acoustic rain gauge vaisala raincap sensor at the outlet of the chateau d o catchment based on the detection of individual raindrop impacts the uncertainty associated to this technology mostly arises from the variation in the shape and vertical velocity of raindrops salmi and ikonen 2005 and raindrop size distributions krajewski et al 2006 rainfall data are available from june 2012 to february 2019 with a 5 min time step over the same period water level measurements were produced by a water level radar sensor with a 5 min time interval at the outlet of the chateau d o subcatchment numerous anomalies are identified in the water level dataset thus the analysis of rainfall events is performed over a discontinuous period of 2 5 years of consistent data to compute flow values a rating curve is defined from flow measurements performed under different hydrological conditions the uncertainties associated to the flow measurements range from 10 to 20 from this dataset 39 rainfall runoff events are identified these events cover a large range of rainfall amounts from 10 1 mm to 94 mm and runoff coefficient ranging from 6 to 80 no observation is available for extreme events so called cévenol events as the hydrological section is overflooded otherwise the sample represents a wide range of durations and intensities observed during the four seasons the verdanson river is a small watercourse as the peak flow at the outlet of the chateau d o catchment is measured between 0 52 and 3 10 m3 s the catchment response is generally rapid as the median time to peak is 1h33min 3 results and discussion 3 1 land cover analysis 3 1 1 application of the land cover analysis to the verdanson catchment table 3 gives the number of training sites associated to the classes of the spot thema nomenclature in proportion to their surface within the verdanson catchment five classes are not associated with sampled area regarding the main road network and the car parks they can be directly transferred into corresponding water quality response unit the railway network in the study area is the tramway which is half on pavements and roads impervious surfaces half on grass areas pervious surfaces finally the green areas are directly associated to pervious areas as well as the water bodies which relate to the location of the watercourses in total 4 45 of the surface of the verdanson catchment is represented by the sampled areas the photo interpretation performed within each of the training sites is based on aerial photography provided by the bd ortho database which is commonly used to assess the impervious cover in france jacqueminet et al 2013 the stratified sampling approach used for the land cover analysis gives the repartition of the water quality response units wqrus in a given area the results of the application to the verdanson catchment are presented in fig 5 with an imperviousness of 57 9 the surface is mainly represented by roofs with 13 4 of flat roofs and 7 1 of sloped roofs and roads and car parks which encompass 14 7 and 12 9 of the total surface respectively fig 5a at a smaller scale the chateau d o catchment presents a lower imperviousness 50 9 and a slightly different repartition of the roof surfaces fig 5b as the urbanization is recent in this catchment and characterized by flat roofed buildings the fraction of sloped roofs is very low 1 9 within the chateau d o catchment the land cover of the five subcatchments is heterogeneous fig 5c the urbanization of the upstream gimel subcatchment is limited with 85 9 of pervious areas the two subcatchments called malbosc 3 and malbosc 2 are characterized by a recent urbanization of residential and commercial surfaces with an imperviousness higher than 70 although the malbosc subcatchment is also recent and residential the lower imperviousness is explained by a part of the catchment that is not urbanized yet finally the domaine d o subcatchment has 61 6 of pervious surfaces due to a 23 ha landscaped park 3 1 2 analysis of the robustness of the land cover analysis a validation of the methodology is undertaken by comparing the estimated surfaces with reference surfaces from the bd topo database fig 6 the latter is the french large scale geographic referential and contains the delineations of roofs roads car parks and green areas as no distinction is made in the bd topo between flat and sloped roofs they are joined to perform the validation the roads are directly compared between the reference data and the estimated surfaces regarding the car parks no validation can be undertaken as the bd topo only considers the car parks bigger than 0 5 ha similarly natural fields identified in the analysis can t be associated to the green areas of the bd topo because they only represent wooded areas bigger than 500 m2 furthermore no data from the bd topo corresponds to the pedestrian areas nor the swimming pools consequently the validation is undertaken on roofs and roads which are the main impervious surfaces represented in the study area indeed within the 23 subcatchments delineated in the verdanson catchment the surfaces of roads and roofs combined represent between 21 and 58 of the subcatchments areas the validation is performed from existing data rather than field observation as several surfaces like roofs may not be accessible in urban areas a satisfactory correlation between estimated and reference surfaces of roads and roofs is observed in fig 6a as the distribution follows the 1 1 sloped straight line the performance of the methodology is illustrated by pearson coefficients computed for roads and roofs surfaces that are respectively 0 97 and 0 98 absolute values of the relative error associated to estimated surfaces are represented in fig 6b the median error value is 14 1 and 11 for roads and roofs respectively considering the total surface of the verdanson catchment the error associated to the road surfaces is 10 2 whereas it is 10 0 for roof areas moreover fig 4b shows that 70 of the errors are lower than 20 an extreme error value is observed in roads surfaces which corresponds to the smallest subcatchment of the area 3 5 ha this error should be put into perspective as it corresponds to small road areas the estimated surface being 0 19 ha against a reference surface of 0 72 ha the errors observed between estimated and reference surfaces of the bd topo highlight the difficulty of comparing maps with different nomenclatures and photo interpretation rules for example in the sampled areas the roads are directly delineated by photo interpretation whereas they are defined as lines associated with widths in the bd topo also the identification of buildings may differ because of uncertainties induced by shadow and image distortion as explained by weng 2012 although a large number of training sites were analyzed in this study some uncertainties also arise from the variability of the different land cover types within the classes of the spot thema nomenclature in an attempt to assess this variability ackerman and stein 2008 highlighted the difficulty of describing the relationship between impervious cover and uniform classes of land use such as residential or commercial nevertheless the results presented in this paper are consistent with the rules adopted to define the spot thema nomenclature as an example the continuous urban fabric represents areas where buildings and artificial surfaces cover the near totality of the soil and the associated imperviousness is found to reach 92 with 53 of roofs 26 of pedestrian areas and 13 of roads furthermore 43 of pervious areas are found in discontinuous housing where the soil is shared between buildings and green areas or bare soils finally the discontinuous collective housing mostly corresponds to apartment blocks and towers hence there is a high percentage of flat roofs 25 conclusively the stratified sampling method of land cover analysis gives satisfactory results in regards to their use in the modelling process the performance assessed through the comparison between estimated surfaces and the bd topo is consistent with other studies employing various methods in thailand an accuracy of 75 21 and 88 30 was reached by chankon et al 2015 when delineating roads and buildings respectively by using the object based image analysis method in france jacqueminet et al 2013 obtained similar performances when using three semi automatic mapping procedures to delineate roofs and roads in a large urban catchment when analyzing urban land cover the results systematically depend upon the available data and the chosen method being either manual photo interpretation semi automatic or automatic procedures weng 2012 in hydrological modelling it has to be noted that uncertainties related to land cover data might have an impact on the simulated runoff volume and peak discharge even though it can be muted by the parametrization of the model beighley et al 2009 in this paper the method of land cover analysis is time saving by using an existing land use map and can be applied elsewhere when land use data are available 3 2 impact of land cover representation on hydrological outputs the two representations of the catchment as hrus and wqrus give comparable performances when modelling water quantity as showed in fig 7 a some rainfall events are associated to low nash values in the two representations whereas some others are well simulated in both cases it is noteworthy that in 85 of the simulations the nash criterion is higher within the wqrus than the hrus indeed over the 39 rainfall events the nash value is equal or above 0 6 for 21 simulations within the wqrus against 11 within the hrus this finding is consistent with the study of petrucci and bonhomme 2014 who observed a significant improvement in nash values when the catchment was discretized into homogeneous units they highlighted that the performances of the homogeneous units being roofs roads green areas and other are similar when the model is either calibrated or uncalibrated in this study the pre estimation of the parameters associated to the wqrus leads to a satisfactory representation of a large part of observed events the simulated runoff volume peak flow and time to peak are also compared between the two model representations fig 7b d the results are similar between the two modelling approaches as for the majority of simulated events runoff volume and time to peak are identical while peak flow values are close to the 1 1 sloped straight line the differences observable in several cases are mainly induced by the spatial distribution of depression storage during small events indeed as the flat roofs are associated to a high value of depression storage the average computed at the catchment scale is highly influenced particularly if the flat roofs encompass a large area consequently the shape of the hydrograph slightly differs from the hrus to the wqrus as well as the storage capacity of the catchment when the rainfall amount is lower than the depression storage associated to the flat roofs for such rainfall events the simulated runoff volume and the peak flow are higher within the wqrus while the time to peak is shorter contrarily to skotnicki and sowiński 2015 who studied small variations of depression storage this study shows that computing an average depression storage for impervious surfaces is not appropriate when a significant part of the catchment presents high storage capacity when rainfall amounts are higher than the depression storage associated to the flat roofs runoff volumes are equal between the two representations as showed in fig 7b however for such events the simulated peak flow is slightly lower from the wqrus than from the hrus this can be explained by the differences of width and longest flow path between the wqrus and the hrus as the flow pathways vary among the wqrus the resulting combination of peak flows differs from the peak flow simulated at the outlet of the hrus to illustrate the dynamics of the hydrographs within the chateau d o subcatchment fig 8 presents the simulated and observed hydrographs obtained for 6 rainfall events with various runoff coefficients it is noticeable that the highest nash values are obtained for runoff coefficients higher than 22 whereas poor performances are achieved for lower runoff coefficients fig 8a and b illustrates the good fitting achieved for runoff coefficients ranging from 22 to 50 the results corresponding to the highest runoff coefficients are represented in fig 8c and d the abnormally high flow values observed during these two events could be explained by log jams that could have distorted the measurement of water level or the lack of knowledge of rainfall over the whole catchment finally fig 8e and f give examples of simulated and observed hydrographs for low runoff coefficients regarding the majority of these events a very low response is observed at the outlet of the catchment even though rainfall amounts are recorded at the raingauge consequently the reliability of water level measurement during such events might be questioned as well as the spatial rainfall distribution that could not be assessed by a single raingauge 3 3 impact of land cover representation on simulated tss concentrations fig 9 shows the sensitivity of simulated pollutographs to urban land cover representation the results are highly contrasted between the hrus and the wqrus fig 9a presents the normalized mass of tss exported defined as the total mass of tss exported divided by the initial mass of tss available over the catchment although the normalized mass exported increases with the wash off coefficient kw in both cases no linear correlation can be established between the normalized mass exported by two model representations while at the outlet of the hrus the ratio between the exported mass and the initial amount of tss reaches 1 a maximum threshold appears at the outlet of the wqrus this can be explained by the very low contribution of the pervious areas as very little or no runoff is generated within these surfaces during the considered events fig 9b presents the normalized time to maximum concentration defined as the duration between the beginning of the rainfall event and the maximum concentration divided by the event duration the hrus systematically presents a higher time to maximum concentration compared to the wqrus no link exists between the wash off coefficient and the normalized time to maximum concentration the maximum concentration from the wqrus and the hrus are compared on fig 9c showing that the maximum concentration increases with kw and is globally higher within the wqrus the two models are highly sensitive to the parameter kw the dynamic of the pollutograph is significantly different from one representation to the other with quicker and higher maximum concentration from the wqrus the pollutographs generated by the hrus and the wqrus on the 15 10 2018 are presented in fig 10 even though the parameters of the wash off equation are the same in both cases significant differences in the dynamics are due to the representation of the land cover 3 4 perspectives for water quality modelling in this paper an accurate identification of the different land cover types associated to contaminant wash off is achieved the modelling results show that the representation of land cover as wqrus keeps its ability to reproduce observed hydrographs as the hydrological outputs are similar between the two representations of land cover from these findings interesting perspectives are open firstly the main perspective of this work is to estimate the potential reduction of tss loads induced by several scenarios of bmps implemented within the wqrus such an analysis could bring some knowledge to support decision makers in effectively implementing bmps in the current need of transforming urban areas into resilient cities even if no calibration of the water quality model can be performed from observed tss data the relative change of tss loads generated by different configurations of bmps can still be assessed and bring useful information the reliability of such results would depend on the analysis of their sensitivity to hydrological and wash off parameters a variation range of tss load reduction could be estimated which magnitude will depend on model parameters secondly the calibration of simulated tss concentrations from observed data would validate the use of the wqrus to model real time tss concentrations the representation of land cover as wqrus provide great flexibility for calibrating the wash off coefficients as they can be independently parametrized for the wqrus as proposed by fraga et al 2016 on roofs roads and car parks also the maximum build up can be specified for each wqru and the pervious areas can be divided according to vegetation and soils to improve the modelling of runoff generation from these surfaces a better simulation of tss concentrations can be expected from wqru land cover representation as recent research emphasized the difficulty to reproduce the spatial variability of contaminant concentrations when calibrating hydrological models within hru heterogeneous catchments besides in their study petrucci and bonhomme 2014 simulated tss concentrations with the swmm and obtained equal or better nash values when the catchment was discretized as homogeneous units like roofs roads green areas and others they showed that the discretization of a catchment as homogeneous land cover units increases the predictive capability of the water quality model notwithstanding the exponential wash off model presents some limitations although it has been widely used within swmm to model water quality barco et al 2004 chow et al 2012 di modugno et al 2015 fallah shorshani et al 2014 gorgoglione et al 2016 temprano et al 2006 wicke et al 2012 some authors recently highlighted the difficulty to maintain its physical meaning when calibrating the model within heterogeneous catchments bonhomme and petrucci 2017 sandoval et al 2018 other water quality models have been developed such as the conceptual runoff quality simulation model described by crobeddu and bennis 2011 however the performances are similar to the rating curve and exponential models also fraga et al 2016 developed a modelling framework to improve the predictive ability of the exponential model by taking into account meteorological data such as rainfall ph duration intensity and the number of antecedent dry days and geometric features such as the materials of the different impervious surfaces nevertheless this approach requires a large amount of data that can be difficult to obtain especially in large urban catchments moreover to be effective an increase of the spatial resolution of the model should coincide with a refined spatial description of the rainfall cristiano et al 2019 the method described in this paper affords the advantage of being applicable elsewhere from an existing land use map and a limited amount of hydrological data although the tss are the only water quality variable considered into the modelling process it gives information on various other pollutants even though no link can be established between tss concentrations and other contaminants it is known that minimizing the transfer of tss also minimize the transfer of other pollutants such as pahs and trace metals gasperi et al 2014 zgheib et al 2012 4 conclusions one of the major challenges related to water quality modelling is the representation of the spatial heterogeneity of urban land cover within hydrologic models this paper pursues two objectives i developing a time effective method of identifying homogeneous urban land cover types from an existing land use map and ii integrating these data into the modelling process by discretizing a catchment into water quality response units wqrus in an attempt of opening opportunities to improve the modelling of tss concentrations the proposed method was developed to be easy to implement with a limited amount of data time effective and transposable elsewhere firstly the identification of wqrus is performed through a stratified sampling method of land cover analysis developed from an openly available land use map secondly the sensitivity of simulated discharges and tss concentrations to land cover representation is assessed by comparing the discretization into wqrus with a standard representation of a catchment as pervious and impervious surfaces in the modelling process the hydrologic parameters are pre estimated according to physical considerations and a unique set of wash off parameters is used in the two approaches the methodology is tested within a mediterranean urban catchment the results are promising they indicate that the performance of the land cover analysis is satisfactory in regards to the modelling requirements the estimated roads and roof surfaces are associated to a relative error lower than 11 when compared a large scale geographic referential compared to numerous remote sensing approaches the proposed method affords the advantage of being robust time saving and easily applicable elsewhere with a minimum of resources the comparative analysis of hydrological modelling shows that the discretization of a catchment as wqrus enhances the hydrological outputs compared to the representation as pervious and impervious surfaces the satisfactory representation of several observed events show that the pre estimation of hydrologic parameters would be satisfactory and can be reproduced in other catchments evenly ungauged catchments besides the aggregation of similar homogeneous land cover types into wqrus prevents unmanageable high level of catchment discretization regarding tss simulations the wqrus provide higher flexibility for the calibration of the wash off coefficients as the dynamics of the pollutograph is sensitive to this parameter moreover the wash off parameters can be specified for each wqru according to the properties of the considered urban surfaces a perspective of this work is a deep investigation of the uncertainties arising from the land cover analysis to assess their impacts on modelling outputs further research could also investigate the representation of urban land cover as wqrus using other wash off functions infiltration methods or hydrologic models although this study focuses on tss dissolved pollutants could also be simulated using the wqru representation in such analysis the types of pollutants accumulated within the wqrus can be specified moreover the pervious areas can be divided according to vegetation soil and maintenance practices finally the main future outlook of this work is the implementation of urban land use planning scenarios in the modelling process estimating ranges of runoff volume and tss load reduction under several scenarios of best management practices could support urban runoff management credit authorship contribution statement marlène rio conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5476,during rainfall events a wide range of contaminants generated by urban areas are transferred into rivers modelling tools are increasingly required by decision makers to assess the effects of urban development and mitigation measures on urban runoff quality however representing the spatial heterogeneity of urban land cover in water quality modelling is a real challenge this study presents a methodology to analyze and characterize the land cover of an urban catchment within a water quality model the application site is the urban river verdanson located in montpellier city france where the climate is mediterranean firstly a time effective original method of identifying homogeneous urban surfaces in terms of build up wash off processes from an existing land use map and aerial photo interpretation is presented secondly the sensitivity of model outputs to the discretization of a catchment into homogeneous land cover types called water quality response units wqrus is tested the results reveal that discretizing the catchment into wqrus enhances the relevance of hydrological outputs and provide more flexibility for a calibration of total suspended solids wash off parameters the findings open interesting opportunities to integrate catchment scale land cover data into the modelling of wash off processes and allow urban runoff managers to assess the influence of urban land use planning scenarios on water quality keywords hydrological model mediterranean climate swmm urbanized catchment total suspended solids wash off 1 introduction urban areas have been widely shown to impact the water quality of urban rivers during rainfall events by transferring a wide range of contaminants accumulated on impervious surfaces and released into drainage and sewage networks gasperi et al 2014 mancini et al 2005 since cities are unceasingly expanding as in the european union where 75 of the population live in urban areas aquatic ecosystems are increasingly threatened consequently decision makers need clear and effective tools to manage water quality in urban areas and reach the objectives set by the water framework directive such supporting tools must be adapted to climatic conditions particularly under a mediterranean climate where extreme rainfall intensities strengthen the transfer of contaminants into the receiving environment rio et al 2017 urban storm water modelling is an increasing field of interest aiming to support decision makers in managing water quantity and quality in urban areas semi distributed models such as canoe mike urban or the storm water management model swmm are widely used niazi et al 2017 zoppou 2001 these models allow the user to represent a collection of subcatchments which generate runoff and contaminant loads into a drainage system the land use within each subcatchment is defined as a fraction of impervious area conceptual models such as non linear reservoirs are used for runoff generation from precipitation data and the transfer of runoff to the outlet is performed by solving the saint venant equations build up and wash off of contaminants are complex processes influenced by numerous factors such as storm event characteristics particle size distribution and catchment features hong et al 2016 liu et al 2012 wijesiri et al 2016 in semi distributed hydrological models wash off processes are generally represented by three empirical models exponential wash off rating curve wash off and event mean concentration wash off rossman 2010 several researchers performed small scale experiments and showed that the exponential equation can be used to describe the wash off of total suspended solids tss and heavy metals on roof and road surfaces egodawatta et al 2009 hossain et al 2010 luo et al 2018 wicke et al 2012 many authors attempted to calibrate the parameters associated to the exponential wash off at catchment scale barco et al 2004 di modugno et al 2015 temprano et al 2006 however more recent research emphasized the difficulty to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of contaminant concentrations when calibrating the model over a long time period within a heterogeneous catchment bonhomme and petrucci 2017 sandoval et al 2018 to better represent the spatial variability of wash off processes at catchment scale the exponential wash off model must be applied on homogeneous land cover types it is commonly accepted to distinguish land cover as the biophysical conditions of the earth from land use that links land cover to human activities the convention is to define land use as urban landscapes eg residential commercial areas and land cover as land use components eg roof vegetation previous works showed that storm water pollutant concentrations can t be directly related to land use classification fletcher et al 2013 in their study liu et al 2013 showed that the land use classification as industrial commercial and residential areas isn t appropriate for water quality modelling they found that site specific characteristics such as the type of urban surface roof road or garden have an important influence on both build up and wash off processes and therefore should be taken into account into the modelling process moreover petrucci and bonhomme 2014 tested the influence of geographical data on the modelling of tss concentration the predictive capability of the model was increased when the subcatchments were represented as homogeneous units of land cover such as green areas roads and roofs consequently a deep analysis of urban land cover at catchment scale is currently identified as a major concern among water quality modellers besides decision makers increasingly need water quality models based on an appropriate description of urban land cover as supporting tools to assess the impacts of land use planning scenarios and effectively implement best management practices bmps recent research focused on improving hydrological models by discretizing a catchment at the scale of a land cover type tuomela et al 2019 discretized an 11 4 ha catchment into 600 subcatchments representing vegetation roofs asphalt sand gravel stone tile pavers or open rock similarly niemi et al 2019 developed an automated tool to delineate adaptive subcatchments with homogeneous land cover high resolution land cover and topography data are required for such catchment discretization however in large urban areas the delineation of homogeneous land cover types is rarely available various digital remote sensing approaches can be undertaken to analyse urban land cover from satellite imagery automated extraction methods are complex to implement and their accuracy is affected by shadow and image distortion weng 2012 manual photointerpretation of large urban areas is laborious and highly time consuming consequently simple and reliable tools are needed to analyse land cover in large urban areas for water quality modelling purposes the purpose of this work is to open opportunities to represent urban land cover into water quality models at catchment scale and further allow the assessment of the impacts of bmps on runoff volumes and tss loads this paper develops a reliable and transposable methodology to analyse and integrate land cover data in the modelling of discharges and tss concentrations firstly a time effective original method is presented to classify the urban land cover accordingly to runoff generation and contaminant wash off processes secondly the sensitivity of model outputs to the representation of land cover is investigated the particularity of the model structure is that homogeneous land cover surfaces are aggregated into water quality response units wqrus the method is exemplified within a mediterranean urban catchment 2 materials and methods there are two main stages to the analysis firstly urban land cover types are identified according to a relevant nomenclature in terms of hydrological and build up wash off processes by adapting classical rules of remote sensing a sampling strategy is developed from an existing land use map secondly two representations of land cover are integrated into the modelling process and compared by hydrological and water quality outputs the application of the method to a mediterranean urban catchment illustrates its performances the limitations and uncertainties associated to the modelling approach are discussed in the next section 2 1 land cover classification according to hydrological and build up wash off processes 2 1 1 relevant nomenclature it has been showed that pollutant build up and wash off are highly influenced by the types of urban land cover fraga et al 2016 however numerous nomenclatures of existing land use maps don t reflect the hydrological and build up wash off processes occurring on urban surfaces consequently the first step of this study is to classify the land cover according to a relevant nomenclature in terms of both water quantity and quality modelling the level 1 of the proposed nomenclature is based on the two hydrological covers generally defined to describe runoff processes i the pervious surfaces where infiltration takes place and ii the impervious surfaces with no infiltration these surfaces are considered in this study as hydrological response unit hrus a common concept used in hydrological modelling to combine areas of uniform soil and land use type salvadore et al 2015 from this classification the level 2 of the nomenclature is developed based on contaminant build up and wash off on the different urban surfaces forming water quality response units wqrus first of all the types and levels of released contaminants differ among several impervious surfaces roof surfaces are shown to release significant quantities of total suspended solids tss and trace metals charters et al 2016 road traffic is responsible for the transfer of tss but also trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to direct deposition of abrasion particles and fuel and lubricant leakages from vehicles on roads and car parks egodawatta et al 2007 further to the nature of the released contaminants build up and wash off are influenced by the processes leading to runoff generation that differs from a surface to another for example flat roofs can have a significant water storage capacity while no depression storage can be associated with sloped roofs moreover the average slope of roads is significantly different from the car parks that are generally flat to avoid accidents as no infiltration take place in swimming pools they can also be considered as impervious areas with important initial losses the remaining impervious surfaces with no road traffic and no particular hydrological characteristics can be called pedestrian areas finally the surfaces where infiltration can occur are clustered into pervious surfaces they represent natural areas such as forests grassed areas shrubs and hedgerow bare soils and banks as well as gardens squares parks and cemeteries although these surfaces present different runoff coefficients they are aggregated into one class in this study that focuses on the contributions of impervious surfaces to surface water contamination the resulting nomenclature is presented in table 1 2 1 2 time effective method of land cover analysis to further develop a hydrological model based on the previous nomenclature the surfaces of each class within a given catchment need to be known numerous remote sensing approaches are available for the identification of wqrus within urban areas chankon et al 2015 jacqueminet et al 2013 unless the area of interest is very small an aerial photo interpretation over a whole catchment would be highly time consuming besides automated extraction methods such as pixel based and object based image analysis are difficult to implement and associated with errors arising from shadow and image distortion weng 2012 consequently existing urban maps can be an interesting basis for land cover analysis in one hand high resolution land cover mappings classify vegetation tree or grass water shade and impervious area bright or dark weng 2012 in other hand existing land use maps classes correspond to homogeneous landscape units both are not directly useable for swmm because of classification and or spatial resolution the definition of a universal relationship between land use classes and impervious cover is very difficult ackerman and stein 2008 indeed this relationship is influenced by the different photointerpretation rules adopted to create land use maps and the specific features of urban areas consequently the method developed here consists in identifying wqrus from an existing land use map by defining on site sampled areas also called training sites within which the urban surfaces can be manually delineated by aerial photo interpretation as land use maps are generally produced by combining remote sensing technics surveys and expert rules it is acceptable as a consequence of an hypothesis of homogeneity in each land use class i e landscape that sampled areas for a given class have comparable metrics such as build surfaces percentage diversity index or main surface percentage the purpose isn t to find the initial rules but the initial spatial units that compose a given land use class the surface fractions obtained in the training sites are finally extended to the entire catchment for the analysis general rules of remote sensing are used a stratified sampling strategy is employed by defining a number of sampled areas associated to the classes of an existing nomenclature the number of training sites per land use class is defined proportionally to the size of each class the total surface of the sampled areas represents more than 4 of the catchment surface within each of the land use classes the sampled areas are defined as circles of 1 ha surface the shape and the surface of the training sites are defined to fit into the polygons corresponding to the land use classes of the existing map the sampled areas are randomly distributed within the land use classes although the delineation of the polygons associated to the existing nomenclature constrains their localizations regarding the classes scarcely represented the analysis is directly performed within the associated polygons then within each of the sampled areas the identification of the urban surfaces is completed by photo interpretation from available aerial photography finally the results obtained within the sampled areas are extended to the land use classes and eventually to the entire catchment when the land use classes are associated with only one training site the results of the photointerpretation performed within the training site are directly applied to the entire land use class when several training sites are associated to a land use class of the existing nomenclature the surfaces of each land cover types are summed over the total surface encompassed by the sampled areas within the considered land use class the proportions of land cover are then computed over the total surface represented by the training sites for example five 1 ha training sites are defined into a land use class called discontinuous mixed housing the surfaces of car parks obtained by photointerpretation are 0 08 0 11 0 06 0 04 and 0 08 ha within these 5 sampling sites consequently the proportion of car parks associated to the class discontinuous mixed housing is 100 0 08 0 11 0 06 0 04 0 08 5 7 4 the method of land cover analysis is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 land cover representation in modelling tss concentrations in this paper the influence of land cover representation on simulated tss concentrations is investigated using the storm water management model swmm swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff routing simulation model used to simulate runoff quantity and quality in urban areas a catchment is conceptualized as a rectangular surface with a uniform slope and width that drains to a single outlet rossman 2010 for runoff generation the principle of mass conservation is applied on three hydrological covers pervious characterized by infiltration parameters impervious and impervious with no depression storage concentrations of contaminants are computed using the water quality module divided into build up and wash off sub modules the build up and wash off models are associated to land cover categories defined within the catchment as percentages of the total area independently of the hydrological covering consequently the land cover defined in the water quality module doesn t impact the runoff generation but only the concentrations of pollutants that are computed for the whole catchment although previous studies showed good performances in terms of water quantity modelling when the catchments were defined by their hydrological covering some others emphasized the need of a more detailed description of the land cover in water quality modelling liu et al 2012 niazi et al 2017 consequently the method further developed consists in discretizing a catchment into water quality response units in order to improve the representation of wash off processes in the modelling process 2 2 1 discretization of a catchment into hrus and wqrus to illustrate the two model approaches investigated in this paper a schematic representation of a catchment is presented in fig 2 on the one hand fig 2a represents the catchment as one rectangle with geometrical dimensions surface width representative of the catchment characteristics this representation corresponds to the standard description of a catchment within the swmm the width is computed from the surface and the flow path length measured as the longest flow pathway across the catchment the three hydrological covers corresponding to the hydrological response units are represented the impervious surface corresponds to the sum of the flat roofs pedestrian areas car parks swimming pools and road surfaces the impervious surface with no depression storage is the area of sloped roofs whereas the pervious surface contains all the areas where infiltration occurs the runoff generated by each of the hydrological covers flows directly to the outlet on the other hand fig 2b illustrates the representation of the same catchment as water quality response units the flow path lengths are estimated specifically for each unit regarding the pedestrian areas car parks flat roofs and pervious areas no geometrical feature can be defined for these classes thus the ratio of the flow path length and width is conserved from the value computed for the entire catchment the sloped roofs are associated to the maximum length allowed by the legislation the flow path length of the catchment is chosen for the roads and a value of 10 m is defined for the swimming pools which don t contribute to runoff generation unless overflows occur the hydrologic parameters of the model are pre estimated according to physical considerations the links between the parameters associated to the hrus and the wqrus are presented in table 2 whereas the average slope of the subcatchment is chosen to characterize the roads pedestrian areas and natural fields a high value is attributed to the sloped roof as it is imposed by the regulation on the contrary the flat roofs are associated to a very low slope of 0 01 the car parks are generally flat to avoid accidents when it is possible according to the topography hence the slope is taken as one tenth of the average slope of the subcatchment regarding the manning coefficients attributed to the wqrus they are computed from estimates of materials roughness and the nikuradze darcy weisbach and manning strickler formulas the depression storage of the roads car parks and pedestrian areas are defined according to the roughness and degradation of the materials of the different land cover types in recently urbanized areas where integrated account of runoff issue concerns the flat roofs can be designed to store rainwater in this case a part of the rainfall is lost by evaporation while the other part is restituted to the drainage network consequently the associated depression storage is high in this study it is chosen as being 20 mm finally the widely used curve number method from the soil conservation service is chosen to model runoff generation the curve number cn varies with soil type and antecedent conditions within the application catchment the hydrologic soil group is c a unique value of 50 is attributed to all pervious areas according to available literature rossman 2010 2 2 2 validation and comparative analysis of hydrological outputs to assess the performances of the two modelling approaches hydrological outputs are compared with observed data an event based validation is undertaken by computing nash values from observed hydrographs widely used in urban hydrology the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is calculated as following equation 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 nse 1 t 1 n q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where qobs t is the observed flow at time t qsim t is the simulated flow q obs is the mean observed flow value over the simulation period of length n in addition the simulated runoff volume flow peak and time to peak are compared between the two model representations 2 2 3 exponential wash off model applied to hrus and wqrus the water quality model focuses on total suspended solids tss concentrations event based simulations are performed and the initial amount of tss is considered to reach its maximum between each rainfall event the mediterranean climate is characterized by intense rainfall events interspersed with long dry periods the initial amount of tss is chosen to be the same at the beginning of each event and its value is fixed according to the available literature chow et al 2012 fallah shorshani et al 2014 wicke et al 2012 only the wash off module sensitivity is tested for the simulations in the case of the hrus the wash off is computed at each time step from the runoff rate at the outlet of the catchment following the eq 2 given hereafter 2 w t k w 2 q t 2 m b t where w t kg h 1 is the rate of wash off at time t kw h mm 2 is a wash off coefficient q t mm h 1 is the runoff rate over the sub catchment at time t and mb t kg is the amount of build up remaining on the surface at time t when the catchment is discretized into wqrus the wash off is the sum of the wash off at the outlets of the wqrus according to the following eq 3 3 w t i 1 7 k wi q i t 2 m bi t where w t kg h 1 is the rate of wash off at time t i is the summation index ranging from 1 to 7 corresponding to the 7 wqrus kwi h mm 2 is a wash off coefficient associated to the i th wqru qi t mm h 1 is the runoff rate over the i th wqru at time t and mbi t kg is the amount of build up remaining on the i th wqru at time t in this study the computation time step is 1 s q t 2 represents the kinetic energy of the runoff the wash off coefficient kwi is identical among the wqrus and to the value of kw associated to the hrus the simulations are run with values of the wash off coefficient kw being 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 1 the range of kw values is chosen according to the available literature chow et al 2012 fallah shorshani et al 2014 rossman 2010 wicke et al 2012 the wide range of kw values doesn t aim at calibrating the model but assessing the sensitivity of model outputs to the representation of land cover independently of the value assigned to the wash off coefficient kw 2 3 application site and available data the verdanson canal is a 7 5 km long watercourse flowing across the city of montpellier located in the south of france the climate is mediterranean presenting semi arid conditions with average rainfall of 676 mm year the majority of rainfall is recorded in autumn and flash floods are observed during intense and local storms that occur after long dry periods perrin and tournoud 2009 the catchment presented in fig 3 is entirely urbanized and its surface is 16 02 km2 the land use is mainly shared between residential areas 48 and major infrastructures 16 such as hospitals and universities the existing land use map presented in fig 3 is provided by montpellier méditerranée métropole the map layer was produced in 2015 based on the spot thema nomenclature with a multi spatial resolution from 1 25000 to 1 5000 other gis data used in the analysis come from the bd ortho which notably contains aerial photographies with a 0 5 m resolution and the bd topo which provides the delineations of buildings produced in 2015 and roads produced from 2012 to 2017 in this study the land cover analysis is performed over the 23 subcatchments of the verdanson catchment their delineation and geographical characteristics are determined using the 5 m resolution digital elevation model produced from 2008 to 2015 provided by the rge alti database among them the chateau d o subcatchment is chosen to perform the comparative analysis of the two land cover representations in water quality modelling with a surface of 1 25 km2 this catchment is an entirely separate storm water sewer system as showed in fig 4 five subcatchments are delineated within this catchment which includes two large retention ponds rainfall measurements are produced by an acoustic rain gauge vaisala raincap sensor at the outlet of the chateau d o catchment based on the detection of individual raindrop impacts the uncertainty associated to this technology mostly arises from the variation in the shape and vertical velocity of raindrops salmi and ikonen 2005 and raindrop size distributions krajewski et al 2006 rainfall data are available from june 2012 to february 2019 with a 5 min time step over the same period water level measurements were produced by a water level radar sensor with a 5 min time interval at the outlet of the chateau d o subcatchment numerous anomalies are identified in the water level dataset thus the analysis of rainfall events is performed over a discontinuous period of 2 5 years of consistent data to compute flow values a rating curve is defined from flow measurements performed under different hydrological conditions the uncertainties associated to the flow measurements range from 10 to 20 from this dataset 39 rainfall runoff events are identified these events cover a large range of rainfall amounts from 10 1 mm to 94 mm and runoff coefficient ranging from 6 to 80 no observation is available for extreme events so called cévenol events as the hydrological section is overflooded otherwise the sample represents a wide range of durations and intensities observed during the four seasons the verdanson river is a small watercourse as the peak flow at the outlet of the chateau d o catchment is measured between 0 52 and 3 10 m3 s the catchment response is generally rapid as the median time to peak is 1h33min 3 results and discussion 3 1 land cover analysis 3 1 1 application of the land cover analysis to the verdanson catchment table 3 gives the number of training sites associated to the classes of the spot thema nomenclature in proportion to their surface within the verdanson catchment five classes are not associated with sampled area regarding the main road network and the car parks they can be directly transferred into corresponding water quality response unit the railway network in the study area is the tramway which is half on pavements and roads impervious surfaces half on grass areas pervious surfaces finally the green areas are directly associated to pervious areas as well as the water bodies which relate to the location of the watercourses in total 4 45 of the surface of the verdanson catchment is represented by the sampled areas the photo interpretation performed within each of the training sites is based on aerial photography provided by the bd ortho database which is commonly used to assess the impervious cover in france jacqueminet et al 2013 the stratified sampling approach used for the land cover analysis gives the repartition of the water quality response units wqrus in a given area the results of the application to the verdanson catchment are presented in fig 5 with an imperviousness of 57 9 the surface is mainly represented by roofs with 13 4 of flat roofs and 7 1 of sloped roofs and roads and car parks which encompass 14 7 and 12 9 of the total surface respectively fig 5a at a smaller scale the chateau d o catchment presents a lower imperviousness 50 9 and a slightly different repartition of the roof surfaces fig 5b as the urbanization is recent in this catchment and characterized by flat roofed buildings the fraction of sloped roofs is very low 1 9 within the chateau d o catchment the land cover of the five subcatchments is heterogeneous fig 5c the urbanization of the upstream gimel subcatchment is limited with 85 9 of pervious areas the two subcatchments called malbosc 3 and malbosc 2 are characterized by a recent urbanization of residential and commercial surfaces with an imperviousness higher than 70 although the malbosc subcatchment is also recent and residential the lower imperviousness is explained by a part of the catchment that is not urbanized yet finally the domaine d o subcatchment has 61 6 of pervious surfaces due to a 23 ha landscaped park 3 1 2 analysis of the robustness of the land cover analysis a validation of the methodology is undertaken by comparing the estimated surfaces with reference surfaces from the bd topo database fig 6 the latter is the french large scale geographic referential and contains the delineations of roofs roads car parks and green areas as no distinction is made in the bd topo between flat and sloped roofs they are joined to perform the validation the roads are directly compared between the reference data and the estimated surfaces regarding the car parks no validation can be undertaken as the bd topo only considers the car parks bigger than 0 5 ha similarly natural fields identified in the analysis can t be associated to the green areas of the bd topo because they only represent wooded areas bigger than 500 m2 furthermore no data from the bd topo corresponds to the pedestrian areas nor the swimming pools consequently the validation is undertaken on roofs and roads which are the main impervious surfaces represented in the study area indeed within the 23 subcatchments delineated in the verdanson catchment the surfaces of roads and roofs combined represent between 21 and 58 of the subcatchments areas the validation is performed from existing data rather than field observation as several surfaces like roofs may not be accessible in urban areas a satisfactory correlation between estimated and reference surfaces of roads and roofs is observed in fig 6a as the distribution follows the 1 1 sloped straight line the performance of the methodology is illustrated by pearson coefficients computed for roads and roofs surfaces that are respectively 0 97 and 0 98 absolute values of the relative error associated to estimated surfaces are represented in fig 6b the median error value is 14 1 and 11 for roads and roofs respectively considering the total surface of the verdanson catchment the error associated to the road surfaces is 10 2 whereas it is 10 0 for roof areas moreover fig 4b shows that 70 of the errors are lower than 20 an extreme error value is observed in roads surfaces which corresponds to the smallest subcatchment of the area 3 5 ha this error should be put into perspective as it corresponds to small road areas the estimated surface being 0 19 ha against a reference surface of 0 72 ha the errors observed between estimated and reference surfaces of the bd topo highlight the difficulty of comparing maps with different nomenclatures and photo interpretation rules for example in the sampled areas the roads are directly delineated by photo interpretation whereas they are defined as lines associated with widths in the bd topo also the identification of buildings may differ because of uncertainties induced by shadow and image distortion as explained by weng 2012 although a large number of training sites were analyzed in this study some uncertainties also arise from the variability of the different land cover types within the classes of the spot thema nomenclature in an attempt to assess this variability ackerman and stein 2008 highlighted the difficulty of describing the relationship between impervious cover and uniform classes of land use such as residential or commercial nevertheless the results presented in this paper are consistent with the rules adopted to define the spot thema nomenclature as an example the continuous urban fabric represents areas where buildings and artificial surfaces cover the near totality of the soil and the associated imperviousness is found to reach 92 with 53 of roofs 26 of pedestrian areas and 13 of roads furthermore 43 of pervious areas are found in discontinuous housing where the soil is shared between buildings and green areas or bare soils finally the discontinuous collective housing mostly corresponds to apartment blocks and towers hence there is a high percentage of flat roofs 25 conclusively the stratified sampling method of land cover analysis gives satisfactory results in regards to their use in the modelling process the performance assessed through the comparison between estimated surfaces and the bd topo is consistent with other studies employing various methods in thailand an accuracy of 75 21 and 88 30 was reached by chankon et al 2015 when delineating roads and buildings respectively by using the object based image analysis method in france jacqueminet et al 2013 obtained similar performances when using three semi automatic mapping procedures to delineate roofs and roads in a large urban catchment when analyzing urban land cover the results systematically depend upon the available data and the chosen method being either manual photo interpretation semi automatic or automatic procedures weng 2012 in hydrological modelling it has to be noted that uncertainties related to land cover data might have an impact on the simulated runoff volume and peak discharge even though it can be muted by the parametrization of the model beighley et al 2009 in this paper the method of land cover analysis is time saving by using an existing land use map and can be applied elsewhere when land use data are available 3 2 impact of land cover representation on hydrological outputs the two representations of the catchment as hrus and wqrus give comparable performances when modelling water quantity as showed in fig 7 a some rainfall events are associated to low nash values in the two representations whereas some others are well simulated in both cases it is noteworthy that in 85 of the simulations the nash criterion is higher within the wqrus than the hrus indeed over the 39 rainfall events the nash value is equal or above 0 6 for 21 simulations within the wqrus against 11 within the hrus this finding is consistent with the study of petrucci and bonhomme 2014 who observed a significant improvement in nash values when the catchment was discretized into homogeneous units they highlighted that the performances of the homogeneous units being roofs roads green areas and other are similar when the model is either calibrated or uncalibrated in this study the pre estimation of the parameters associated to the wqrus leads to a satisfactory representation of a large part of observed events the simulated runoff volume peak flow and time to peak are also compared between the two model representations fig 7b d the results are similar between the two modelling approaches as for the majority of simulated events runoff volume and time to peak are identical while peak flow values are close to the 1 1 sloped straight line the differences observable in several cases are mainly induced by the spatial distribution of depression storage during small events indeed as the flat roofs are associated to a high value of depression storage the average computed at the catchment scale is highly influenced particularly if the flat roofs encompass a large area consequently the shape of the hydrograph slightly differs from the hrus to the wqrus as well as the storage capacity of the catchment when the rainfall amount is lower than the depression storage associated to the flat roofs for such rainfall events the simulated runoff volume and the peak flow are higher within the wqrus while the time to peak is shorter contrarily to skotnicki and sowiński 2015 who studied small variations of depression storage this study shows that computing an average depression storage for impervious surfaces is not appropriate when a significant part of the catchment presents high storage capacity when rainfall amounts are higher than the depression storage associated to the flat roofs runoff volumes are equal between the two representations as showed in fig 7b however for such events the simulated peak flow is slightly lower from the wqrus than from the hrus this can be explained by the differences of width and longest flow path between the wqrus and the hrus as the flow pathways vary among the wqrus the resulting combination of peak flows differs from the peak flow simulated at the outlet of the hrus to illustrate the dynamics of the hydrographs within the chateau d o subcatchment fig 8 presents the simulated and observed hydrographs obtained for 6 rainfall events with various runoff coefficients it is noticeable that the highest nash values are obtained for runoff coefficients higher than 22 whereas poor performances are achieved for lower runoff coefficients fig 8a and b illustrates the good fitting achieved for runoff coefficients ranging from 22 to 50 the results corresponding to the highest runoff coefficients are represented in fig 8c and d the abnormally high flow values observed during these two events could be explained by log jams that could have distorted the measurement of water level or the lack of knowledge of rainfall over the whole catchment finally fig 8e and f give examples of simulated and observed hydrographs for low runoff coefficients regarding the majority of these events a very low response is observed at the outlet of the catchment even though rainfall amounts are recorded at the raingauge consequently the reliability of water level measurement during such events might be questioned as well as the spatial rainfall distribution that could not be assessed by a single raingauge 3 3 impact of land cover representation on simulated tss concentrations fig 9 shows the sensitivity of simulated pollutographs to urban land cover representation the results are highly contrasted between the hrus and the wqrus fig 9a presents the normalized mass of tss exported defined as the total mass of tss exported divided by the initial mass of tss available over the catchment although the normalized mass exported increases with the wash off coefficient kw in both cases no linear correlation can be established between the normalized mass exported by two model representations while at the outlet of the hrus the ratio between the exported mass and the initial amount of tss reaches 1 a maximum threshold appears at the outlet of the wqrus this can be explained by the very low contribution of the pervious areas as very little or no runoff is generated within these surfaces during the considered events fig 9b presents the normalized time to maximum concentration defined as the duration between the beginning of the rainfall event and the maximum concentration divided by the event duration the hrus systematically presents a higher time to maximum concentration compared to the wqrus no link exists between the wash off coefficient and the normalized time to maximum concentration the maximum concentration from the wqrus and the hrus are compared on fig 9c showing that the maximum concentration increases with kw and is globally higher within the wqrus the two models are highly sensitive to the parameter kw the dynamic of the pollutograph is significantly different from one representation to the other with quicker and higher maximum concentration from the wqrus the pollutographs generated by the hrus and the wqrus on the 15 10 2018 are presented in fig 10 even though the parameters of the wash off equation are the same in both cases significant differences in the dynamics are due to the representation of the land cover 3 4 perspectives for water quality modelling in this paper an accurate identification of the different land cover types associated to contaminant wash off is achieved the modelling results show that the representation of land cover as wqrus keeps its ability to reproduce observed hydrographs as the hydrological outputs are similar between the two representations of land cover from these findings interesting perspectives are open firstly the main perspective of this work is to estimate the potential reduction of tss loads induced by several scenarios of bmps implemented within the wqrus such an analysis could bring some knowledge to support decision makers in effectively implementing bmps in the current need of transforming urban areas into resilient cities even if no calibration of the water quality model can be performed from observed tss data the relative change of tss loads generated by different configurations of bmps can still be assessed and bring useful information the reliability of such results would depend on the analysis of their sensitivity to hydrological and wash off parameters a variation range of tss load reduction could be estimated which magnitude will depend on model parameters secondly the calibration of simulated tss concentrations from observed data would validate the use of the wqrus to model real time tss concentrations the representation of land cover as wqrus provide great flexibility for calibrating the wash off coefficients as they can be independently parametrized for the wqrus as proposed by fraga et al 2016 on roofs roads and car parks also the maximum build up can be specified for each wqru and the pervious areas can be divided according to vegetation and soils to improve the modelling of runoff generation from these surfaces a better simulation of tss concentrations can be expected from wqru land cover representation as recent research emphasized the difficulty to reproduce the spatial variability of contaminant concentrations when calibrating hydrological models within hru heterogeneous catchments besides in their study petrucci and bonhomme 2014 simulated tss concentrations with the swmm and obtained equal or better nash values when the catchment was discretized as homogeneous units like roofs roads green areas and others they showed that the discretization of a catchment as homogeneous land cover units increases the predictive capability of the water quality model notwithstanding the exponential wash off model presents some limitations although it has been widely used within swmm to model water quality barco et al 2004 chow et al 2012 di modugno et al 2015 fallah shorshani et al 2014 gorgoglione et al 2016 temprano et al 2006 wicke et al 2012 some authors recently highlighted the difficulty to maintain its physical meaning when calibrating the model within heterogeneous catchments bonhomme and petrucci 2017 sandoval et al 2018 other water quality models have been developed such as the conceptual runoff quality simulation model described by crobeddu and bennis 2011 however the performances are similar to the rating curve and exponential models also fraga et al 2016 developed a modelling framework to improve the predictive ability of the exponential model by taking into account meteorological data such as rainfall ph duration intensity and the number of antecedent dry days and geometric features such as the materials of the different impervious surfaces nevertheless this approach requires a large amount of data that can be difficult to obtain especially in large urban catchments moreover to be effective an increase of the spatial resolution of the model should coincide with a refined spatial description of the rainfall cristiano et al 2019 the method described in this paper affords the advantage of being applicable elsewhere from an existing land use map and a limited amount of hydrological data although the tss are the only water quality variable considered into the modelling process it gives information on various other pollutants even though no link can be established between tss concentrations and other contaminants it is known that minimizing the transfer of tss also minimize the transfer of other pollutants such as pahs and trace metals gasperi et al 2014 zgheib et al 2012 4 conclusions one of the major challenges related to water quality modelling is the representation of the spatial heterogeneity of urban land cover within hydrologic models this paper pursues two objectives i developing a time effective method of identifying homogeneous urban land cover types from an existing land use map and ii integrating these data into the modelling process by discretizing a catchment into water quality response units wqrus in an attempt of opening opportunities to improve the modelling of tss concentrations the proposed method was developed to be easy to implement with a limited amount of data time effective and transposable elsewhere firstly the identification of wqrus is performed through a stratified sampling method of land cover analysis developed from an openly available land use map secondly the sensitivity of simulated discharges and tss concentrations to land cover representation is assessed by comparing the discretization into wqrus with a standard representation of a catchment as pervious and impervious surfaces in the modelling process the hydrologic parameters are pre estimated according to physical considerations and a unique set of wash off parameters is used in the two approaches the methodology is tested within a mediterranean urban catchment the results are promising they indicate that the performance of the land cover analysis is satisfactory in regards to the modelling requirements the estimated roads and roof surfaces are associated to a relative error lower than 11 when compared a large scale geographic referential compared to numerous remote sensing approaches the proposed method affords the advantage of being robust time saving and easily applicable elsewhere with a minimum of resources the comparative analysis of hydrological modelling shows that the discretization of a catchment as wqrus enhances the hydrological outputs compared to the representation as pervious and impervious surfaces the satisfactory representation of several observed events show that the pre estimation of hydrologic parameters would be satisfactory and can be reproduced in other catchments evenly ungauged catchments besides the aggregation of similar homogeneous land cover types into wqrus prevents unmanageable high level of catchment discretization regarding tss simulations the wqrus provide higher flexibility for the calibration of the wash off coefficients as the dynamics of the pollutograph is sensitive to this parameter moreover the wash off parameters can be specified for each wqru according to the properties of the considered urban surfaces a perspective of this work is a deep investigation of the uncertainties arising from the land cover analysis to assess their impacts on modelling outputs further research could also investigate the representation of urban land cover as wqrus using other wash off functions infiltration methods or hydrologic models although this study focuses on tss dissolved pollutants could also be simulated using the wqru representation in such analysis the types of pollutants accumulated within the wqrus can be specified moreover the pervious areas can be divided according to vegetation soil and maintenance practices finally the main future outlook of this work is the implementation of urban land use planning scenarios in the modelling process estimating ranges of runoff volume and tss load reduction under several scenarios of best management practices could support urban runoff management credit authorship contribution statement marlène rio conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5477,hydrological prediction in basins with few data remains an important task for hydrologists given the practical relevance of hydrological prediction for water management and infrastructure design in this article fiducial method is applied for hydrological prediction to deal with small sample cases fiducial inference can be viewed as a procedure that obtains a measure on a parameter space while assuming less than bayesian inference does no prior it can also be viewed as a procedure that in a routine algorithmic way finds approximate pivots for parameters of interest which is one of the main goals of frequential inference in addition fiducial methods require only the information from samples streamflow data such that fiducial methods can account for valid information of streamflow observation and avoid model uncertainties three goodness of fit performance measures in terms of width of prediction interval pi accuracy and comprehensive measure will be examined to demonstrate the

generating process statistical techniques are versatile muller and thompson 2016 fisher 1930 introduced the idea of fiducial probability and fiducial inference as a statistical attempt to overcome what he saw as a serious deficiency of the bayesian approach to inference the use of a prior distribution on model parameters even when no prior information is available fisher s fiducial inference has been the subject of many discussions and controversies ever since he introduced the idea in the 1930 s the idea experienced a bumpy ride during its early years attempts to work with fiducial inference have fallen out of fashion in favor of frequential inference and bayesian inference however it appears to have made a renascence recently with the development of generalized inference hannig et al 2006 hannig 2009 compared with bayesian method fiducial method may be more attractive since fiducial interval estimations are start with a data set generating equation also called a structural equation it does not need prior distribution li et al 2016 lu and jin 2019 while bayesian idea begins with a given prior of the unknown parameter berger 1985 hamada et al 2004 bernardo 2005 tuyl et al 2009 in addition bayesian method can be performed with different sets of prior information which may lead to different interval estimates fiducial interval estimation of the parameter for specific distribution is performed by capturing information from sample observations statistical inference assumes a specific model for the probability distribution of the observations in application to real cases fiducial inference will be valid only if the assumed distribution is a plausible model for the probability behavior of the observations therefore choosing a relevant distribution which influences the entire procedure of corresponding parameter estimations and predictions is quite a strong assumption for small sample problems certain frequential properties cannot be addressed well which makes the frequential method work insufficiently in such problems wei et al 2018 willink and white 2019 in general the fiducial inference is a valid statistical method with many good characteristics see hannig et al 2006 previous studies evaluated the performance of fiducial prediction interval pi by using monte carlo simulations in terms of coverage probabilities and error rates the results indicated that fiducial methods are satisfactory even for the small sample problems li et al 2013 hasan and krishnamoorthy 2018 wang et al 2019 krishnamoorthy and xia 2018 wang et al 2019 presented that fiducial approaches are not only accurate for small samples according to the coverage probabilities but also much time saving besides fiducial method has also been widely used for statistical inference under some complex situations for example based on the fiducial methods the pi for the mean of lognormal data with excess zeros has been constructed li et al 2013 hasan and krishnamoorthy 2018 in the recent decade environmental data e g in water quality detection air contamination and daily rainfall scenarios is used for developing fiducial method as calculating examples krishnamoorthy and wang 2016 constructed confidence intervals cis and upper confidence limits ucls for the mean of alkalinity concentrations in groundwater and vinyl chloride concentrations in clean up gradient monitoring wells based on the fiducial inference fiducial approach was then extended to censored cases illustrating by same datasets hasan and krishnamoorthy 2018 developed a fiducial ucl and a closed form approximation of ucl for an upper percentile used the new methods in pollution assessment to determine whether the concentration of air borne chlorine collected from an industrial site in the united states was in compliance with the federal standard threshold limit for chlorine wang et al 2019 applied fiducial method to the monthly rainfall for a 39 years period taken from earth system research laboratory and the radar evaluated rainfall data from 52 south florida cumulus clouds to calculate cis for the difference between the means of two different regions in previous studies environmental data were used as calculating examples and the potential of fiducial method was proved theoretically there is no assessment for efficiency of fiducial method in real case this study aims to apply fiducial method to hydrology prediction for a real case of xiangxihe watershed china the efficiency will be investigated with not only three goodness of fit performance measures in terms of width of pi accuracy and comprehensive measure but also comparison between a process based hydrological prediction method with bayesian inference the assessment for the efficiency of fiducial method can facilitate its practical application fiducial method will be applied directly with the streamflow data based on fiducial quantities for the normal or asymptotic normal distribution process based model will address mechanisms of runoff yield and routing in the watershed and bayesian inference is used to deal with model parameter uncertainties 2 methodology 2 1 fiducial method first of all we shall introduce how to find the approximate fiducial quantities for the parameters of gamma distribution based on cube root transformed samples which are approximately normally distributed let y 1 y n be a sample from a gamma a b with shape parameter a and the scale parameter b let x i y i 1 3 i 1 n on the basis of the wilson and hilferty 1931 approximation xi s are approximately normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ 2 given by 1 μ ab 1 3 1 1 9 a 2 σ 2 b 2 3 9 a 1 3 krishnamoorthy and wang 2016 developed fiducial cis and pis based on this transformation the details for the structure of the fiducial quantities for a and b are as follows we define x 1 n i 1 n x i and s 2 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 to obtain the fiducial quantities for μ and σ 2 we consider the stochastic representations 3 x d μ z σ n and s 2 d σ 2 χ n 1 2 n 1 where z is the standard normal random variable χ n 1 2 denotes the chi square random variable with degrees of freedom df n 1 the notation d means distributed as notice here z and χ n 1 2 are independent solving the above equations for μ and σ 2 and replacing x s with x s where x s is a realization of x s the fiducial quantities can be obtained as 4 g μ x z n 1 χ n 1 2 s n 5 g σ 2 n 1 s 2 χ n 1 2 based on eqs 1 5 the fiducial quantities for shape parameter a and scale parameter b for gamma distribution are 6 g a 1 9 1 0 5 g μ 2 g σ 2 1 0 5 g μ 2 g σ 2 2 1 1 2 7 g b 27 g a 1 2 g σ 2 3 2 where g μ 2 g μ 2 and g σ g σ 2 fiducial pi for the mean of a future sample can be constructed by using fiducial quantities g a and g b based on a background sample indicating current data sample let y 1 y m be a future sample with sample size m the joint fiducial distribution of the mean of a future sample and the background sample can be obtained by simulating means from gamma g i a g i b i 1 n the mean of a future sample with m observations from a gamma distribution also follows a gamma distribution with the shape parameter multiplied by m and the scale parameter divided by m and the joint fiducial distribution can be found by 8 y i g a m m a m g i a g i b m i 1 n in this paper the future sample size is 1 indicating m 1 and y i g a m m a g i a g i b the pi for streamflow can be obtained using the following algorithm 1 which can be coded in any programming language algorithm 1 1 for a given sample from a gamma distribution compute the mean x and variance s 2 of the cube root transformed sample 2 generate a standard normal variate z and a chi square variate χ n 1 2 3 compute g μ and g σ based on eqs 4 and 5 4 calculate g a and g b in eqs 6 and 7 5 generate y from gamma g a g b distribution 6 repeat steps 2 5 for a large number of times say 10 000 7 let g y β 2 denote the β 2 100 percentile of the y s g y 1 β 2 denote the 1 β 2 100 percentile of the y s then g y β 2 g y 1 β 2 is a 100 1 β pi for streamflow with sample size m 1 and the median of the sorted g y s can be deemed as the point estimation fiducial inference for the lognormal distribution can be developed based on the log transformed relation between the lognormal distribution and the normal distribution krishnamoorthy and hasan 2018 let y 1 y n denote the original variable that follows a log normal distribution with e y θ and v a r y δ 2 based on the log transformation x i log y i is normally distributed with mean e x μ and variance v a r x σ 2 let y 1 y n be a future sample with sample size n then we can find 9 y 1 y n d e μ z 1 σ e μ z n σ where z j s are independent standard normal random variables fiducial variables for a future sample can be found by replacing μ and σ 2 with g μ and g σ 2 based on eqs 4 and 5 10 g y 1 g y n e g μ z 1 g σ e g μ z n g σ when considering the case of n 1 the mean for the future sample will be constructed as 11 g y 1 n j 1 n g y j g y d e g μ z 1 g σ g y can be constructed by using the expressions for g μ and g σ in eqs 4 and 5 12 g y d exp g μ z 1 g σ exp x s n 1 χ n 1 2 z 1 n z 1 exp x e x p w where z 1 and z 1 are independent standard normal random variables and w s n 1 χ n 1 2 z 1 n z 1 similarly the pi for streamflow can be obtained using the algorithm 2 as follows algorithm 2 1 for a given sample from a lognormal distribution compute the mean x and variance s 2 of the log transformed sample 2 generate standard normal variate z 1 and a chi square variate χ n 1 2 3 compute g μ and g σ based on eqs 4 and 5 4 generate a standard normal variable z 1 and compute w and g y in eq 12 5 repeat steps 2 4 for a large number of times say 10 000 6 let g y β 2 denote the β 2 100 percentile of the y s g y 1 β 2 denote the 1 β 2 100 percentile of the y s then g y β 2 g y 1 β 2 is a 100 1 β pi for streamflow with sample size m 1 and the median of g y s can be deemed as the point estimation in this paper the fiducial pi for either lognormal or gamma distribution will be utilized for hydrological prediction after fitting the streamflow data we find that the monthly data either follow lognormal or gamma distribution sometimes they follow both distributions as mentioned in introduction section using a different distribution would lead to a different prediction in order to find the best fit and the most accurate prediction we run a goodness of fit test for each month and apply the most suitable method to find the pi accordingly the test was performed by goft package in r program which will return a p value for each case the p value illustrates the significance of each test the higher the p value the more appropriate the data follow the corresponding distribution the details for the goodness of fit tests for 12 month s data are provided in table 1 2 2 swat based on bayesian inference the bayesian paradigm can help generate posterior pdfs which combine useful information about uncertainty and prior knowledge about the process based parameters the bayesian theorem is expressed as follows li et al 2015 13 f post ϕ π f pri ϕ f m π ϕ f pri ϕ f m π ϕ d ϕ where ϕ θ ω in which θ denotes the hydrological model parameters and ω represents statistical parameters the bayesian approach implements statistical inference through a quantitative update of prior beliefs

density i e f pri ϕ tends to vanish when dealing with large samples the likelihood function i e f m π ϕ is the key issue the bayesian inference which is defined as with the distribution of residuals

with the above obstacles its basic idea is to carefully construct a markov chain based on formal likelihood measures the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm is multi chain mcmc

and explicitly handles outlier chains to avoid convergence problems on difficult response surfaces with numerous local optimal solutions vrugt et al 2009 the dream algorithm in r provided in joseph and guillaume 2013 were applied in the present study the stochastic streamflow can be investigated based on parameter uncertainties estimated with bayesian method and the water cycle protocols provided by soil and water assessment tool swat surface runoff occurs when the rate of precipitation to the ground surface exceeds the rate of percolation and evapotranspiration which is simulated with the soil conservation service curve number procedure zhang et al 2019 the stochastic surface runoff can then be formulated as 14 s 25 4 1000 c n 2 10 15 q surf r day i a 2 r day i a s where s is

percentage that the observed data falls within the pis and interval skill score that combine the evaluation of the sharpness and the reliability the sharpness δ β is an accuracy measure defined as the average width of the pis at any given quantile level β the smaller values indicate sharper and better suited simulations zhang et al 2016 17 δ β 1 k k 1 k y k 0 u y k 0 l where y k 0 l and y k 0 u represent the simulated lower and upper bound at any given time step and quantile level β during the entire simulation horizon for a given simulation interval a binary indicator n k β variable is introduced corresponding to hits and misses of observations in each step 18 n k β 1 if y k y k 0 l y k 0 u for k k 0 otherwise where yk denotes the observed value at k day the ideal coverage of the simulation bound is defined as the nominal coverage 1 β the reliability bias b β is calculated with the discrepancy between nominal and observed coverage of the pis i e empirical coverage a perfect fit is defined as b β 0 when the empirical coverage is equal to the nominal coverage barnett et al 2005 19 b β 1 β 1 k k 1 k n k β interval skill score sc β combines performance measures discussed

simulation bounds thordarson et al 2012 2 4 case study a practical case of hydrological prediction in the xiangxihe watershed is provided to compare the applicability of fiducial and process based methods originating from the shennongjia forest region the xiangxihe river is located in the west of hubei province china between latitudes of 30 57 n and 31 34 n and longitudes of 110 25 e and 111 06 e zhang et al 2017 the basin is located in the subtropical continental monsoon climate zone with an average annual temperature of 16 6 c and an average annual flow of 40 18 m3 s the precipitation in the watershed is abundant with obvious seasonal changes and uneven distribution in a year the region has an average annual precipitation of 1015 6 mm where more than 70 of the total annual precipitation occurs from may to september in the watershed with 34 1 of storms happening in july the meteorological data and hydrologic data were collected from xingshan gauge station 110 45 e 31 13 n in xiangxihe watershed the streamflow data as well as meteorological data including daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and daily rainfall were collected from 1991 to 2010 the average streamflow is 30 62 m3 s and the largest monthly discharge is 174 m3 s august 1998 the monthly streamflow data are used to illustrate the fiducial and mcmc pis the general framework of these methods is illustrated in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological prediction with fiducial method this section illustrates the results of the fiducial method the pis are constructed as follows 1 collecting streamflow data to be used 2 testing the data and finding the best distribution fitted gamma or lognormal 3 for constructing the corresponding pis using the algorithm 1 if the data follows gamma distribution using the algorithm 2 otherwise monthly streamflow data from 1991 to 2010 is used for fiducial inference the pis for 2008 to 2010 validation period are constructed with real data from 1991 to 2007 while the pis for 2011 to 2025 are estimated based on the predicted values the median of the g y s where y 2011 2012 2025 fig 2 reflects the degree of the migration center position of the streamflow distribution in 12 months based on the frequency histograms probability density curves and skewnesses sks from the histograms the streamflow data are relatively asymmetrical the probability density curves are generated based on the estimated parameters after fitting gamma or lognormal distribution showing that longer tails of the curves are on the right side and sks for 12 months streamflow data are all positive and most of sks are greater than 0 5 this indicates that the streamflow data is positively skewed therefore it is safe to use gamma or lognormal distribution to fit the streamflow data fig 3 illustrates the 35 pi and 95 pi of monthly streamflow for years 2008 2025 constructed based on algorithm 1 and 2 fiducial pi measures the uncertainty associated with the streamflow prediction 2008 to 2010 are validation period and 2011 to 2025 are prediction period the observed streamflow data is separately indicated with hollow circles the performance of fiducial method was analyzed based on the monthly data for streamflow from january 2008 to december 2010 which is highlighted with red dotted line and detailed using the attached plot from the results under quantile levels of 0 05 97 2 of the observed values fall in fiducial pis in the three year validation period where 2008 contains 100 of the data 2009 contains 91 2 2010 contains 100 under the quantile levels of 0 65 the average percentages decreased to 38 9 of the streamflow during the validation period the percentage is 25 in 2008 41 7 in 2009 50 in 2010 the results indicate that fiducial method captures observed streamflow data very well for the quantile level of 0 05 and less well under the level of 0 65 the trend of predictions presents the seasonal characteristics of streamflow and the width of fiducial pi is larger in flood season than that in non flood season wide fiducial pi would be obtained at the peak of the streamflow in june july and august implying that the peak streamflow would vary under high variability situation corresponding to large streamflow in summer while fiducial pi would be narrow in november and december implying that the changing range would be small corresponding to a low streamflow in the winter 3 2 streamflow prediction from process based method based on bayesian inference sensitivity analysis with latin hypercube is carried out for fourteen parameters that represent important hydrological processes such as overland flow generation evapotranspiration etc fig 4 illustrates the sensitivity ranking for swat model parameters t stat and p values are used to describe the sensitivity t stat provides a measure of sensitivity with larger absolute values indicating more sensitive p values determine the significance of the sensitivity a value close to zero has more significance from the results canmx cn2 lat time alpha bf are the most sensitive parameters implying that canopy interception overland flow generation lateral flow and baseflow recession are the most important processes for the water cycle with xiangxi watershed sensitivity analysis is used to reduce the number of parameters that are involved in uncertainty analysis the top ten parameters of the sensitivity ranking are involved in parameter uncertainty analysis with mcmc uncertainty analysis is performed in the calibration period with the monthly streamflow data from 1998 to 2007 and a validation period from 2008 to 2010 the prediction period is from 2011 to 2025 the prior densities assumed in this study are spread over a wide range to represent vague prior knowledge and designed to be uniform over their limit value ranges in this study parameters are estimated using dream with eight markov chain containing 100 000 iterations for each parameter the first 10 of which are removed as burn in period the convergence of the chain was confirmed using the gelman rubin criterion which involves both the between chain variance and the within chain variance and quantitatively diagnoses if each parameter converges to a stationary distribution gelman and rubin 1992 the marginal posterior pdfs for the ten parameters are illustrated in fig 5 the details of parameters posterior distributions and their sensitive ranking are provided in table 2 from the results almost all the posterior distributions are not normally distributed associated with obvious skewness several posterior distributions are shown to be bimodal such as the distributions of lat time alpha bf esco simulation uncertainty is revealed based on the markov chains of parameters under different quantile levels fig 6 illustrates the simulation uncertainty ranges in calibration and validation periods under quantile levels of 0 05 95 pi and 0 65 35 pi the uncertainty ranges are generated based on hydrological protocols provided by swat and posterior information of the sensitive parameters obtained with bayesian inference the observed discharges are separately indicated with hollow circles from the results under quantile levels of 0 05 the percentage of the observed daily stream discharge within the simulation uncertainty ranges is 85 under calibration period 66 7 of the daily data fall within 95 pi during the three year validation period the percentage is 75 in 2008 75 in 2009 50 in 2010 under quantile levels of 0 65 the percentages would decrease which are 41 7 25 and 16 7 for the three years and 27 8 on average in calibration period 44 2 of the daily data fall within the uncertainty range the results indicate that the simulation ranges seem to be unable to capture many of the observed discharges fig 7 illustrates simulation uncertainty ranges in prediction period the prediction values are obtained based on weather forecast module in swat model as well as the hydrological protocols and parameters posterior information which are same with fig 6 from figs 6 and 7 the simulation intervals under quantile levels of 0 05 are wider than those obtained under quantile levels of 0 65 leading to a much better coverage of the observed discharge this is particularly obvious for the peak streamflows during the summer and recession process in autumn the peak streamflow is influenced by surface runoff while recession process is associated with base flow simulation the surface runoff and base flow are described by sensitive cn2 and alpha bf respectively this implies that considering uncertainties in parameters that related to important hydrological processes can improve the modeling ability 3 3 simulation performance of fiducial method and swat based on bayesian inference the performance and the modeling ability will be investigated with three indicators in terms of width of prediction interval pi accuracy and comprehensive measure including model sharpness δ β reliability bias b β and interval skill score sc β in this section for each indicator the performances under different nominal coverages and seasons are disclosed simulation performances of the two methods are also compared in terms of the three indicators the related reasons are analyzed based on methods principles furthermore computation time of the two methods is also compared in the section fig 8 illustrates the model performance of fiducial method and swat based on bayesian inference during flood and non flood season of validation period and the entire validation period model sharpness is measured by the average width of pis the sharpness of fiducial method would increase as the nominal coverage is raised as depicted in the fig 8a c for example the sharpness for validation period would be 24 23 m3 s 1 β 0 55 and 30 75 m3 s 1 β 0 65 from the result the sharpness of swat based on bayesian inference would also generally increase as the nominal coverage is raised this can be due to the reason that higher nominal coverage corresponds to wider range of parameter values it is further noticed that the sharpness in flood season is larger than that in non flood season for both methods for example the sharpness of fiducial method in flood and non flood season would be 47 70 m3 s and 19 03 m3 s under the nominal coverage of 0 65 the sharpness of swat based on bayesian inference would be 32 38 m3 s and 16 60 m3 s during the two periods respectively in addition we can see that the sharpness of fiducial method is almost consistent with that of swat based on bayesian inference when the nominal coverage is below 0 55 while the sharpness of fiducial method is much greater than that of swat based on bayesian inference with large nominal coverages these results indicate that the width of the pis obtained with fiducial method is larger than that of swat based on bayesian inference under large nominal coverages this is mainly because candidate points are eliminated with metropolis acceptance probability that are calculated considering likelihood in the process of bayesian inference then bayesian inference constructs a markov chain containing the accepted points that converges to a stationary distribution for fiducial method monthly streamflow data contains extreme values leading to large variance especially in flood season for example the variance of streamflow data are 1053 10 713 96 1654 68 794 47 385 54 in flood season and 8 07 30 30 124 45 130 66 745 94 440 99 14 73 in non flood season respectively the variance for streamflow data is a significant parameter in the function of fiducial to construct pis larger variance would lead to a wider pi reliability bias measures the percentage that the observations fall into the pis from the results of fiducial method depicted in fig 8d the most reliable simulations would be under nominal coverage of 0 45 0 55 or 0 95 which are 0 022 0 02 and 0 022 for the three nominal coverages respectively from the results of swat based on bayesian inference the most reliable simulation would be under nominal coverage of 0 15 0 35 and 0 85 with the reliability bias being 0 094 0 072 and 0 044 respectively from the results of the reliability biases in flood and non flood season fig 8e f the average reliability biases of fiducial method are 0 047 and 0 080 in non flood season and flood season respectively indicating that the performance of reliability bias in non flood season is better than that in flood season this can be due to the reason that fiducial method implements the inference based on information from sample leading to errors in prediction of the extreme values during flood season from the results of swat based on bayesian inference the average reliability biases in non flood season and flood season are 0 196 and 0 102 respectively the result indicates that the performance of reliability bias for swat based on bayesian inference in flood season is better than that in non flood season furthermore when the sharpness of the two methods are almost same under the nominal coverage from 0 15 to 0 55 the reliability bias of fiducial method is closer to 0 than that of swat based on bayesian inference this indicates that fiducial pis can capture more observations with the similar width the results can be explained in two aspects on one hand larger reliability bias of swat based on bayesian inference may be due to the reason that the process based hydrologic modeling involves significant uncertainties in terms of imperfectness of data and model structure inadequacies in the representation of a set of point scale gauges for the entire areal meteorological field as well as systematic and random measurement errors of gauges themselves can lead to errors in hydrological prediction besides deriving from the simplifications of reality in models principles model structural uncertainty can result in simulation inaccuracy especially in modeling of recession process and underground storage fiducial methods require only the information from samples streamflow data they account for valid information of streamflow observation and avoid model uncertainties on the other hand under small sample cases since the information gathered might not be sufficient parameter estimation could be biased attributed to the assumption of prior information bayesian methods need that information to estimate the parameters while fiducial methods do not require the prior information of the given dataset thus the constructed pis are more precise the interval skill score evaluates the model performance by combining the information of sharpness and reliability bias describing the distance between the simulated interval and the observation at each considered quantile an increased score results in a reduced fit of simulation bounds thordarson et al 2012 from the results in fig 8g the interval skill score would increase with raised nominal coverage and the score would rise rapidly when the nominal coverage is greater than 0 75 for example the interval skill score under nominal coverage of 0 15 0 55 and 0 95 would be 37 174 49 5195 152 189 for swat based on bayesian inference and 25 474 35 704 84 637 for fiducial method the results depicted in fig 8h i further notice that both fiducial method and swat based on bayesian inference have higher scores in flood season than those in non flood season furthermore from the results the interval skill score of fiducial method is lower than that of swat based on bayesian inference for example the interval skill score for fiducial method would be 130 912 and 52 075 in flood season and non flood season under the nominal coverage 0 95 while the interval skill score for swat based on bayesian inference would be 209 567 and 111 204 the results of fig 8g i imply that the performance of fiducial method is better under small sample cases considering interval skill score computation time of the two methods is also compared in the study all the experiments are conducted on a machine with intel r core tm cpu i5 7200u 2 50 ghz with 8 gb of ram during the three year validation period the running time is 5 88 s and during prediction period the running time is 25 68 s for fiducial method the running time for swat based on bayesian inference is 4 8 h for all the periods it is obvious that fiducial method is much more time saving than the process based method dream algorithm significantly enhances the applicability of bayesian inference to complex multi modal search problems and increase the speed of convergence by running multiple interacting chains simultaneously using differential evolution however swat based on bayesian inference requires repeated calculations to get the numerical solution 100 000 iterations for each model parameter fiducial methods require only the information from samples so they do not encounter the problem aforementioned the computing times needed for fiducial are usually more than 500 times shorter than those of bayesian ones although the results indicate that fiducial method has better performance than swat based on bayesian inference under small samples cases fiducial method is not proclaimed to be a better solution for hydrology system under small sample cases since the information gathered might not be sufficient parameter estimation could be biased attributed to the assumption of prior information and simulation uncertainties fiducial methods do not require the prior information of the given dataset in addition fiducial methods require only the information from samples streamflow data such that fiducial methods can account for valid information of streamflow observation and avoid model uncertainties that hinder the application of process based method under large sample cases sufficient data information supports investigation of uncertainty sources swat based on bayesian inference cannot only provide an exhaustive exploration of a complex high dimensional parameter space of random variables but also accommodate complex hydrological mechanism such as those with nonlinear effects based on sufficient data information lee et al 2007 laloy et al 2013 4 conclusions in this article fiducial method is firstly applied for hydrological prediction its performance is investigated by comparing with swat based on bayesian inference unlike bayesian and frequentist methods fiducial method performs inverse probability and calculates fiducial interval estimation based on fiducial distribution without calling on prior probability distributions in other words this method does not require tremendous calculations to find the estimates for the unknown parameters the simulation performances of the two methods are compared by using three indicators for entire validation period non flood and flood season of validation period under different quantile levels several findings are revealed as follows i the performance of sharpness for the two methods is basically same under small nominal coverage the sharpness for swat based on bayesian inference is lower than that of fiducial method under large nominal coverages ii the reliability bias of fiducial method is generally closer to zero than that of swat based on bayesian inference during all periods especially fiducial pis can capture more observations with the similar width fiducial method returns more satisfactory results iii prediction performance of fiducial method is more satisfactory than swat based on bayesian inference under small sample cases according to interval skill score iv fiducial method for hydrological prediction is much more time saving than swat based on bayesian inference therefore fiducial method has a great potential to handle hydrological prediction for small sample cases as it produces more satisfactory and time saving results credit authorship

5477,hydrological prediction in basins with few data remains an important task for hydrologists given the practical relevance of hydrological prediction for water management and infrastructure design in this article fiducial method is applied for hydrological prediction to deal with small sample cases fiducial inference can be viewed as a procedure that obtains a measure on a parameter space while assuming less than bayesian inference does no prior it can also be viewed as a procedure that in a routine algorithmic way finds approximate pivots for parameters of interest which is one of the main goals of frequential inference in addition fiducial methods require only the information from samples streamflow data such that fiducial methods can account for valid information of streamflow observation and avoid model uncertainties three goodness of fit performance measures in terms of width of prediction interval pi accuracy and comprehensive measure will be examined to demonstrate the

infrastructure design khan and valeo 2016 li et al 2019 statistical techniques quantify the main features of a set of data and its random variation e g the trend seasonal cyclical irregular components of the original data and data distribution to forecast and consequently manages water resources xue et al 2013 aguilera et al 2018 shivam et al 2019 because they do not assume any specific runoff generating process statistical techniques are versatile muller and thompson 2016 fisher 1930 introduced the idea of fiducial probability and fiducial inference as a statistical attempt to overcome what he saw as a serious deficiency of the bayesian approach to inference the use of a prior distribution on model parameters even when no prior information is available fisher s fiducial inference has been the subject of many discussions and controversies ever since he introduced the idea in the 1930 s the idea experienced a bumpy ride during its early years attempts to work with fiducial inference have fallen out of fashion in favor of frequential inference and bayesian inference however it appears to have made a renascence recently with the development of generalized inference hannig et al 2006 hannig 2009 compared with bayesian method fiducial method may be more attractive since fiducial interval estimations are start with a data set generating equation also called a structural equation it does not need prior distribution li et al 2016 lu and jin 2019 while bayesian idea begins with a given prior of the unknown parameter berger 1985 hamada et al 2004 bernardo 2005 tuyl et al 2009 in addition bayesian method can be performed with different sets of prior information which may lead to different interval estimates fiducial interval estimation of the parameter for specific distribution is performed by capturing information from sample observations statistical inference assumes a specific model for the probability distribution of the observations in application to real cases fiducial inference will be valid only if the assumed distribution is a plausible model for the probability behavior of the observations therefore choosing a relevant distribution which influences the entire procedure of corresponding parameter estimations and predictions is quite a strong assumption for small sample problems certain frequential properties cannot be addressed well which makes the frequential method work insufficiently in such problems wei et al 2018 willink and white 2019 in general the fiducial inference is a valid statistical method with many good characteristics see hannig et al 2006 previous studies evaluated the performance of fiducial prediction interval pi by using monte carlo simulations in terms of coverage probabilities and error rates the results indicated that fiducial methods are satisfactory even for the small sample problems li et al 2013 hasan and krishnamoorthy 2018 wang et al 2019 krishnamoorthy and xia 2018 wang et al 2019 presented that fiducial approaches are not only accurate for small samples according to the coverage probabilities but also much time saving besides fiducial method has also been widely used for statistical inference under some complex situations for example based on the fiducial methods the pi for the mean of lognormal data with excess zeros has been constructed li et al 2013 hasan and krishnamoorthy 2018 in the recent decade environmental data e g in water quality detection air contamination and daily rainfall scenarios is used for developing fiducial method as calculating examples krishnamoorthy and wang 2016 constructed confidence intervals cis and upper confidence limits ucls for the mean of alkalinity concentrations in groundwater and vinyl chloride concentrations in clean up gradient monitoring wells based on the fiducial inference fiducial approach was then extended to censored cases illustrating by same datasets hasan and krishnamoorthy 2018 developed a fiducial ucl and a closed form approximation of ucl for an upper percentile used the new methods in pollution assessment to determine whether the concentration of air borne chlorine collected from an industrial site in the united states was in compliance with the federal standard threshold limit for chlorine wang et al 2019 applied fiducial method to the monthly rainfall for a 39 years period taken from earth system research laboratory and the radar evaluated rainfall data from 52 south florida cumulus clouds to calculate cis for the difference between the means of two different regions in previous studies environmental data were used as calculating examples and the potential of fiducial method was proved theoretically there is no assessment for efficiency of fiducial method in real case this study aims to apply fiducial method to hydrology prediction for a real case of xiangxihe watershed china the efficiency will be investigated with not only three goodness of fit performance measures in terms of width of pi accuracy and comprehensive measure but also comparison between a process based hydrological prediction method with bayesian inference the assessment for the efficiency of fiducial method can facilitate its practical application fiducial method will be applied directly with the streamflow data based on fiducial quantities for the normal or asymptotic normal distribution process based model will address mechanisms of runoff yield and routing in the watershed and bayesian inference is used to deal with model parameter uncertainties 2 methodology 2 1 fiducial method first of all we shall introduce how to find the approximate fiducial quantities for the parameters of gamma distribution based on cube root transformed samples which are approximately normally distributed let y 1 y n be a sample from a gamma a b with shape parameter a and the scale parameter b let x i y i 1 3 i 1 n on the basis of the wilson and hilferty 1931 approximation xi s are approximately normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ 2 given by 1 μ ab 1 3 1 1 9 a 2 σ 2 b 2 3 9 a 1 3 krishnamoorthy and wang 2016 developed fiducial cis and pis based on this transformation the details for the structure of the fiducial quantities for a and b are as follows we define x 1 n i 1 n x i and s 2 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 to obtain the fiducial quantities for μ and σ 2 we consider the stochastic representations 3 x d μ z σ n and s 2 d σ 2 χ n 1 2 n 1 where z is the standard normal random variable χ n 1 2 denotes the chi square random variable with degrees of freedom df n 1 the notation d means distributed as notice here z and χ n 1 2 are independent solving the above equations for μ and σ 2 and replacing x s with x s where x s is a realization of x s the fiducial quantities can be obtained as 4 g μ x z n 1 χ n 1 2 s n 5 g σ 2 n 1 s 2 χ n 1 2 based on eqs 1 5 the fiducial quantities for shape parameter a and scale parameter b for gamma distribution are 6 g a 1 9 1 0 5 g μ 2 g σ 2 1 0 5 g μ 2 g σ 2 2 1 1 2 7 g b 27 g a 1 2 g σ 2 3 2 where g μ 2 g μ 2 and g σ g σ 2 fiducial pi for the mean of a future sample can be constructed by using fiducial quantities g a and g b based on a background sample indicating current data sample let y 1 y m be a future sample with sample size m the joint fiducial distribution of the mean of a future sample and the background sample can be obtained by simulating means from gamma g i a g i b i 1 n the mean of a future sample with m observations from a gamma distribution also follows a gamma distribution with the shape parameter multiplied by m and the scale parameter divided by m and the joint fiducial distribution can be found by 8 y i g a m m a m g i a g i b m i 1 n in this paper the future sample size is 1 indicating m 1 and y i g a m m a g i a g i b the pi for streamflow can be obtained using the following algorithm 1 which can be coded in any programming language algorithm 1 1 for a given sample from a gamma distribution compute the mean x and variance s 2 of the cube root transformed sample 2 generate a standard normal variate z and a chi square variate χ n 1 2 3 compute g μ and g σ based on eqs 4 and 5 4 calculate g a and g b in eqs 6 and 7 5 generate y from gamma g a g b distribution 6 repeat steps 2 5 for a large number of times say 10 000 7 let g y β 2 denote the β 2 100 percentile of the y s g y 1 β 2 denote the 1 β 2 100 percentile of the y s then g y β 2 g y 1 β 2 is a 100 1 β pi for streamflow with sample size m 1 and the median of the sorted g y s can be deemed as the point estimation fiducial inference for the lognormal distribution can be developed based on the log transformed relation between the lognormal distribution and the normal distribution krishnamoorthy and hasan 2018 let y 1 y n denote the original variable that follows a log normal distribution with e y θ and v a r y δ 2 based on the log transformation x i log y i is normally distributed with mean e x μ and variance v a r x σ 2 let y 1 y n be a future sample with sample size n then we can find 9 y 1 y n d e μ z 1 σ e μ z n σ where z j s are independent standard normal random variables fiducial variables for a future sample can be found by replacing μ and σ 2 with g μ and g σ 2 based on eqs 4 and 5 10 g y 1 g y n e g μ z 1 g σ e g μ z n g σ when considering the case of n 1 the mean for the future sample will be constructed as 11 g y 1 n j 1 n g y j g y d e g μ z 1 g σ g y can be constructed by using the expressions for g μ and g σ in eqs 4 and 5 12 g y d exp g μ z 1 g σ exp x s n 1 χ n 1 2 z 1 n z 1 exp x e x p w where z 1 and z 1 are independent standard normal random variables and w s n 1 χ n 1 2 z 1 n z 1 similarly the pi for streamflow can be obtained using the algorithm 2 as follows algorithm 2 1 for a given sample from a lognormal distribution compute the mean x and variance s 2 of the log transformed sample 2 generate standard normal variate z 1 and a chi square variate χ n 1 2 3 compute g μ and g σ based on eqs 4 and 5 4 generate a standard normal variable z 1 and compute w and g y in eq 12 5 repeat steps 2 4 for a large number of times say 10 000 6 let g y β 2 denote the β 2 100 percentile of the y s g y 1 β 2 denote the 1 β 2 100 percentile of the y s then g y β 2 g y 1 β 2 is a 100 1 β pi for streamflow with sample size m 1 and the median of g y s can be deemed as the point estimation in this paper the fiducial pi for either lognormal or gamma distribution will be utilized for hydrological prediction after fitting the streamflow data we find that the monthly data either follow lognormal or gamma distribution sometimes they follow both distributions as mentioned in introduction section using a different distribution would lead to a different prediction in order to find the best fit and the most accurate prediction we run a goodness of fit test for each month and apply the most suitable method to find the pi accordingly the test was performed by goft package in r program which will return a p value for each case the p value illustrates the significance of each test the higher the p value the more appropriate the data follow the corresponding distribution the details for the goodness of fit tests for 12 month s data are provided in table 1 2 2 swat based on bayesian inference the bayesian paradigm can help generate posterior pdfs which combine useful information about uncertainty and prior knowledge about the process based parameters the bayesian theorem is expressed as follows li et al 2015 13 f post ϕ π f pri ϕ f m π ϕ f pri ϕ f m π ϕ d ϕ where ϕ θ ω in which θ denotes the hydrological model parameters and ω represents statistical parameters the bayesian approach implements statistical inference through a quantitative update of prior beliefs after considering measurement f post ϕ π denotes the posterior probability that expresses our updated beliefs on θ after measurements and forcing conditions are accounted for the effect of the prior density i e f pri ϕ tends to vanish when dealing with large samples the likelihood function i e f m π ϕ is the key issue the bayesian inference which is defined as with the distribution of residuals integrating marginal distribution and conditional distribution the posterior density might have a complicated functional form which is difficult to calculate markov chain monte carlo mcmc can deal with the above obstacles its basic idea is to carefully construct a markov chain based on formal likelihood measures the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm is multi chain mcmc sampler which significantly enhances the applicability of mcmc simulation to complex multi modal search problems by running multiple interacting chains simultaneously using differential evolution laloy and vrugt 2012 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 it has been implemented with metropolis hastings sampler metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 gibbs sampler gelfand et al 1990 delayed rejection adaptive metropolis dram laine et al 2006 shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua global optimization algorithm vrugt et al 2003 and differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream vrugt 2016 the dream scheme automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution during the search adapts subspace sampling to maximize the average normalized jumping distance in each chain and explicitly handles outlier chains to avoid convergence problems on difficult response surfaces with numerous local optimal solutions vrugt et al 2009 the dream algorithm in r provided in joseph and guillaume 2013 were applied in the present study the stochastic streamflow can be investigated based on parameter uncertainties estimated with bayesian method and the water cycle protocols provided by soil and water assessment tool swat surface runoff occurs when the rate of precipitation to the ground surface exceeds the rate of percolation and evapotranspiration which is simulated with the soil conservation service curve number procedure zhang et al 2019 the stochastic surface runoff can then be formulated as 14 s 25 4 1000 c n 2 10 15 q surf r day i a 2 r day i a s where s is retention parameter mm h2o c n 2 represents the service runoff curve number for moisture condition ii i e average moisture which varies spatially due to changes in soils land use management and slope and temporally due to changes in soil water content ia is initial abstractions which include surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff mm h2o q surf is surface runoff mm h2o which is of randomness due to the uncertainty of the service runoff curve number model parameters with lines indicate that they are uncertain and contain errors in estimating their values which are accounted for by mcmc the maximum amount of water allowed to be evaporated is determined by the depth distribution of evaporative demand the depth distribution can be modified by soil evaporation compensation coefficient esco through the following equation 16 e soil l y e soil z l e soil z u esco where e soil l y represents the evaporative demand for layer ly mm h2o esoil zl is the evaporative demand at the lower boundary of the soil layer mm h2o and esoil zu denotes the evaporative demand at the upper boundary of the soil layer mm h2o 2 3 probabilistic performance measures in this study three goodness of fit performance measures are used to measure model ability the measures are sharpness calculated in terms of the width of the derived pis reliability bias that indicates the percentage that the observed data falls within the pis and interval skill score that combine the evaluation of the sharpness and the reliability the sharpness δ β is an accuracy measure defined as the average width of the pis at any given quantile level β the smaller values indicate sharper and better suited simulations zhang et al 2016 17 δ β 1 k k 1 k y k 0 u y k 0 l where y k 0 l and y k 0 u represent the simulated lower and upper bound at any given time step and quantile level β during the entire simulation horizon for a given simulation interval a binary indicator n k β variable is introduced corresponding to hits and misses of observations in each step 18 n k β 1 if y k y k 0 l y k 0 u for k k 0 otherwise where yk denotes the observed value at k day the ideal coverage of the simulation bound is defined as the nominal coverage 1 β the reliability bias b β is calculated with the discrepancy between nominal and observed coverage of the pis i e empirical coverage a perfect fit is defined as b β 0 when the empirical coverage is equal to the nominal coverage barnett et al 2005 19 b β 1 β 1 k k 1 k n k β interval skill score sc β combines performance measures discussed above to evaluate the modeling performance of the different models directly the score at time instant k is calculated for the interval simulation as follows 20 s c β δ β 2 β k k 1 k y k 0 l y k 1 y k y k 0 l y k y k 0 u 1 y k 0 u y k the skill score describes the distance between the simulated interval and the observation at each considered quantile an increased score results in a reduced fit of simulation bounds thordarson et al 2012 2 4 case study a practical case of hydrological prediction in the xiangxihe watershed is provided to compare the applicability of fiducial and process based methods originating from the shennongjia forest region the xiangxihe river is located in the west of hubei province china between latitudes of 30 57 n and 31 34 n and longitudes of 110 25 e and 111 06 e zhang et al 2017 the basin is located in the subtropical continental monsoon climate zone with an average annual temperature of 16 6 c and an average annual flow of 40 18 m3 s the precipitation in the watershed is abundant with obvious seasonal changes and uneven distribution in a year the region has an average annual precipitation of 1015 6 mm where more than 70 of the total annual precipitation occurs from may to september in the watershed with 34 1 of storms happening in july the meteorological data and hydrologic data were collected from xingshan gauge station 110 45 e 31 13 n in xiangxihe watershed the streamflow data as well as meteorological data including daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and daily rainfall were collected from 1991 to 2010 the average streamflow is 30 62 m3 s and the largest monthly discharge is 174 m3 s august 1998 the monthly streamflow data are used to illustrate the fiducial and mcmc pis the general framework of these methods is illustrated in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological prediction with fiducial method this section illustrates the results of the fiducial method the pis are constructed as follows 1 collecting streamflow data to be used 2 testing the data and finding the best distribution fitted gamma or lognormal 3 for constructing the corresponding pis using the algorithm 1 if the data follows gamma distribution using the algorithm 2 otherwise monthly streamflow data from 1991 to 2010 is used for fiducial inference the pis for 2008 to 2010 validation period are constructed with real data from 1991 to 2007 while the pis for 2011 to 2025 are estimated based on the predicted values the median of the g y s where y 2011 2012 2025 fig 2 reflects the degree of the migration center position of the streamflow distribution in 12 months based on the frequency histograms probability density curves and skewnesses sks from the histograms the streamflow data are relatively asymmetrical the probability density curves are generated based on the estimated parameters after fitting gamma or lognormal distribution showing that longer tails of the curves are on the right side and sks for 12 months streamflow data are all positive and most of sks are greater than 0 5 this indicates that the streamflow data is positively skewed therefore it is safe to use gamma or lognormal distribution to fit the streamflow data fig 3 illustrates the 35 pi and 95 pi of monthly streamflow for years 2008 2025 constructed based on algorithm 1 and 2 fiducial pi measures the uncertainty associated with the streamflow prediction 2008 to 2010 are validation period and 2011 to 2025 are prediction period the observed streamflow data is separately indicated with hollow circles the performance of fiducial method was analyzed based on the monthly data for streamflow from january 2008 to december 2010 which is highlighted with red dotted line and detailed using the attached plot from the results under quantile levels of 0 05 97 2 of the observed values fall in fiducial pis in the three year validation period where 2008 contains 100 of the data 2009 contains 91 2 2010 contains 100 under the quantile levels of 0 65 the average percentages decreased to 38 9 of the streamflow during the validation period the percentage is 25 in 2008 41 7 in 2009 50 in 2010 the results indicate that fiducial method captures observed streamflow data very well for the quantile level of 0 05 and less well under the level of 0 65 the trend of predictions presents the seasonal characteristics of streamflow and the width of fiducial pi is larger in flood season than that in non flood season wide fiducial pi would be obtained at the peak of the streamflow in june july and august implying that the peak streamflow would vary under high variability situation corresponding to large streamflow in summer while fiducial pi would be narrow in november and december implying that the changing range would be small corresponding to a low streamflow in the winter 3 2 streamflow prediction from process based method based on bayesian inference sensitivity analysis with latin hypercube is carried out for fourteen parameters that represent important hydrological processes such as overland flow generation evapotranspiration etc fig 4 illustrates the sensitivity ranking for swat model parameters t stat and p values are used to describe the sensitivity t stat provides a measure of sensitivity with larger absolute values indicating more sensitive p values determine the significance of the sensitivity a value close to zero has more significance from the results canmx cn2 lat time alpha bf are the most sensitive parameters implying that canopy interception overland flow generation lateral flow and baseflow recession are the most important processes for the water cycle with xiangxi watershed sensitivity analysis is used to reduce the number of parameters that are involved in uncertainty analysis the top ten parameters of the sensitivity ranking are involved in parameter uncertainty analysis with mcmc uncertainty analysis is performed in the calibration period with the monthly streamflow data from 1998 to 2007 and a validation period from 2008 to 2010 the prediction period is from 2011 to 2025 the prior densities assumed in this study are spread over a wide range to represent vague prior knowledge and designed to be uniform over their limit value ranges in this study parameters are estimated using dream with eight markov chain containing 100 000 iterations for each parameter the first 10 of which are removed as burn in period the convergence of the chain was confirmed using the gelman rubin criterion which involves both the between chain variance and the within chain variance and quantitatively diagnoses if each parameter converges to a stationary distribution gelman and rubin 1992 the marginal posterior pdfs for the ten parameters are illustrated in fig 5 the details of parameters posterior distributions and their sensitive ranking are provided in table 2 from the results almost all the posterior distributions are not normally distributed associated with obvious skewness several posterior distributions are shown to be bimodal such as the distributions of lat time alpha bf esco simulation uncertainty is revealed based on the markov chains of parameters under different quantile levels fig 6 illustrates the simulation uncertainty ranges in calibration and validation periods under quantile levels of 0 05 95 pi and 0 65 35 pi the uncertainty ranges are generated based on hydrological protocols provided by swat and posterior information of the sensitive parameters obtained with bayesian inference the observed discharges are separately indicated with hollow circles from the results under quantile levels of 0 05 the percentage of the observed daily stream discharge within the simulation uncertainty ranges is 85 under calibration period 66 7 of the daily data fall within 95 pi during the three year validation period the percentage is 75 in 2008 75 in 2009 50 in 2010 under quantile levels of 0 65 the percentages would decrease which are 41 7 25 and 16 7 for the three years and 27 8 on average in calibration period 44 2 of the daily data fall within the uncertainty range the results indicate that the simulation ranges seem to be unable to capture many of the observed discharges fig 7 illustrates simulation uncertainty ranges in prediction period the prediction values are obtained based on weather forecast module in swat model as well as the hydrological protocols and parameters posterior information which are same with fig 6 from figs 6 and 7 the simulation intervals under quantile levels of 0 05 are wider than those obtained under quantile levels of 0 65 leading to a much better coverage of the observed discharge this is particularly obvious for the peak streamflows during the summer and recession process in autumn the peak streamflow is influenced by surface runoff while recession process is associated with base flow simulation the surface runoff and base flow are described by sensitive cn2 and alpha bf respectively this implies that considering uncertainties in parameters that related to important hydrological processes can improve the modeling ability 3 3 simulation performance of fiducial method and swat based on bayesian inference the performance and the modeling ability will be investigated with three indicators in terms of width of prediction interval pi accuracy and comprehensive measure including model sharpness δ β reliability bias b β and interval skill score sc β in this section for each indicator the performances under different nominal coverages and seasons are disclosed simulation performances of the two methods are also compared in terms of the three indicators the related reasons are analyzed based on methods principles furthermore computation time of the two methods is also compared in the section fig 8 illustrates the model performance of fiducial method and swat based on bayesian inference during flood and non flood season of validation period and the entire validation period model sharpness is measured by the average width of pis the sharpness of fiducial method would increase as the nominal coverage is raised as depicted in the fig 8a c for example the sharpness for validation period would be 24 23 m3 s 1 β 0 55 and 30 75 m3 s 1 β 0 65 from the result the sharpness of swat based on bayesian inference would also generally increase as the nominal coverage is raised this can be due to the reason that higher nominal coverage corresponds to wider range of parameter values it is further noticed that the sharpness in flood season is larger than that in non flood season for both methods for example the sharpness of fiducial method in flood and non flood season would be 47 70 m3 s and 19 03 m3 s under the nominal coverage of 0 65 the sharpness of swat based on bayesian inference would be 32 38 m3 s and 16 60 m3 s during the two periods respectively in addition we can see that the sharpness of fiducial method is almost consistent with that of swat based on bayesian inference when the nominal coverage is below 0 55 while the sharpness of fiducial method is much greater than that of swat based on bayesian inference with large nominal coverages these results indicate that the width of the pis obtained with fiducial method is larger than that of swat based on bayesian inference under large nominal coverages this is mainly because candidate points are eliminated with metropolis acceptance probability that are calculated considering likelihood in the process of bayesian inference then bayesian inference constructs a markov chain containing the accepted points that converges to a stationary distribution for fiducial method monthly streamflow data contains extreme values leading to large variance especially in flood season for example the variance of streamflow data are 1053 10 713 96 1654 68 794 47 385 54 in flood season and 8 07 30 30 124 45 130 66 745 94 440 99 14 73 in non flood season respectively the variance for streamflow data is a significant parameter in the function of fiducial to construct pis larger variance would lead to a wider pi reliability bias measures the percentage that the observations fall into the pis from the results of fiducial method depicted in fig 8d the most reliable simulations would be under nominal coverage of 0 45 0 55 or 0 95 which are 0 022 0 02 and 0 022 for the three nominal coverages respectively from the results of swat based on bayesian inference the most reliable simulation would be under nominal coverage of 0 15 0 35 and 0 85 with the reliability bias being 0 094 0 072 and 0 044 respectively from the results of the reliability biases in flood and non flood season fig 8e f the average reliability biases of fiducial method are 0 047 and 0 080 in non flood season and flood season respectively indicating that the performance of reliability bias in non flood season is better than that in flood season this can be due to the reason that fiducial method implements the inference based on information from sample leading to errors in prediction of the extreme values during flood season from the results of swat based on bayesian inference the average reliability biases in non flood season and flood season are 0 196 and 0 102 respectively the result indicates that the performance of reliability bias for swat based on bayesian inference in flood season is better than that in non flood season furthermore when the sharpness of the two methods are almost same under the nominal coverage from 0 15 to 0 55 the reliability bias of fiducial method is closer to 0 than that of swat based on bayesian inference this indicates that fiducial pis can capture more observations with the similar width the results can be explained in two aspects on one hand larger reliability bias of swat based on bayesian inference may be due to the reason that the process based hydrologic modeling involves significant uncertainties in terms of imperfectness of data and model structure inadequacies in the representation of a set of point scale gauges for the entire areal meteorological field as well as systematic and random measurement errors of gauges themselves can lead to errors in hydrological prediction besides deriving from the simplifications of reality in models principles model structural uncertainty can result in simulation inaccuracy especially in modeling of recession process and underground storage fiducial methods require only the information from samples streamflow data they account for valid information of streamflow observation and avoid model uncertainties on the other hand under small sample cases since the information gathered might not be sufficient parameter estimation could be biased attributed to the assumption of prior information bayesian methods need that information to estimate the parameters while fiducial methods do not require the prior information of the given dataset thus the constructed pis are more precise the interval skill score evaluates the model performance by combining the information of sharpness and reliability bias describing the distance between the simulated interval and the observation at each considered quantile an increased score results in a reduced fit of simulation bounds thordarson et al 2012 from the results in fig 8g the interval skill score would increase with raised nominal coverage and the score would rise rapidly when the nominal coverage is greater than 0 75 for example the interval skill score under nominal coverage of 0 15 0 55 and 0 95 would be 37 174 49 5195 152 189 for swat based on bayesian inference and 25 474 35 704 84 637 for fiducial method the results depicted in fig 8h i further notice that both fiducial method and swat based on bayesian inference have higher scores in flood season than those in non flood season furthermore from the results the interval skill score of fiducial method is lower than that of swat based on bayesian inference for example the interval skill score for fiducial method would be 130 912 and 52 075 in flood season and non flood season under the nominal coverage 0 95 while the interval skill score for swat based on bayesian inference would be 209 567 and 111 204 the results of fig 8g i imply that the performance of fiducial method is better under small sample cases considering interval skill score computation time of the two methods is also compared in the study all the experiments are conducted on a machine with intel r core tm cpu i5 7200u 2 50 ghz with 8 gb of ram during the three year validation period the running time is 5 88 s and during prediction period the running time is 25 68 s for fiducial method the running time for swat based on bayesian inference is 4 8 h for all the periods it is obvious that fiducial method is much more time saving than the process based method dream algorithm significantly enhances the applicability of bayesian inference to complex multi modal search problems and increase the speed of convergence by running multiple interacting chains simultaneously using differential evolution however swat based on bayesian inference requires repeated calculations to get the numerical solution 100 000 iterations for each model parameter fiducial methods require only the information from samples so they do not encounter the problem aforementioned the computing times needed for fiducial are usually more than 500 times shorter than those of bayesian ones although the results indicate that fiducial method has better performance than swat based on bayesian inference under small samples cases fiducial method is not proclaimed to be a better solution for hydrology system under small sample cases since the information gathered might not be sufficient parameter estimation could be biased attributed to the assumption of prior information and simulation uncertainties fiducial methods do not require the prior information of the given dataset in addition fiducial methods require only the information from samples streamflow data such that fiducial methods can account for valid information of streamflow observation and avoid model uncertainties that hinder the application of process based method under large sample cases sufficient data information supports investigation of uncertainty sources swat based on bayesian inference cannot only provide an exhaustive exploration of a complex high dimensional parameter space of random variables but also accommodate complex hydrological mechanism such as those with nonlinear effects based on sufficient data information lee et al 2007 laloy et al 2013 4 conclusions in this article fiducial method is firstly applied for hydrological prediction its performance is investigated by comparing with swat based on bayesian inference unlike bayesian and frequentist methods fiducial method performs inverse probability and calculates fiducial interval estimation based on fiducial distribution without calling on prior probability distributions in other words this method does not require tremendous calculations to find the estimates for the unknown parameters the simulation performances of the two methods are compared by using three indicators for entire validation period non flood and flood season of validation period under different quantile levels several findings are revealed as follows i the performance of sharpness for the two methods is basically same under small nominal coverage the sharpness for swat based on bayesian inference is lower than that of fiducial method under large nominal coverages ii the reliability bias of fiducial method is generally closer to zero than that of swat based on bayesian inference during all periods especially fiducial pis can capture more observations with the similar width fiducial method returns more satisfactory results iii prediction performance of fiducial method is more satisfactory than swat based on bayesian inference under small sample cases according to interval skill score iv fiducial method for hydrological prediction is much more time saving than swat based on bayesian inference therefore fiducial method has a great potential to handle hydrological prediction for small sample cases as it produces more satisfactory and time saving results credit authorship

5478,in this work we propose the integration of mechanistic models for eutrophic reservoirs and constructed wetland within a dynamic optimization framework for the optimal design of wetlands for water quality restoration purposes a partial differential equation system results from dynamic mass balances for the main biogeochemical variables in both reservoir and wetland the integrated model is formulated as an optimal control problem within a control vector parameterization approach the optimization model includes wetland areas as design variables and the fractions of tributaries that are diverted through the wetlands as control variables the objective function is the minimization of the sum of the integral of the quadratic difference between total phosphorus concentration and a desired value below eutrophication limits and the integral of the quadratic difference between total nitrogen concentration and a desired value below eutrophication limits along a twelve year time horizon the case of study is the eutrophic paso de las piedras reservoir which supplies drinking water to two cities in argentina and it has two tributaries which run through an important agricultural area in the region numerical results provide a the optimal areas for constructed wetlands next to tributaries b optimal temporal profiles for diverted fraction of tributaries through wetlands and c temporal profiles of the main biogeochemical variables within the lake and the wetlands the integrated model which constitutes a useful management tool for a more rational planning of water quality restoration 1 introduction during the last decades there has been an important increase in the frequency and intensity of harmful cyanobacteria blooms cyanohab on a global scale with documented cyanohabs in at least 108 countries harke et al 2016 this fact is associated with the increased loading of nutrients in freshwater and marine ecosystems from industrial and domestic wastewater as well as agricultural and livestock activities in eutrophic water bodies cyanobacteria can reach very high cell densities in the water column generating several problems that affect public health commercial and sports fishing tourism and recreational activities with significant economic losses around the world sanseverino et al 2016 the most severe problem associated with the development of cyanohabs is the potential production of cyanotoxins being nowadays one of the main environmental and public health concerns human diseases and animal mortality events by cyanohab exposition have been reported around the world epa 2015a annual cost estimations related to eutrophication of u s and england and wales freshwater systems are around us 2 2 billion dodds et al 2009 and us 105 160 million pretty et al 2003 respectively in argentina a meta analysis including data of 70 years records 1945 2015 from 122 water bodies revealed that 74 3 of the cyanohab reported cases exceeded who world health organization alert level 2 for drinking and recreation water 100 000 cells ml 1 ófarrell et al 2019 the first step in the remediation of anthropogenic eutrophication is the reduction or cessation of nutrient loading into lakes and reservoirs this bottom up strategy has been intensively addressed by the construction of wastewater treatment plants for point sources of pollutants coming from industrial and domestic activities however the diffuse nature of the non point sources mainly derived from agricultural and livestock activities makes their management more challenging an approach applied to address this problem is the use of constructed wetlands which are portions of land covered with macrophytes built next to the banks of the tributaries or around the water body to avoid nutrient loading by runoff within the wetlands many physicochemical processes are involved in the reduction of nutrient concentration such as retention and assimilation by macrophytes plankton and other microorganisms and adsorption by the sediments e g langergraber et al 2009 kumar and zhao 2011 ni et al 2018 in the last decades constructed wetlands have become an attractive alternative for wastewater treatment due to their high efficiency productivity and low cost for municipal industrial and agricultural wastewater bioremediation vynazal and brezinivá 2015 constructed wetlands have been applied for water quality restoration in many freshwater systems to address nonpoint source pollution zhao and piccone 2020 experimental analysis of restoration strategies is time consuming and monitoring for long periods has large implementation costs the development of mathematical models supports the evaluation of restoration strategies and management policies gargallo et al 2017 developed a mechanistic biokinetic model for nitrogen removal through constructed wetlands to remediate the eutrophic lake l albufera valencia this tool allowed the understanding of the main mechanisms in nitrogen removal and helped the decision making process for the implementation of restoration strategies recently mayo et al 2018 developed a conceptual numerical model to predict nitrogen removal and nitrogen dynamics in constructed wetland for lake victoria east africa restoration on the other hand mathematical models for lakes and reservoirs have an important role in understanding the behavior of ecosystems under different scenarios and assessing the impact of restoration strategies in this sense many approaches and applications have been studied during the last decades bhagowati and ahamad 2019 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 ofir et al 2017 developed and calibrated a dynamic model to analyze through simulation of different scenarios the impact of biomanipulation in lake kinneret ecosystem fadel et al 2019 calibrated an open access one dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model general lake model aquatic ecodynamics and examined the effect of environmental variables in dynamics and succession of cyanobacteria at karaoun reservoir through simulation of different climatic and hydrological scenarios the calibrated model is a useful tool to identify blooms events their consequences and to evaluate management strategies xiaolin li et al 2019 linked a nutrient model marina and an ecosystem model pclake to quantify nutrients inputs to lake dianchi that cause its eutrophication and identify critical loadings for nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake the final objective was to assist local authorities in formulating and implementing management polices to reduce nutrient pollution in lake dianchi estrada et al 2009a and di maggio et al 2016 proposed rigorous water quality models for freshwater eutrophic bodies which have been calibrated and validated with collected data for an eutrophic reservoir that provides drinking water for two cities in argentina estrada and diaz 2010 performed global sensitivity analysis these water quality models have been formulated as dynamic optimization problems for determination and evaluation of restoration strategies in freshwater bodies estrada et al 2009b estrada et al 2011 di maggio et al 2015 more recently siniscalchi et al 2018 proposed eco hydrological models for brackish lakes as optimal control problems for flooding management in this work we propose the integration of a mechanistic reservoir model with artificial wetland models within a dynamic optimization framework to address the optimal design of constructed wetlands as external remediation tool the novelty of the present manuscript is the integration of these rigorous wetland reservoir models within a dynamic optimization framework to determine both optimal wetland size and optimal temporal profiles of tributary diversion through the wetlands to decrease nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the reservoir the model also provides temporal profiles for the main biogeochemical variables within both the wetland and the reservoirs in a daily basis in this way the proposed model constitutes a useful tool for planning water quality restoration strategies in eutrophicated water bodies the complete integrated model water quality reservoir model constructed wetland models is formulated as an optimal control problem with a control vector parameterization approach in gproms general process modelling system which is an equation oriented framework with extensive capabilities for simulation optimization and advanced parameter estimation of steady state or dynamic highly complex processes psenterprise ltd 2019 numerical results provide optimal areas of the constructed wetlands and profiles for the main variables of the wetlands and the reservoir with and without remediation 2 case

optimization problem is a constrained optimization problem subject to a differential algebraic equation dae system in this kind of problems the control time dependent and design time independent variables constitute the degrees of freedom of the problem whose optimal values are determined by the optimization algorithm the differential equations of the dae system which are imposed as constraints in the optimal control and design problem represent dynamic mass balances for the biogeochemical components of the integrated model wqrm cwm while the algebraic equations represent the generation consumption terms the seasonal forcing functions and the inflow flowrates from the tributaries and their associated nutrient concentrations table 3 shows the dynamic optimization problems formulated to design the optimal wetland size and the tributary diversion fraction temporal profiles as objective function we consider the minimization of the sum of integrals of the square differences between inorganic phosphorus po4 and inorganic nitrogen no3 nh4 concentrations in the water column of the reservoir and a desired value of 0 02 and 0 3 mg l wetzel 1983 respectively the dual nutrient criteria is applied to solve the optimization problem as recommended by epa epa 2015b to avoid negative effects on the downstream ecosystems by altering the n p ratio paerl et al 2016 the objective function φ 1 considers the integral over time to include the entire temporal horizon table 3 degrees of freedom optimization variables of the control problems are the area of the constructed wetlands for el divisorio stream wed and sauce grande river wsg design variables and the fraction of the tributaries diverted to the wetlands f tributary control variables also a path constraint is included to satisfy that the sum of the areas a cw t of both wetlands a cw i does not exceed a quarter of the total area of the reservoir 900 ha to solve the formulated optimal control and design problems a control vector parameterization approach is applied within an equation oriented framework gproms psenterprise ltd 2019 this approach is an efficient methodology for solving dynamic optimization problems since it takes advantage of information on gradients of the objective function and differential algebraic constraints with respect to optimization variables wetlands areas and diverted fraction of the tributaries which are evaluated along the entire time horizon in each integration of the dae system corresponding to each iteration of the outer optimization problem in this way the optimization algorithm can efficiently proceed with the search for directions that minimize the objective function the nonlinear programming nlp problem formulated at the optimization outer level is solved with a successive quadratic programming sqp method within gproms psenterprise ltd 2019 which provides additional efficiency to the entire procedure 4 results and discussion in this work the case study is paso de las piedras reservoir argentina and two potential constructed wetlands integrated to its two tributaries sauce grande river and el divisorio stream after analyzing field data for tributary flowrates and nutrient concentration table 4 the first idea that emerges as reservoir water quality restoration method is to divert out el divisorio stream due to its high nutrient concentration and low flowrate as compared to sauce grande river i e eliminating it as a reservoir tributary by bypassing the lake average daily inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen loading from el divisorio stream are about 36 and 14 of the sauce grande river discharge loading respectively however model simulations of the bypass of el divisorio stream during four years which corresponds to one retention time will cause a fall in the water column mean height from 7 38 m to 5 18 m this numerical result indicates that diverting out el divisorio stream for long periods is not a feasible strategy to decrease nutrient loading as it would increase the risk on the continuous water supply to a population of above 400 000 inhabitants therefore we propose the construction of two wetlands one on each tributary to decrease nutrient loading to the reservoir without decreasing water inflows 4 1 constructed wetland optimal design and control for paso de las piedras reservoir we formulate and solve an optimal control and design problem for two constructed wetlands integrated to a water reservoir as an option to decrease the nutrient loading into this hypereutrophic reservoir paso de las piedras by considering wetland areas as design variables and the diverted fractions of tributaries through the wetlands as control variables as objective function we consider the minimization of the sum of integral of the square difference between inorganic phosphorus po4 and a desired value of 0 02 mg l and the integral of the square difference between inorganic nitrogen no3 nh4 concentrations in the water column of the reservoir a desired value of 0 3 mg l wetzel 1983 respectively throughout a twelve year period numerical results indicate optimal areas of 6 61 and 2 39 km2 for wed and wsg respectively the sum of both areas is the maximum allowed value in the dynamic optimization problem path constraint in table 3 which corresponds to a quarter of the total lake area fig 2 shows phytoplankton a and b orthophosphate c nitrate d concentrations without and after remediation by diverting a fraction of the tributaries along the considered time horizon through constructed wetlands wed and wsg of optimal areas the optimal temporal profiles for tributary diversion fraction through both wetlands are at their upper bound along the entire time horizon taking into account the mean value of the twelfth year considered for restoration orthophosphate concentration in the reservoir decreases 2 92 and organic phosphorus 6 43 regarding nitrogen species the annual mean value decreases 19 4 being the more affected variable after applying the restoration strategy optimal values organic nitrogen decreases 7 71 while ammonium increases 0 76 model results indicate that the application of constructed wetland strategy through a time horizon of 12 years allows the removal of 64 8 34 1 tn of tp and 76 2 of nt 21 tn from el divisorio stream through wed while wsg can remove 46 2 9 8 tn of tp and 64 23 8 tn of tn from the sauce grande river numerical results show a slight decrease in total phytoplankton concentration 1 26 fig 2a associated to the reduction in the external p and n loading fig 2c and d this low reduction in phytoplankton concentration is mainly associated to internal nutrient recycle processes within the water body although nutrient loading is reduced after restoration nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations within the reservoir are still too high to substantially limit phytoplankton growth it must be noted that fig 2b also shows a detail of phytoplankton concentration profile along the twelfth year on a daily basis experimental studies carried out in worldwide freshwater ecosystems showed similar results indicating that nutrient management is required for long term restoration but to obtain results in the short and medium term internal lake strategies such as biomanipulation liu et al 2018 dredging ding et al 2018 and or aeration ashley 2011 are also required a reduction in the loading of tp in 76 and of tn in 14 through a time horizon of 14 years in arresø lake denmark allowed a decrease in chlorophyll and cyanobacteria concentration of 81 and 82 respectively jeppesen et al 2007 on the other hand a reduction of 50 of the tn and 11 of the tp in wuli lake china involved the external constructed wetlands and point source treatment and internal dredging and a fishery elimination techniques application chen et al 2013 after 10 years total phytoplankton biomass decreases considerably but cyanobacteria concentration increased about 29 with respect to the pre restoration level these experimental results show the need to have mathematical models to predict the consequences of the application of one or combined restoration techniques on the structure of the planktonic community and to plan restoration strategies a recent global meta analysis of lakes and coastal marine ecosystems recovery concludes that improvement in water quality through reduction or cessation of anthropogenic nutrients can take over years to decades and depends on multiple factors mccrackin et al 2017 internal loading of p is one of the most important limnological phenomenon reported as recovery delayer søndergaard et al 2007 søndergaard and jeppesen 2007 in previous work estrada et al 2009b estrada et al 2011 water quality improvement applying biomanipulation techniques in paso de las piedras reservoir was addressed through mathematical modeling with promising results on the other hand the application of aeration as a restoration technique did not show any improvement in algal growth control mainly because the reservoir is not stratified fig 3 shows the temporal profiles of the main variables within the hypothetical constructed wetlands wed and wsg macrophytes biomass s bonariensis is harvested when it reachs a maximum of 1 42 kgdw m 2 20 729 mgc l 1 in wed and 0 89 kgdw m 2 20 178 mgc l 1 in wsg

production toyama et al 2018 among others depending on the selected plant species po4 and nh4 concentration are higher in wed with an annual mean value of 0 035 0 01 mg l 1 for po4 and 0 20 0 07 mg l 1 for nh4 wsd shows a mean annual concentration of 0 012 0 003 and 0 16 0 03 for po4 and nh4 respectively nitrate concentrations are close to zero in certain periods along the time horizon minimum value 0 001 mg l 1 we verified this fact with experimental data from an experimental pilot scale wetland siniscalchi 2013 no3 mean concentration shows similar values 0 04 mg l 1 for both wetlands 4 2 optimal control and design problem for a lower nutrient concentration scenario in order to show the usefulness of the dynamic optimization model as a tool for design and planning for drinking water systems management in this section we study the use of constructed wetlands for remediation purposes starting with a hypothetical eutrophic condition lower nutrient concentration for paso de las piedras reservoir we consider the alternative of filtering both tributaries for four years as objective function we used the integral of the minimization of the squared differences between inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations and desired values below eutrophication limits the wetland areas are considered as design variables while the fraction of both tributaries that is derived through the wetlands is defined as the control variables in the optimization problem numerical results fig 4 indicate that optimal wetland areas are of 6 km2 and 3 km2 for wed and wsg respectively fig 4 shows the temporal profiles of total phosphorus a and total nitrogen b within the reservoir without and after restoration after applying the restoration strategy for four years in a eutrophic reservoir the average concentration of orthophosphate and total phosphorus into the lake decreases by 53 with respect to the concentration raised if the strategy is not applied considering nitrate and total nitrogen concentration their reduction into the water body reaches 95 and 90 respectively depletion in nutrient concentration leads to a reduction of 46 for total phytoplankton mean concentration fig 4c and of 18 for cyanobacteria mean concentration fig 4d dynamic behavior of the phytoplankton profile fig 4c shows that solar radiation and temperature are also main seasonal environmental modulators of algae growth optimal profiles for the fraction diverted to the wetlands to prevents increasing of nutrients that are included as control variables in the optimization problem are shown in fig 4e comparison of the results obtained for the hypereutrophic actual conditions section 4 1 and the hypothetical eutrophic conditions for paso de las piedras reservoir highlights the importance of the previous trophic status of the water body to reach significant improvements through the reduction of external nutrients loading 5 conclusions in this work we propose an integrated mechanistic mathematical model for constructed wetlands and a water reservoir within a dynamic optimization framework wetland models take into account macrophyte growth as phosphorus and nitrogen biofilter and the main biogeochemical variables within the artificial ecosystem these models are integrated with a previously developed water quality model for paso de las piedras reservoir estrada et al 2009a b the integration of these models allows the determination of optimal design of the wetlands system taking into account the main water quality variables of both systems simultaneously furthermore this approach gives an insight on the need to apply additional strategies to achieve health recovery of eutrophic water bodies therefore integrated models used with dynamic

restoration 1 introduction during the last decades there has been an important increase in the frequency and intensity of harmful cyanobacteria blooms cyanohab on a global scale with documented cyanohabs in at least 108 countries harke et al 2016 this fact is associated with the increased loading of nutrients in freshwater and marine ecosystems from industrial and domestic wastewater as well as agricultural and livestock activities in eutrophic water bodies cyanobacteria can reach very high cell densities in the water column generating several problems that affect public health commercial and sports fishing tourism and recreational activities with significant economic losses around the world sanseverino et al 2016 the most severe problem associated with the development of cyanohabs is the potential production of cyanotoxins being nowadays one of the main environmental and public health concerns human diseases and animal mortality events by cyanohab exposition have been reported around the world epa 2015a annual cost estimations related to eutrophication of u s and england and wales freshwater systems are around us 2 2 billion dodds et al 2009 and us 105 160 million pretty et al 2003 respectively in argentina a meta analysis including data of 70 years records 1945 2015 from 122 water bodies revealed that 74 3 of the cyanohab reported cases exceeded who world health organization alert level 2 for drinking and recreation water 100 000 cells ml 1 ófarrell et al 2019 the first step in the remediation of anthropogenic eutrophication is the reduction or cessation of nutrient loading into lakes and reservoirs this bottom up strategy has been intensively addressed by the construction of wastewater treatment plants for point sources of pollutants coming from industrial and domestic activities however the diffuse nature of the non point sources mainly derived from agricultural and livestock activities makes their management more challenging an approach applied to address this problem is the use of constructed wetlands which are portions of land covered with macrophytes built next to the banks of the tributaries or around the water body to avoid nutrient loading by runoff within the wetlands many physicochemical processes are involved in the reduction of nutrient concentration such as retention and assimilation by macrophytes plankton and other microorganisms and adsorption by the sediments e g langergraber et al 2009 kumar and zhao 2011 ni et al 2018 in the last decades constructed wetlands have become an attractive alternative for wastewater treatment due to their high efficiency productivity and low cost for municipal industrial and agricultural wastewater bioremediation vynazal and brezinivá 2015 constructed wetlands have been applied for water quality restoration in many freshwater systems to address nonpoint source pollution zhao and piccone 2020 experimental analysis of restoration strategies is time consuming and

developed a mechanistic biokinetic model for nitrogen removal through constructed wetlands to remediate the eutrophic lake l albufera valencia this tool allowed the understanding of the main mechanisms in nitrogen removal and helped the decision making process for the implementation of restoration strategies recently mayo et al 2018 developed a conceptual numerical model to predict nitrogen removal and nitrogen dynamics in constructed wetland for lake victoria east africa restoration on the other hand mathematical models for lakes and reservoirs have an important role in understanding the behavior of ecosystems under different scenarios and assessing the impact of restoration strategies in this sense many approaches and applications have been studied during the last decades bhagowati and ahamad 2019 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 ofir et al 2017 developed and calibrated a dynamic model to analyze through simulation of different scenarios the impact of biomanipulation in lake kinneret ecosystem fadel et al 2019 calibrated an open access one dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model general lake model aquatic ecodynamics and examined the effect of

calibrated and validated with collected data for an eutrophic reservoir that provides drinking water for two cities in argentina estrada and diaz 2010 performed global sensitivity analysis these water quality models have been formulated as dynamic optimization problems for determination and evaluation of restoration strategies in freshwater bodies estrada et al 2009b estrada et al 2011 di maggio et

mechanistic reservoir model with artificial wetland models within a dynamic optimization framework to address the optimal design of constructed wetlands as external remediation tool the novelty of the present manuscript is the integration of these rigorous wetland reservoir models within a dynamic optimization framework to determine both optimal wetland size and optimal temporal profiles of tributary diversion through the wetlands to decrease nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the reservoir the model also provides temporal profiles for the main biogeochemical variables within both the wetland and the reservoirs in a daily basis in this way the proposed model constitutes a useful tool for planning water quality restoration strategies in eutrophicated water bodies the complete

optimization problem is a constrained optimization problem subject to a differential algebraic equation dae system in this kind of problems the control time dependent and design time independent variables constitute the degrees of freedom of the problem whose optimal values are determined by the optimization algorithm the differential equations of the dae system which are imposed as constraints in the optimal control and design problem represent dynamic mass balances for the biogeochemical components of the integrated model wqrm cwm while the algebraic equations represent the generation consumption terms the seasonal forcing functions and the inflow flowrates from the tributaries and their associated nutrient concentrations table 3 shows the dynamic optimization problems formulated to design the optimal wetland size and the tributary diversion fraction temporal profiles as objective function we consider the minimization of the sum of integrals of the square differences between inorganic phosphorus po4 and inorganic nitrogen no3 nh4 concentrations in the water column of the reservoir and a desired value of 0 02 and 0 3 mg l wetzel 1983 respectively the dual nutrient criteria is applied to solve the optimization problem as recommended by epa epa 2015b to avoid negative effects on the downstream ecosystems by altering the n p ratio paerl et al 2016 the objective function φ 1 considers the integral over time to include the entire temporal horizon table 3 degrees of freedom optimization variables of the control problems are the area of the constructed wetlands for el divisorio stream wed and sauce grande river wsg design variables and the fraction of the tributaries diverted to the wetlands f tributary control variables also a path constraint is included to satisfy that the sum of the areas a cw t of both wetlands a cw i does not exceed a quarter of the total area of the reservoir 900 ha to solve the formulated optimal control and design problems a control vector parameterization approach is applied within an equation oriented framework gproms psenterprise ltd 2019 this approach is an efficient methodology for solving dynamic optimization problems since it takes advantage of information on gradients of the objective function and differential algebraic constraints with respect to optimization variables wetlands areas and diverted fraction of the tributaries which are evaluated along the entire time horizon in each integration of the dae system corresponding to each iteration of the outer optimization problem in this way the optimization algorithm can efficiently proceed with the search for directions that minimize the objective function the nonlinear programming nlp problem formulated at the optimization outer level is solved with a successive quadratic programming sqp method within gproms psenterprise ltd 2019 which provides additional efficiency to the entire procedure 4 results and discussion in this work the case study is paso de las piedras reservoir argentina and two potential constructed wetlands integrated to its two tributaries sauce grande river and el divisorio stream after analyzing field data for tributary flowrates and nutrient concentration table 4 the first idea that emerges as reservoir water quality restoration method is to divert out el divisorio stream due to its high nutrient concentration and low flowrate as compared to sauce grande river i e eliminating it as a reservoir tributary by bypassing the lake average daily inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen loading from el divisorio stream are about 36 and 14 of the sauce grande river discharge loading respectively however model simulations of the bypass of el divisorio stream during four years which corresponds to one retention time will cause a fall in the water column mean height from 7 38 m to 5 18 m this numerical result indicates that diverting out el divisorio stream for long periods is not a feasible strategy to decrease nutrient loading as it would increase the risk on the continuous water supply to a population of above 400 000 inhabitants therefore we propose the construction of two wetlands one on each tributary to decrease nutrient loading to the reservoir without decreasing water inflows 4 1 constructed wetland optimal design and control for paso de las piedras reservoir we formulate and solve an optimal control and design problem for two constructed wetlands integrated to a water reservoir as an option to decrease the nutrient loading into this hypereutrophic reservoir paso de las piedras by considering wetland areas as design variables and the diverted fractions of tributaries through the wetlands as control variables as objective function we consider the minimization of the sum of integral of the square difference between inorganic phosphorus po4 and a desired value of 0 02 mg l and the integral of the square difference between inorganic nitrogen no3 nh4 concentrations in the water column of the reservoir a desired value of 0 3 mg l wetzel 1983 respectively throughout a twelve year period numerical results indicate optimal areas of 6 61 and 2 39 km2 for wed and wsg respectively the sum of both areas is the maximum allowed value in the dynamic optimization problem path constraint in table 3 which corresponds to a quarter of the total lake area fig 2 shows phytoplankton a and b orthophosphate c nitrate d concentrations without and after remediation by diverting a fraction of the tributaries along the considered time horizon through constructed wetlands wed and wsg of optimal areas the optimal temporal profiles for tributary diversion fraction through both wetlands are at their upper bound along the entire time horizon taking into account the mean value of the twelfth year considered for restoration orthophosphate concentration in the reservoir decreases 2 92 and organic phosphorus 6 43 regarding nitrogen species the annual mean value decreases 19 4 being the more affected variable after applying the restoration strategy optimal values organic nitrogen decreases 7 71 while ammonium increases 0 76 model results indicate that the application of constructed wetland strategy through a time horizon of 12 years allows the removal of 64 8 34 1 tn of tp and 76 2 of nt 21 tn from el divisorio stream through wed while wsg can remove 46 2 9 8 tn of tp and 64 23 8 tn of tn from the sauce grande river numerical results show a slight decrease in total phytoplankton concentration 1 26 fig 2a associated to the reduction in the external p and n loading fig 2c and d this low reduction in phytoplankton concentration is mainly associated to internal nutrient recycle processes within the water body although nutrient loading is reduced after restoration nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations within the reservoir are still too high to substantially limit phytoplankton growth it must be noted that fig 2b also shows a detail of phytoplankton concentration profile along the twelfth year on a daily basis experimental studies carried out in worldwide freshwater ecosystems showed similar results indicating that nutrient management is required for long term restoration but to obtain results in the short and medium term internal lake strategies such as biomanipulation liu et al 2018 dredging ding et al 2018 and or aeration ashley 2011 are also required a reduction in the loading of tp in 76 and of tn in 14 through a time horizon of 14 years in arresø lake denmark allowed a decrease in chlorophyll and cyanobacteria concentration of 81 and 82 respectively jeppesen et al 2007 on the other hand a reduction of 50 of the tn and 11 of the tp in wuli lake china involved the external constructed wetlands and point source treatment and internal dredging and a fishery elimination techniques application chen et al 2013 after 10 years total phytoplankton biomass decreases considerably but cyanobacteria concentration increased about 29 with respect to the pre restoration level these experimental results show the need to have mathematical models to predict the consequences of the application of one or combined restoration techniques on the structure of the planktonic community and to plan restoration strategies a recent global meta analysis of lakes and coastal marine ecosystems recovery concludes that improvement in water quality through reduction or cessation of anthropogenic nutrients can take over years to decades and depends on multiple factors mccrackin et al 2017 internal loading of p is one of the most important limnological phenomenon reported as recovery delayer søndergaard et al 2007 søndergaard and jeppesen 2007 in previous work estrada et al 2009b estrada et al 2011 water quality improvement applying biomanipulation techniques in paso de las piedras reservoir was addressed through mathematical modeling with promising results on the other hand the application of aeration as a restoration technique did not show any improvement in algal growth control mainly because the reservoir is not stratified fig 3 shows the temporal profiles of the main variables within the hypothetical constructed wetlands wed and wsg macrophytes biomass s bonariensis is harvested when it reachs a maximum of 1 42 kgdw m 2 20 729 mgc l 1 in wed and 0 89 kgdw m 2 20 178 mgc l 1 in wsg

production toyama et al 2018 among others depending on the selected plant species po4 and nh4 concentration are higher in wed with an annual mean value of 0 035 0 01 mg l 1 for po4 and 0 20 0 07 mg l 1 for nh4 wsd shows a mean annual concentration of 0 012 0 003 and 0 16 0 03 for po4 and nh4 respectively nitrate concentrations are close to zero in certain periods along the time horizon minimum value 0 001 mg l 1 we verified this fact with experimental data from an experimental pilot scale wetland siniscalchi 2013 no3 mean concentration shows similar values 0 04 mg l 1 for both wetlands 4 2 optimal control and design problem for a lower nutrient concentration scenario in order to show the usefulness of the dynamic optimization model as a tool for design and planning for drinking water systems management in this section we study the use of constructed wetlands for remediation purposes starting with a hypothetical eutrophic condition lower nutrient concentration for paso de las piedras reservoir we consider the alternative of filtering both tributaries for four years as objective function we used the integral of the minimization of the squared differences between inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations and desired values below eutrophication limits the wetland areas are considered as design variables while the fraction of both tributaries that is derived through the wetlands is defined as the control variables in the optimization problem numerical results fig 4 indicate that optimal wetland areas are of 6 km2 and 3 km2 for wed and wsg respectively fig 4 shows the temporal profiles of total phosphorus a and total nitrogen b within the reservoir without and after restoration after applying the restoration strategy for four years in a eutrophic reservoir the average concentration of orthophosphate and total phosphorus into the lake decreases by 53 with respect to the concentration raised if the strategy is not applied considering nitrate and total nitrogen concentration their reduction into the water body reaches 95 and 90 respectively depletion in nutrient concentration leads to a reduction of 46 for total phytoplankton mean concentration fig 4c and of 18 for cyanobacteria mean concentration fig 4d dynamic behavior of the phytoplankton profile fig 4c shows that solar radiation and temperature are also main seasonal environmental modulators of algae growth optimal profiles for the fraction diverted to the wetlands to prevents increasing of nutrients that are included as control variables in the optimization problem are shown in fig 4e comparison of the results obtained for the hypereutrophic actual conditions section 4 1 and the hypothetical eutrophic conditions for paso de las piedras reservoir highlights the importance of the previous trophic status of the water body to reach significant improvements through the reduction of external nutrients loading 5 conclusions in this work we propose an integrated mechanistic mathematical model for constructed wetlands and a water reservoir within a dynamic optimization framework wetland models take into account macrophyte growth as phosphorus and nitrogen biofilter and the main biogeochemical variables within the artificial ecosystem these models are integrated with a previously developed water quality model for paso de las piedras reservoir estrada et al 2009a b the integration of these models allows the determination of optimal design of the wetlands system taking into account the main water quality variables of both systems simultaneously furthermore this approach gives an insight on the need to apply additional strategies to achieve health recovery of eutrophic water bodies therefore integrated models used with dynamic optimization approaches are powerful management tools for a more rational planning of internal and external coordinated strategies for water quality restoration declaration of competing interest the

5479,previous studies of the impact of sea level rise on seawater intrusion slr swi are mostly based on horizontal coastal aquifers despite that most coastal aquifers are sloping a recent study has shown that the effect of aquifer slope can not be neglected when assessing slr swi in unconfined coastal aquifers however the effect of slope in confined aquifers has not been evaluated in this study we apply existing analytical solutions to quantify the effect of the slope of both upper and lower confining layers on slr swi the results show that for flux controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems slr does not change the steady state interface location consistent with previous findings for horizontal aquifers therefore our analysis focuses on head controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems for which we find the assumption of horizontal confining units causes significant errors we demonstrate this by assessing the sensitivities of the seawater toe location and seawater volume to slr for various combinations of sloping confining layers the results indicate that the influence of the slope on slr swi is small in thin confined aquifers however the slope is an important factor in thick confined aquifers the influence of the slope in the lower confining layer on slr swi is much greater than that of the upper confining layer aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to slr swi whereas those that thin towards inland are least susceptible the assessment of slr swi in sloping confined coastal aquifers in the current study demonstrates application of a rapid first order assessment tool that can be applied to a wide range of other sloping coastal confined aquifer problems keywords seawater intrusion sea level rise sloping confined aquifer analytical solution 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi occurs when seawater encroaches into the freshwater region of a coastal aquifer and has long been considered a global issue bear et al 1999 the seawater contamination of freshwater limits groundwater pumping in coastal areas lacombe and carleton 1992 werner et al 2011 and may lead to the salinization of agricultural lands coastal soils and ecosystems werner et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 the impacts of swi are difficult to remediate and may arise from various causal factors and therefore it is critical to properly conceptualize and quantify the extent of swi the two causes of swi that have been the focus of most previous studies include the over pumping of coastal aquifers leading to regional scale drawdown e g werner and gallagher 2006 post et al 2019 and sea level rise slr due to climate change e g werner and simmons 2009 werner et al 2012 lu et al 2013 2015 in light of ipcc 2013 projections of slr of up to 0 82 m by 2100 it is important to develop reliable tools for estimating slr induced swi slr swi in the remainder while slr swi in horizontal aquifers has been widely studied slr swi in sloping confined aquifers remains an important knowledge gap werner et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 methods applied to studies of slr swi include numerical simulation e g watson et al 2010 chang et al 2011 morgan et al 2015 and analytical approaches e g werner and simmons 2009 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lu et al 2015 there is also a limited number of articles that use experimental methods e g morgan et al 2013 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 numerical simulation allows for the investigation of transient dispersive swi in heterogeneous aquifers and the assessment of mixing zone widths and seawater circulation rates e g webb and howard 2011 badaruddin et al 2017 while numerical methods offer greater flexibility in the range of situations that can be evaluated analytical solutions are more computationally efficient and reveal interrelationships between parameters and the seawater extent without the need for high numerical burden albeit analytical solutions apply to restricted coastal aquifer situations e g steady state immiscible freshwater seawater interactions etc analytical solutions facilitate rapid evaluation of the seawater extent in coastal aquifers and are useful first order assessment tools that are routinely used by practitioners to obtain initial estimates of the scale of swi e g beebe et al 2016 knight et al 2018 werner and simmons 2009 explored slr swi using the theory developed by strack 1976 which assumes steady state non dispersive conditions and the dupuit forchheimer approximation dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 thereby neglecting the resistance to groundwater flow in the vertical direction they considered isotropic homogeneous horizontal unconfined aquifers with uniform recharge and adopted two alternative inland boundary conditions i e head controlled and flux controlled head controlled conditions are those where the head at the inland boundary is fixed i e despite slr whereas the groundwater discharge at the inland boundary is fixed under flux controlled conditions werner and simmons 2009 the results showed that slr induces larger landward shifts in the toe i e 100 s of meters in head controlled systems whereas flux controlled conditions lead to slr swi of up to 50 m for typical aquifer conditions notwithstanding surface overtopping impacts werner et al 2012 adopted a similar theory to that of werner and simmons 2009 to study swi vulnerability using derivative equations they included confined aquifers and developed equations for the seawater volume in the aquifer and found that slr does not exacerbate swi in flux controlled confined aquifers only a handful of previous theoretical analyses of swi consider sloping aquifers for example koussis et al 2012 used the theory of strack 1976 to provide a solution to steady state interface flow in sloping unconfined aquifers with uniform recharge and a freshwater collector trough i e a line sink or well gallery parallel to the coast their analytical solutions for the discharge head interface position and toe location were derived by approximating a linearized hydraulic potential due to gravity they demonstrated the practicality of the analytical solutions through application to the akrotiri coastal aquifer cyprus showing that the toe location was much more sensitive to sea level than to recharge change subsequently mazi et al 2013 extended the analytical solutions of koussis et al 2012 to assess slr swi in both flux controlled and head controlled sloping unconfined aquifers their results showed high nonlinearities in the form of thresholds in aquifer depth sea level change and minimum submarine discharge or hydraulic head beyond which swi would increase abruptly consistent with observations by werner et al 2012 for horizontal aquifers more recently ketabchi et al 2016 evaluated slr swi in unconfined aquifers including the effects of land surface inundation lsi land surface slope aquifer bed slope and inland boundary condition i e flux and head controlled using both numerical and analytical approaches among these controlling factors they found that fresh groundwater discharge to the sea and the recharge rate were the main controlling factors for seawater toe location whereas the aquifer bed slope and the freshwater seawater density difference produced the lowest sensitivities for both inland boundary condition types lu et al 2016 developed analytical solutions for the steady state location of a sharp interface between freshwater and seawater for both sloping confined and unconfined aquifers both constant head and constant flux inland boundary conditions were considered the method adopted by lu et al 2016 differs from the single potential method used in koussis et al 2012 in that lu et al 2016 solve for the interface location by applying continuity of head and flux at the toe location where the freshwater only zone connects to the interface zone i e the region where freshwater flows above seawater the analytical solutions for sloping unconfined aquifers developed by lu et al 2016 reproduced the solution of koussis et al 2012 more importantly lu et al 2016 found that in flux controlled coastal systems the geometry of the aquifer bottom has little influence on the shape of the interface and primarily controls the location of the interface toe analytical solutions for coastal confined aquifers can be categorized according to the representation of the ocean boundary condition that is the aquifer may be truncated at the shoreline e g strack 1976 1989 werner et al 2012 or the offshore part of the aquifer may be considered e g bakker 2006 bakker et al 2017 werner and robinson 2018 the first ocean boundary type is valid only for shallow confined aquifers that presumably have a minimal offshore freshwater extent the second type presumes that freshwater in the confined aquifer continues offshore until upward leakage accounts for freshwater discharge to the submarine aquifer or until some geomorphological control e g a fault the overlying aquitard is eroded away or the aquifer is exposed at the continental shelf brings the confined aquifer into connection with the sea e g morgan et al 2018 post et al 2013 demonstrated that vast meteoric groundwater reserves occur beneath the sea floor and therefore offshore confined aquifers are thought to be a common global phenomenon studies of offshore aquifers by bakker 2006 bakker et al 2017 and werner and robinson 2018 presume that the aquifer extent beneath the sea is bounded on top by a leaky overlying aquitard separating the sea from the aquifer bakker 2006 showed that four situations arise requiring separate analytical solutions distinguished by the position of the interface tip i e whether or not it reaches the offshore boundary and the toe whether it is onshore or offshore here the tip is the location where the top of the aquifer intercepts the interface werner and robinson 2018 corrected bakker s 2006 solution so that aquitards contain freshwater where they overly offshore aquifers also containing freshwater the aforementioned studies of confined aquifers in coastal areas are based on the assumption of horizontal aquifers it is not clear how the slope of confined coastal aquifers will affect slr swi although previous studies have explored the effect of the slope of the base of unconfined aquifers on swi e g koussis et al 2012 mazi et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 thereby providing an initial insight into the influence of sloping lower confining units the focus of this study is to assess for the first time the influence of slr on both the toe location and seawater volume in sloping confined aquifers analytical solutions for seawater volume in sloping confined aquifers are obtained using the sloping aquifer theory of lu et al 2016 the sensitivity of swi slr to key controlling parameters is evaluated for various combinations of sloping confining units 2 conceptual model in this study we consider two types of homogeneous confined coastal aquifers 1 shallow confined aquifers truncated at the shoreline and 2 deeper confined aquifers that extend offshore where they are overlain by an impervious layer this differs from offshore aquifer studies that adopt leaky offshore aquitards e g bakker 2006 solórzano rivas and werner 2018 werner and robinson 2018 in that we ignore distributed upward leakage to the sea the conceptual models adopted in the current analysis are shown in fig 1 in the following analysis slr swi is quantified as the change in steady state position of the freshwater seawater interface following previous studies e g werner et al 2012 three forms of sloping confined coastal aquifers are considered these differ depending on the slope of the upper and lower confining layers relative to each other namely i upper and lower confining layers are parallel ii one confining layer is sloping and the other is horizontal and iii both confining layers are sloping but are not parallel the madras aquifer in india is a typical sloping aquifer with confining layers that are not parallel sherif and singh 1999 fig 2 illustrates the various combinations arising from different slopes positive horizontal and negative of the upper and lower confining layers namely cases a to m the analytical method applied in assessing slr swi in confined aquifers is an extension to that of lu et al 2016 they developed solutions for sloping aquifers both unconfined and confined considering both flux controlled and head controlled inland boundary conditions their method requires the following assumptions 1 the system is in steady state 2 freshwater and seawater are immiscible and separated by an interface 3 the confined aquifer is isotropic and homogeneous 4 only horizontal flow is considered and the flow of seawater is neglected and 5 confining units are impermeable fig 3 illustrates the parameters that accompany the general conceptual model from which various cases shown in fig 2 can be derived in this conceptual model the origin of the coordinate system is located at the aquifer base and the seaward termination of the aquifer whether this is at the shoreline or offshore note that a vertical coastal boundary other than a sloping coastal boundary is considered in fig 3 which does not change the steady state freshwater seawater interface position the interface height z l is related to the hydraulic head ϕ l based on the so called ghyben herzberg relation badon ghyben and drabbe 1888 herzberg 1901 1 z α ϕ h s h s where h s l is the sea level height above the aquifer base fig 3 and α is the dimensionless density ratio α ρ f ρ s ρ f with ρ f and ρ s m l3 the respective freshwater and seawater densities α 40 is used in this study other relevant variables shown in fig 3 include the inclination of the upper and lower confining layers at angles β 1 and β 2 rad respectively the angles β 1 and β 2 are positive negative where the slope is rising falling in the inland direction h l is the vertical thickness at the seaward termination of the confined aquifer q f l2 t is the freshwater flux from inland per unit coastline length and h l l is the hydraulic head at the inland boundary which is located at a distance l l from the seaward termination of the confined aquifer x t and z t l represent the abscissa and ordinate of the toe position of the interface respectively by specifying one of q f or h l at the inland boundary solutions are obtained for flux controlled or head controlled conditions respectively in head controlled systems the freshwater flux after slr is q f l2 t otherwise under flux controlled systems q f remains unchanged despite slr similarly h l l is the new head value at the inland boundary following slr in flux controlled systems 3 analytical solutions of seawater volume in sloping confined aquifers 3 1 interface toe and seawater volume analytical solutions for the distribution of the freshwater seawater interface and the location of the toe based on the sloping aquifer theory of lu et al 2016 are provided in appendix a by assuming a freshwater seawater sharp interface mixing between the two water bodies is neglected when deriving analytical solutions which results in an overestimate of seawater intrusion improved solutions could be obtained by considering a correction factor lu and werner 2013 lu et al 2016 though they are not adopted in the current study analytical solutions can be further improved by considering the freshwater outflow gap which has been adopted to correct analytical solutions by koussis et al 2015 and koussis and mazi 2018 both flux controlled and head controlled inland boundary conditions are considered at least initially these solutions are used to obtain relationships for the seawater volume v sw l2 as given below the theory in appendix a shows that solutions for the interface i e eqs a5 and a12 and the toe location x t i e eqs a8 a10 a13 and a14 are independent of the sea level height h s under flux controlled conditions in other words there is no slr swi in flux controlled sloping confined coastal aquifers this is consistent with previous findings for horizontal confined coastal aquifers e g werner et al 2012 conversely in situations where the inland head is constant the toe position of the interface shifts landward in response to slr therefore we consider only head controlled settings in the analyses that follow solutions for x t are given in appendix a for each of the three confining unit cases see fig 2 for confining unit case i i e β 1 β 2 x t is determined by eqs a20 for case a and a22 for cases b and c for confining unit case ii i e β 1 0 β 2 0 or β 1 0 β 2 0 x t is assessed using eqs a26 for cases d and e and a28 for cases f and g while for confining unit case iii i e β 1 0 β 2 0 and β 1 β 2 x t is obtained from eq a29 for cases h to m the toe location after slr denoted as x t l is obtained by replacing h s with h s h s δh s where δh s l is slr slr swi is quantified as the shift in steady state toe location i e δx t x t x t in a similar manner to previous studies e g werner and simmons 2009 it is noteworthy that the expression for x t in eq a20 as well as eqs a22 a26 a28 and a29 is independent of the hydraulic conductivity k l t which is consistent with the solution for head controlled confined aquifers given by lu et al 2015 whereas werner et al 2012 include k in their expression of slr swi in head controlled systems we replace q f with an expression containing h l e g eq a19 which results in the elimination of k in eq a20 and other subsequent expressions the volume of seawater v sw in the coastal aquifer was determined from various interface equations described above for case a β 1 β 2 0 fig 2 a horizontal confined aquifer the seawater volume is given by 2 v sw a ε 0 h k z h 2 2 α q f d z here the superscript a of v sw a l2 is used to identify the case ε is

propensity for swi to occur in response to slr werner et al 2012 that is derivative equations are obtained based on the analytical solutions of the previous subsection as undertaken by werner et al 2012 for horizontal aquifers the propensity for slr to cause a landward shift in the toe is represented by x t h s while slr induced increase in the seawater volume in the aquifer is represented by v sw h s x t h s equations are obtained by differentiating eqs a20 a22 a26 a28 and a29 with respect to h s and these are given in table 1 equations for v sw h s are obtained by differentiating eqs 3 5 8 12 and 16 as shown in table 2 three parameter sets pertaining to confined coastal aquifers described by knight et al 2018 are used to investigate swi sensitivities as given in table 3 note that k is omitted from table 3 because it is inconsequential using the theory developed in the previous section knight et al 2018 adopted simplified representations of these aquifers including the assumption of horizontalness which allowed for the application of the analytical solution of werner and robinson 2018 however according to pauw et al 2017 haider et al 2015 and kaleris et al 2002 these aquifers are sloping in the interests of testing different combinations of sloping confining units we modify the aquifer parameters used by knight et al 2018 by applying various confining aquifer slopes namely values of tanβ 1 and tanβ 2 ranging from 0 001 to 0 001 were tested in doing so slr swi is assessed in hypothetical variations i e various hypothetical aquifer slopes of these three field cases the extent of slr swi under the influence of sloping confining layers was compared with results obtained from the assumption of horizontal confining units to provide guidance on the effect of slope on seawater extent and volume 4 results and discussion fig 4 illustrates the sensitivities of swi to sea level height x t h s and v sw h s in the three regional aquifers listed in table 3 assuming values of tanβ 1 and tanβ 2 ranging from 0 001 to 0 001 the three cases produce toe and volume sensitivities x t h s and v sw h s that range over two orders of magnitude with case 3 leading to the largest slr swi sensitivities the results show that the slopes of both upper and lower confining layers affect slr swi in all cases although in case 3 fig 4c1 and c2 swi is almost insensitive to tanβ 1 and only minor changes in v sw h s are obtained when tanβ 2 is modified in case 1 fig 4a2 maximum values of x t h s and v sw h s occur at different combinations of tanβ 1 and tanβ 2 for the three cases that is in case 1 fig 4a1 and a2 x t h s and v sw h s have maximum values at tanβ 1 tanβ 2 0 001 whereas in case 2 fig 4b1 and b2 maximum values of x t h s and v sw h s appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 and in case 3 fig 4c1 and c2 maximum values appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 logarithmic sensitivities of slr swi kabala 2001 werner et al 2012 given by x t h s h s x t and v sw h s h s v sw are obtained for the three previous cases as illustrated in fig 5 in all three cases logarithmic sensitivities have maximum values at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 and minimum values at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 for both toe and seawater volume this differs from the results for linear sensitivities fig 4 for which minimum and maximum values of x t h s and v sw h s varied between the cases results from fig 5 indicate that confined aquifers that increase in thickness in the landward direction are most susceptible to slr swi whereas those that thin in the landward direction are least susceptible to slr swi the lower swi in aquifers that contract in the landward direction is the intuitive result of the reduced area of aquifer available for the invasion of seawater in thinning aquifers case 3 again produces the largest slr swi logarithmic sensitivities the results also indicate that logarithmic sensitivities of v sw are higher than those of x t for all three cases the results of fig 5 are extended to explore the effect of the thickness of a sloping aquifer on slr swi using modified parameters from case 2 both linear and logarithmic sensitivities are assessed that is x t h s v sw h s x t h s h s x t and v sw h s h s v sw are obtained from parameters sets for case 2 except with aquifer thicknesses of 80 m 120 m and 160 m h 40 m in the unmodified form of case 2 the results are shown in fig 6 illustrating that both linear and logarithmic sensitivities are higher in thicker aquifers note that the highest sensitivities in figs 4 and 5 were also obtained for the thickest aquifer case 3 consistent with the results in fig 5 maximum values of logarithmic sensitivities appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 and minimum values appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 these results indicate that the effect of confining layer slope on x t h s and v sw h s is modified by aquifer thickness whereby slr swi is more sensitive to the slope of lower boundary tanβ 2 in thicker aquifers fig 6c1 to c4 the relationship between thickness confining layer slope and slr swi was further evaluated by calculating both linear and logarithmic sensitivities for all three cases see table 3 with modified aquifer thicknesses h 40 m h 80 m and 120 m as shown in fig 7 nine slope cases were considered these being combinations of tanβ 1 0 001 0 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 0 0 001 consistent with cases a to i see fig 2 in fig 7 changes in aquifer thickness h causes larger variations in both linear and logarithmic sensitivities compared to the variations attributable to changes in confining layer slope this means that the effect of aquifer thickness on slr swi is greater than that of confining layer slope at least for the thicknesses and slopes considered for h 40 m the slr swi linear and logarithmic sensitivities are almost the same in all nine slope cases a to i whereas greater differences between slope cases are apparent with h 120 m this indicates that the slope of confining layers has a more significant effect on slr swi in thicker confined aquifers the large differences in sensitivities between cases 1 2 and 3 with h 120 m compare to the small differences between cases 1 2 and 3 with h 40 m suggest that the variables related to hydraulic gradient i e h s h l and l are also more influential in assessing slr swi relative to the confining layer slope in thick confined aquifers in addition to slr we assessed the effect on swi of inland head changes which produce sensitivities that are negatively signed relative to those that arise from slr for the intuitive reason that a rise in inland head acts to oppose swi compared to increasing swi with rising sea level derivative equations for the change in toe location and seawater volume with inland head variation i e x t h l and v sw h l respectively are attainable using similar methods to those outlined in appendix a these produce the following simple relationships 17 x t h l α 1 α x t h s 18 v sw h l α 1 α v sw h s here α 1 α is approximately 0 976 if typical seawater and freshwater densities are used therefore the logarithmic sensitivities of swi to inland head can be obtained 19 x t h l h l x t α 1 α x t h s h l x t 20 v sw h l h l v sw α 1 α v sw h s h l v sw to investigate the effect on sensitivities of slr swi in sloping confined aquifers of differences in sea level h s and inland head h l we calculated both linear and logarithmic sensitivities for cases 1 and 2 i e and the nine slope cases by keeping the head difference h s h l the same but with modified h s and h l as shown in fig 8 the results show that for case 1 higher h s and h l h s 150 m and h l 154 m produce larger values of linear and logarithmic sensitivities however the head difference h s h l had a stronger effect on slr swi relative to the component head values this indicates that the effect of confining layer slope on slr swi sensitivities is related to both h s and h l for a given hydraulic gradient and the difference between them for small values of h s h l changes to h s and h l have a greater effect on the sensitivities of slr swi in sloping confined aquifer the effect of head difference h s h l aquifer length l and the head gradient h s h l l on slr swi in sloping confined aquifers was examined using a similar approach to that described above namely logarithmic sensitivities were obtained for all three cases except with h s h l l values of 0 002 as shown in fig 9 note that this specific head gradient can be obtained by two methods changing the aquifer length or the head difference as listed in tables 4 and 5 see appendix b in fig 9 for scenarios where h s h l l is equal cases with small h l and l have higher logarithmic sensitivities hollow green symbols versus hollow purple symbols when h s h l is equal the logarithmic sensitivity for each slope case is almost the same hollow yellow symbols versus hollow purple symbols cases 1a and 1c cases 2a and 2c cases 3a and 3c especially for horizontal aquifers case a see tables 4 and 5 in appendix b the value of slr swi logarithmic sensitivities for cases 1a and 1c or cases 2a and 2c cases 3a and 3c is equal for horizontal aquifers the logarithmic sensitivities of slr swi are independent of aquifer length l since l will be eliminated in the analytical solutions of x t h s h s x t and v sw h s h s v sw according to the partial derivative equations of x t h s and v sw h s for case a see tables 1 and 2 this result indicates that the magnitude of logarithmic sensitivities is dependent on the head difference h s h l compared with the variation of logarithmic sensitivities caused by the changes of head difference the variation caused by the changes of confining layer slope is smaller but the effect of sloping confining layers on logarithmic sensitivities of slr swi in thicker aquifers is amplified case 3 5 conclusions the application and extension of lu et al s 2016 theory allows for an assessment of slr swi in sloping confined aquifers considering the different combinations of upper and lower sloping impervious layers analytical solutions of seawater volume and interface toe location in confined aquifers of differing slope are given to explore the effect of key controlling parameters on slr swi the sensitivities of interface toe location and seawater volume to sea level height in sloping confined aquifer were calculated with parameters of three regional cases with modifications to allow for sensitivities to be tested the specific findings are as follows 1 slope is an important factor particularly in thick confined aquifers and especially for the lower confining layer for which the impact of the slope on slr induced swi is much greater than that of the upper confining layer 2 confined aquifers that increase in thickness in the landward direction are most susceptible to slr swi whereas those that thin in the landward direction are least susceptible to slr swi 3 the effect of slope on sensitivities of slr swi is dependent on h h s h l and h s h l except for equal h s h l aquifers where the logarithmic sensitivity of slr swi for each slope case is insensitive to aquifer length 4 slr produces larger relative changes in the freshwater volume compared to relative changes in the toe location in summary the interface location is ultimately dependent on tanβ 1 tanβ 2 h h s h l h s h l and l the effects of slope on slr swi are complex and depend on the parameters of the problem whereby the highest propensities for slr swi i e largest values of x t h s and v sw h s may involve upper and lower confining units sloping downwards or upwards in the offshore direction however the results of logarithmic sensitivities differ from linear sensitivities whereby the former shows that confined aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to slr swi these findings highlight the need to consider aquifer slope when analyzing slr induced swi in confined coastal aquifers although this study is based on a simple conceptual model that neglects the mixing between freshwater and seawater aquifer heterogeneity and transient conditions the results derived have important implications for the assessment of coastal confined aquifers which can be extended to unique sloping aquifer cases using the rapid first order methodology outlined herein for flux controlled systems the result is consistent with previous findings for horizontal confined coastal aquifers werner et al 2012 whereby slr does not cause movement in the steady state interface the current study should be extended to account for transient effects and other factors omitted from the analytical approach and also the role of three dimensional stresses such as pumping and aquifer variability are likely to play important roles in slr swi in sloping coastal confined aquifers credit authorship contribution statement wenlong shi formal analysis investigation writing original draft chunhui lu

appendix a the location of the interface in sloping confined coastal aquifers is obtained using the method of lu et al 2016 an abbreviated derivation for the interface distribution is provided here firstly in terms of a known flux at the inland boundary q f and subsequently in terms of a known inland boundary head h l according to the simple conceptual model shown in fig 3 the thickness of freshwater h l can be expressed as a1 h z h x tan β 1 where z l is the elevation of the interface and h l is the confined aquifer thickness at the seaward boundary and β 1 rad is the inclined angle of the upper confining layer darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer approximation dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 are combined to obtain a2 q f k h d ϕ dx k z h x tan β 1 d ϕ dx where q f l2 t is the freshwater flux from the inland boundary k l t is the hydraulic conductivity and ϕ l is the hydraulic head above the x axis the relationship between ϕ and z can be written as a3 z α ϕ h s h s in which α is the density ratio equal to ρ f ρ s ρ f where ρ f and ρ s m l3 are freshwater and seawater densities respectively taking the derivative of eq a3 and combining with eq a2 we obtain a4 dz dx α d ϕ dx α q f k z h x tan β 1 if β 1 0 eq a4 can be integrated to obtain a5 x k z h 2 2 α q f to find the interface toe location we use the geometrical relationship between the ordinate z t and the abscissa x t of the interface toe a6 z t x t tan β 2 where β 2 rad is the inclined angle of the lower confining layer inserting eq a6 into eq a5 yields a7 x t k x t tan β 2 h 2 2 α q f the situation involving β 1 0 and β 2 0 is a horizontal confined aquifer with constant thickness for which eq a7 reduces to the solution provided by werner et al 2012 a8 x t k h 2 2 α q f when β 1 0 and β 2 0 i e

positive square root obtained from eq a9 has no physical significance and should be rejected since x t increases with decreasing q f lu et al 2016 meanwhile the solution of eq a10 has the real root only when α 2 q f 2 2αq f khtanβ 2 0 and the maximum value of the solution appears when α 2 q f 2 2αq f khtanβ 2 0 if β 1 0 the solution of eq a4 is obtained by transformation a11 z h α q f k tan β 1 ln 1 k z h x tan β 1 tan β 1 α q f eq a11 can be rewritten in another form a12 x α q f k tan 2 β 1 1 exp k tan β 1 z h α q f z h tan β 1 both eqs a11 and a12 can be employed to determine the interface location to find the interface toe location replacing x and z in eq a12 by x t and z t and substituting eq a6 into eq a12 generates a13 x t α q f k tan 2 β 1 1 exp k tan β 1 x t tan β 2 h α q f x t tan β 2 h tan β 1 despite that eq a13 is an implicit function by using the newton raphson method x t can be determined when β 1 0 β 2 0 i e cases f and g we can get a simpler formula a14 x t α q f k tan 2 β 1 1 exp k tan β 1 h α q f h tan β 1 alternatively the analytical solutions for interface location and toe location in sloping confined aquifers with head controlled conditions can be derived by using the solutions that have been obtained in flux controlled systems and the relationship between the flux and head at the inland boundary based on the method provided by lu et al 2016 the vertically integrated freshwater discharge between the interface toe and the inland boundary i e freshwater zone can be expressed as following a15 q f k h tan β 1 tan β 2 x d ϕ dx if β 1 β 2 i e confining unit case i see fig 2 eq a15 is simplified as a16 q f k h d ϕ dx integrating eq a16 with using the inland boundary condition x l ϕ h l we obtain a17 ϕ q f kh x l h l at the interface toe location according to the geometric relationship see fig 3 we have a18 x x t ϕ ϕ t 1 α α h s x t tan β 2 x t tan β 2 thus after substitution of eq a18 into eq a17 q f for case a i e β 1 β 2 0 is expressed in terms of h l as a19 q f kh x t l 1 α α h s h l the interface toe location in horizontal confined aquifer is determined by inserting eq a19 into eq a8 a20 x t hl 2 1 α h s α h l h 2 eq a20 is exactly the same as the previous result of lu et al 2015 when β 1 β 2 β 0 i e cases b and c it means that both confining beds are parallel but not horizontal q f is then expressed as a21 q f kh x t

by using the newton raphson method if β 1 β 2 applying the inland boundary condition x l ϕ h l eq a15 can be integrated as a23 ϕ q f k tan β 1 tan β 2 ln h tan β 1 tan β 2 x h tan β 1 tan β 2 l h l eq a23 requires the logarithm of a positive real number to ensure its validity resulting in l h tan β 1 tan β 2 when tanβ 1 tanβ 2 0 then substituting eq a18 into eq a23 we obtain a24 q f k tan β 1 tan β

discharge is calculated by simplifying eq a24 a25 q f k tan β 2 1 α α h s 1 α x t tan β 2 h l ln h x t tan β 2 h l tan β 2 inserting eq a25 into eq a10 we obtained a26 x t h tan β 2 2 2 x t 1 α h s x

both confining beds are sloping but not parallel and q f is written as eq a24 the solution of the interface toe location in this case can be computed by inserting eq a24 into eq a13 a29 x t h tan β 2

solutions of eqs a22 a26 a28 and a29 require iteration to be solved because the dependent variable x t is on both sides appendix b 
5479,previous studies of the impact of sea level rise on seawater intrusion slr swi are mostly based on horizontal coastal aquifers despite that most coastal aquifers are sloping a recent study has shown that the effect of aquifer slope can not be neglected when assessing slr swi in unconfined coastal aquifers however the effect of slope in confined aquifers has not been evaluated in this study we apply existing analytical solutions to quantify the effect of the slope of both upper and lower confining layers on slr swi the results show that for flux controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems slr does not change the steady state interface location consistent with previous findings for horizontal aquifers therefore our analysis focuses on head controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems for which we find the assumption of horizontal confining units causes significant errors we demonstrate this by assessing the sensitivities of the seawater toe location and seawater volume to slr for various combinations of sloping confining layers the results indicate that the influence of the slope on slr swi is small in thin confined aquifers however the slope is an important factor in thick confined aquifers the influence of the slope in the lower confining layer on slr swi is much greater than that of the upper confining layer aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to slr swi whereas those that thin towards inland are least susceptible the assessment of slr swi in sloping confined coastal aquifers in the current study demonstrates application of a rapid first order assessment tool that can be applied to a wide range of other sloping coastal confined aquifer problems keywords seawater intrusion sea level rise sloping confined aquifer analytical solution 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi occurs when seawater encroaches into the freshwater region of a coastal aquifer and has long been considered a global issue bear et al 1999 the seawater contamination of freshwater limits groundwater pumping in coastal areas lacombe and carleton 1992 werner et al 2011 and may lead to the salinization of agricultural lands coastal soils and ecosystems werner et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 the impacts of swi are difficult to remediate and may arise from various causal factors and therefore it is critical to properly conceptualize and quantify the extent of swi the two causes of swi that have been the focus of most previous studies include the over pumping of coastal aquifers leading to regional scale drawdown e g werner and gallagher 2006 post et al 2019 and sea level rise slr due to climate change e g werner and simmons 2009 werner et al 2012 lu et al 2013 2015 in light of ipcc 2013 projections of slr of up to 0 82 m by 2100 it is important to develop reliable tools for estimating slr induced swi slr swi in the remainder while slr swi in horizontal aquifers has been widely studied slr swi in sloping confined aquifers remains an important knowledge gap werner et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 methods applied to studies of slr swi include numerical simulation e g watson et al 2010 chang et al 2011 morgan et al 2015 and analytical approaches e g werner and simmons 2009 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lu et al 2015 there is also a limited number of articles that use experimental methods e g morgan et al 2013 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 numerical simulation allows for the investigation of transient dispersive swi in heterogeneous aquifers and the assessment of mixing zone widths and seawater circulation rates e g webb and howard 2011 badaruddin et al 2017 while numerical methods offer greater flexibility in the range of situations that can be evaluated analytical solutions are more computationally efficient and reveal interrelationships between parameters and the seawater extent without the need for high numerical burden albeit analytical solutions apply to restricted coastal aquifer situations e g steady state immiscible freshwater seawater interactions etc analytical solutions facilitate rapid evaluation of the seawater extent in coastal aquifers and are useful first order assessment tools that are routinely used by practitioners to obtain initial estimates of the scale of swi e g beebe et al 2016 knight et al 2018 werner and simmons 2009 explored slr swi using the theory developed by strack 1976 which assumes steady state non dispersive conditions and the dupuit forchheimer approximation dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 thereby neglecting the resistance to groundwater flow in the vertical direction they considered isotropic homogeneous horizontal unconfined aquifers with uniform recharge and adopted two alternative inland boundary conditions i e head controlled and flux controlled head controlled conditions are those where the head at the inland boundary is fixed i e despite slr whereas the groundwater discharge at the inland boundary is fixed under flux controlled conditions werner and simmons 2009 the results showed that slr induces larger landward shifts in the toe i e 100 s of meters in head controlled systems whereas flux controlled conditions lead to slr swi of up to 50 m for typical aquifer conditions notwithstanding surface overtopping impacts werner et al 2012 adopted a similar theory to that of werner and simmons 2009 to study swi vulnerability using derivative equations they included confined aquifers and developed equations for the seawater volume in the aquifer and found that slr does not exacerbate swi in flux controlled confined aquifers only a handful of previous theoretical analyses of swi consider sloping aquifers for example koussis et al 2012 used the theory of strack 1976 to provide a solution to steady state interface flow in sloping unconfined aquifers with uniform recharge and a freshwater collector trough i e a line sink or well gallery parallel to the coast their analytical solutions for the discharge head interface position and toe location were derived by approximating a linearized hydraulic potential due to gravity they demonstrated the practicality of the analytical solutions through application to the akrotiri coastal aquifer cyprus showing that the toe location was much more sensitive to sea level than to recharge change subsequently mazi et al 2013 extended the analytical solutions of koussis et al 2012 to assess slr swi in both flux controlled and head controlled sloping unconfined aquifers their results showed high nonlinearities in the form of thresholds in aquifer depth sea level change and minimum submarine discharge or hydraulic head beyond which swi would increase abruptly consistent with observations by werner et al 2012 for horizontal aquifers more recently ketabchi et al 2016 evaluated slr swi in unconfined aquifers including the effects of land surface inundation lsi land surface slope aquifer bed slope and inland boundary condition i e flux and head controlled using both numerical and analytical approaches among these controlling factors they found that fresh groundwater discharge to the sea and the recharge rate were the main controlling factors for seawater toe location whereas the aquifer bed slope and the freshwater seawater density difference produced the lowest sensitivities for both inland boundary condition types lu et al 2016 developed analytical solutions for the steady state location of a sharp interface between freshwater and seawater for both sloping confined and unconfined aquifers both constant head and constant flux inland boundary conditions were considered the method adopted by lu et al 2016 differs from the single potential method used in koussis et al 2012 in that lu et al 2016 solve for the interface location by applying continuity of head and flux at the toe location where the freshwater only zone connects to the interface zone i e the region where freshwater flows above seawater the analytical solutions for sloping unconfined aquifers developed by lu et al 2016 reproduced the solution of koussis et al 2012 more importantly lu et al 2016 found that in flux controlled coastal systems the geometry of the aquifer bottom has little influence on the shape of the interface and primarily controls the location of the interface toe analytical solutions for coastal confined aquifers can be categorized according to the representation of the ocean boundary condition that is the aquifer may be truncated at the shoreline e g strack 1976 1989 werner et al 2012 or the offshore part of the aquifer may be considered e g bakker 2006 bakker et al 2017 werner and robinson 2018 the first ocean boundary type is valid only for shallow confined aquifers that presumably have a minimal offshore freshwater extent the second type presumes that freshwater in the confined aquifer continues offshore until upward leakage accounts for freshwater discharge to the submarine aquifer or until some geomorphological control e g a fault the overlying aquitard is eroded away or the aquifer is exposed at the continental shelf brings the confined aquifer into connection with the sea e g morgan et al 2018 post et al 2013 demonstrated that vast meteoric groundwater reserves occur beneath the sea floor and therefore offshore confined aquifers are thought to be a common global phenomenon studies of offshore aquifers by bakker 2006 bakker et al 2017 and werner and robinson 2018 presume that the aquifer extent beneath the sea is bounded on top by a leaky overlying aquitard separating the sea from the aquifer bakker 2006 showed that four situations arise requiring separate analytical solutions distinguished by the position of the interface tip i e whether or not it reaches the offshore boundary and the toe whether it is onshore or offshore here the tip is the location where the top of the aquifer intercepts the interface werner and robinson 2018 corrected bakker s 2006 solution so that aquitards contain freshwater where they overly offshore aquifers also containing freshwater the aforementioned studies of confined aquifers in coastal areas are based on the assumption of horizontal aquifers it is not clear how the slope of confined coastal aquifers will affect slr swi although previous studies have explored the effect of the slope of the base of unconfined aquifers on swi e g koussis et al 2012 mazi et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 thereby providing an initial insight into the influence of sloping lower confining units the focus of this study is to assess for the first time the influence of slr on both the toe location and seawater volume in sloping confined aquifers analytical solutions for seawater volume in sloping confined aquifers are obtained using the sloping aquifer theory of lu et al 2016 the sensitivity of swi slr to key controlling parameters is evaluated for various combinations of sloping confining units 2 conceptual model in this study we consider two types of homogeneous confined coastal aquifers 1 shallow confined aquifers truncated at the shoreline and 2 deeper confined aquifers that extend offshore where they are overlain by an impervious layer this differs from offshore aquifer studies that adopt leaky offshore aquitards e g bakker 2006 solórzano rivas and werner 2018 werner and robinson 2018 in that we ignore distributed upward leakage to the sea the conceptual models adopted in the current analysis are shown in fig 1 in the following analysis slr swi is quantified as the change in steady state position of the freshwater seawater interface following previous studies e g werner et al 2012 three forms of sloping confined coastal aquifers are considered these differ depending on the slope of the upper and lower confining layers relative to each other namely i upper and lower confining layers are parallel ii one confining layer is sloping and the other is horizontal and iii both confining layers are sloping but are not parallel the madras aquifer in india is a typical sloping aquifer with confining layers that are not parallel sherif and singh 1999 fig 2 illustrates the various combinations arising from different slopes positive horizontal and negative of the upper and lower confining layers namely cases a to m the analytical method applied in assessing slr swi in confined aquifers is an extension to that of lu et al 2016 they developed solutions for sloping aquifers both unconfined and confined considering both flux controlled and head controlled inland boundary conditions their method requires the following assumptions 1 the system is in steady state 2 freshwater and seawater are immiscible and separated by an interface 3 the confined aquifer is isotropic and homogeneous 4 only horizontal flow is considered and the flow of seawater is neglected and 5 confining units are impermeable fig 3 illustrates the parameters that accompany the general conceptual model from which various cases shown in fig 2 can be derived in this conceptual model the origin of the coordinate system is located at the aquifer base and the seaward termination of the aquifer whether this is at the shoreline or offshore note that a vertical coastal boundary other than a sloping coastal boundary is considered in fig 3 which does not change the steady state freshwater seawater interface position the interface height z l is related to the hydraulic head ϕ l based on the so called ghyben herzberg relation badon ghyben and drabbe 1888 herzberg 1901 1 z α ϕ h s h s where h s l is the sea level height above the aquifer base fig 3 and α is the dimensionless density ratio α ρ f ρ s ρ f with ρ f and ρ s m l3 the respective freshwater and seawater densities α 40 is used in this study other relevant variables shown in fig 3 include the inclination of the upper and lower confining layers at angles β 1 and β 2 rad respectively the angles β 1 and β 2 are positive negative where the slope is rising falling in the inland direction h l is the vertical thickness at the seaward termination of the confined aquifer q f l2 t is the freshwater flux from inland per unit coastline length and h l l is the hydraulic head at the inland boundary which is located at a distance l l from the seaward termination of the confined aquifer x t and z t l represent the abscissa and ordinate of the toe position of the interface respectively by specifying one of q f or h l at the inland boundary solutions are obtained for flux controlled or head controlled conditions respectively in head controlled systems the freshwater flux after slr is q f l2 t otherwise under flux controlled systems q f remains unchanged despite slr similarly h l l is the new head value at the inland boundary following slr in flux controlled systems 3 analytical solutions of seawater volume in sloping confined aquifers 3 1 interface toe and seawater volume analytical solutions for the distribution of the freshwater seawater interface and the location of the toe based on the sloping aquifer theory of lu et al 2016 are provided in appendix a by assuming a freshwater seawater sharp interface mixing between the two water bodies is neglected when deriving analytical solutions which results in an overestimate of seawater intrusion improved solutions could be obtained by considering a correction factor lu and werner 2013 lu et al 2016 though they are not adopted in the current study analytical solutions can be further improved by considering the freshwater outflow gap which has been adopted to correct analytical solutions by koussis et al 2015 and koussis and mazi 2018 both flux controlled and head controlled inland boundary conditions are considered at least initially these solutions are used to obtain relationships for the seawater volume v sw l2 as given below the theory in appendix a shows that solutions for the interface i e eqs a5 and a12 and the toe location x t i e eqs a8 a10 a13 and a14 are independent of the sea level height h s under flux controlled conditions in other words there is no slr swi in flux controlled sloping confined coastal aquifers this is consistent with previous findings for horizontal confined coastal aquifers e g werner et al 2012 conversely in situations where the inland head is constant the toe position of the interface shifts landward in response to slr therefore we consider only head controlled settings in the analyses that follow solutions for x t are given in appendix a for each of the three confining unit cases see fig 2 for confining unit case i i e β 1 β 2 x t is determined by eqs a20 for case a and a22 for cases b and c for confining unit case ii i e β 1 0 β 2 0 or β 1 0 β 2 0 x t is assessed using eqs a26 for cases d and e and a28 for cases f and g while for confining unit case iii i e β 1 0 β 2 0 and β 1 β 2 x t is obtained from eq a29 for cases h to m the toe location after slr denoted as x t l is obtained by replacing h s with h s h s δh s where δh s l is slr slr swi is quantified as the shift in steady state toe location i e δx t x t x t in a similar manner to previous studies e g werner and simmons 2009 it is noteworthy that the expression for x t in eq a20 as well as eqs a22 a26 a28 and a29 is independent of the hydraulic conductivity k l t which is consistent with the solution for head controlled confined aquifers given by lu et al 2015 whereas werner et al 2012 include k in their expression of slr swi in head controlled systems we replace q f with an expression containing h l e g eq a19 which results in the elimination of k in eq a20 and other subsequent expressions the volume of seawater v sw in the coastal aquifer was determined from various interface equations described above for case a β 1 β 2 0 fig 2 a horizontal confined aquifer the seawater volume is given by 2 v sw a ε 0 h k z h 2 2 α q f d z here the superscript a of v sw a l2 is used to identify the case ε is

propensity for swi to occur in response to slr werner et al 2012 that is derivative equations are obtained based on the analytical solutions of the previous subsection as undertaken by werner et al 2012 for horizontal aquifers the propensity for slr to cause a landward shift in the toe is represented by x t h s while slr induced increase in the seawater volume in the aquifer is represented by v sw h s x t h s equations are obtained by differentiating eqs a20 a22 a26 a28 and a29 with respect to h s and these are given in table 1 equations for v sw h s are obtained by differentiating eqs 3 5 8 12 and 16 as shown in table 2 three parameter sets pertaining to confined coastal aquifers described by knight et al 2018 are used to investigate swi sensitivities as given in table 3 note that k is omitted from table 3 because it is inconsequential using the theory developed in the previous section knight et al 2018 adopted simplified representations of these aquifers including the assumption of horizontalness which allowed for the application of the analytical solution of werner and robinson 2018 however according to pauw et al 2017 haider et al 2015 and kaleris et al 2002 these aquifers are sloping in the interests of testing different combinations of sloping confining units we modify the aquifer parameters used by knight et al 2018 by applying various confining aquifer slopes namely values of tanβ 1 and tanβ 2 ranging from 0 001 to 0 001 were tested in doing so slr swi is assessed in hypothetical variations i e various hypothetical aquifer slopes of these three field cases the extent of slr swi under the influence of sloping confining layers was compared with results obtained from the assumption of horizontal confining units to provide guidance on the effect of slope on seawater extent and volume 4 results and discussion fig 4 illustrates the sensitivities of swi to sea level height x t h s and v sw h s in the three regional aquifers listed in table 3 assuming values of tanβ 1 and tanβ 2 ranging from 0 001 to 0 001 the three cases produce toe and volume sensitivities x t h s and v sw h s that range over two orders of magnitude with case 3 leading to the largest slr swi sensitivities the results show that the slopes of both upper and lower confining layers affect slr swi in all cases although in case 3 fig 4c1 and c2 swi is almost insensitive to tanβ 1 and only minor changes in v sw h s are obtained when tanβ 2 is modified in case 1 fig 4a2 maximum values of x t h s and v sw h s occur at different combinations of tanβ 1 and tanβ 2 for the three cases that is in case 1 fig 4a1 and a2 x t h s and v sw h s have maximum values at tanβ 1 tanβ 2 0 001 whereas in case 2 fig 4b1 and b2 maximum values of x t h s and v sw h s appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 and in case 3 fig 4c1 and c2 maximum values appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 logarithmic sensitivities of slr swi kabala 2001 werner et al 2012 given by x t h s h s x t and v sw h s h s v sw are obtained for the three previous cases as illustrated in fig 5 in all three cases logarithmic sensitivities have maximum values at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 and minimum values at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 for both toe and seawater volume this differs from the results for linear sensitivities fig 4 for which minimum and maximum values of x t h s and v sw h s varied between the cases results from fig 5 indicate that confined aquifers that increase in thickness in the landward direction are most susceptible to slr swi whereas those that thin in the landward direction are least susceptible to slr swi the lower swi in aquifers that contract in the landward direction is the intuitive result of the reduced area of aquifer available for the invasion of seawater in thinning aquifers case 3 again produces the largest slr swi logarithmic sensitivities the results also indicate that logarithmic sensitivities of v sw are higher than those of x t for all three cases the results of fig 5 are extended to explore the effect of the thickness of a sloping aquifer on slr swi using modified parameters from case 2 both linear and logarithmic sensitivities are assessed that is x t h s v sw h s x t h s h s x t and v sw h s h s v sw are obtained from parameters sets for case 2 except with aquifer thicknesses of 80 m 120 m and 160 m h 40 m in the unmodified form of case 2 the results are shown in fig 6 illustrating that both linear and logarithmic sensitivities are higher in thicker aquifers note that the highest sensitivities in figs 4 and 5 were also obtained for the thickest aquifer case 3 consistent with the results in fig 5 maximum values of logarithmic sensitivities appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 and minimum values appear at tanβ 1 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 these results indicate that the effect of confining layer slope on x t h s and v sw h s is modified by aquifer thickness whereby slr swi is more sensitive to the slope of lower boundary tanβ 2 in thicker aquifers fig 6c1 to c4 the relationship between thickness confining layer slope and slr swi was further evaluated by calculating both linear and logarithmic sensitivities for all three cases see table 3 with modified aquifer thicknesses h 40 m h 80 m and 120 m as shown in fig 7 nine slope cases were considered these being combinations of tanβ 1 0 001 0 0 001 and tanβ 2 0 001 0 0 001 consistent with cases a to i see fig 2 in fig 7 changes in aquifer thickness h causes larger variations in both linear and logarithmic sensitivities compared to the variations attributable to changes in confining layer slope this means that the effect of aquifer thickness on slr swi is greater than that of confining layer slope at least for the thicknesses and slopes considered for h 40 m the slr swi linear and logarithmic sensitivities are almost the same in all nine slope cases a to i whereas greater differences between slope cases are apparent with h 120 m this indicates that the slope of confining layers has a more significant effect on slr swi in thicker confined aquifers the large differences in sensitivities between cases 1 2 and 3 with h 120 m compare to the small differences between cases 1 2 and 3 with h 40 m suggest that the variables related to hydraulic gradient i e h s h l and l are also more influential in assessing slr swi relative to the confining layer slope in thick confined aquifers in addition to slr we assessed the effect on swi of inland head changes which produce sensitivities that are negatively signed relative to those that arise from slr for the intuitive reason that a rise in inland head acts to oppose swi compared to increasing swi with rising sea level derivative equations for the change in toe location and seawater volume with inland head variation i e x t h l and v sw h l respectively are attainable using similar methods to those outlined in appendix a these produce the following simple relationships 17 x t h l α 1 α x t h s 18 v sw h l α 1 α v sw h s here α 1 α is approximately 0 976 if typical seawater and freshwater densities are used therefore the logarithmic sensitivities of swi to inland head can be obtained 19 x t h l h l x t α 1 α x t h s h l x t 20 v sw h l h l v sw α 1 α v sw h s h l v sw to investigate the effect on sensitivities of slr swi in sloping confined aquifers of differences in sea level h s and inland head h l we calculated both linear and logarithmic sensitivities for cases 1 and 2 i e and the nine slope cases by keeping the head difference h s h l the same but with modified h s and h l as shown in fig 8 the results show that for case 1 higher h s and h l h s 150 m and h l 154 m produce larger values of linear and logarithmic sensitivities however the head difference h s h l had a stronger effect on slr swi relative to the component head values this indicates that the effect of confining layer slope on slr swi sensitivities is related to both h s and h l for a given hydraulic gradient and the difference between them for small values of h s h l changes to h s and h l have a greater effect on the sensitivities of slr swi in sloping confined aquifer the effect of head difference h s h l aquifer length l and the head gradient h s h l l on slr swi in sloping confined aquifers was examined using a similar approach to that described above namely logarithmic sensitivities were obtained for all three cases except with h s h l l values of 0 002 as shown in fig 9 note that this specific head gradient can be obtained by two methods changing the aquifer length or the head difference as listed in tables 4 and 5 see appendix b in fig 9 for scenarios where h s h l l is equal cases with small h l and l have higher logarithmic sensitivities hollow green symbols versus hollow purple symbols when h s h l is equal the logarithmic sensitivity for each slope case is almost the same hollow yellow symbols versus hollow purple symbols cases 1a and 1c cases 2a and 2c cases 3a and 3c especially for horizontal aquifers case a see tables 4 and 5 in appendix b the value of slr swi logarithmic sensitivities for cases 1a and 1c or cases 2a and 2c cases 3a and 3c is equal for horizontal aquifers the logarithmic sensitivities of slr swi are independent of aquifer length l since l will be eliminated in the analytical solutions of x t h s h s x t and v sw h s h s v sw according to the partial derivative equations of x t h s and v sw h s for case a see tables 1 and 2 this result indicates that the magnitude of logarithmic sensitivities is dependent on the head difference h s h l compared with the variation of logarithmic sensitivities caused by the changes of head difference the variation caused by the changes of confining layer slope is smaller but the effect of sloping confining layers on logarithmic sensitivities of slr swi in thicker aquifers is amplified case 3 5 conclusions the application and extension of lu et al s 2016 theory allows for an assessment of slr swi in sloping confined aquifers considering the different combinations of upper and lower sloping impervious layers analytical solutions of seawater volume and interface toe location in confined aquifers of differing slope are given to explore the effect of key controlling parameters on slr swi the sensitivities of interface toe location and seawater volume to sea level height in sloping confined aquifer were calculated with parameters of three regional cases with modifications to allow for sensitivities to be tested the specific findings are as follows 1 slope is an important factor particularly in thick confined aquifers and especially for the lower confining layer for which the impact of the slope on slr induced swi is much greater than that of the upper confining layer 2 confined aquifers that increase in thickness in the landward direction are most susceptible to slr swi whereas those that thin in the landward direction are least susceptible to slr swi 3 the effect of slope on sensitivities of slr swi is dependent on h h s h l and h s h l except for equal h s h l aquifers where the logarithmic sensitivity of slr swi for each slope case is insensitive to aquifer length 4 slr produces larger relative changes in the freshwater volume compared to relative changes in the toe location in summary the interface location is ultimately dependent on tanβ 1 tanβ 2 h h s h l h s h l and l the effects of slope on slr swi are complex and depend on the parameters of the problem whereby the highest propensities for slr swi i e largest values of x t h s and v sw h s may involve upper and lower confining units sloping downwards or upwards in the offshore direction however the results of logarithmic sensitivities differ from linear sensitivities whereby the former shows that confined aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to slr swi these findings highlight the need to consider aquifer slope when analyzing slr induced swi in confined coastal aquifers although this study is based on a simple conceptual model that neglects the mixing between freshwater and seawater aquifer heterogeneity and transient conditions the results derived have important implications for the assessment of coastal confined aquifers which can be extended to unique sloping aquifer cases using the rapid first order methodology outlined herein for flux controlled systems the result is consistent with previous findings for horizontal confined coastal aquifers werner et al 2012 whereby slr does not cause movement in the steady state interface the current study should be extended to account for transient effects and other factors omitted from the analytical approach and also the role of three dimensional stresses such as pumping and aquifer variability are likely to play important roles in slr swi in sloping coastal confined aquifers credit authorship contribution statement wenlong shi formal analysis investigation writing original draft chunhui lu

appendix a the location of the interface in sloping confined coastal aquifers is obtained using the method of lu et al 2016 an abbreviated derivation for the interface distribution is provided here firstly in terms of a known flux at the inland boundary q f and subsequently in terms of a known inland boundary head h l according to the simple conceptual model shown in fig 3 the thickness of freshwater h l can be expressed as a1 h z h x tan β 1 where z l is the elevation of the interface and h l is the confined aquifer thickness at the seaward boundary and β 1 rad is the inclined angle of the upper confining layer darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer approximation dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 are combined to obtain a2 q f k h d ϕ dx k z h x tan β 1 d ϕ dx where q f l2 t is the freshwater flux from the inland boundary k l t is the hydraulic conductivity and ϕ l is the hydraulic head above the x axis the relationship between ϕ and z can be written as a3 z α ϕ h s h s in which α is the density ratio equal to ρ f ρ s ρ f where ρ f and ρ s m l3 are freshwater and seawater densities respectively taking the derivative of eq a3 and combining with eq a2 we obtain a4 dz dx α d ϕ

abscissa x t of the interface toe a6 z t x t tan β 2 where β 2 rad is the inclined angle of the lower confining layer inserting eq a6 into eq a5 yields a7 x t k x t tan β 2 h 2 2 α q f the situation involving β 1 0 and β 2 0 is a horizontal confined aquifer with constant thickness for which eq a7 reduces to the solution provided by werner et al 2012 a8 x t k h 2 2 α q f when β 1 0 and β 2 0 i e

positive square root obtained from eq a9 has no physical significance and should be rejected since x t increases with decreasing q f lu et al 2016 meanwhile the solution of eq a10 has the real root only when α 2 q f 2 2αq f khtanβ 2 0 and the maximum value of the solution appears when α 2 q f 2 2αq f khtanβ 2 0 if β 1 0 the solution of eq a4 is obtained by transformation a11 z h α q f k tan β 1 ln 1 k z h x tan β 1 tan β 1 α q f eq a11 can be rewritten in another form a12 x α q f k tan 2 β 1 1 exp k tan β 1 z h α q f z h tan β 1 both eqs a11 and a12 can be employed to determine the interface

by using the solutions that have been obtained in flux controlled systems and the relationship between the flux and head at the inland boundary based on the method provided by lu et al 2016 the vertically integrated freshwater discharge between the interface toe and the inland boundary i e freshwater zone can be expressed as following a15 q f k h tan β 1 tan β 2 x d ϕ dx if β 1 β 2 i e confining unit case i see fig 2 eq a15 is simplified as a16 q f k h d ϕ dx integrating eq a16 with using the inland boundary condition x l ϕ h l we obtain a17 ϕ q f kh x l h l at the interface toe

by using the newton raphson method if β 1 β 2 applying the inland boundary condition x l ϕ h l eq a15 can be integrated as a23 ϕ q f k tan β 1 tan β 2 ln h tan β 1 tan β 2 x h tan β 1 tan β 2 l h l eq a23 requires the logarithm of a positive real number to ensure its validity resulting in l h tan β 1 tan β 2 when tanβ 1 tanβ 2 0 then substituting eq a18 into eq a23 we obtain a24 q f k tan β 1 tan β

both confining beds are sloping but not parallel and q f is written as eq a24 the solution of the interface toe location in this case can be computed by inserting eq a24 into eq a13 a29 x t h tan β 2
