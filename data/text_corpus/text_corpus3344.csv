16720,few studies have examined the exposure of small streams 30 km2 catchment size to agriculturally used pesticides compared to large rivers a total of 105 sites in 103 small agricultural streams were investigated for 76 pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides and 32 pesticide metabolites in spring and summer over two years 2018 and 2019 during dry weather and rainfall using event driven sampling the median total concentration of the 76 pesticides was 0 18 µg l with 9 pesticides per sample on average n 815 this is significantly higher than monitoring data for larger streams reflecting the close proximity to agricultural fields and the limited dilution by non agricultural waters the frequency of detection of all pesticides correlated with sales quantity and half lives in water terbuthylazine mcpa boscalid and tebuconazole showed the highest median concentrations the median of the total concentration of the 32 metabolites exceeded the pesticide concentration by more than an order of magnitude during dry weather the median total concentration of the 76 pesticides was 0 07 µg l with 5 pesticides per sample on average rainfall events increased the median total pesticide concentration by a factor of 10 to 0 7 µg l and the average number of pesticides per sample to 14 with up to 41 in single samples the concentration increase was particularly strong for 2 4 d mcpa terbuthylazine and nicosulfuron 75 percentile metabolite concentrations were generally less responsive to rainfall except for those of terbuthylazine flufenacet metamitron and prothioconazole the frequent and widespread exceedance of the regulatory acceptable concentrations rac of the 76 pesticides during both dry weather and rainfall suggests that current plant protection product

surface water transformation products 1 introduction most surface waters are subject to the input of anthropogenic chemicals these may stem from discharges of treated municipal wastewater combined sewer overflows cooling waters industrial wastewaters and diffuse sources such as road runoff or agricultural fields wittmer et al 2010 pesticides applied to agricultural fields for the protection of crops can enter water bodies by surface runoff subsurface drainage systems groundwater inflow and spray drift bundschuh et al 2014 leu et al 2010 liess et al 1999 important parameters that influence the extent of pesticide input into surface waters are weather soil type pesticide properties and application method gramlich et al 2018 pesticides are biologically active compounds and it is known for long that their input into surface waters can affect aquatic biota from single species to community level and the whole river ecosystem beketov et al 2013 liess and ohe 2005 stehle and schulz 2015 the input of pesticides into surface waters is particularly high during the main application period in spring and summer and has been shown to increase during rain events leu et al 2004 szöcs et al 2017 in the european union eu the first regulation of pesticide concentrations in aquatic compartments dates back to 1980 the council of the european communities 1979 and was directed to groundwater as an important source of drinking water with a limit of 0 1 µg l for any pesticide with the water framework directive wfd of 2000 pesticide concentrations in surface waters were regulated european parliament and council of the european union 2020 to date maximum allowable concentration environmental quality standards mac eqs are derived for only 14 of the 463 pesticides that are currently approved in the european union european commission 2020 according to the wfd official monitoring programs are in place in the eu to surveil surface water quality the ten major river basin districts in germany have to be monitored representatively and sampled at defined intervals independent of weather conditions small basins with less than 100 km2 are sampled less frequently than larger basins wick et al 2019 and small catchments 10 km2 are not specifically considered by the wfd however small streams are important habitats and they comprise the majority of running waters in germany for example almost 2 3 of the total length of running waters is represented by small streams with catchment sizes 10 km2 approx 258 000 of 400 000 km bundesamt für naturschutz 2004 small agricultural streams are characterized by immediate proximity to agricultural fields and a low dilution capacity of field runoff by other waters compared to larger rivers further downstream szöcs et al 2017 such stream sections are denoted as edge of field surface waters in the eu efsa risk assessment of plant protection products for aquatic organisms efsa 2013 small streams have been shown to be specifically exposed to high pesticide concentrations spycher et al reported that risks in five small streams in switzerland were underestimated by current monitoring strategies with low temporal resolution spycher et al 2018 in germany a so called national action plan on sustainable use of plant protection products nap was implemented that demands monitoring of the pesticide burden of small streams to better account for their risks federal ministry of food and agriculture germany 2013 the protection of the environment is a primary aim of pesticide regulation for the approval of plant protection products in the eu exposure models are used to derive predicted environmental concentrations pec in surface waters for a given application furthermore regulatory acceptable concentrations racs of pesticides are derived for surface waters based on available effect data efsa 2013 to exclude unacceptable effects on the environment european parliament council of the european union 2009 racs can vary between eu member states and are subject to change if new effect data become available eventually only those applications of plant protection products are approved for which the pec remains below the rac consequently exceedances of racs should not occur pesticide monitoring data can be used to check for compliance with the respective racs and thus serve as reality check for the approaches established in the approval of plant protection products such a reality check needs to consider also ecologically relevant and potentially critical situations and thus to include small agricultural streams and rainfall events to become representative such monitoring would also have to include a large diversity of settings in terms of catchment morphology land use and crops grown in the catchment and to cover diverse weather conditions in this study pesticides were monitored at 105 sites in spring and summer of two years 2018 2019 by a combination of sampling at regular intervals and event driven sampling to account for rain events liess et al 2021 this sampling combines high temporal resolution with high spatial coverage in germany resulting in 800 samples processed in the same way to generate highly comparable concentration data for 76 pesticides and 32 metabolites plus 4 indicator compounds to account for inputs from non agricultural sources this large set of monitoring data is interpreted involving information on the catchments land use crops growth and the physico chemical properties and use characteristics of the pesticides under study this work aims at answering the following questions what are the concentration levels of pesticides and pesticide metabolites in small agricultural streams compared to larger ones during the period of pesticide application how do rainfall events affect pesticide concentrations in these streams which pesticides reacted most sensitively to rainfall events can we explain the concentrations of pesticides based on their physico chemical properties or their use characteristics can the concentrations be predicted from the fraction of agricultural land use in a catchment how do pesticide metabolites compare to their parent compounds do pesticide concentrations during dry weather and rainfalls comply with the concentration levels derived during the approval of plant protection products by answering these questions this study aims at supporting risk assessment as well as risk management of pesticides with a focus on small streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling in total 886 samples were taken in small agricultural streams in spring and summer april to july of 2018 and 2019 covering the application period of intensive pesticide use wick et al 2019 sampling was carried out at 105 sampling sites in 103 streams selected based on catchment size high percentage of agricultural land use and expected low urban influence wick et al 2019 distributed over twelve federal states in germany fig s1 the mean catchment size was 17 6 km2 the sampling strategy comprised regular grab water sampling every third week following the approach employed in monitoring according to wfd and event driven sampling to cover rain events of the regularly taken 551 samples only 480 samples are included in this study these were categorized as taken during dry weather referred to as dry hereafter because less than 10 mm rainfall was reported on the day of sampling and no rainfall event was noted on this day or the day before the event driven sampling was conducted with automated samplers maxx tp5 rangendingen germany triggered by a rise of water level in the respective stream that corresponded to precipitation 10 mm day in the respective catchment rain 335 samples further details on sampling and site characteristics were provided in a previous publication liess et al 2021 2 2 sample preparation the water samples were filtered with a disposable syringe filter a combination of glass fiber filter and 0 45 µm regenerated cellulose acetate altmann analytik munich germany one ml of the filtered sample was spiked with five isotope labeled internal standards of the pesticides with very low rac values of 0 00077 0 01 µg l spiking concentrations are provided in table s2 three further internal standards were added to check for instrumental performance the reference substances at purities of 98 and higher were delivered from hpc standards borsdorf germany and chemos altdorf germany dissolved in acetonitrile at concentrations of 100 µg ml 1 the dilutions to build the calibration curves were prepared in milli q water 2 3 lc ms ms analyses in total 76 pesticides 40 herbicides 24 fungicides and 12 insecticides 32 pesticide metabolites and 4 indicator compounds were analyzed in the water samples the target analytes changed slightly from 2018 to 2019 amino bifenox acid bifenox acid and sulcotrione were excluded from the monitoring in 2019 whereas chlorantraniliprole insecticide hexamethoxymethylmelamine hmmm a marker for road runoff and the metabolite r471811 of chlorothalonil fungicide metabolite were included the analyses were carried out with an lc ms ms system involving an agilent 1290 infinity liquid chromatography system coupled to a qtrap6500 tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization esi interface sciex by direct injection of the aqueous samples and multiple reaction monitoring quantification was performed by external calibration in ultrapure water except for the five analytes for which labelled internal standards were added see above details on the analytical method linear calibration range and validation data are provided in the supplement information tables s1 s3 2 4 data analysis for data processing the multiquant software version 3 0 sciex darmstadt germany was used while most of the pesticides were quantified with external calibration curves concentration levels between 0 005 µg l 1 to 0 75 µg l 1 those marked by low racs clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid methiocarb and fipronil were quantified using the isotope labeled internal standards listed in table s2 the linear calibration range between the limit of detection lod and 0 75 µg l 1 allowed the quantification of the dry samples if pollutant concentrations exceeded the linear calibration range e g in rain samples the quantification was carried out after repeated analysis injecting a smaller sample volume of 10 µl instead of 80 µl all concentration data will be available under https doi org 10 1594 pangaea 931673 from the 30 09 2022 onwards further data analysis was carried out with originpro 9 7 0 185 originlab the frequency of detection fod was calculated based on values larger than the limit of quantification loq fodloq as well as the limit of detection lod fodlod for calculations of concentration ranges values below the loq were also considered specified where applicable quantiles were interpolated based on the method empirical distribution with averaging in origin k means k 5 clustering was conducted to group the pesticides and their metabolites based on the physico chemical properties charge and logd ow ph 7 4 chemicalize chemaxon see results in table s9 and fig s8 to test the explanatory power of different variables on the fodloq values we conducted a correlation analysis spearman s rank correlation analysis with the

relationship between pesticide concentrations and their physico chemical properties and use characteristics a multiple linear regression was performed followed by an anova in originpro 9 7 0 185 originlab land use within the hydrological catchments of the studied streams was derived using the corine land cover data copernicus 2019 all land use subtypes of the classes agriculture forest urban and grassland were aggregated at class level and the respective area share was calculated land use and cultivated crops were mapped in situ within a buffer zone reaching 3 km upstream and 500 m to each streamside the four main land use classes were not further differentiated and no pesticide application data for the grassland and forests were available thus only the agriculture and urban land use are further discussed in this manuscript cultivated crops are displayed as the percentage of the agricultural area fig s9 the land use data were tested for correlation spearman s correlation with the measured concentration per site for sites with different land use in 2018 and 2019 the years were considered separately resulting in a total number of 119 observations the median and mean values of the measured concentrations per compound at one site were calculated from all samples taken dry and rain n 815 and the correlation was tested for both values table s10 the five pesticides with the highest correlation coefficient are shown in table s10a with the urban land use plus the marker substances and in table s10b with the six most representative area wise crops wheat corn rape barley viticulture sugar beet information on typically applied pesticides per crop for 2018 and 2019 was provided by the julius kühn institute julius kühn institute 2020 3 results discussion 3 1 frequency of detection and concentration ranges of the monitored pesticides a total of 815 samples from 105 sampling sites in 103 small agricultural streams taken in spring and summer of 2018 and 2019 are considered in this study 480 samples denoted as dry 335 samples denoted as rain fig s1 they were analyzed for 76 pesticides 40 herbicides 24 fungicides and 12 insecticides and 32 pesticide metabolites pesticide selection was based on previous monitoring data use and ecotoxicity wick et al 2019 in this set of 50 000 concentration data terbuthylazine flufenacet prosulfocarb and s metolachlor showed the highest frequency of detection fodloq of 40 fig 1 complete list in table s4 considering all values above the lod these compounds were detected in more than 64 of all samples table s4 fods of all pesticides correlated with their sales quantity for germany rs 0 51 p 0 001 and less pronounced with their half lives in water rs 0 28 p 0 05 fig s2 but not with their half lives in soil their water solubility or polarity expressed as logd ow the latter finding may point to the fact that pesticides can be exported from the agricultural field in dissolved form as well as particle bound during runoff events their application amounts and persistence then remain as the decisive factors for the occurrence in agricultural streams a multiple linear regression fig s3 also confirmed the significance of the sales quantity and the half lives in water explaining 32 of the variance this agrees to a previous study for one defined catchment that also found the applied amount as the major determinant of occurrence in adjacent streams although for a lower number of pesticides kreuger and törnqvist 1998 the fodloq in this study with 815 samples were comparable or higher than those reported in an earlier study in germany based on samples taken between 2005 and 2015 as part of the regular monitoring according to the wfd szöcs et al 2017 higher fods are presumably partially due to lower loqs in this study compared to regular monitoring much higher fods were found for picoxystrobin factor 45 prosulfocarb and bromoxynil factor 16 and 13 lower fods were recorded for dimethachlor and isoproturon factor 11 and 5 lower fods than szöcs et al respectively fig s4 the latter may be explained by the fact that the approval of isoproturon ended in 2016 in the eu and that the sales quantity of dimethachlor declined by a factor of 6 between this earlier study and the years 2018 and 2019 bundesamt für verbraucherschutz und lebensmittelsicherheit 2020 the pesticides detected most frequently were also often those determined with the highest median concentration fig 2 terbuthylazine was detected in concentrations ranging up to 0 56 µg l 95 percentile median 0 0056 µg l fig 2 other predominant pesticides in this study were mcpa 95 percentile 0 38 µg l median 0 0035 µg l boscalid tebuconazole s metolachlor dimethenamid flufenacet and fluxapyroxad 95 percentile 0 041 µg l median 0 0013 µg l also for the concentrations determined in the streams a significant correlation with sales quantity rs 0 46 p 0 001 and half lives in water rs 0 26 p 0 001 was found fig s6 for 45 pesticides concentrations measured here could be compared with governmental monitoring data for the years 2018 and 2019 of two federal states in germany these data have a higher share of larger streams fig 3 pesticide concentrations of this study were significantly higher kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 p values in table s5 for 28 federal state a and 25 federal state b of the 45 pesticides the higher concentration may be attributed to i the small stream sizes of this study ii the high number of rain samples or iii the collection of samples only during the application period of most pesticides however within the 105 sites of this study a decrease of pesticide concentrations with increasing catchment size was not visible rs 0 082 p 0 40 for the mean and rs 0 051 p 0 61 for the median this may be due to the limited span of catchment sizes from 9 km2 to 19 km2 for the 25 75 percentile higher concentrations in smaller streams have been reported previously for example in a study on 42 danish streams in three size classes with 1000 samples analyzed this increase was particularly pronounced for the peak concentrations 95 percentiles lorenz et al 2017 taken together the fod data fig 1 and the concentration data fig 3 for the 76 pesticides at the 105 sites confirm the previous notion that pesticide concentrations in small agricultural streams of catchment sizes of 10 km2 and below are not well reflected in the official monitoring program leu et al 2004 szöcs et al 2017 it should be noted in this context that the small streams make up almost 2 3 of the running water in germany bundesamt für naturschutz 2004 the formation of metabolites from parent pesticides is inevitable for non persistent pesticides fenner et al 2013 these metabolites are often more polar as well as mobile and can also be more persistent gassmann et al 2013 monitoring of pesticide metabolites supports the understanding of pesticide fate in agricultural systems the median of the total concentration of the 32 metabolites included in this study was 2 4 µg l and thus exceeded the total pesticide concentration by a factor of 13 given the comparatively low number of metabolites the concentration of all metabolites must be even higher the most frequently detected metabolites in this study originate from chlorothalonil fodloq 94 terbuthylazine chloridazon and dimethachlor fodloq 40 fig s5 the chlorothalonil metabolite r471811 was only recently reported as the predominant pesticide metabolite in groundwater and surface water samples from switzerland kiefer et al 2020 two other studies reported chloridazon desphenyl in between 43 and 77 of surface water samples in germany and with mean concentrations comparable to this study buttiglieri et al 2009 szöcs et al 2017 dimethachlor cga 369873 was previously described as an emerging metabolite in german ground and surface waters in 2013 but at a much lower concentration median 0 02 µg l for groundwater and surface water vs 0 14 µg l in the present study reemtsma et al 2013 the mean concentrations of some metabolites were two to three orders of magnitude higher than their parent compounds factor 89 530 for metazachlor esa chloridazon desphenyl and dimethachlor cga 369873 table s6 in single samples the concentration of metazachlor esa metolachlor esa terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy and chloridazon desphenyl even exceeded their parent compounds by a factor 1000 table s6 chloridazon desphenyl was previously detected in higher concentrations than chloridazon in the hesse region germany in 2007 buttiglieri et al 2009 the so called relevant metabolites are of the highest regulatory concern as these still cause pesticidal toxic or ecotoxicological effects european commission 2003 among the monitored metabolites the two metazachlor metabolites bh 479 11 and bh 479 9 6 and 0 1 fodloq and terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy 40 fodloq are classified as relevant metabolites banning et al 2019 lawa 2019 furthermore the european food safety authority efsa recently recommended considering all metabolites of chlorothalonil as relevant metabolites kiefer et al 2020 chlorothalonil r471811 median 0 29 µg l was also classified as relevant in switzerland bundesamt für landwirtschaft 2020 especially the high fods of the relevant metabolites of chlorothalonil and terbuthylazine raise concern it should be noted however that due to their mobility and persistence also non relevant metabolites in surface water can affect water quality and the downstream use of surface water e g as a resource for drinking water via bank filtration 3 2 effects of rainfall on the frequency of detection and concentrations previous studies more limited in pesticide number or spatial extent than this study have shown that pesticide concentrations in streams can be strongly elevated during rainfall compared to those found during dry weather due to inputs by surface runoff macropore flow or subsurface drainage chow et al 2020 liess et al 1999 the large number of sites samples and pesticides of this study allows evaluating the effects of rain events on pesticide export in more detail the total concentration of pesticides in surface waters drastically increased during rainfall events fig 4 a the median increased by one order of magnitude from 0 072 µg l to 0 70 µg l from dry to rain and the 95 percentile from 1 7 to 24 µg l correspondingly also the number of pesticides per sample drastically increased the maximum of the frequency distribution shifted from two pesticides per sample in the dry sample set to 14 pesticides per sample in the rain sample set fig 4c and the mean number of quantified pesticides concentration loq increased from 5 2 pesticides per sample to 14 in rain samples for the detected pesticides concentration lod the number increased from 16 in the dry to 31 in the rain sample set in single rain samples more than 40 different pesticides occurred above their loq correspondingly the mean fodloq for the 76 parent pesticides tripled from 6 9 in the dry samples to 18 6 in the rain samples thus rainfall events lead to a drastic increase in both pesticide concentration and pesticide number in the small agricultural streams this matches with a study on 10 danish streams in which an increase of the total pesticide concentration from 0 19 µg l at base flow to 1 8 µg l at storm flow was recorded rasmussen et al 2015 for a quantitative description of pesticide dynamics it would be useful to calculate rainfall dependent pesticide fluxes wittmer et al 2010 however the continuous recording of water fluxes in the streams as necessary for that purpose was not feasible at the 105 sites under study as this study was directed to studying the effects of pesticide export on stream water quality concentrations are more important than fluxes the more frequent detection of higher concentrations of pesticides during rainfall events is already seen in fig 2 rain blue data points however this trend is not equally strong for all pesticides as visible by comparing the 75 and 90 percentiles of the rain and dry samples for the 76 pesticides figs 5 and s5 as data for 105 sampling sites are included in this comparison these values were expected to be largely independent of site characteristics and mainly relate to physico chemical properties or use characteristics of the pesticides the pesticides 2 4 d terbuthylazine flufenacet metamitron trifloxystrobin mcpa ethofumesate pirimicarb nicosulfuron methiocarb fluroxypyr s metolachlor mecoprop p dimethenamid isoproturon thiacloprid and azoxystrobin exhibited strongly elevated concentrations during rainfall one order of magnitude for both 75 and 90 percentiles compared to dry weather fig 5 fig s7 and table s7 these are mainly substances of medium polarity average logd ow 2 2 and either neutral or with a single negative charge tables s8 s9 and fig s8 the same is true however for the compounds that do not show a clear increase during rain events fig 5 like bentazone clothianidin and diflufenican table s7 contrary to the parent pesticides the summed concentrations of metabolites and the number of detected metabolites per sample were hardly affected by rainfalls fig 4b and d the formation of metabolites by bio transformation takes time so that their occurrence in surface waters is less directly linked to the application period of their parent substances correspondingly the concentrations of the metabolites have been shown to be less influenced by rainfall events and to be largely exported via subsurface as previously shown for the metabolites of dimethenamid atrazine and metolachlor in a headwater catchment gassmann et al 2013 nevertheless marked differences between rain and dry samples were also visible for individual metabolites fig 5 fig s5 and table s7 for example the metabolites terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy flufenacet thiadone metamitron desamino and prothioconazole desthio exhibited one to two orders of magnitude elevated concentrations during rainfall conversely the metabolites metolachlor cga 357704 and metazachlor bh 479 12 were much less concentrated one order of magnitude in surface waters during rain events fig 5 these two metabolites of metolachlor and metazachlor are no primary metabolites but are formed only in later stages of the degradation processes reemtsma et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that their formation requires longer periods of time which are not available when surface runoff occurs shortly after pesticide application but when pesticides and their metabolites infiltrate into the soil these metabolites may therefore reach surface water by groundwater exfiltration kern et al 2011 during rainfall the increased surface runoff dilutes the fraction of groundwater in the surface water and therefore the concentration of these metabolites may decrease the very high polarity of the two metabolites logd ow 4 to 5 and a negative charge of 2 supports the notion that they may be transported via groundwater as sorption to organic as well as inorganic soil constituents should be negligible for such compounds the effects of rainfall events on the concentrations of pesticides and their metabolites in small agricultural streams are illustrated for selected compounds at selected sites in fig 6 the concentrations of flufenacet metamitron mcpa 2 4d terbuthylazine and metazachlor strongly increased during rainfall after application the magnitude of this increase is clearly larger than for their metabolites except terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy the terbuthylazine metabolite largely exceeded the concentration of its parent compound 1 3 orders of magnitude fig 6d however also the metabolites flufenacet thiadone and metamitron desamino showed increased concentrations during rainfall events fig 6a and b in contrast the concentrations of the metabolites of s metolachlor were not increased fig 6f these concentration profiles highlight the strong fluctuation in concentrations evoked by rainfall events in small agricultural streams site specific rain dry ratios for the sum of all pesticides may be used to elaborate on catchment characteristics that support pesticide export into surface water such as slope the distance between fields and the water body or the presence of subsurface drainage systems in addition the consideration of site specific concentration ratios of certain metabolite parent pairs may also provide information on the preferred transport pathway at that site such an extended data analysis may help identify characteristics of catchments that are critical for pesticide export and in this way point to options on how to reduce this export into surface waters 3 3 influence of land use on pesticide concentrations the land use in the 105 catchments under study was categorized into four main groups agriculture forest urban grassland fig s9 and the agricultural area then further divided into crop groups the six most representative crops largest grown area of agricultural land use were wheat corn rape barley vineyard and sugar beet fig s9 many pesticides showed a significant spearman s correlation p 0 05 table s10 with the main crop types grown in the respective catchment e g the concentrations of the herbicides ethofumesate quinmerac and the fungicide epoxiconazole moderately correlated with the percentage of wheat in the respective catchment rs 0 54 0 46 102 sites the herbicide s metolachlor terbuthylazine and nicosulfuron with corn rs 0 37 0 28 91 sites the herbicides propyzamide diflufenican and the fungicide dimoxystrobin correlated moderately positive with areas where rape rs 0 47 0 38 90 sites and the herbicides diflufenican and flurtamone where barley rs 0 47 0 29 85 sites was grown for the vineyard areas a correlation with the fungicides metrafenone boscalid and dimethomorph was found rs 0 79 0 51 20 sites the herbicides metamitron ethofumesate lenacil quinmerac and chloridazon correlated with the area where sugar beet was grown rs 0 60 0 42 47 sites many of these pesticides were also listed for the respective crop by the so called papa survey in germany which collects pesticide application data from selected agricultural farms for 2018 and 2019 julius kühn institute 2020 these results outline the strong link between the agricultural activity in a catchment and the occurrence and concentration of pesticides in the respective stream hence agricultural practice is the key to reduce pesticide concentrations in small streams also the practice in the past years may affect present pesticide loads in streams rasmussen et al 2015 a few pesticides could be linked to urban activities to account for input from sources other than agriculture a few indicator compounds were also monitored such as the pharmaceutical diclofenac and the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole for municipal wastewater discharges and hexamethoxymethylmelamine hmmm for road runoff alhelou et al 2019 reemtsma et al 2010 seitz and winzenbacher 2017 table s10 hmmm rs 0 56 0 61 and the phenoxyacid herbicides mecoprop p rs 0 42 0 49 and although weaker 2 4 d rs 0 27 0 35 showed a significant correlation with the percentage of the urban area but not with the agricultural area these are pesticides that are especially used as a weed killer in urban areas and are also described as an indicator for urban runoff waters jekel et al 2015 raina et al 2011 benzotriazole and diclofenac also correlated with urban land use rs 0 24 0 38 but weaker than hmmm 3 4 frequency of rac exceedances the rac value represents the environmental concentration below which no unacceptable effects on the environment are expected in regulation the approval of plant protection products aims at avoiding rac exceedances by requiring the farmers to implement certain risk management measures such as keeping distances to water bodies however a companion paper analyzing the monitoring data of this study shows that rac exceedances are frequently occurring in small agricultural streams especially during rainfall and outlined the consequences for aquatic invertebrate communities liess et al 2021 a comparison of rac exceedances separately for the dry and rain samples is performed here to assess the relevance of rain events table 1 for the set of 480 samples taken during dry weather conditions racs were exceeded 143 times in 23 of the samples and at 50 of the sites the situation became significantly worse during rainfall events 335 samples then a total of 448 rac exceedances were recorded on average 1 3 times per sample in 60 of the samples fig s10 and at 73 of the 105 sites in other words only 27 of the sampling sites at small agricultural streams were left without a rac exceedance during rainfall during the sampling period april july in two years these data show that rac exceedances in small streams occur widely and frequently although rain events are especially critical rac exceedances also occur frequently during dry weather in that phase only 50 of the sites covered in this study did not show a rac exceedance overall this suggests that streams of small size are especially susceptible to rac exceedances amplified by rain events the almost systematic exceedance of racs questions the approval process of plant protection products that aims at preventing such exceedances three factors may explain the discrepancy between the regulatory aim and agricultural reality a some assumptions underlying the models for predicting environmental concentrations are too optimistic so that pec modeling systematically underestimated the real environmental concentrations bach et al 2017 knäbel et al 2012 b the risk management measures that should be taken in agricultural practice are either not taken or have less benefit than expected with the consequence that concentrations in agricultural streams exceed the pecs on a broad scale and c the application of a plant protection product that was approved several years ago for a certain culture fails to comply with more recently derived lower racs of the respective pesticide liess et al 2021 the rac exceedances encountered in this study also outline the importance of an adequate post approval monitoring for surface waters this would inform to which extent the real world situation agrees to the predictions made in the approval of plant protection products the insecticides thiacloprid clothianidin and fipronil were the three compounds with the most frequent rac exceedances during dry weather as well as during rainfall events table 1 the racs for thiacloprid clothianidin and fipronil are in the low ng l or even pg l range 0 007 0 00077 µg l as these insecticides are also highly toxic to aquatic insects it appears generally challenging to comply with such low racs the eu has reacted with a ban on clothianidin and thiacloprid field applications approval expired in 2019 and 2020 therefore a decline in the concentrations of these two compounds in surface waters may be observed in the future the approval of the insecticide fipronil as seed treatment expired in 2017 already its frequent rac exceedances observed in 2018 and 2019 may be due to the stock of fipronil in the agricultural soils remaining from its previous application previously recommended amount of 10 kg ha in potato the importance of legacy pesticides for current streamwater quality has been outlined earlier rasmussen et al 2015 alternatively the ongoing use of fipronil as a biocide and as a veterinary product may explain these findings this option is corroborated by the correlation of fipronil concentrations with the percentage of urban land use in this study rs 0 39 table s10 the use of fipronil as veterinary flea products was recently suggested to cause elevated concentrations in rivers in england perkins et al 2021 furthermore the carbamate pesticide methiocarb and the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiamethoxam approval expired in the eu in 2019 and 2020 the herbicides lenacil terbuthylazine metolachlor and nicosulfuron also exceeded their rac value in up to 5 of the samples taken during rain events table 1 frequent exceedance of the racs by neonicotinoids has been recognized earlier casado et al 2019 szöcs et al 2017 beyond the 76 pesticides selected for this study another 387 pesticides are approved in the eu european commission 2020 furthermore not all crop cultures could be covered representatively by the 815 samples of this study therefore further pesticides than those listed in table 1 and tables s11 may lead to rac exceedances it may seem obvious to reduce the pesticide burden of agricultural streams by reducing the application of those pesticides with frequent rac exceedances table 1 and recommending using pesticides with a similar application domain but a lower number of exceedances however such a strategy may eventually lead to an increasing frequency of rac exceedance for the substitute with overall little if any positive effect on the pesticide burden of agricultural streams boyd 2018 consequently more holistic approaches have been proposed to reduce the environmental burden of pesticide application topping et al 2020 4 conclusions the total median pesticide concentration at 105 sites in small agricultural streams median catchment size 13 km2 in germany in spring and summer 2018 and 2019 was 0 18 µg l this concentration was considerably higher than recorded during governmental monitoring according to the wfd the local agricultural use was linked to the pesticide concentration in the streams across all sites the fodloq was highest for terbuthylazine flufenacet prosulfocarb s metolachlor and metazachlor for the 76 pesticides of the study fods correlated with their sales quantity and aqueous half lives rainfall induced a strong increase of pesticide concentration by a factor of 10 in the small streams compared to dry weather to a median total concentration of 0 7 µg l also the average number of quantified pesticides increased to 14 per sample concentration increase with rainfall was strongest for 2 4 d factor 35 mcpa and terbuthylazine factor 17 pesticide metabolites occurred in much higher concentrations at dry weather than their parent compound total median 2 0 vs 0 07 µg l but were in general less affected by rain events rac exceedances in small agricultural streams are frequent and widespread they are very high during rainfall events but do also occur frequently during dry weather at 50 of the sites this outlines that the present approval of plant protection products fails to ensure compliance of pesticide concentrations in

16720,few studies have examined the exposure of small streams 30 km2 catchment size to agriculturally used pesticides compared to large rivers a total of 105 sites in 103 small agricultural streams were investigated for 76 pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides and 32 pesticide metabolites in spring and summer over two years 2018 and 2019 during dry weather and rainfall using event driven sampling the median total concentration of the 76 pesticides was 0 18 µg l with 9 pesticides per sample on average n 815 this is significantly higher than monitoring data for larger streams reflecting the close proximity to agricultural fields and the limited dilution by non agricultural waters the frequency of detection of all pesticides correlated with sales quantity and half lives in water terbuthylazine mcpa boscalid and tebuconazole showed the highest median concentrations the median of the total concentration of the 32 metabolites exceeded the pesticide concentration by more than an order of magnitude during dry weather the median total concentration of the 76 pesticides was 0 07 µg l with 5 pesticides per sample on average rainfall events increased the median total pesticide concentration by a factor of 10 to 0 7 µg l and the average number of pesticides per sample to 14 with up to 41 in single samples the concentration increase was particularly strong for 2 4 d mcpa terbuthylazine and nicosulfuron 75 percentile metabolite concentrations were generally less responsive to rainfall except for those of terbuthylazine flufenacet metamitron and prothioconazole the frequent and widespread exceedance of the regulatory acceptable concentrations rac of the 76 pesticides during both dry weather and rainfall suggests that current plant protection product

vary between eu member states and are subject to change if new effect data become available eventually only those applications of plant protection products are approved for which the pec remains below the rac consequently exceedances of racs should not occur pesticide monitoring data can be used to check for compliance with the respective racs and thus serve as reality check for the approaches established in the approval of plant protection products such a reality check needs to consider also ecologically relevant and potentially critical situations and thus to include small agricultural streams and rainfall events to become representative such monitoring would also have to include a large diversity of settings in terms of catchment morphology land use and crops grown in the catchment and to cover diverse weather conditions in this study pesticides were monitored at 105 sites in spring and summer of two years 2018 2019 by a combination of sampling at regular intervals and event driven sampling to account for rain events liess et al 2021 this sampling combines high temporal resolution with high spatial coverage in germany resulting in 800 samples processed in the same way to generate highly comparable concentration data for 76 pesticides and 32 metabolites plus 4 indicator compounds to account for inputs from non agricultural sources this large set of monitoring data is interpreted involving information on the catchments land use crops growth and the physico chemical properties and use characteristics of the pesticides under study this work aims at answering the following questions what are the concentration levels of pesticides and pesticide metabolites in small agricultural streams compared to larger ones during the period of pesticide application how do rainfall events affect pesticide concentrations in these streams which pesticides reacted most sensitively to rainfall events can we explain the concentrations of pesticides based on their physico chemical properties or their use characteristics can the concentrations be predicted from the fraction of agricultural land use in a catchment how do pesticide metabolites compare to their parent compounds do pesticide concentrations during dry weather and rainfalls comply with the concentration levels derived during the approval of plant protection products by answering these questions this study aims at supporting risk assessment as well as risk management of pesticides with a focus on small streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling in total 886 samples were taken in small agricultural streams in spring and summer april to july of 2018 and 2019 covering the application period of intensive pesticide use wick et al 2019 sampling was carried out at 105 sampling sites in 103 streams selected based on catchment size high percentage of agricultural land use and expected low urban influence wick et al 2019 distributed over twelve federal states in germany fig s1 the mean catchment size was 17 6 km2 the sampling strategy comprised regular grab water sampling every third week following the approach employed in monitoring according to wfd and event driven sampling to cover rain events of the regularly taken 551 samples only 480 samples are included in this study these were categorized as taken during dry weather referred to as dry hereafter because less than 10 mm

hexamethoxymethylmelamine hmmm a marker for road runoff and the metabolite r471811 of chlorothalonil fungicide metabolite were included the analyses were carried out with an lc ms ms system involving an agilent 1290 infinity liquid chromatography system coupled to a qtrap6500 tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization esi interface sciex by direct injection of the aqueous samples and multiple reaction monitoring quantification was performed by external calibration in ultrapure water except for the five analytes for which labelled internal standards were added see above details on the analytical method linear calibration range and validation data are provided in the supplement information tables s1 s3 2 4 data analysis for data processing the multiquant software

racs clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid methiocarb and fipronil were quantified using the isotope labeled internal standards listed in table s2 the linear calibration range between the limit of detection lod and 0 75 µg l 1 allowed the quantification of the dry samples if pollutant concentrations exceeded the linear calibration range e g in rain samples the quantification was carried out

and grassland were aggregated at class level and the respective area share was calculated land use and cultivated crops were mapped in situ within a buffer zone reaching 3 km upstream and 500 m to each streamside the four main land use classes were not further differentiated and no pesticide application data for the grassland and forests were available thus only the agriculture and urban land use are further discussed in this manuscript cultivated crops are displayed as the percentage of the agricultural area fig s9 the land use data were tested for correlation spearman s correlation with the measured concentration per site for sites with different land use in 2018 and 2019 the years were considered separately resulting in a total number of 119 observations the median and mean values

detection and concentration ranges of the monitored pesticides a total of 815 samples from 105 sampling sites in 103 small agricultural streams taken in spring and summer of 2018 and 2019 are considered in this study 480 samples denoted as dry 335 samples denoted as rain fig s1 they were analyzed for 76 pesticides 40 herbicides 24 fungicides and 12 insecticides and 32 pesticide metabolites pesticide selection was based on previous monitoring data use and ecotoxicity wick et al 2019 in this set of 50 000 concentration data terbuthylazine flufenacet prosulfocarb and s metolachlor showed the highest frequency of detection fodloq of 40 fig 1 complete list in table s4 considering all values above the lod these compounds were detected in more than 64 of all samples table s4 fods of all pesticides correlated with their sales quantity for germany rs 0 51 p 0 001 and less pronounced with their half lives in water rs 0 28 p 0 05 fig s2 but not with their half lives in soil their water solubility or polarity expressed as logd ow the latter finding may point to the fact that pesticides can be exported from the agricultural field in dissolved form as well as particle bound during runoff events their application amounts and persistence then remain as the decisive factors for the occurrence in agricultural streams a multiple linear regression fig s3 also confirmed the significance of the sales quantity and the half lives in water explaining 32 of the variance this agrees to a previous study for one defined catchment that also found the applied amount as the major determinant of occurrence in adjacent streams although for a lower number of pesticides kreuger and törnqvist 1998 the fodloq in this study with 815 samples were comparable or higher than those reported in an earlier study in germany based on samples taken between 2005 and 2015 as part of the regular monitoring according to the wfd szöcs et al 2017 higher fods are presumably partially due to lower loqs in this study compared to regular monitoring much higher fods were found for picoxystrobin factor 45 prosulfocarb and bromoxynil factor 16 and 13 lower fods were recorded for dimethachlor and isoproturon factor 11 and 5 lower fods than szöcs et al respectively fig s4 the latter may be explained by the fact that the approval of isoproturon ended in 2016 in the eu and that the sales quantity of dimethachlor declined by a factor of 6 between this earlier study and the years 2018 and 2019 bundesamt für verbraucherschutz und lebensmittelsicherheit 2020 the pesticides detected most frequently were also often those determined with the highest median concentration fig 2 terbuthylazine was detected in concentrations ranging up to 0 56 µg l 95 percentile median 0 0056 µg l fig 2 other predominant pesticides in this study were mcpa 95 percentile 0 38 µg l median 0 0035 µg l boscalid tebuconazole s metolachlor dimethenamid flufenacet and fluxapyroxad 95 percentile 0 041 µg l median 0 0013 µg l also for the concentrations determined in the streams a significant correlation with sales quantity rs 0 46 p 0 001 and half lives in water rs 0 26 p 0 001 was found fig s6 for 45 pesticides concentrations measured here could be compared with governmental monitoring data for the years 2018 and 2019 of two federal states in germany these data have a higher share of larger streams fig 3 pesticide concentrations of this study were significantly higher kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 p values in table s5 for 28 federal state a and 25 federal state b of the 45 pesticides the higher concentration may be attributed to i the small stream sizes of this study ii the high number of rain samples or iii the collection of samples only during the application period of most pesticides however within the 105 sites of this study a decrease of pesticide concentrations with increasing catchment size was not visible rs 0 082 p 0 40 for the mean and rs 0 051 p 0 61 for the median this may be due to the limited span of catchment sizes from 9 km2 to 19 km2 for the 25 75 percentile higher concentrations in smaller streams have been reported previously for example in a study on 42 danish streams in three size classes with 1000 samples analyzed this increase was particularly pronounced for the peak concentrations 95 percentiles lorenz et al 2017 taken together the fod data fig 1 and the concentration data fig 3 for the 76 pesticides at the 105 sites confirm the previous notion that pesticide concentrations in small agricultural streams of catchment sizes of 10 km2 and below are not well reflected in the official monitoring program leu et al 2004 szöcs et al 2017 it should be noted in this context that the small streams make up almost 2 3 of the running water in germany bundesamt für naturschutz 2004 the formation of metabolites from parent pesticides is inevitable for non persistent pesticides fenner et al 2013 these metabolites are often more polar as well as mobile and can also be more persistent gassmann et al 2013 monitoring of pesticide metabolites supports the understanding of pesticide fate in agricultural systems the median of the total concentration of the 32 metabolites included in this study was 2 4 µg l and thus exceeded the total pesticide concentration by a factor of 13 given the comparatively low number of metabolites the concentration of all metabolites must be even higher the most frequently detected metabolites in this study originate from chlorothalonil fodloq 94 terbuthylazine chloridazon and dimethachlor fodloq 40 fig s5 the chlorothalonil metabolite r471811 was only recently reported as the predominant pesticide metabolite in groundwater and surface water samples from switzerland kiefer et al 2020 two other studies reported chloridazon desphenyl in between 43 and 77 of surface water samples in germany and with mean concentrations comparable to this study buttiglieri et al 2009 szöcs et al 2017 dimethachlor cga 369873 was previously described as an emerging metabolite in german ground and surface waters in 2013 but at a much lower concentration median 0 02 µg l for groundwater and surface water vs 0 14 µg l in the present study reemtsma et al 2013 the mean concentrations of some metabolites were two to three orders of magnitude higher than their parent compounds factor 89 530 for metazachlor esa chloridazon desphenyl and dimethachlor cga 369873 table s6 in single samples the concentration of metazachlor esa metolachlor esa terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy and chloridazon desphenyl even exceeded their parent compounds by a factor 1000 table s6 chloridazon desphenyl was previously detected in higher concentrations than chloridazon in the hesse region germany in 2007 buttiglieri et al 2009 the so called relevant metabolites are of the highest regulatory concern as these still cause pesticidal toxic or ecotoxicological effects european commission 2003 among the monitored metabolites the two metazachlor metabolites bh 479 11 and bh 479 9 6 and 0 1 fodloq and terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy 40 fodloq are classified as relevant metabolites banning et al 2019 lawa 2019 furthermore the european food safety authority efsa recently recommended considering all metabolites of chlorothalonil as relevant metabolites kiefer et al 2020 chlorothalonil r471811 median 0 29 µg l was also classified as relevant in switzerland bundesamt für landwirtschaft 2020 especially the high fods of the relevant metabolites of chlorothalonil and terbuthylazine raise concern it should be noted however that due to their mobility and persistence also non relevant metabolites in surface water can affect water quality and the downstream use of surface water e g as a resource for drinking water via bank filtration 3 2 effects of rainfall on the frequency of detection and concentrations previous studies more limited in pesticide number or spatial extent than this study have shown that pesticide concentrations in streams can be strongly elevated during rainfall compared to those found during dry weather due to inputs by surface runoff macropore flow or subsurface drainage chow et al 2020 liess et al 1999 the large number of sites samples and pesticides of this study allows evaluating the effects of rain events on pesticide export in more detail the total concentration of pesticides in surface waters drastically increased during rainfall events fig 4 a the median increased by one order of magnitude from 0 072 µg l to 0 70 µg l from dry to rain and the 95 percentile from 1 7 to 24 µg l correspondingly also the number of pesticides per sample drastically increased the maximum of the frequency distribution shifted from two pesticides per sample in the dry sample set to 14 pesticides per sample in the rain sample set fig 4c and the mean number of quantified pesticides concentration loq increased from 5 2 pesticides per sample to 14 in rain samples for the detected pesticides concentration lod the number increased from 16 in the dry to 31 in the rain sample set in single rain samples more than 40 different pesticides occurred above their loq correspondingly the mean fodloq for the 76 parent pesticides tripled from 6 9 in the dry samples to 18 6 in the rain samples thus rainfall events lead to a drastic increase in both pesticide concentration and pesticide number in the small agricultural streams this matches with a study on 10 danish streams in which an increase of the total pesticide concentration from 0 19 µg l at base flow to 1 8 µg l at storm flow was recorded rasmussen et al 2015 for a quantitative description of pesticide dynamics it would be useful to calculate rainfall dependent pesticide fluxes wittmer et al 2010 however the continuous recording of water fluxes in the streams as necessary for that purpose was not feasible at the 105 sites under study as this study was directed to studying the effects of pesticide export on stream water quality concentrations are more important than fluxes the more frequent detection of higher concentrations of pesticides during rainfall events is already seen in fig 2 rain blue data points however this trend is not equally strong for all pesticides as visible by comparing the 75 and 90 percentiles of the rain and dry samples for the 76 pesticides figs 5 and s5 as data for 105 sampling sites are included in this comparison these values were expected to be largely independent of site characteristics and mainly relate to physico chemical properties or use characteristics of the pesticides the pesticides 2 4 d terbuthylazine flufenacet metamitron trifloxystrobin mcpa ethofumesate pirimicarb nicosulfuron methiocarb fluroxypyr s metolachlor mecoprop p dimethenamid isoproturon thiacloprid and azoxystrobin exhibited strongly elevated concentrations during rainfall one order of magnitude for both 75 and 90 percentiles compared to dry weather fig 5 fig s7 and table s7 these are mainly substances of medium polarity average logd ow 2 2 and either neutral or with a single negative charge tables s8 s9 and fig s8 the same is true however for the compounds that do not show a clear increase during rain events fig 5 like bentazone clothianidin and diflufenican table s7 contrary to the parent pesticides the summed concentrations of metabolites and the number of detected metabolites per sample were hardly affected by rainfalls fig 4b and d the formation of metabolites by bio transformation takes time so that their occurrence in surface waters is less directly linked to the application period of their parent substances correspondingly the concentrations of the metabolites have been shown to be less influenced by rainfall events and to be largely exported via subsurface as previously shown for the metabolites of dimethenamid atrazine and metolachlor in a headwater catchment gassmann et al 2013 nevertheless marked differences between rain and dry samples were also visible for individual metabolites fig 5 fig s5 and table s7 for example the metabolites terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy flufenacet thiadone metamitron desamino and prothioconazole desthio exhibited one to two orders of magnitude elevated concentrations during rainfall conversely the metabolites metolachlor cga 357704 and metazachlor bh 479 12 were much less concentrated one order of magnitude in surface waters during rain events fig 5 these two metabolites of metolachlor and metazachlor are no primary metabolites but are formed only in later stages of the degradation processes reemtsma et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that their formation requires longer periods of time which are not available when surface runoff occurs shortly after pesticide application but when pesticides and their metabolites infiltrate into the soil these metabolites may therefore reach surface water by groundwater exfiltration kern et al 2011 during rainfall the increased surface runoff dilutes the fraction of groundwater in the surface water and therefore the concentration of these metabolites may decrease the very high polarity of the two metabolites logd ow 4 to 5 and a negative charge of 2 supports the notion that they may be transported via groundwater as sorption to organic as well as inorganic soil constituents should be negligible for such compounds the effects of rainfall events on the concentrations of pesticides and their metabolites in small agricultural streams are illustrated for selected compounds at selected sites in fig 6 the concentrations of flufenacet metamitron mcpa 2 4d terbuthylazine and metazachlor strongly increased during rainfall after application the magnitude of this increase is clearly larger than for their metabolites except terbuthylazine desethyl 2 hydroxy the terbuthylazine metabolite largely exceeded the concentration of its parent compound 1 3 orders of magnitude fig 6d however also the metabolites flufenacet thiadone and metamitron desamino showed increased concentrations during rainfall events fig 6a and b in contrast the concentrations of the metabolites of s metolachlor were not increased fig 6f these concentration profiles highlight the strong fluctuation in concentrations evoked by rainfall events in small agricultural streams site specific rain dry ratios for the sum of all pesticides may be used to elaborate on catchment characteristics that support pesticide export into surface water such as slope the distance between fields and the water body or the presence of subsurface drainage systems in addition the consideration of site specific concentration ratios of certain metabolite parent pairs may also provide information on the preferred transport pathway at that site such an extended data analysis may help identify characteristics of catchments that are critical for pesticide export and in this way point to options on how to reduce this export into surface waters 3 3 influence of land use on pesticide concentrations the land use in the 105 catchments under study was categorized into four main groups agriculture forest urban grassland fig s9 and the agricultural area then further divided into crop groups the six most representative crops largest grown area of agricultural land use were wheat corn rape barley vineyard and sugar beet fig s9 many pesticides showed a significant spearman s correlation p 0 05 table s10 with the main crop types grown in the respective catchment e g the concentrations of the herbicides ethofumesate quinmerac and the fungicide epoxiconazole moderately correlated with the percentage of wheat in the respective catchment rs 0 54 0 46 102 sites the herbicide s metolachlor terbuthylazine and nicosulfuron with corn rs 0 37 0 28 91 sites the herbicides propyzamide diflufenican and the fungicide dimoxystrobin correlated moderately positive with areas where rape rs 0 47 0 38 90 sites and the herbicides diflufenican and flurtamone where barley rs 0 47 0 29 85 sites was grown for the vineyard areas a correlation with the fungicides metrafenone boscalid and dimethomorph was found rs 0 79 0 51 20 sites the herbicides metamitron ethofumesate lenacil quinmerac and chloridazon correlated with the area where sugar beet was grown rs 0 60 0 42 47 sites many of these pesticides were also listed for the respective crop by the so called papa survey in germany which collects pesticide application data from selected agricultural farms for 2018 and 2019 julius kühn institute 2020 these results outline the strong link between the agricultural activity in a catchment and the occurrence and concentration of pesticides in the respective stream hence agricultural practice is the key to reduce pesticide concentrations in small streams also the practice in the past years may affect present pesticide loads in streams rasmussen et al 2015 a few pesticides could be linked to urban activities to account for input from sources other than agriculture a few indicator compounds were also monitored such as the pharmaceutical diclofenac and the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole for municipal wastewater discharges and hexamethoxymethylmelamine hmmm for road runoff alhelou et al 2019 reemtsma et al 2010 seitz and winzenbacher 2017 table s10 hmmm rs 0 56 0 61 and the phenoxyacid herbicides mecoprop p rs 0 42 0 49 and although weaker 2 4 d rs 0 27 0 35 showed a significant correlation with the percentage of the urban area but not with the agricultural area these are pesticides that are especially used as a weed killer in urban areas and are also described as an indicator for urban runoff waters jekel et al 2015 raina et al 2011 benzotriazole and diclofenac also correlated with urban land use rs 0 24 0 38 but weaker than hmmm 3 4 frequency of rac exceedances the rac value represents the environmental concentration below which no unacceptable effects on the environment are expected in regulation the approval of plant protection products aims at avoiding rac exceedances by requiring the farmers to implement certain risk management measures such as keeping distances to water bodies however a companion paper analyzing the monitoring data of this study shows that rac exceedances are frequently occurring in small agricultural streams especially during rainfall and outlined the consequences for aquatic invertebrate communities liess et al 2021 a comparison of rac exceedances separately for the dry and rain samples is performed here to assess the relevance of rain events table 1 for the set of 480 samples taken during dry weather conditions racs were exceeded 143 times in 23 of the samples and at 50 of the sites the situation became significantly worse during rainfall events 335 samples then a total of 448 rac exceedances were recorded on average 1 3 times per sample in 60 of the samples fig s10 and at 73 of the 105 sites in other words only 27 of the sampling sites at small agricultural streams were left without a rac exceedance during rainfall during the sampling period april july in two years these data show that rac exceedances in small streams occur widely and frequently although rain events are especially critical rac exceedances also occur frequently during dry weather in that phase only 50 of the sites covered in this study did not show a rac exceedance overall this suggests that streams of small size are especially susceptible to rac exceedances amplified by rain events the almost systematic exceedance of racs questions the approval process of plant protection products that aims at preventing such exceedances three factors may explain the discrepancy between the regulatory aim and agricultural reality a some assumptions underlying the models for predicting environmental concentrations are too optimistic so that pec modeling systematically underestimated the real environmental concentrations bach et al 2017 knäbel et al 2012 b the risk management measures that should be taken in agricultural practice are either not taken or have less benefit than expected with the consequence that concentrations in agricultural streams exceed the pecs on a broad scale and c the application of a plant protection product that was approved several years ago for a certain culture fails to comply with more recently derived lower racs of the respective pesticide liess et al 2021 the rac exceedances encountered in this study also outline the importance of an adequate post approval monitoring for surface waters this would inform to which extent the real world situation agrees to the predictions made in the approval of plant protection products the insecticides thiacloprid clothianidin and fipronil were the three compounds with the most frequent rac exceedances during dry weather as well as during rainfall events table 1 the racs for thiacloprid clothianidin and fipronil are in the low ng l or even pg l range 0 007 0 00077 µg l as these insecticides are also highly toxic to aquatic insects it appears generally challenging to comply with such low racs the eu has reacted with a ban on clothianidin and thiacloprid field applications approval expired in 2019 and 2020 therefore a decline in the concentrations of these two compounds in surface waters may be observed in the future the approval of the insecticide fipronil as seed treatment expired in 2017 already its frequent rac exceedances observed in 2018 and 2019 may be due to the stock of fipronil in the agricultural soils remaining from its previous application previously recommended amount of 10 kg ha in potato the importance of legacy pesticides for current streamwater quality has been outlined earlier rasmussen et al 2015 alternatively the ongoing use of fipronil as a biocide and as a veterinary product may explain these findings this option is corroborated by the correlation of fipronil concentrations with the percentage of urban land use in this study rs 0 39 table s10 the use of fipronil as veterinary flea products was recently suggested to cause elevated concentrations in rivers in england perkins et al 2021 furthermore the carbamate pesticide methiocarb and the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiamethoxam approval expired in the eu in 2019 and 2020 the herbicides lenacil terbuthylazine metolachlor and nicosulfuron also exceeded their rac value in up to 5 of the samples taken during rain events table 1 frequent exceedance of the racs by neonicotinoids has been recognized earlier casado et al 2019 szöcs et al 2017 beyond the 76 pesticides selected for this study another 387 pesticides are approved in the eu european commission 2020 furthermore not all crop cultures could be covered representatively by the 815 samples of this study therefore further pesticides than those listed in table 1 and tables s11 may lead to rac exceedances it may seem obvious to reduce the pesticide burden of agricultural streams by reducing the application of those pesticides with frequent rac exceedances table 1 and recommending using pesticides with a similar application domain but a lower number of exceedances however such a strategy may eventually lead to an increasing frequency of rac exceedance for the substitute with overall little if any positive effect on the pesticide burden of agricultural streams boyd 2018 consequently more holistic approaches have been proposed to reduce the environmental burden of pesticide application topping et al 2020 4 conclusions the total median pesticide concentration at 105 sites in small agricultural streams median catchment size 13 km2 in germany in spring and summer 2018 and 2019 was 0 18 µg l this concentration was considerably higher than recorded during governmental monitoring according to the wfd the local agricultural use was linked to the pesticide concentration in the streams across all sites the fodloq was highest for terbuthylazine flufenacet prosulfocarb s metolachlor and metazachlor for the 76 pesticides of the study fods correlated with their sales quantity and aqueous half lives rainfall induced a strong increase of pesticide concentration by a factor of 10 in the small streams compared to dry weather to a median total concentration of 0 7 µg l also the average number of quantified pesticides increased to 14 per sample concentration increase with rainfall was strongest for 2 4 d factor 35 mcpa and terbuthylazine factor 17 pesticide metabolites occurred in much higher concentrations at dry weather than their parent compound total median 2 0 vs 0 07 µg l but were in general less affected by rain events rac exceedances in small agricultural streams are frequent and widespread they are very high during rainfall events but do also occur frequently during dry weather at 50 of the sites this outlines that the present approval of plant protection products fails to ensure compliance of pesticide concentrations in small agricultural streams current official monitoring strategies in germany underestimate the input of pesticides into small streams declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16721,sludge granulation in continuous flow systems is an emerging technology to intensify existing activated sludge infrastructure for nutrient removal in these systems the nutrient removal contributions and partitioning of microbial functions between granules and flocs can offer insights into process implementations to this end a reactor system that simulates the continuous flow environment using an equal amount of initial granule and floc biomass was investigated the two operational strategies for maintaining granule growth in the continuous flow system were a the higher solids retention time srt for the granules versus flocs as well as b selective feeding of carbon to the granules the srt of the large granule fractions 425 µm lg and floc small granule fractions 425 µm fsg were controlled at 20 and 2 7 6 0 days respectively long term operation of the hybrid granule floc system achieved high po4 3 and nh4 removal efficiencies higher polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao activity was observed in the fsg than lg while ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob activities were similar in the two biomass fractions nitrite shunt was observed in the fsg possibly due to out competition by the high nob activity in lg more importantly washing out the fsg caused a reduction in lg s aob and pao activity indicating a possible dependency of lg on fsg for maintaining its nutrient removal capacity our findings highlighted the partitioning and potential competition cooperation of key microbial functional groups between lg and fsg facilitating nutrient removal in a

acids vss volatile suspended solids 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is one of the major latest innovations in wastewater treatment for enhanced nutrient removal the fast settling and high thickening properties of ags allow for the increase in solids inventory without additional secondary clarifiers pronk et al 2015 ags technology is therefore an attractive alternative for future expansions at any wastewater facilities that must meet increased capacity with population growth but are limited by space the current ags technology is based on sequencing batch reactors sbrs where plug flow feeding and washout of slow settling particles i e tall reactors with short settling time can be conveniently applied these selection stresses are needed for sludge granulation but cannot be easily adapted in continuous flow systems cfs where reactors are shallow and completely mixed making the integration of ags technology into existing wastewater infrastructure an ongoing challenge research efforts are therefore underway to develop alternative processes that enable granule growth in cfs the main strategy utilized thus far has been based on settling velocity where fast settling particles are continuously separated from the slow settling particles and retained in the system this washout of slow settling particles is accomplished with equipment such as solids liquid separator external settler or other designs of similar concept which are reviewed in detail by kent et al 2018 more recently sun et al 2019 demonstrated granulation in a pilot scale cfs with ten completely stirred tank reactors in series to mimic plug flow condition and two external settlers to wash out the slow settling particles the inclusion of the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process may further improve the feasibility of achieving granulation in cfs ebpr based systems select for slow growing microorganisms such as polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms pao and gao respectively that form denser and stronger granules than ordinary heterotrophs de kreuk van loosdrecht 2004 figdore et al 2018 these benefits of pao gao granules are well established in ags sbrs and have also been utilized for granule selection in some continuous flow studies devlin oleszkiewicz 2018 li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 moreover high abundance of pao gao based granules was unexpectedly observed at existing full scale continuous flow ebpr plants suggesting the feasibility of widespread adaptation of ags at cfs where ebpr capacity is already present wei et al 2020 leveraging the growth of paos in granules may be a simple way to integrate ags technology in cfs various studies had demonstrated this concept in continuous flow ebpr systems by adding a granule floc separator that receives a portion of the mixed liquor flow from which lighter particles are selectively wasted whereas larger particles are retained and recycled to the anaerobic zone carter 2020 stinson et al 2019 sturm et al 2017 these continuous flow configurations can have varying floc granule separation methods but share the common strategy of favoring growth of paos within the granules the principle of ags revolves around granulation but flocs still constitute a major portion 20 40 of the biomass in ags systems and is important for treating non diffusible substrates and removing colloids to achieve low effluent tss concentrations layer et al 2019 it is therefore expected that regardless of the various cfs configurations with integrated ags it will be a hybrid system consisting of both granules and flocs and their respective roles in system performance must be better understood in ags sbr systems flocs and granules have different solids retention time srts due to the selective retainment of larger particles ali et al 2019 a similar selection pressure is imposed when cfs are modified with a granule floc separator where flocculent granular srts can be decoupled to enable selective wasting of small particles various process schemes and methods for granule floc separations have been proposed and are being tested in large scale carter 2020 stinson et al 2019 sturm et al 2017 but there is a lack of fundamental knowledge in the role of flocs or the microbial segregation dependencies between flocs and granules in these systems in this study a reactor system simulating a continuous flow environment was inoculated with a combined granule floc biomass and operated for 157 days selective feeding of carbon to the granules was adopted and srts of the large small particles were differentially controlled the primary goal of this study was to understand differences in nutrient removal performance partitioning of functional groups and microbial community structure between small large particle fractions in continuous flow systems integrated with granular sludge based on the results a secondary goal was to hypothesize potential competitions and dependencies between flocs granules and to inform implementation of granular sludge in cfs 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental phases the study included five experimental phases with two operational modes as listed in table 1 the two operational modes ags sbr and continuous flow simulation are described in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 initially the reactor was operated in ags sbr mode with granular sludge only pre experiment phase then phase i started by switching to the continuous flow simulation mode in which we continued the operation of the granular sludge column but added a second reactor for floc recycling purposes during the switch to continuous flow operation 2000 mg l of flocculent mlss were added to the original 2000 mg l of granular mlss the flocculent sludge was collected from the city of puyallup water pollution control plant wa usa an anoxic aerobic nitrogen removal facility a 425 µm sieve was used to separate large small particles to decouple the srt of granules flocs this slightly larger cutoff size than the original definition of 0 2 mm for aerobic granules de kreuk et al 2007 was chosen initially to ensure that no large flocs were included in the granular category srt of the 425 µm size fraction was controlled at 20 days for the entire study while srt of the 425 µm size fraction were varied for phase i iii table 1 methodology for srt control is detailed in si 1 2 after phase iii the reactor was returned to ags sbr mode floc removed phase the same synthetic wastewater feed with acetate propionate as sole carbon source was used for all phases the feed concentrations were 433 mg l cod 42 mg l nh4 n and 21 mg l po4 3 p detailed composition listed in si 1 3 for all phases the do and ph during the aerobic phase were controlled at 2 0 mg l and 7 5 respectively and temperature was controlled at 16 c 2 1 1 ags sbr mode a 3 l reactor column column reactor was operated in sbr cycles consisting of 60 min anaerobic feeding 900 ml 13 min idle 4 min dilution water fill 750 ml with deionized water 242 min aeration 3 min settling 5 min decant 55 volume exchange ratio and 3 min idle instead of plug flow feeding through the sludge bed as is typical in ags sbrs the reactor was mixed continuously with n2 gas during anaerobic feeding anaerobic mixing was done to better simulate a continuous flow feeding condition similar to previous research nguyen quoc et al 2021 and to avoid a substrate gradient where larger particles are exposed to higher carbon concentrations 2 1 2 continuous flow simulation mode the continuous flow operation was set up to simulate conditions in a conceptual hybrid granule floc process scheme fig s1a which is a conventional anaerobic aerobic process except 55 of the mixed liquor flow is routed to a granule separator where particles of different sizes are partitioned from the granule separator larger particles are recycled to the anaerobic zone whereas lighter fraction are recycled to the aerobic zone this operation allows for 1 bypassing 55 of the flocs away from the anaerobic zone to achieve selective feeding of carbon to the granules and 2 decoupling controls of flocculent granular srts to simulate this conceptual scheme in the lab the same column reactor and cycles as the ags sbr mode were used but with the following modifications 1 decant from the column reactor top 55 of volume was pumped to a side reactor floc reactor to settle for 60 mins while sludge remained in the column reactor was fed anaerobically and 2 after the anaerobic feeding idle period effluent was withdrawn from the top of floc reactor and the remaining sludge was pumped back to the column reactor fig s1b deciphers a detailed schematic of reactor operations 2 2 biomass specific activity tests batch tests were conducted for 425 µm and 425 µm size fraction separately to determine the maximum specific ammonia and nitrite oxidation rates sar and snr respectively and the specific phosphorus release rate spr sar and snr tests were done at air saturation and spr test was done anaerobically briefly a 150 ml biomass sample was spiked with 20 mg nh4 n l ammonia 10 mg no2 n l or 90 mg cod l acetate then monitored for changes in ammonia nitrite or phosphate concentrations over time for the sar snr and spr test respectively the specific activities were determined from the slope of concentrations versus time and normalized to g volatile solids see si 1 4 for detailed methods 2 3 analytical methods suspended and volatile solids tss and vss were analyzed according to standard methods 2540d and 2540e apha 2005 respectively the sludge volume index was determined from the settled volume ml of a mixed liquor sample after 5 and 30 min settling in a graduated cylinder divided by g tss svi5 and svi30 respectively ammonia iso 15923 1 nitrite epa method 354 1 and phosphate epa method 365 1 concentrations were measured using the gallerytm automated photometric analyzer thermo fisher scientific acetate and propionate concentrations were analyzed with an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 system with the ionpac ice as6 column thermo scientific granule and floc morphologies were observed at 6x 10x magnification under a zeiss stemi 508 stereomicroscope in darkfield mode particle size distribution of 425 µm fraction was obtained by sieving analysis si 1 5 2 4 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics samples were collected at the end of each experimental phase and dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy powerbiofilm kit following the manufacturer s procedure except that homogenization was performed using a fastprep 24 mp biomedicals usa at 4 m s for 30 s the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers 515f y 926r parada et al 2016 the pcr products were sequenced on an illumina miseq in 2 300bp mode by bgi genomics hong kong and the molecular research lab texas usa amplicon reads were processed following the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm 2 dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 v 1 16 implemented in r v 4 0 2 parameters used for data trimming and filtering are detailed in si 1 6 taxonomy of the sequence variants were assigned against the silva project s v 132 database using the ribosomal database project classifier wang et al 2007 all amplicon sequence variants asv of a phyla with less than

fluorescence in situ hybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted on granule slices to observe the distribution of ammonia oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob and nob respectively detailed methods and the fish probes used can be found in si 1 8 3 results 3 1 system performance the overall performance data are plotted in fig 1 and the typical cycle profiles of nutrient concentrations are shown in fig 2 in the pre experimental phase the average effluent ammonia concentration of the ags reactor was 3 7 1 0 mg n l with 91 nh4 removal efficiency as soon as the continuous flow simulation started phase i the effluent ammonia dropped below 0 05 mg n l while the effluent nitrate increased to around 10 mg n l fig 1b complete nitrification was sustained for the rest of the study based on the low effluent ammonia nitrite concentrations except a brief increase at the end of phase ii the reactor did not have an anoxic phase and thus denitrification took place within the anoxic layer of the granules during the aerobic phase via simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd it was estimated that roughly 11 5 of the nitrogen was removed via snd see s2 1 for calculations denitrification also occurred during the anaerobic phase of a reactor cycle where any remaining nitrate was removed with the influent carbon as electron donor fig 2d p removal performance was stable except for a period of perturbation between phase ii and iii grey highlighted area in fig 1a caused by an error during carbon media preparation stable reactor performance was attained again before phase iii began excluding the period of operational issues the system achieved removal efficiencies of 96 2 98 9 for po4 3 and 99 1 99 9 for nh4 table s5 due to the higher granular srt 20 days than flocculent srt 6 4 and 2 7 days the mlvss of the 425 µm fraction were always significantly lower than the granule mlvss fig 1c after phase iii the solids withdrawn from the column reactor were wasted instead of recycled back into the column hence increasing the effluent tss fig 1d exactly one srt after this operational change elevated concentrations of po4 3 started occurring in the effluent the ebpr performance continued to deteriorate for 7 more days and reactor operation was terminated 3 2 rapid granulation of flocs the amount of small particles decanted to the floc reactor sharply decreased from 50 at the start of phase i to 13 in just 10 days fig s3 while the svi5 svi30 ratio dropped from 1 9 to 1 3 fig s4 indicating rapid densification of the flocs this observation was supported by microscopic images showing that flocs became small granules exhibiting a dense core with semi spherical morphologies fig s5a due to the observation that the 425 µm fraction consisted of both flocs and small granules any solids 425 µm are termed flocs and small granules fsg and solids 425 µm are termed large granules lg lg and fsg had similar ash content which averaged 35 2 6 and 36 4 7 respectively the short granulation time for the flocs was likely enabled by the added nucleation sites from breakage of lg and pao enrichment in the fsg discussed in si 2 2 as the flocs granulated the amount of biomass bypassing the anaerobic phase became minimal which created a condition where fsg and lg directly competed for carbon in the anaerobic phase 3 3 physical characteristics of granules the high settleability of lg was maintained throughout the experimental period as indicated with an svi5 of 66 ml g at the end of phase iii a reduction in granule size was indicated by the disappearance of the 2 mm size fraction since phase ii fig s6 which was also apparent from the micrographs fig s5b the density of lg reduced from 1016 kg m3 in the pre experimental phase down to 1008 kg m3 by end of phase iii which was still within the range of typical density observed for granular sludge bassin et al 2012 3 4 microbial community the relative 16s rrna gene abundance of the top abundant genera is shown in fig 3 the microbial community between lg and fsg appeared to be similar fig s7 showing significant differences for merely 3 out of the 362 genera p 0 03 stamp and the magnitude of differences were low 0 15 fig s8 relative abundances of the key microbial functional groups fig s9 showed that the putative paos during phase i iii included candidatus accumulibacter accumulibacter 18 0 37 1 and dechloromonas 9 3 25 5 the pao phenotype of dechloromonas has been confirmed by many studies petriglieri et al 2021 terashima et al 2016 but some members can behave according to the gao phenotype ahn et al 2007 mcilroy et al 2016 it should be noted that the relative abundance of dechloromonas is known to be overestimated with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing which can yield 10 folds more abundance than quantification with fish stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the only ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob genus detected in phase i iii was nitrosomonas 0 04 0 79 while nitrospira 0 0 1 9 and candidatus nitrotoga nitrotoga 0 06 0 33 were the two nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob present analysis using comammox specific primers indicated that the nitrospira genus consisted of canonical nob species and not comammox fig s10 to investigate the deterioration of ebpr performance after termination of floc recycling the microbial community of phases i iii and the flocs removed phase were compared the comparison showed a decrease in accumulibacter abundance p 0 043 fig s11 while the relative abundances of leptospira p 0 00001 defluviimonas p 0 00002 and an unclassified genus under the sphingobacteriales order p 0 0009 increased 3 5 specific po4 p release rates the spr remained constant for lg as expected with a constant srt at 20 days the spr of fsg was higher than the lg for phases i and ii by 47 and 57 respectively fig 4 in phase iii the fsg srt was reduced to 2 7 days which may explain the 38 reduction in fsg s spr as the operating srt approached the minimum srt for ebpr of around 1 5 2 5 days at 16 c brdjanovic et al 1998 mamais jenkins 1992 as mentioned in section 3 1 the ebpr performance failed one srt after termination of floc recycling a p release activity test done on the reactor biomass right before ending reactor operations showed an spr of 27 8 mgp gvss hr which was a 52 reduction compared to phase iii 3 6 maximum specific nh4 and no2 oxidation rates the sars of lg and fsg were similar in phases i and ii the changes in snr did not follow a clear trend fig 5 b but it was obvious that the snr was higher for lg than fsg for all phases by a factor of 2 3 nitrospira was the dominant nob except in phase ii where nitrotoga became dominant in the fsg and was as abundant as nitrospira in lg fig 5b the dominance of nitrotoga overlapped with the highest bulk nitrite concentrations during phase ii fig 2c which corroborates with other studies showing dominance of nitrotoga over nitrospira at higher nitrite availability kinnunen et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 although having the same range of maximum specific activities nitrotoga have a lower affinity for nitrite and higher tolerance for free nitrous acid than nitrospira kitzinger et al 2018 wegen et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 which may explain the higher nitrotoga abundance at higher nitrite concentrations in phase iii the sar decreased substantially for fsg due to the srt drop to 2 7 days which was also accompanied by a 27 sar reduction in the lg based on the respective mlvss and specific activities the contributions of fsg and lg to the total ammonia oxidation capacity were determined fig s12 which shows that fsg contributed only 3 5 of the capacity in phase iii 3 7 specific nob aob activity ratios to investigate the reasons behind the higher snr rate in lg versus fsg the ratios of maximum specific nitrite to ammonia oxidation rates or nob aob activity ratios are plotted in fig 6 along with theoretical ratios estimated for the fully nitrifying condition the theoretical ratios were calculated from µmax nob µmax aob using literature values while assuming the same endogenous decay for aob nob and that nitrite produced by aob was the only nitrogen source for nob si 2 3 for fsg the experimental nob aob activity ratios were 14 56 lower than the theoretical values for the fully nitrifying condition whereas for lg the observed ratios were within 6 for phase i and 65 67 higher for phase ii if compared to the fully nitrifying condition 4 discussion 4 1 carbon competition between granules and flocs here we evaluated the contributions of granules and flocs to the nutrient removal performance of a cfs where the growth of granules was favored by maintaining a low floc srt and separating a portion of the flocs from the anaerobic feed phase in full scale this concept could be implemented by sending the granule fraction from a granule floc separator to the anaerobic zone and the lighter fraction from the clarifier underflow to the aerobic phase fig s1a the fraction of biomass that bypassed the anaerobic phase via density separation was eventually low due to the rapid granulation of flocs thus creating a condition where paos in lg and fsg directly competed for carbon in the anaerobic phase this situation would be representative of a full scale system where granule and floc separation can be achieved only partially hence exposing flocs occasionally to anaerobic carbon addition the consumption of carbon by paos in the fsg reduced the bulk liquid substrate concentration and diffusion gradient into the granule core leading to disintegration of lg and a gradual decrease in average granule size the reduction in granule size led to a higher aerobic zone volume fraction at a set bulk do level nguyen quoc et al 2021 which increased the sar and thus also the nitrate concentration in the reactor fig 1b it should be noted that the initial increase in ammonia oxidation efficiency at the beginning of phase i was due to the higher total mlvss after the addition of flocs into the reactor fig 1c which resulted in immediate increase of effluent nitrate concentration after the total mlvss reduced and stabilized around 1500 mg l by mid phase i the ammonia oxidation capacity of the system was maintained due to the increase of sar in both fsg and lg fig 5a in nereda type sbr systems the remaining nitrate at the end of the aeration phase is not mixed with the influent carbon due to plug flow feeding hence allowing for anaerobic conditions even if snd is incomplete weissbrodt et al 2017 to simulate continuous flow conditions the anaerobic phase of our system was mixed the simultaneous presence of nitrate and carbon allowed for anoxic condition that favored the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers as confirmed with 0 mg l no3 n measured at the end of anaerobic phase fig 2d some strains of the defluviimonas and emticicia genera can perform denitrification foesel et al 2011 saha chakrabarti 2006 and their gradual increase in relative abundance from phase i to phase iii fig 3 corresponds to the observed increase in heterotrophic denitrification activities on the contrary the relative abundance of zoogloea a putative denitrifier and pha accumulating organism nierychlo et al 2020 gradually reduced zoogloea has been suggested as an important player in granule formation by producing specific eps larsen et al 2008 seviour et al 2012 the reason for their gradual disappearance in our system remains unclear but may correspond to a change in eps composition and or their ecological niche as large granules disintegrated in addition to competing with paos present in the flocs paos in lg also had to compete with heterotrophic denitrifiers for carbon during the anaerobic phase due to the presence of nitrate this carbon consumption by the denitrifiers caused a lower substrate diffusion gradient into the core of granules resulting in a weakened granule structure and further contributing to their size reduction however the settling characteristics of the lg were maintained despite their reduction in size and density we propose that this was likely due to the high ebpr performance and high pao enrichment within the granules pao based granules have higher settling characteristics than ordinary heterotrophic granules due to the higher density of polyphosphate and the slow growing metabolism of pao leads to smooth granular morphology that further contributes to a fast settling rate figdore et al 2018 winkler et al 2013b our results indicate that due to the diluted substrate concentrations competition by flocs and direct contact of nitrate with carbon granulation in cfs can be somewhat challenging but still achievable strategies such as using pao enriched granules as the initial seed and bypassing flocs from the anaerobic zone can be applied to maintain granule stability nitrate recycled to the anaerobic zone should be minimized as in the case for all ebpr activated sludge processes in full scale applications the low diffusible carbon fraction of real wastewater would make granulation even more challenging layer et al 2019 the recommendation is therefore to implement process schemes that increase the substrate concentrations e g mixed liquor fermentation to support granulation in full scale cfs 4 2 partitioning of microbial activity between fsg and lg despite similar microbial composition the microbial community between fsg and lg were similar based on 16s rrna gene sequencing fig s7 and s8 which algins with other studies layer et al 2019 liu tay 2012 winkler et al 2013a our system was unique such that the granular srt 20 days and flocculent srt 6 4 and 2 7 days were manually decoupled and carefully controlled and thus a similar microbial composition between granules and flocs was not expected in a full scale ags sbr ali et al 2019 found a lack of species sorting between flocs 0 2 mm and small granules 0 2 1 mm due to their similar srts 6 7 days whereas large granules 1 mm had a significantly different microbial composition but at much higher srt of 142 days therefore it is possible that the difference in srts for fsg and lg in this study was too small to allow for a strong partitioning of core microbial communities between different sized aggregates in addition previous research has shown that in a continuous flow reactor there can be dynamic and random processes of attachment detachment aggregation and breakage between flocs and granules zhou et al 2014 this constant exchange of biomass between flocs and granules could also explain their similar microbial composition despite the difference in their srts although the 16s rrna gene sequencing results indicated a similar overall microbial community between the fsg and lg partitioning of nutrient removal activities was revealed by activity batch tests i e fsg had lower nob activities and higher pao activities than lg these observations of microbial activity segregations led to insights for implementations of granular sludge technology in continuous flow systems discussed in sections 4 1 4 3 and 4 4 which would have been overlooked if molecular sequencing was the only tool utilized indeed 16s rrna gene sequencing is a useful method for obtaining high level microbial community compositions but the compositional nature of the data cannot fully determine how the absolute abundance of individual taxa varies among samples barlow et al 2020 our results highlighted the importance of conducting physiological activity tests in addition to molecular sequencing to elucidate nutrient removal partitioning in heterogenous microenvironments e g granules versus flocs within a mixed culture 4 3 nitrite shunt in smaller particles the lower nob aob activity ratios in the fsg versus lg was an interesting observation as nob suppression in wwtps can lead to significant savings in aeration and carbon costs for lg the observed nob aob ratios were either similar to phase i or higher than phase ii values calculated for a fully nitrifying condition fig 6b the higher observed nob aob ratios versus the fully nitrifying values in phase ii suggested that the growth of nob was uncoupled from the nitrite supply of aob which can be enabled by nitrite produced via partial denitrification by other bacteria or the decay products in the anoxic layer of lg winkler et al 2015 the reasoning for why this uncoupled nob growth from aob was only observed in phase ii requires further research for fsg on the other hand the nob aob activity ratios were lower than the fully nitrifying condition indicating suppression of nob the inhibition effect of free ammonia fa could be a contributing factor as nob in the fsg were more exposed to bulk liquid ammonia concentrations whereas mass diffusion limitation would provide a more protected environment for the nob in lg kent et al 2019 observed a similar trend of decreasing nob aob activity ratios with decreasing granule size in a continuous flow ags reactor and showed that smaller granules were more sensitive to fa inhibition based on the ammonia concentration profile fig 2b and the operational temperature ph the fa concentrations in our system were in the 0 05 0 1 mg nh3 n l range for half of the aerobic phase however the inhibition effect of fa on nitrospira can vary widely ranging from an inhibition threshold of 0 04 0 08 mg nh3 n l up to no inhibition at 10 mg nh3 n l possibly due to genus level ecophysiological diversity and other variations such as short term effect biomass acclimation and competition with other microbial groups blackburne et al 2007 simm et al 2006 ushiki et al 2017 in addition nitrotoga may tolerate high fa concentrations 200 mg nh3 n l li et al 2020 indicating that fa inhibition may not be the reason for nob suppression in the fsg for phase ii during which nitrotoga was the only nob genus detected previous research on aerobic granules both pao and nitritation anammox types demonstrated stratification of nitrifier guilds such that aobs occupy the outer granule shell while nob are directly underneath to benefit from the localized high no2 availability and protection from washout matsumoto et al 2010 poot et al 2016 winkler et al 2011 winkler et al 2015 such heterogeneous distribution of aob nob was largely observed with fish conducted on lg slices collected at the end of phase ii fig s14 the protection from washout and access to higher nitrite concentrations would contribute to a high nob activity in the lg and create a nitrite sink for nob in the fsg as supported by the 2 3 times lower nob activity in the fsg than lg the reasoning behind nob suppression in fsg requires further research but our results indicate a potential opportunity for achieving nitritation by selecting for smaller granule sizes as previously suggested by kent et al 2019 this strategy would be easier to implement in sbr type ags reactors than cfs as a wider particle size distribution can be expected in sbrs due to the plug flow feeding regime 4 4 possible importance of fsg for growth of key functional groups there were several indications that a loss of microbial activity in fsg affected the lg in phase iii the sar in the fsg reduced by 69 relative to phase ii as expected at a 2 7 day srt and 16 c the sar of lg was also lowered by 27 even though the srt of lg remained constant in addition the ebpr performance struggled after the recycling of fsg was terminated after phase iii and the spr in lg reduced by 52 along with a significant reduction of accumulibacter abundance fig 3 and s11 after terminating fsg recycling genera leptospira and defluviimonas showed obvious increase in their relative abundance fig s11 one of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences shared 100 nucleotide identity to the saprophytic leptospira idonii numberger et al 2019 members of the defluviimonas genus can be strict or facultative aerobes that utilize volatile fatty acids vfa foesel et al 2011 math et al 2013 the role of these microbial groups during the deterioration of ebpr performance remains unknown but it can be suspected that they competed for carbon within the community even with similar microbial community between granules and flocs flocs can exhibit higher specific growth rates in comparison to granules due to lower substrate diffusion limitation liu tay 2012 this phenomenon was supported by a higher spr in the fsg than lg in phase i and ii fig 4 where fsg contributed to 25 57 of the reactor s p removal capacity fig s13 even in phase iii when the fsg srt approached the minimum value to sustain ebpr fsg still contributed to 8 of the p removal capacity it should be noted a higher aob activity was not observed in the fsg as for the pao activity this discrepancy was likely due to the faster growth rate of paos than aobs who would benefit more from the 20 day srt in the lg versus the 4 6 day srt in fsg at 16 c despite the lower oxygen diffusion it is hypothesized that due to the kinetic advantages pao growth predominantly occurred in the fsg then the recycling of fsg back into the column reactor may have enabled additional residence time for larger particles formation and attachment thereby contributing to maintaining the pao community in the lg biomass by washing out the fsg this dynamic segregation and interaction for pao growth was disturbed thus explaining the failed ebpr performance the same explanation can be applied to the reduction of lg s aob activity after aob in the fsg was washed out phase iii fig 5a although this hypothesis requires further confirmation our observations indicated the important role of flocs and small particles in a continuous flow system with integrated ags technology due to the limited diffusible carbon penetration into the granule core growth of paos may rely on flocs and smaller granules in continuous flow systems this understanding indicated that even with a high granule abundance recycling of flocs and the need for clarifiers cannot be completely eliminated in cfs as in the case for sbrs unless substrate diffusion limitations can be mitigated in that sense process configurations that mimic a more plug flow feeding regime e g multiple anaerobic stages in series would be favorable for the implementation of ags technologies in cfs 5 conclusions the integration of ags into continuous flow wastewater treatment systems is a promising technology to enhance the biological nutrient removal capacity of existing infrastructure in this study long term granule stability and high nutrient removal performance were achieved in a continuous flow setting the respective contributions of large granules lg and floc small granules fsg to the nutrient removal capacity were determined fsg had higher pao activity than lg due to the lower substrate diffusion limitation whereas aob activity was similar between the two biomass fractions as aobs benefitted from the higher srt in the lg nitrite shunt nob suppression was observed only in the fsg but not lg most importantly washing out the fsg from the system resulted in a reduction of pao and aob activity in the lg and eventual failure of the ebpr performance suggesting lg s dependency on the fsg for sustaining the pao and to a lesser extent aob populations the scientific innovations of this study were 1 demonstrating the feasibility of sustaining pao dominated granule growth in a continuous flow system 2 highlighting the complex partitioning and the potential competitive cooperative relationship between flocs and granules under a continuous flow scheme and 3 showcasing the important role of small particles in maintaining the nutrient removal capacity of a hybrid granule floc

16721,sludge granulation in continuous flow systems is an emerging technology to intensify existing activated sludge infrastructure for nutrient removal in these systems the nutrient removal contributions and partitioning of microbial functions between granules and flocs can offer insights into process implementations to this end a reactor system that simulates the continuous flow environment using an equal amount of initial granule and floc biomass was investigated the two operational strategies for maintaining granule growth in the continuous flow system were a the higher solids retention time srt for the granules versus flocs as well as b selective feeding of carbon to the granules the srt of the large granule fractions 425 µm lg and floc small granule fractions 425 µm fsg were controlled at 20 and 2 7 6 0 days respectively long term operation of the hybrid granule floc system achieved high po4 3 and nh4 removal efficiencies higher polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao activity was observed in the fsg than lg while ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob activities were similar in the two biomass fractions nitrite shunt was observed in the fsg possibly due to out competition by the high nob activity in lg more importantly washing out the fsg caused a reduction in lg s aob and pao activity indicating a possible dependency of lg on fsg for maintaining its nutrient removal capacity our findings highlighted the partitioning and potential competition cooperation of key microbial functional groups between lg and fsg facilitating nutrient removal in a

thickening properties of ags allow for the increase in solids inventory without additional secondary clarifiers pronk et al 2015 ags technology is therefore an attractive alternative for future expansions at any wastewater facilities that must meet increased capacity with population growth but are limited by space the current ags technology is based on sequencing batch reactors sbrs where plug flow feeding and washout of slow settling particles i e tall reactors with short settling time can be conveniently applied these selection stresses are needed for sludge granulation but cannot be easily adapted in continuous flow systems cfs where reactors are shallow and completely mixed making the integration of ags technology into existing wastewater infrastructure an ongoing challenge research efforts are therefore underway to develop alternative processes that enable granule growth in cfs the main strategy utilized thus far has been based on settling velocity where fast settling particles are continuously separated from the slow settling particles and retained in the system this washout of slow settling particles is accomplished with equipment such as solids liquid separator external settler or other designs of similar concept which are reviewed in detail by kent et al 2018 more recently sun et al 2019 demonstrated granulation in a pilot scale cfs with ten completely stirred tank reactors in series to mimic plug flow condition and two external settlers to wash out the slow settling particles the inclusion of the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process may further improve the feasibility of achieving granulation in cfs ebpr based systems select for slow growing microorganisms such as polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms pao and gao respectively that form denser and stronger granules than ordinary heterotrophs de kreuk van loosdrecht 2004 figdore et al 2018 these benefits of pao gao granules are well established in ags sbrs and have also been utilized for granule selection in some continuous flow studies devlin oleszkiewicz 2018 li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 moreover high abundance of pao gao based granules was unexpectedly observed at existing full scale continuous flow ebpr plants suggesting the feasibility of widespread adaptation of ags at cfs where ebpr capacity is already present wei et al 2020 leveraging the growth of paos in granules may be a simple way to integrate ags technology in cfs various studies had demonstrated this concept in continuous flow ebpr systems by adding a granule floc separator that receives a portion of the mixed liquor flow from which lighter particles are selectively wasted whereas larger particles are retained and recycled to the anaerobic zone carter 2020 stinson et al 2019 sturm et al 2017 these continuous flow configurations can have varying floc granule separation methods but share the common strategy of favoring growth of paos within the granules the principle of ags revolves around granulation but flocs still constitute a major portion 20 40 of the biomass in ags systems and is important for treating non diffusible substrates and removing colloids to achieve low effluent tss concentrations layer et al 2019 it is therefore expected that regardless of the various cfs configurations with integrated ags it will be a hybrid system consisting of both granules and flocs and their respective roles in system performance must be better understood in ags sbr systems flocs and granules have different solids retention time srts due to the selective retainment of larger particles ali et al 2019 a similar selection pressure is imposed when cfs are modified with a granule floc separator where flocculent granular srts can be decoupled to enable selective wasting of small particles various process schemes and methods for granule floc separations have been proposed and are being tested in large scale carter 2020 stinson et al 2019 sturm et al 2017 but there is a lack of fundamental knowledge in the role of flocs or the microbial segregation dependencies between flocs and granules in these systems in this study a reactor system simulating a continuous flow environment was inoculated with a combined granule floc biomass and operated for 157 days selective feeding of carbon to the granules was adopted and srts of the large small particles were differentially controlled the primary goal of this study was to understand differences in nutrient removal performance partitioning of functional groups and microbial community structure between small large particle fractions in continuous flow systems integrated with granular sludge based on the results a secondary goal was to hypothesize potential competitions and dependencies between flocs granules and to inform implementation of granular sludge in cfs 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental phases the study included five experimental phases with two operational modes as listed in table 1 the two operational modes ags sbr and continuous flow simulation are described in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 initially the reactor was operated in ags sbr mode with granular sludge only pre experiment phase then phase i started by switching to the continuous flow simulation mode in which we continued the operation of the granular sludge column but added a second reactor for floc recycling purposes during the switch to continuous flow operation 2000 mg l of flocculent mlss were added to the original 2000 mg l of granular mlss the flocculent sludge was collected from the city of puyallup water pollution control plant wa usa an anoxic aerobic nitrogen removal facility a 425 µm sieve was used to separate large small particles to decouple the srt of granules flocs this slightly larger cutoff size than the original definition of 0 2 mm for aerobic granules de kreuk et al 2007 was chosen initially to ensure that no large flocs were included in the granular category srt of the 425 µm size fraction was controlled at 20 days for the entire study while srt of the 425 µm size fraction were varied for phase i iii table 1 methodology for srt control is detailed in si 1 2 after phase iii the reactor was returned to ags sbr mode floc removed phase the same synthetic wastewater feed with acetate propionate as sole carbon source was used for all phases the feed concentrations were 433 mg l cod 42 mg l nh4 n and 21 mg l po4 3 p detailed composition listed in si 1 3 for all phases the do and ph during the aerobic phase were controlled at 2 0 mg l and 7 5 respectively and temperature was controlled at 16 c 2 1 1 ags sbr mode a 3 l reactor column column reactor was operated in sbr cycles consisting of 60 min anaerobic feeding 900 ml 13 min idle 4 min dilution water fill 750 ml with deionized water 242 min aeration 3 min settling 5 min decant 55 volume exchange ratio and 3 min idle instead of plug flow feeding through the sludge bed as is typical in ags sbrs the reactor was mixed continuously with n2 gas during anaerobic feeding anaerobic mixing was done to better simulate a continuous flow feeding condition similar to previous research nguyen quoc et al 2021 and to avoid a substrate gradient where larger particles are exposed to higher carbon concentrations 2 1 2 continuous flow simulation mode the continuous flow operation was set up to simulate conditions in a conceptual hybrid granule floc process scheme fig s1a which is a conventional anaerobic aerobic process except 55 of the mixed liquor flow is routed to a granule separator where particles of different sizes are partitioned from the granule separator larger particles are recycled to the anaerobic zone whereas lighter fraction are recycled to the aerobic zone this operation allows for 1 bypassing 55 of the flocs away from the anaerobic zone to achieve selective feeding of carbon to the granules and 2 decoupling controls of flocculent granular srts to simulate this conceptual scheme in the lab the same column reactor and cycles as the ags sbr mode were used but with the following modifications 1 decant from the column reactor top 55 of volume was pumped to a side reactor floc reactor to settle for 60 mins while sludge remained in the column reactor was fed anaerobically and 2 after the anaerobic feeding idle period effluent was withdrawn from the top of floc reactor and the remaining sludge was pumped back to the column reactor fig s1b deciphers a detailed schematic of reactor operations 2 2 biomass specific activity tests batch tests were conducted for 425 µm and 425 µm size fraction separately to determine the maximum specific ammonia and nitrite oxidation rates sar and snr respectively and the specific phosphorus release rate spr sar and snr tests were done at air saturation and spr test was done anaerobically briefly a 150 ml biomass sample was spiked with 20 mg nh4 n l ammonia 10 mg no2 n l or 90 mg cod l acetate then monitored for changes in ammonia nitrite or phosphate concentrations over time for the sar snr and spr test respectively the specific activities were determined from the slope of concentrations versus time and normalized to g volatile solids see si 1 4 for detailed methods 2 3 analytical methods suspended and volatile solids tss and vss were analyzed according to standard methods 2540d and 2540e apha 2005 respectively the sludge volume index was determined from the settled volume ml of a mixed liquor sample after 5 and 30 min settling in a graduated cylinder divided by g tss svi5 and svi30 respectively ammonia iso 15923 1 nitrite epa method 354 1 and phosphate epa method 365 1 concentrations were measured using the gallerytm automated photometric analyzer thermo fisher scientific acetate and propionate concentrations were analyzed with an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 system with the ionpac ice as6 column thermo scientific granule and floc morphologies were observed at 6x 10x magnification under a zeiss stemi 508 stereomicroscope in darkfield mode particle size distribution of 425 µm fraction was obtained by sieving analysis si 1 5 2 4 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics samples were collected at the end of each experimental phase and dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy powerbiofilm kit following the manufacturer s procedure except that homogenization was performed using a fastprep 24 mp biomedicals usa at 4 m s for 30 s the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers 515f y 926r parada et al 2016 the pcr products were sequenced on an illumina miseq in 2 300bp mode by bgi genomics hong kong and the molecular research lab texas usa amplicon reads were processed following the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm 2 dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 v 1 16 implemented in r v 4 0 2 parameters used for data trimming and filtering are detailed in si 1 6 taxonomy of the sequence variants were assigned against the silva project s v 132 database using the ribosomal database project classifier wang et al 2007 all amplicon sequence variants asv of a phyla with less than 50 reads were omitted from the analysis the relative abundance of each asv was calculated by the read counts of each asv 100 divided by the total read counts in a sample the r packages phyloseq v 1 32

fluorescence in situ hybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted on granule slices to observe the distribution of ammonia oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob and nob respectively detailed methods and the fish probes used can be found in si 1 8 3 results 3 1 system performance the overall performance data are plotted in fig 1 and the typical cycle profiles of nutrient concentrations are shown in fig 2 in the pre experimental phase the average effluent ammonia concentration of the ags reactor was 3 7 1 0 mg n l with 91 nh4 removal efficiency as soon as the continuous flow simulation started phase i the effluent ammonia dropped below 0 05 mg n l while the effluent nitrate increased to around 10 mg n l fig 1b complete nitrification was sustained for the rest of the study based on the low effluent ammonia nitrite concentrations except a brief increase at the end of phase ii the reactor did not have an anoxic phase and thus denitrification took place within the anoxic layer of the granules during the aerobic phase via simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd it was estimated that roughly 11 5 of the nitrogen was removed via snd see s2 1 for calculations denitrification also occurred during the anaerobic phase of a reactor cycle where any remaining nitrate was removed with the influent carbon as electron donor fig 2d p removal performance was stable except for a period of perturbation between phase ii and iii grey highlighted area in fig 1a caused by an error during carbon media preparation stable reactor performance was attained again before phase iii began excluding the period of operational issues the system achieved removal efficiencies of 96 2 98 9 for po4 3 and 99 1 99 9 for nh4 table s5 due to the higher granular srt 20 days than flocculent srt 6 4 and 2 7 days the mlvss of the 425 µm fraction were always significantly lower than the granule mlvss fig 1c after phase iii the solids withdrawn from the column reactor were wasted instead of recycled back into the column hence increasing the effluent tss fig 1d exactly one srt after this operational change elevated concentrations of po4 3 started occurring in the effluent the ebpr performance continued to deteriorate for 7 more days and reactor operation was terminated 3 2 rapid granulation of flocs the amount of small particles decanted to the floc reactor sharply decreased from 50 at the start of phase i to 13 in just 10 days fig s3 while the svi5 svi30 ratio dropped from 1 9 to 1 3 fig s4 indicating rapid densification of the flocs this observation was supported by microscopic images showing that flocs became small granules exhibiting a dense core with semi spherical morphologies fig s5a due to the observation that the 425 µm fraction consisted of both flocs and small granules any solids 425 µm are termed flocs and small granules fsg and solids 425 µm are termed large granules lg lg and fsg had similar ash content which averaged 35 2 6 and 36 4 7 respectively the short granulation time for the flocs was likely enabled by the added nucleation sites from breakage of lg and pao enrichment in the fsg discussed in si 2 2 as the flocs granulated the amount of biomass bypassing the anaerobic phase became minimal which created a condition where fsg and lg directly competed for carbon in the anaerobic phase 3 3 physical characteristics of granules the high settleability of lg was maintained throughout the experimental period as indicated with an svi5 of 66 ml g at the end of phase iii a reduction in granule size was indicated by the disappearance of the 2 mm size fraction since phase ii fig s6 which was also apparent from the micrographs fig s5b the density of lg reduced from 1016 kg m3 in the pre experimental phase down to 1008 kg m3 by end of phase iii which was still within the range of typical density observed for granular sludge bassin et al 2012 3 4 microbial community the relative 16s rrna gene abundance of the top abundant genera is shown in fig 3 the microbial community between lg and fsg appeared to be similar fig s7 showing significant differences for merely 3 out of the 362 genera p 0 03 stamp and the magnitude of differences were low 0 15 fig s8 relative abundances of the key microbial functional groups fig s9 showed that the putative paos during phase i iii included candidatus accumulibacter accumulibacter 18 0 37 1 and dechloromonas 9 3 25 5 the pao phenotype of dechloromonas has been confirmed by many studies petriglieri et al 2021 terashima et al 2016 but some members can behave according to the gao phenotype ahn et al 2007 mcilroy et al 2016 it should be noted that the relative abundance of dechloromonas is known to be overestimated with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing which can yield 10 folds more abundance than quantification with fish stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the only ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob genus detected in phase i iii was nitrosomonas 0 04 0 79 while nitrospira 0 0 1 9 and candidatus nitrotoga nitrotoga 0 06 0 33 were the two nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob present analysis using comammox specific primers indicated that the nitrospira genus consisted of canonical nob species and not comammox fig s10 to investigate the deterioration of ebpr performance after termination of floc recycling the microbial community of phases i iii and the flocs removed phase were compared the comparison showed a decrease in accumulibacter abundance p 0 043 fig s11 while the relative abundances of leptospira p 0 00001 defluviimonas p 0 00002 and an unclassified genus under the sphingobacteriales order p 0 0009 increased 3 5 specific po4 p release rates the spr remained constant for lg as expected with a constant srt at 20 days the spr of fsg was higher than the lg for phases i and ii by 47 and 57 respectively fig 4 in phase iii the fsg srt was reduced to 2 7 days which may explain the 38 reduction in fsg s spr as the operating srt approached the minimum srt for ebpr of around 1 5 2 5 days at 16 c brdjanovic et al 1998 mamais jenkins 1992 as mentioned in section 3 1 the ebpr performance failed one srt after termination of floc recycling a p release activity test done on the reactor biomass right before ending reactor operations showed an spr of 27 8 mgp gvss hr which was a 52 reduction compared to phase iii 3 6 maximum specific nh4 and no2 oxidation rates the sars of lg and fsg were similar in phases i and ii the changes in snr did not follow a clear trend fig 5 b but it was obvious that the snr was higher for lg than fsg for all phases by a factor of 2 3 nitrospira was the dominant nob except in phase ii where nitrotoga became dominant in the fsg and was as abundant as nitrospira in lg fig 5b the dominance of nitrotoga overlapped with the highest bulk nitrite concentrations during phase ii fig 2c which corroborates with other studies showing dominance of nitrotoga over nitrospira at higher nitrite availability kinnunen et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 although having the same range of maximum specific activities nitrotoga have a lower affinity for nitrite and higher tolerance for free nitrous acid than nitrospira kitzinger et al 2018 wegen et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 which may explain the higher nitrotoga abundance at higher nitrite concentrations in phase iii the sar decreased substantially for fsg due to the srt drop to 2 7 days which was also accompanied by a 27 sar reduction in the lg based on the respective mlvss and specific activities the contributions of fsg and lg to the total ammonia oxidation capacity were determined fig s12 which shows that fsg contributed only 3 5 of the capacity in phase iii 3 7 specific nob aob activity ratios to investigate the reasons behind the higher snr rate in lg versus fsg the ratios of maximum specific nitrite to ammonia oxidation rates or nob aob activity ratios are plotted in fig 6 along with theoretical ratios estimated for the fully nitrifying condition the theoretical ratios were calculated from µmax nob µmax aob using literature values while assuming the same endogenous decay for aob nob and that nitrite produced by aob was the only nitrogen source for nob si 2 3 for fsg the experimental nob aob activity ratios were 14 56 lower than the theoretical values for the fully nitrifying condition whereas for lg the observed ratios were within 6 for phase i and 65 67 higher for phase ii if compared to the fully nitrifying condition 4 discussion 4 1 carbon competition between granules and flocs here we evaluated the contributions of granules and flocs to the nutrient removal performance of a cfs where the growth of granules was favored by maintaining a low floc srt and separating a portion of the flocs from the anaerobic feed phase in full scale this concept could be implemented by sending the granule fraction from a granule floc separator to the anaerobic zone and the lighter fraction from the clarifier underflow to the aerobic phase fig s1a the fraction of biomass that bypassed the anaerobic phase via density separation was eventually low due to the rapid granulation of flocs thus creating a condition where paos in lg and fsg directly competed for carbon in the anaerobic phase this situation would be representative of a full scale system where granule and floc separation can be achieved only partially hence exposing flocs occasionally to anaerobic carbon addition the consumption of carbon by paos in the fsg reduced the bulk liquid substrate concentration and diffusion gradient into the granule core leading to disintegration of lg and a gradual decrease in average granule size the reduction in granule size led to a higher aerobic zone volume fraction at a set bulk do level nguyen quoc et al 2021 which increased the sar and thus also the nitrate concentration in the reactor fig 1b it should be noted that the initial increase in ammonia oxidation efficiency at the beginning of phase i was due to the higher total mlvss after the addition of flocs into the reactor fig 1c which resulted in immediate increase of effluent nitrate concentration after the total mlvss reduced and stabilized around 1500 mg l by mid phase i the ammonia oxidation capacity of the system was maintained due to the increase of sar in both fsg and lg fig 5a in nereda type sbr systems the remaining nitrate at the end of the aeration phase is not mixed with the influent carbon due to plug flow feeding hence allowing for anaerobic conditions even if snd is incomplete weissbrodt et al 2017 to simulate continuous flow conditions the anaerobic phase of our system was mixed the simultaneous presence of nitrate and carbon allowed for anoxic condition that favored the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers as confirmed with 0 mg l no3 n measured at the end of anaerobic phase fig 2d some strains of the defluviimonas and emticicia genera can perform denitrification foesel et al 2011 saha chakrabarti 2006 and their gradual increase in relative abundance from phase i to phase iii fig 3 corresponds to the observed increase in heterotrophic denitrification activities on the contrary the relative abundance of zoogloea a putative denitrifier and pha accumulating organism nierychlo et al 2020 gradually reduced zoogloea has been suggested as an important player in granule formation by producing specific eps larsen et al 2008 seviour et al 2012 the reason for their gradual disappearance in our system remains unclear but may correspond to a change in eps composition and or their ecological niche as large granules disintegrated in addition to competing with paos present in the flocs paos in lg also had to compete with heterotrophic denitrifiers for carbon during the anaerobic phase due to the presence of nitrate this carbon consumption by the denitrifiers caused a lower substrate diffusion gradient into the core of granules resulting in a weakened granule structure and further contributing to their size reduction however the settling characteristics of the lg were maintained despite their reduction in size and density we propose that this was likely due to the high ebpr performance and high pao enrichment within the granules pao based granules have higher settling characteristics than ordinary heterotrophic granules due to the higher density of polyphosphate and the slow growing metabolism of pao leads to smooth granular morphology that further contributes to a fast settling rate figdore et al 2018 winkler et al 2013b our results indicate that due to the diluted substrate concentrations competition by flocs and direct contact of nitrate with carbon granulation in cfs can be somewhat challenging but still achievable strategies such as using pao enriched granules as the initial seed and bypassing flocs from the anaerobic zone can be applied to maintain granule stability nitrate recycled to the anaerobic zone should be minimized as in the case for all ebpr activated sludge processes in full scale applications the low diffusible carbon fraction of real wastewater would make granulation even more challenging layer et al 2019 the recommendation is therefore to implement process schemes that increase the substrate concentrations e g mixed liquor fermentation to support granulation in full scale cfs 4 2 partitioning of microbial activity between fsg and lg despite similar microbial composition the microbial community between fsg and lg were similar based on 16s rrna gene sequencing fig s7 and s8 which algins with other studies layer et al 2019 liu tay 2012 winkler et al 2013a our system was unique such that the granular srt 20 days and flocculent srt 6 4 and 2 7 days were manually decoupled and carefully controlled and thus a similar microbial composition between granules and flocs was not expected in a full scale ags sbr ali et al 2019 found a lack of species sorting between flocs 0 2 mm and small granules 0 2 1 mm due to their similar srts 6 7 days whereas large granules 1 mm had a significantly different microbial composition but at much higher srt of 142 days therefore it is possible that the difference in srts for fsg and lg in this study was too small to allow for a strong partitioning of core microbial communities between different sized aggregates in addition previous research has shown that in a continuous flow reactor there can be dynamic and random processes of attachment detachment aggregation and breakage between flocs and granules zhou et al 2014 this constant exchange of biomass between flocs and granules could also explain their similar microbial composition despite the difference in their srts although the 16s rrna gene sequencing results indicated a similar overall microbial community between the fsg and lg partitioning of nutrient removal activities was revealed by activity batch tests i e fsg had lower nob activities and higher pao activities than lg these observations of microbial activity segregations led to insights for implementations of granular sludge technology in continuous flow systems discussed in sections 4 1 4 3 and 4 4 which would have been overlooked if molecular sequencing was the only tool utilized indeed 16s rrna gene sequencing is a useful method for obtaining high level microbial community compositions but the compositional nature of the data cannot fully determine how the absolute abundance of individual taxa varies among samples barlow et al 2020 our results highlighted the importance of conducting physiological activity tests in addition to molecular sequencing to elucidate nutrient removal partitioning in heterogenous microenvironments e g granules versus flocs within a mixed culture 4 3 nitrite shunt in smaller particles the lower nob aob activity ratios in the fsg versus lg was an interesting observation as nob suppression in wwtps can lead to significant savings in aeration and carbon costs for lg the observed nob aob ratios were either similar to phase i or higher than phase ii values calculated for a fully nitrifying condition fig 6b the higher observed nob aob ratios versus the fully nitrifying values in phase ii suggested that the growth of nob was uncoupled from the nitrite supply of aob which can be enabled by nitrite produced via partial denitrification by other bacteria or the decay products in the anoxic layer of lg winkler et al 2015 the reasoning for why this uncoupled nob growth from aob was only observed in phase ii requires further research for fsg on the other hand the nob aob activity ratios were lower than the fully nitrifying condition indicating suppression of nob the inhibition effect of free ammonia fa could be a contributing factor as nob in the fsg were more exposed to bulk liquid ammonia concentrations whereas mass diffusion limitation would provide a more protected environment for the nob in lg kent et al 2019 observed a similar trend of decreasing nob aob activity ratios with decreasing granule size in a continuous flow ags reactor and showed that smaller granules were more sensitive to fa inhibition based on the ammonia concentration profile fig 2b and the operational temperature ph the fa concentrations in our system were in the 0 05 0 1 mg nh3 n l range for half of the aerobic phase however the inhibition effect of fa on nitrospira can vary widely ranging from an inhibition threshold of 0 04 0 08 mg nh3 n l up to no inhibition at 10 mg nh3 n l possibly due to genus level ecophysiological diversity and other variations such as short term effect biomass acclimation and competition with other microbial groups blackburne et al 2007 simm et al 2006 ushiki et al 2017 in addition nitrotoga may tolerate high fa concentrations 200 mg nh3 n l li et al 2020 indicating that fa inhibition may not be the reason for nob suppression in the fsg for phase ii during which nitrotoga was the only nob genus detected previous research on aerobic granules both pao and nitritation anammox types demonstrated stratification of nitrifier guilds such that aobs occupy the outer granule shell while nob are directly underneath to benefit from the localized high no2 availability and protection from washout matsumoto et al 2010 poot et al 2016 winkler et al 2011 winkler et al 2015 such heterogeneous distribution of aob nob was largely observed with fish conducted on lg slices collected at the end of phase ii fig s14 the protection from washout and access to higher nitrite concentrations would contribute to a high nob activity in the lg and create a nitrite sink for nob in the fsg as supported by the 2 3 times lower nob activity in the fsg than lg the reasoning behind nob suppression in fsg requires further research but our results indicate a potential opportunity for achieving nitritation by selecting for smaller granule sizes as previously suggested by kent et al 2019 this strategy would be easier to implement in sbr type ags reactors than cfs as a wider particle size distribution can be expected in sbrs due to the plug flow feeding regime 4 4 possible importance of fsg for growth of key functional groups there were several indications that a loss of microbial activity in fsg affected the lg in phase iii the sar in the fsg reduced by 69 relative to phase ii as expected at a 2 7 day srt and 16 c the sar of lg was also lowered by 27 even though the srt of lg remained constant in addition the ebpr performance struggled after the recycling of fsg was terminated after phase iii and the spr in lg reduced by 52 along with a significant reduction of accumulibacter abundance fig 3 and s11 after terminating fsg recycling genera leptospira and defluviimonas showed obvious increase in their relative abundance fig s11 one of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences shared 100 nucleotide identity to the saprophytic leptospira idonii numberger et al 2019 members of the defluviimonas genus can be strict or facultative aerobes that utilize volatile fatty acids vfa foesel et al 2011 math et al 2013 the role of these microbial groups during the deterioration of ebpr performance remains unknown but it can be suspected that they competed for carbon within the community even with similar microbial community between granules and flocs flocs can exhibit higher specific growth rates in comparison to granules due to lower substrate diffusion limitation liu tay 2012 this phenomenon was supported by a higher spr in the fsg than lg in phase i and ii fig 4 where fsg contributed to 25 57 of the reactor s p removal capacity fig s13 even in phase iii when the fsg srt approached the minimum value to sustain ebpr fsg still contributed to 8 of the p removal capacity it should be noted a higher aob activity was not observed in the fsg as for the pao activity this discrepancy was likely due to the faster growth rate of paos than aobs who would benefit more from the 20 day srt in the lg versus the 4 6 day srt in fsg at 16 c despite the lower oxygen diffusion it is hypothesized that due to the kinetic advantages pao growth predominantly occurred in the fsg then the recycling of fsg back into the column reactor may have enabled additional residence time for larger particles formation and attachment thereby contributing to maintaining the pao community in the lg biomass by washing out the fsg this dynamic segregation and interaction for pao growth was disturbed thus explaining the failed ebpr performance the same explanation can be applied to the reduction of lg s aob activity after aob in the fsg was washed out phase iii fig 5a although this hypothesis requires further confirmation our observations indicated the important role of flocs and small particles in a continuous flow system with integrated ags technology due to the limited diffusible carbon penetration into the granule core growth of paos may rely on flocs and smaller granules in continuous flow systems this understanding indicated that even with a high granule abundance recycling of flocs and the need for clarifiers cannot be completely eliminated in cfs as in the case for sbrs unless substrate diffusion limitations can be mitigated in that sense process configurations that mimic a more plug flow feeding regime e g multiple anaerobic stages in series would be favorable for the implementation of ags technologies in cfs 5 conclusions the integration of ags into continuous flow wastewater treatment systems is a promising technology to enhance the biological nutrient removal capacity of existing infrastructure in this study long term granule stability and high nutrient removal performance were achieved in a continuous flow setting the respective contributions of large granules lg and floc small granules fsg to the nutrient removal capacity were determined fsg had higher pao activity than lg due to the lower substrate diffusion limitation whereas aob activity was similar between the two biomass fractions as aobs benefitted from the higher srt in the lg nitrite shunt nob suppression was observed only in the fsg but not lg most importantly washing out the fsg from the system resulted in a reduction of pao and aob activity in the lg and eventual failure of the ebpr performance suggesting lg s dependency on the fsg for sustaining the pao and to a lesser extent aob populations the scientific innovations of this study were 1 demonstrating the feasibility of sustaining pao dominated granule growth in a continuous flow system 2 highlighting the complex partitioning and the potential competitive cooperative relationship between flocs and granules under a continuous flow scheme and 3 showcasing the important role of small particles in maintaining the nutrient removal capacity of a hybrid granule floc

16722,wastewater treatment plants wwtps play an important role in retaining organic matter and nutrients but to a lesser extent micropollutants therefore treated wastewater is recognized as a major source of multiple stressors including complex mixtures of micropollutants these can potentially affect microbial communities in the receiving water bodies and the ecological functions they provide in this study we evaluated in flow through channels the consequences of an exposure to a mixture of stream water and different percentages of urban wwtp effluent ranging from 0 to 80 on the microbial diversity and function of periphyton communities assuming that micropollutants exert a selective pressure for tolerant microorganisms within communities we further examined the periphyton sensitivity to a micropollutant mixture extracted from passive samplers that were immersed in the wastewater effluent as well micropollutants in water and in periphyton were comprehensively quantified our results show that micropollutants detected in periphyton differed from those found in water both in term of concentration and composition especially photosystem ii inhibitors accumulated in periphyton more than other pesticides although effects of other substances cannot be excluded this accumulation may have contributed to the observed higher tolerance of phototrophic communities to micropollutants upon exposure to 30 and 80 of wastewater on the contrary no difference in tolerance was observed for heterotrophic communities exposure to the gradient of wastewater led to structural differences in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities for instance the relative abundance of cyanobacteria was higher with increasing percentage of wastewater effluent whereas the opposite was observed for diatoms such results could indicate that differences in community structure do not necessarily lead to higher tolerance this highlights the need to consider other wastewater constituents such as nutrients and wastewater derived microorganisms that can modulate community structure and tolerance by using engineered flow through channels that mimic to some extent the required field conditions for the development of tolerance in periphyton our study constitutes a base to investigate the mechanisms underlying the increased tolerance such as the potential role of microorganisms originating from wastewater effluents and different treatment options to reduce the micropollutant load in effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pollution induced community tolerance aquatic biofilm passive sampler organic micropollutants microbial diversity 16s and 18s rrna gene sequencing 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are point sources for complex mixtures of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial chemicals stamm et al 2016 due to the large variety of their chemical structures and modes of biological action these micropollutants can alter the function and structure of aquatic communities which may lead to the downgrading of the ecological status of the receiving waterbodies gessner and tlili 2016 vörösmarty et al 2010 a further layer of complexity is added because wastewater discharge is accompanied by an increase of temperature nutrient loads organic matter petrie et al 2015 and microorganisms from the effluent mansfeldt et al 2020 mußmann et al 2013 pascual benito et al 2020 disentangling the specific effects of micropollutants from those of the other environmental stressors therefore requires study designs that embrace the chemical and biological complexity within ecosystems while providing means for controlled interventions to accomplish such a study design we constructed a flow through channel system which allows for exposure to increasing proportion of treated wastewater and used periphytic communities as a biological model periphyton also known as benthic biofilm is dominated by complex and dynamic assemblages of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms as well as micro and meiofauna embedded in an extracellular matrix of organic detritus phototrophic microorganisms includes unicellular eukaryotes such as diatoms and green algae and prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria interacting with heterotrophic bacteria prokaryotes battin et al 2016 biggs et al 1998 periphytic communities are ubiquitous in streams of small to moderate sizes in which they play a central role as the basis of aquatic food webs they contribute to primary production ecosystem respiration and element cycling battin et al 2016 with their high microbial diversity they exhibit a broad range of sensitivities to environmental stressors including micropollutants these features and ecological roles support the use of stream periphyton communities as a model to assess micropollutant effects in complex ecological systems montuelle et al 2010 sabater et al 2007 several studies have demonstrated that exposure to wastewater leads to changes in the taxonomic diversity of periphyton communities chonova et al 2018 price et al 2018 romero et al 2019 subirats et al 2017 although these studies focused on the bacterial and not on the algal composition in periphyton they showed that shifts in microbial communities were accompanied by the alteration of important ecological functions such as algal primary production heterotrophic respiration or organic matter decomposition notwithstanding these findings such structural and functional changes by themselves cannot be ascribed to specific effects of micropollutants or other stressors that are associated with wastewater discharges carr et al 2005 lebkuecher et al 2018 the concept of pollution induced community tolerance pict has been suggested by blanck et al 1988 as a tool to establish such a specific link between exposure to micropollutants and effects at the community level it rests on the fact that a common response in contaminated ecosystems consists in changes in community composition that result from the replacement of sensitive species by tolerant ones upon chronic exposures of communities to chemical stress millward and klerks 2002 as a consequence increased tolerance of a community to micropollutants may be used as an indicator of previous exposures tlili et al 2016 increased community tolerance to micropollutant mixtures has been demonstrated with stream periphyton communities in the field pesce et al 2011 and in microcosm studies foulquier et al 2015 kim tiam et al 2016 morin et al 2012 rotter et al 2013 in recent field surveys tlili et al 2017 2020 reported on an increased tolerance to micropollutant mixtures of phototrophic and heterotrophic communities in periphyton downstream compared to upstream of several wwtps the results showed that the fold increase in tolerance was positively correlated with the level of contamination with micropollutants at the respective sampling sites most importantly a substantial decrease in micropollutant concentrations by 85 as the result of upgrading the wwtp at one of the sampling sites with activated carbon filtration led to the loss of the previously measured community tolerance tlili et al 2020 however these studies did not include phylogenetic data in the analysis of microbial composition and hence did not allow identifying specific taxa that were positively or negatively impacted by wastewater effluents given this background the overarching goal of this study was to describe the differences in periphytic community composition and diversity that might be associated with the higher tolerance of periphyton exposed to a gradient of treated wastewater to reach this goal periphyton was grown in flow through channels that were continuously alimented with a mixture of stream water and different percentages of an urban wwtp effluent according to the pict concept we then determined the tolerance of periphyton communities towards a micropollutant mixture that was extracted from passive samplers deployed in the wastewater effluent moreover we performed a detailed analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities structure by means of genomic high throughput sequencing and a comprehensive quantification of micropollutant concentrations in the water in passive sampler extracts and in periphyton samples we hypothesised that periphyton communities will change across the gradient of wastewater constituents such as nutrients micropollutants microorganisms and metals leading to higher tolerance of the whole community to micropollutants this increased tolerance was measured specifically via bioassays according to the pict concept 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental system and design 2 1 1 channel system treatments and periphyton colonization the channel system used in our study corresponds to an indoor version of the maiandros system previously used outdoor by burdon et al 2020 see supporting information si i for a detailed description briefly this system allows controlled mixing of different waters for comparative experiments in 16 independent flow through channels total length of 2 6 m 0 15 m width and 0 1 m water depth which are continuously fed with water by means of influent pumps buffer tanks and mixing units an additional lightening system that reproduces the sunlight spectrum philips master led tube hf 1200 mm was installed to ensure a photoperiod of 12h light 12h dark the two influent pumps fed water into the two buffer tanks one holding stream water and the other holding treated wastewater see 2 1 2 below both equipped with a stirrer to avoid settling of particulates stream water and wastewater were continuously and fully mixed in the mixing units equipped with static mixers and flow splitters at the respective ratio needed to obtain the targeted nominal percentage of wastewater in our study the inflow to each channel was 120 l h 1 resulting in a hydraulic residence time of 10 minutes each channel was equipped with a paddle wheel providing 0 2 m s 1 horizontal flow speed which corresponds to the lower end of flow velocity observed in the adjacent stream the 16 channels were randomly assigned to four treatments corresponding to a nominal proportion of 0 10 30 and 80 treated wastewater n four replicate channels per treatment si ii 1 periphyton was grown on clean glass slides 210 75 4 mm that were directly placed vertically in the channels 40 glass slides per channel after 28 days colonized glass slides were retrieved and immediately transported to the laboratory for biological analyses see 2 2 2 below 2 1 2 water sources the channels were continuously fed with a mixture of stream water that was directly pumped from chriesbach a small peri urban stream 47 24 16 7 n 8 36 41 4 e dübendorf switzerland and treated wastewater thereafter called wastewater the untreated wastewater originated from a local municipal sewer in the catchment of dübendorf on a branch serving 20 000 persons plus some food processing industry untreated wastewater followed a standard activated sludge treatment for nitrification and denitrification without

properties and micropollutants the ph temperature conductivity and oxygen concentration were measured daily in the 2 buffer tanks and in the 16 channels by using a multi parameter portable meter wtw meters germany additionally water samples were taken every week in the two buffer tanks stream water and wastewater and in the 16 channels for the measurement of 20 other water quality parameters see si table 2 for detailed list of parameters using standard methods as described by the swiss national river monitoring and survey programme foen 2020 a total of 51 organic micropollutants consisting of 21 pesticides 24 pharmaceuticals 3 artificial sweeteners 2 corrosion inhibitors and caffeine a tracer of sewage effluent in natural waters were analysed in grab and in 24 hour composite water samples as well as in extracts from passive samplers si ii 1 and si table 3 the substances were originally selected by munz et al 2017 who established a list of priority substances based on a large survey in 24 swiss streams that are impacted by wastewater effluents the selection criteria included detection frequency concentrations in municipal wastewater toxicity analytical restrictions and substance classes this mixture was also studied by tlili et al 2017 to investigate the tolerance of periphyton upstream and downstream of five swiss wwtps the channel system guaranteed a homogenous mixture of stream water and wastewater in each channel therefore 1 4 ml of the grab water samples can be considered representative for the analysis of water soluble compounds these samples were taken weekly in each channel and stored in 1 5 ml clear glass vials short thread with screw caps septa silicone ptfe bgb switzerland at 20 c until analysis preliminary results showed negligible variability among replicates thus only one channel has been selected for micropollutant analyses the composite samples were also taken weekly from the stream water and wastewater during 24 hours with an automated water sampler maxx tp5 c aktiv germany the water was automatically sampled 50 ml every 30 minutes pooled together and 1 4 ml of each 24 hour sample was stored in 1 5 ml clear glass vials at 20 c until chemical analysis composite samples from a dry weather and a rain weather period were selected for each week in parallel two attractspe disks sdb rps 47 mm diameter affinisep france with supor polyethersulfone pes membrane disc filters 47 mm diameter 0 45 µm pore size vwr switzerland were installed in two channels of each treatment to sample polar to semi polar organic micropollutants according to moschet et al 2015 two passive samplers from two different channels were selected from each sampling period for micropollutant analyses for each treatment n 4 the same type of passive samplers but without pes membrane were also deployed in the wastewater buffer tank and the accumulated micropollutants were extracted and used for the pict bioassays tlili et al 2017 prior to their deployment all passive samplers were conditioned with methanol and then with nanopure water for 30 min each on a rotary shaker then the sdb disks were placed on a steel plate covered or not by the pes membrane closed by a cover plate and stored in nanopure water at room temperature in order to remain in the linear adsorption range moschet et al 2015 the passive samplers were deployed during twelve days and renewed for a second twelve day period 2 2 2 sampling for biological analyses periphyton growing on five glass slides from the same channel was scraped pooled and suspended in 200 ml of evian natural water si ii 2 stock suspension was kept for periphyton characterization and pict bioassays the remaining volume was lyophilized before micropollutant analysis and carbon nitrogen phosphorus c n p ratio determination the tolerance of periphyton to micropollutants accumulated in the passive samplers deployed in the wastewater buffer tank was assessed according to the pict concept by measuring the inhibition of algal primary production photosynthetic efficiency and bacterial secondary production see 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 2 3 chemical and biological analyses 2 3 1 micropollutants in water and in periphyton passive samplers from the channels were prepared and extracted according to moschet et al 2015 with few modifications si iii 1 micropollutant concentrations in the passive sampler extracts were then used to derive theoretical concentrations in the water by using the sampling rates rs established by moschet et al 2015 briefly the actual micropollutant concentration in 1 ml extract ng l 1 was first converted to the extractable amount of micropollutant ng per passive sampler then this value was further multiplied by the corresponding rs value l day 1 and the deployment period of 12 days resulting in a theoretical concentration in water ng l 1 micropollutants were also analysed in the passive sampler extract used for the pict bioassays see tlili et al 2017 for the detailed description of the extraction concentrations of micropollutants accumulated in periphyton 44 of the 51 micropollutants analysed were quantifiable were measured at the end of the colonization

alkalinity na k cl so4 2 nh4 no2 ortho phosphate total phosphorus silicic acid dissolved organic carbon total organic carbon total nitrogen and total inorganic carbon were significantly higher in wastewater than in stream water while the opposite was observed for ph and oxygen anova p 0 001 the principal component analysis pca of the entire physicochemical dataset clearly distinguishes the four groups corresponding to 0 10 30 and 80 of wastewater from the stream and wastewater buffer tanks at each sampling time fig 1 this distinction was seen throughout the four weeks of experimentation despite the fact that the physicochemical parameters fluctuated over time si tables 1 and 2 most likely due to rain events 3 2 micropollutants in water and periphyton stream water and wastewater were continuously sampled during the 4 week colonisation period for micropollutant analysis in composite samples most of the target substances were found in both water sources si fig 1 and si table 7 the total concentrations of each substance group was higher in wastewater than in stream water for instance pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners i e acesulfame cyclamate and sucralose and corrosion inhibitors i e benzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole were on average 20 times higher in the wastewater si fig 1 and si table 7 micropollutant concentrations in the channels were determined either in grab water samples si table 8 or in the passive sampler extracts before back calculating average concentrations in the water as described by moschet et al 2015 si tables 9a and 9b micropollutant concentrations overall correlated between grab and passive samples pearson s r 0 88 p 0 001 except for eight pharmaceuticals and eight pesticides including deet and pirimicarb only quantified in passive sampler extracts and the pharmaceutical gabapentin only quantified in grab samples si tables 8 and 9b total concentration of micropollutants in the channels increased with the wastewater proportion for all substance groups fig 2 for instance the concentrations of the two photosystem ii psii inhibitors diuron and isoproturon seemed to increase by a factor of eight and ten respectively from 0 to 80 wastewater treatments si table 9b the total micropollutant concentration in periphyton was as well increased with increasing wastewater proportion fig 2 indicating that periphyton was able to accumulate micropollutants from the water phase for instance although only five out of the 21 targeted pesticides were detectable in periphyton the concentrations of three of them diuron isoproturon and terbutryn were approximately 1 5 to 3 times higher in the 80 wastewater treatment compared to the control si table 10 these three compounds displayed the highest bcfs of all the compounds analysed table 1 however the relative proportion of each substance group fig 2 and detection frequency of each substance in periphyton si table 10 differed strongly from those found in the water and the passive samplers si table 9b an example are artificial sweeteners whose relative proportion decreased in periphyton whereas the opposite was observed for pesticides for artificial sweeteners the absence of matrix effect was checked by assigning the value of the limit of quantification loq of each compound when its concentration was loq 3 3 periphyton characterization biomass nutrient stoichiometry and functions despite the measured increase in nutrient concentrations in the channels with increasing wastewater proportion periphyton biomass total algal bacterial did not differ among the treatments table 2 anova p 0 0632 p 0 1662 and p 0 2099 respectively importantly the increase of available nutrients in the water phase did not impact the stoichiometry of nutrients in periphyton as shown by the lack of significant differences among the treatments in the elemental ratios c n c p and n p table 2 anova p 0 4392 p 0 265 and p 0 2962 respectively furthermore the c n p ratios were about 126 18 1 and therefore closer to the one described for algae 106 16 1 redfield et al 1963 than for bacteria 45 9 1 goldman et al 1987 among the measured functional endpoints only bacterial secondary production significantly differed upon exposure to 30 wastewater compared to the control 0 wastewater while photosynthetic activity differed between 30 and 80 wastewater table 2 3 4 community tolerance to micropollutants tolerance of periphyton was assessed via short term assays with a micropollutant mixture extracted from the passive samplers that had been deployed in the buffer tank holding the wastewater a higher tolerance of phototrophs was found for periphyton exposed to wastewater table 3 and si fig 2 specifically the ec20 and ec50 values for photosynthetic efficiency were higher for the periphyton from 30 and 80 treatment than for the control 0 wastewater for algal primary production ec20 and ec50 values were significantly higher in the 80 wastewater treatment thanin the control corroborating an increased tolerance of phototrophs in contrast secondary production which is associated with heterotrophs did not indicate any wastewater related tolerance even with the highest tested micropollutant concentration si fig 2 3 5 diversity and taxonomic abundance of periphyton communities in order to investigate the impact of wastewater on community composition 18s and 16s rrna gene sequencing was used focussing on the richness diversity and composition of eukaryotes e g diatoms and green algae and prokaryotes e g cyanobacteria respectively alpha diversity i e the taxonomic richness and shannon diversity index of prokaryotes was higher in the 30 wastewater tukey s test p 0 05 whereas it did not differ from the control for the 80 wastewater fig 3 a and b for eukaryotes a similar trend was observed for taxonomic richness but not for diversity fig 3c and d except for the eukaryotic shannon index fig 3d alpha diversity in the community isolated from the wastewater buffer tank was similar to that of periphyton from the 80 wastewater treatment wastewater also led to a separation in the beta diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities permanova p 0 001 fig 4 this separation increased with wastewater proportion as attested by the significant differences between each periphyton group pairwise permanova p 0 05 in terms of abundance of taxa a total of 36 prokaryotic and 34 eukaryotic phyla were identified in periphyton and the community sampled from the wastewater buffer tank si figs 3 and 4 the notable proportion of taxa without affiliation na for eukaryotes reflects the lack of information in the databases in comparison to those for prokaryotes the relative abundance of the ten most abundant prokaryotic and eukaryotic phyla in periphyton and wastewater communities is shown in fig 5 wastewater effluent differentially influenced the relative abundance of prokaryotic phyla in periphyton fig 5a among the six phyla that were higher with increasing wastewater proportion acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi cyanobacteria and parcubacteria cyanobacteria i e phototrophic prokaryotes stood out in particular because their proportion was higher in periphyton with wastewater despite the fact that this phylum was present at low abundance in the wastewater buffer tank fig 5a a detailed analysis at the class level of proteobacteria in the bacterial community shows that the relative abundance of alpha and beta proteobacteria decreases with wastewater proportion while the opposite is observed for delta and epsilon proteobacteria si fig 5 several eukaryotic phyla annelida platyhelminthes and zoopagomycota were also higher with wastewater proportion even though similarly to cyanobacteria their abundance in the wastewater buffer tank was relatively low fig 5b in contrast cercozoa and discocea were dominant in the wastewater community but low in abundance in any of the artificial streams bacillariophyta diatoms and chlorophyta green algae negatively correlated with the wastewater proportion fig 5b however a detailed analysis at the genus level showed that responses to the wastewater exposure differed within each of these two phyla si figs 6 and 7 for instance while several diatoms e g cocconeis and nitzschia and green algae e g chlorochytrium and scenedesmus genera were not impacted the relative abundance of the diatom ulnaria and the green algae mychonastes were significantly higher in periphyton with the increase of wastewater proportion si figs 6 and 7 to shed light on the partitioning of taxa among periphyton and the community isolated from the wastewater buffer tank venn diagrams were constructed fig 6 in terms of prokaryotes fig 6a periphyton specific taxa dominated in all treatments by at least 64 relative abundance the taxa shared with the community from the wastewater buffer tank increased in relative abundance from 19 0 wastewater to 34 80 wastewater in terms of eukaryotes fig 6b periphyton specific taxa again dominated in relative abundance for all treatments but the proportion shared with that of the community in the wastewater buffer tank was higher than for prokaryotes reaching up to 53 4 discussion 4 1 validation of the experimental system by mixing treated wastewater and stream water proportionally the pre set percentages of wastewater were approximately reached this was confirmed by conductivity measurements experimental proportions of 11 8 and 23 9 wastewater were calculated for the intended 10 and 30 wastewater proportions respectively si fig 8 the general water chemistry data also indicate that our experimental system allowed exposing periphyton to distinct proportions of wastewater in the channels overall these results show that the experimental system provides for a purposeful control of mixing stream and wastewater while integrating the natural variations as would be typical in field situations with changes in environmental conditions e g rain events the slight deviations from the intended mixture values resulted from technical issues such as accumulation of solid particulates in the flow rotameters indeed particulate accumulation required daily cleaning and re adjustment of the mixture according to conductivity values this problem will be addressed in the future by setting up an online monitoring system for constant automatic fine tuning of the target mixture value 4 2 exposure to and accumulation of micropollutants in periphyton overall the grab water samples and passive sampler extracts were comparable for the majority of the analysed substances except for eight pesticides and eight pharmaceuticals these substances were either only quantified via passive sampling or occasionally in few of the grab water samples which indicates that they were not present all the time or present at concentrations below detection limits during grab sampling such results underline the fact that in contrast to grab sampling passive samplers better reflect the time integrated in situ exposure of periphyton to these compounds moschet et al 2015 the relative proportion of each substance group in periphyton differed from that found in the water with lower and higher proportions of artificial sweeteners and pesticides respectively in periphyton this shows that micropollutant composition and concentrations in periphyton also need to be characterized as grab water or passive sampling cannot reflect their association with periphyton indeed several factors may explain these differences the physicochemical properties of each substance such as hydrophobicity reflected by the octanol water partition coefficient kow can influence bioaccumulation for instance the three quantified artificial sweeteners are highly hydrophilic log kow 1 and therefore less prone to accumulate in phospho lipid structures according to log kow however hydrophobicity alone cannot fully explain our results since no significant correlation between log kow values and the ratios of micropollutant concentrations in periphyton and water was found when all the compounds n 44 micropollutants were taken into account pearson s r 0 23 p 0 14 si table 11 micropollutants can also undergo biotransformation processes within microbial cells reducing parent compound concentrations as it has been shown for the three artificial sweeteners cyclamate saccharine and acesulfame in periphyton communities downstream of a wwtp desiante et al 2021 presence within cells of specific molecular binding sites may as well influence bioaccumulation of micropollutants such as for the herbicides diuron terbutryn and isoproturon morin et al 2018 tlili et al 2011b thus explaining the high bcfs for these compounds compared to the other analysed micropollutants these are psii inhibitors that bind specifically to the protein d1 of the photosynthetic apparatus of phototrophic organisms such as diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria allen et al 1983 the physicochemical properties of the extracellular matrix of periphyton itself such as the presence of polysaccharide substances can also interfere with micropollutant uptake within periphyton bonnineau et al 2020 4 3 general descriptors of periphyton versus tolerance to micropollutants traditional descriptors such as biomass respiration and photosynthetic activity did not show a clear pattern in relation to the wastewater gradient as also previously shown in mesocosms pereda et al 2019 and field surveys lebkuecher et al 2018 tlili et al 2017 therefore these descriptors are not useful as specific indicators for wastewater borne stressors on periphyton yet exposure to passive sampler extracts derived from the wastewater buffer tank revealed that the phototrophic fraction of the biofilm had become tolerant upon exposure to wastewater indeed phototrophs responded less sensitively in terms of primary production and even less in terms of photosynthetic activity to the micropollutant mixture than the non exposed control communities did this outcome is in line with the reports on tolerance development in natural streams of periphyton exposed to wastewater extracts tlili et al 2017 2020 hence our engineered channel set up allowed reproducing to some extent the field conditions that are necessary for the development of tolerance upon exposure to wastewater effluents what is more the extract used for tolerance measurements was representative of the micropollutant mixture in wastewater si table 11 justifying its use in toxicity assays photosynthetic efficiency was more affected i e becoming more tolerant than primary production while both endpoints are proxies for photosynthesis their underlying processes are distinct specifically photosynthetic efficiency corresponds to light dependent reactions i e absorption of light energy by chlorophyll while primary production refers to light independent reactions i e assembly of sugar molecule from carbon dioxide yahia et al 2019 hence it is conceivable that their susceptibility to tolerance development may differ photosystem ii inhibitors i e those that were also found to preferentially accumulate in periphyton target photosynthetic efficiency specifically primary production on the other hand corresponds to the incorporation of carbon into biomass and may be affected by different classes of micropollutants with various modes of action this may therefore prevent the selection of tolerant taxa within the community when exposure levels are relatively low as in the 10 and 30 wastewater treatment in sharp contrast to phototrophs heterotrophs were not affected by the exposure to the passive sampler extract as shown with secondary production despite the presence of potential secondary production inhibitors within the mixture such as the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim bacterial secondary production has previously been used to assess the increased tolerance of heterotrophic communities in periphyton from downstream of wwtps tlili et al 2017 2020 in these studies bacterial secondary production was inhibited by micropollutant extracts from passive samplers deployed in wastewater effluents the reasons for the differences among studies are not yet clear but could be caused by a high level of baseline tolerance in the bacterial component of periphyton grown in the channels during the 4 week colonisation period including in the control communities without wastewater such results underline the importance of selecting reference communities with a relatively low baseline tolerance in pict studies 4 4 effect of wastewater on the structure of periphyton communities community structure was evaluated based on commonly used descriptors specifically beta diversity i e structural differences among several communities alpha diversity i e richness and shannon diversity index and relative abundance of taxa analysis of beta diversity revealed a differences of community structure with increasing wastewater proportion starting as low as 10 wastewater several field studies also reported on the impact of wastewater on the structure of periphyton communities from downstream of urban aubertheau et al 2017 lebkuecher et al 2018 romero et al 2019 and hospital chonova et al 2019 2018 effluents in contrast differences of alpha diversity indices did not strictly follow the wastewater gradient similar contrasting results between alpha and beta diversity indices have previously been reported in the field by comparing two upstream and two downstream sites of a wwtp lebkuecher et al 2018 and may be explained by several wastewater linked factors such as nutrients micropollutants microorganisms and metals nutrients may favour the growth of certain taxa while micropollutants may negatively influence the abundance of others van horn et al 2011 on the opposite antibiotics can also induce changes in the bacterial community structure of stream biofilms by favouring antibiotic resistant bacteria proia et al 2013 these changes may have consequences in terms of loss of biodiversity and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with potentially negative consequences for ecosystem functioning microorganisms originating from wwtps are also able to colonize downstream periphyton chonova et al 2019 mußmann et al 2013 thus likely influencing the structure of microbial community this may lead to two distinct communities with regard to beta diversity i e measuring the structural differences among several microbial communities being indistinguishable via alpha diversity indices i e richness and evenness of a given community the observed higher tolerance of the phototrophic component of periphyton to micropollutants may result from a direct effect of the wastewater on the abundance of phototrophs such as diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria for instance despite the fact that several diatom genera the dominating eukaryotic communities in periphyton battin et al 2016 were negatively impacted by the exposure to wastewater others were not impacted cocconeis and nitzschia or even stimulated ulnaria by the presence of wastewater and thus potentially contribute to the higher tolerance observed the higher abundance of cyanobacteria observed with increasing wastewater may also indicate potential contribution to the observed tolerance these phototrophic bacteria have already been shown to increase in the presence of wastewater in natural stream corcoll et al 2014 and microcosm carles and artigas 2020 romero et al 2019 studies indeed cyanobacteria can benefit from the protective environment given by periphyton and are known to be particularly tolerant to several micropollutants including herbicides forlani et al 2008 singh et al 2013 further experiments are needed to specifically investigate the direct link between pict and microbial community composition for instance by using simplified synthetic communities and sequential addition of each constituent of the wastewater effluent besides the direct impacts of wastewater on the phototrophic communities indirect effects may also occur through interspecific interactions and thereby contribute to the higher tolerance observed for instance micrograzers contribute significantly to the functioning of periphyton notably by modulating microbial populations via their grazing activity weitere et al 2018 in our study ciliophora abundance was higher in periphyton with increasing wastewater proportion potentially adding grazing pressure already at early stages of biofilm development böhme et al 2009 peng et al 2018 little is known to date about the role of micrograzers in periphyton tolerance to micropollutants and effects of wastewater on periphyton communities in general indeed most of the studies have focused on macro grazers feeding on periphyton for instance guasch et al 2016 have reported on synergistic effects of snails radix ovata lymnaeidae and the biocide triclosan on periphyton with a reduced capacity of detoxification and removal of dissolved nutrients complementary investigations are needed to specifically address this issue despite the fact that periphyton and wastewater communities correspond to two different life styles benthic vs planktonic and originate from distinct environments with different light conditions they share a non negligible proportion of their relative taxonomic abundance 20 and 43 for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively together with the observed increase of shared taxa between periphyton and wastewater and the decrease of taxa specific to wastewater this finding provides a first indication that tolerance may indeed arise at least in part from colonisation of periphyton by microorganisms from the wastewater this could be explained by a direct i e colonisation of periphyton by micropollutant tolerant taxa or an indirect effect of wastewater microorganisms on the structure of periphyton community the most plausible explanation is an indirect effect since phototrophs diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria for which the increased tolerance was observed were already present in control periphyton and almost not detected in wastewater several field surveys have shown that downstream bacterial i e prokaryotic community profiles in the water column were a mixture between the upstream and the effluent mansfeldt et al 2020 pascual benito et al 2020 price et al 2018 with an exception for cyanobacteria mansfeldt et al 2020 much less is known for periphyton communities one natural field study reported that several bacterial taxa considered to be indicators of wastewater effluents were also found in downstream periphyton even though they represented less than 5 of the total number of taxa in periphyton chonova et al 2019 mußmann et al 2013 have also shown that among all identified nitrifiers from wwtps only one taxon colonized in downstream periphyton overall a detailed characterization of the diversity profile of microorganisms from wastewater effluents that actively colonize downstream biofilms could help in identifying potential key players of the higher periphyton tolerance observed 5 conclusions the present study aimed at describing the differences in microbial community composition and diversity associated with the higher tolerance observed for periphyton exposed to a gradient of wastewater effluent we were able to grow periphyton in engineered flow through channels that allowed us to closely mimic natural conditions while being able to control flow and stream vs wastewater proportions the comprehensive set of biological and chemical analyses used led us to the following main conclusions the analysis of micropollutants in water and periphyton provided a comprehensive picture of exposure and bioavailability the relative proportion of each substance group in periphyton differed from that found in the water highlighting the need to consider bioaccumulation of micropollutants in periphyton in order to accurately link exposure to effects at the community level and the consequences for the ecosystem the exposure of periphyton to wastewater led to a higher tolerance of phototrophs to the mixture of micropollutants extracted from passive samplers compared to the control however we could not observe any inhibition of bacterial secondary production and consequently no increased tolerance for heterotrophs by the same micropollutant extract therefore the potential impact of micropollutants from the wastewater on periphyton was likely higher for phototrophs and may impact essential ecosystem functions provided by periphyton such as primary production and nutrient cycles wastewater induced significant differences in the structure of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities several wastewater constituents not only micropollutants but also nutrients microorganisms and metals may lead to these differences for instance our study provides additional indication of a transfer of microorganisms from wastewater to periphyton communities therefore the colonisation of periphyton by micropollutant tolerant microorganisms coming from the wastewater may contribute to the increased tolerance of periphyton downstream of wwtp future studies are needed to look specifically at the relative contribution of wastewater derived microorganisms in the establishment of periphyton tolerance to micropollutants for example

16722,wastewater treatment plants wwtps play an important role in retaining organic matter and nutrients but to a lesser extent micropollutants therefore treated wastewater is recognized as a major source of multiple stressors including complex mixtures of micropollutants these can potentially affect microbial communities in the receiving water bodies and the ecological functions they provide in this study we evaluated in flow through channels the consequences of an exposure to a mixture of stream water and different percentages of urban wwtp effluent ranging from 0 to 80 on the microbial diversity and function of periphyton communities assuming that micropollutants exert a selective pressure for tolerant microorganisms within communities we further examined the periphyton sensitivity to a micropollutant mixture extracted from passive samplers that were immersed in the wastewater effluent as well micropollutants in water and in periphyton were comprehensively quantified our results show that micropollutants detected in periphyton differed from those found in water both in term of concentration and composition especially photosystem ii inhibitors accumulated in periphyton more than other pesticides although effects of other substances cannot be excluded this accumulation may have contributed to the observed higher tolerance of phototrophic communities to micropollutants upon exposure to 30 and 80 of wastewater on the contrary no difference in tolerance was observed for heterotrophic communities exposure to the gradient of wastewater led to structural differences in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities for instance the relative abundance of cyanobacteria was higher with increasing percentage of wastewater effluent whereas the opposite was observed for diatoms such results could indicate that differences in community structure do not necessarily lead to higher tolerance this highlights the need to consider other wastewater constituents such as nutrients and wastewater derived microorganisms that can modulate community structure and tolerance by using engineered flow through channels that mimic to some extent the required field conditions for the development of tolerance in periphyton our study constitutes a base to investigate the mechanisms underlying the increased tolerance such as the potential role of microorganisms originating from wastewater effluents and different treatment options to reduce the micropollutant load in effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pollution induced community tolerance

micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial chemicals stamm et al 2016 due to the large variety of their chemical structures and modes of biological action these micropollutants can alter the function and structure of aquatic communities which may lead to the downgrading of the ecological status of the receiving waterbodies gessner and tlili 2016 vörösmarty et al 2010 a

mansfeldt et al 2020 mußmann et al 2013 pascual benito et al 2020 disentangling the specific effects of micropollutants from those of the other environmental stressors therefore requires study designs that embrace the chemical and biological complexity within ecosystems while providing means for controlled interventions to accomplish such a study design we constructed a flow through channel system which allows for exposure to increasing proportion of treated wastewater and used periphytic communities as a biological model periphyton also known as benthic biofilm is dominated by complex and dynamic assemblages of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms as well as micro and meiofauna embedded in an extracellular matrix of organic detritus phototrophic microorganisms includes unicellular eukaryotes such as diatoms and green algae and prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria interacting with heterotrophic bacteria prokaryotes battin et al 2016 biggs et al 1998 periphytic communities are ubiquitous in streams of small to moderate sizes in which they play a central role as the basis of aquatic food webs they contribute to primary production ecosystem respiration and element cycling battin et al 2016 with their high microbial diversity they exhibit a broad range of sensitivities to environmental stressors including micropollutants these features and ecological roles support the use of stream periphyton communities as a model to assess micropollutant effects in complex ecological systems montuelle et al 2010 sabater et al 2007 several studies have demonstrated that exposure to wastewater leads to changes in the taxonomic diversity of periphyton communities chonova et al 2018 price et al 2018 romero et al 2019 subirats et al 2017 although these studies focused on the bacterial and not on the algal composition in periphyton they showed that shifts in microbial communities were accompanied by the alteration of important ecological functions such as algal primary production heterotrophic respiration or organic matter decomposition notwithstanding these findings such structural and functional changes by themselves cannot be ascribed to specific effects of micropollutants or other stressors that are associated with wastewater discharges carr et al 2005 lebkuecher et al 2018 the concept of pollution induced community tolerance pict has been suggested by blanck et al 1988 as a tool to establish such a specific link between exposure to micropollutants and effects at the community level it rests on the fact that a common response in contaminated ecosystems consists in changes in community composition that result from the replacement of sensitive species by tolerant ones upon chronic exposures of communities to chemical stress millward and klerks 2002 as a consequence increased tolerance of a community to micropollutants may be used as an indicator of previous exposures tlili et al 2016 increased community tolerance to micropollutant mixtures has been demonstrated with stream periphyton communities in the field pesce et al 2011 and in microcosm studies foulquier et al 2015 kim tiam et al 2016 morin et al 2012 rotter et al 2013 in recent field surveys tlili et al 2017 2020 reported on an increased tolerance to micropollutant mixtures of phototrophic and heterotrophic communities in periphyton downstream compared to upstream of several wwtps the results showed that the fold increase in tolerance was positively correlated with the level of contamination with micropollutants at the respective sampling sites most importantly a substantial decrease in micropollutant concentrations by 85 as the result of upgrading the wwtp at one of the sampling sites with activated carbon filtration led to the loss of the previously measured community tolerance tlili et al 2020 however these studies did not include phylogenetic data in the analysis of microbial composition and hence did not allow identifying specific taxa that were positively or negatively impacted by wastewater effluents given this background the overarching goal of this study was to describe the differences in periphytic community composition and diversity that might be associated with the higher tolerance of periphyton exposed to a gradient of treated wastewater to reach this goal periphyton was grown in flow through channels that were continuously alimented with a mixture of stream water and different percentages of an urban wwtp effluent according to the pict concept we then determined the tolerance of periphyton communities towards a micropollutant mixture that was extracted from passive samplers deployed in the wastewater effluent moreover we performed a detailed analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities structure by means of genomic high throughput sequencing and a comprehensive quantification of micropollutant concentrations in the water in passive sampler extracts and in periphyton samples we hypothesised that periphyton communities will change across the gradient of wastewater constituents such as nutrients micropollutants microorganisms and metals leading to higher tolerance of the whole community to micropollutants this increased tolerance was measured specifically via bioassays according to the pict concept 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental system and design 2 1 1 channel

properties and micropollutants the ph temperature conductivity and oxygen concentration were measured daily in the 2 buffer tanks and in the 16 channels by using a multi parameter portable meter wtw meters germany additionally water samples were taken every week in the two buffer tanks stream water and wastewater and in the 16 channels for the measurement of 20 other water quality parameters see si table 2 for detailed list of parameters using standard methods as described by the swiss national river monitoring and survey programme foen 2020 a total of 51 organic micropollutants consisting of 21 pesticides 24 pharmaceuticals 3 artificial sweeteners 2 corrosion inhibitors and caffeine a tracer of sewage effluent in natural waters were analysed in grab and in 24 hour composite water samples as well as in extracts from passive samplers si ii 1 and si table 3 the substances were originally selected by munz et al 2017 who established a list of priority substances based on a large survey in 24 swiss streams that are impacted by wastewater effluents the selection criteria included detection frequency concentrations in municipal wastewater toxicity analytical restrictions and substance classes this mixture was also studied by tlili et al 2017 to investigate the tolerance of periphyton upstream and downstream of five swiss wwtps the channel system guaranteed a homogenous mixture of stream water and wastewater in each channel therefore 1 4 ml of the grab water samples can be considered representative for the analysis of water soluble compounds these samples were taken weekly in each channel and stored in 1 5 ml clear glass vials short thread with screw caps septa silicone ptfe bgb switzerland at 20 c until analysis preliminary results showed negligible variability among replicates thus only one channel has been selected for micropollutant analyses the composite samples were also taken weekly from the stream water and wastewater during 24 hours with an automated water sampler maxx tp5 c aktiv germany the water was automatically sampled 50 ml every 30 minutes pooled together and 1 4 ml of each 24 hour sample was stored in 1 5 ml clear glass vials at 20 c until chemical analysis composite samples from a dry weather and a rain weather period were selected for each week in parallel two attractspe disks sdb rps 47 mm diameter affinisep france with supor polyethersulfone pes membrane disc filters 47 mm diameter 0 45 µm pore size vwr switzerland were installed in two channels of each treatment to sample polar to semi polar organic micropollutants according to moschet et al 2015 two passive samplers from two different channels were selected from each sampling period for micropollutant analyses for each treatment n 4 the same type of passive samplers but without pes membrane were also deployed in the wastewater buffer tank and the accumulated micropollutants were extracted and used for the pict bioassays tlili et al 2017 prior to their deployment all passive samplers were conditioned with methanol and then with nanopure water for 30 min each on a rotary shaker then the sdb disks were placed on a steel plate covered or not by the pes membrane closed by a cover plate and stored in nanopure water at room temperature in order to remain in the linear adsorption range moschet et al 2015 the passive samplers were deployed during twelve days and renewed for a second twelve day period 2 2 2 sampling for biological analyses periphyton growing on five glass slides from the same channel was scraped pooled and suspended in 200 ml of evian

period of 12 days resulting in a theoretical concentration in water ng l 1 micropollutants were also analysed in the passive sampler extract used for the pict bioassays see tlili et al 2017 for the

data analyses in order to assess tolerance in periphyton induced by wastewater concentration activity curves of the four biological replicates n 4 channels of each treatment were plotted as a function of decreasing passive sampler extract dilutions the background measured in the formaldehyde controls was subtracted from each activity value the final value was normalised by the activity measured in the micropollutant free control for each treatment the data corresponding to four biological replicates and 6 passive sampler dilutions 20 n 24 were then fitted with the doseresp function of the

distributed were transformed using logarithmic or box cox functions statistical analyses were carried out in r 3 6 1 by using rstudio version 1 2 5001 sequencing data analyses were performed with the r package phyloseq version 1 32 0 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 after rarefaction 16s and 18s rrna datasets were composed of samples containing the same number of reads 98 089 and 97 001 reads respectively alpha diversity i e richness and evenness of a given periphyton community was evaluated for each wastewater proportion via shannon diversity index and chao1 species richness with the package phyloseq the analysis of beta diversity i e measuring the structural differences among several communities was based on weighted unifrac distances which use the phylogenetic distances between taxa and their

alkalinity na k cl so4 2 nh4 no2 ortho phosphate total phosphorus silicic acid dissolved organic carbon total organic carbon total nitrogen and total inorganic carbon were significantly higher in wastewater than in stream water while the opposite was observed for ph and oxygen anova p 0 001 the principal component analysis pca of the entire physicochemical dataset clearly distinguishes the four groups corresponding to 0 10 30 and 80 of wastewater from the stream and wastewater buffer tanks at each sampling time fig 1 this distinction was seen throughout the four weeks of experimentation despite the fact that the physicochemical parameters fluctuated over time si tables 1 and 2 most likely due to rain events 3 2 micropollutants in water and periphyton stream water and wastewater were continuously sampled during the 4 week colonisation period for micropollutant analysis in composite samples most of the target substances were found in both water sources si fig 1 and si table 7 the total concentrations of each substance group was higher in wastewater than in stream water for instance pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners i e acesulfame cyclamate and sucralose and corrosion inhibitors i e benzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole were on average 20 times higher in the wastewater si fig 1 and si table 7 micropollutant concentrations in the channels were determined either in grab water samples si table 8 or in the passive sampler extracts before back calculating average concentrations in the water as described by moschet et al 2015 si tables 9a and 9b micropollutant concentrations overall correlated between grab and passive samples pearson s r 0 88 p 0 001 except for eight pharmaceuticals and eight pesticides including deet and pirimicarb only quantified in passive sampler extracts and the pharmaceutical gabapentin only quantified in grab samples si tables 8 and 9b total concentration of micropollutants in the channels increased with the wastewater proportion for all substance groups fig 2 for instance the concentrations of the two photosystem ii psii inhibitors diuron and isoproturon seemed to increase by a factor of eight and ten respectively from 0 to 80 wastewater treatments si table 9b the total micropollutant concentration in periphyton was as well increased with increasing wastewater proportion fig 2 indicating that periphyton was able to accumulate micropollutants from the water phase for instance although only five out of the 21 targeted pesticides were detectable in periphyton the concentrations of three of them diuron isoproturon and terbutryn were approximately 1 5 to 3 times higher in the 80 wastewater treatment compared to the control si table 10 these three compounds displayed the highest bcfs of all the compounds analysed table 1 however the relative proportion of each substance group fig 2 and detection frequency of each substance in periphyton si table 10 differed strongly from those found in the water and the passive samplers si table 9b an example are artificial sweeteners whose relative proportion decreased in periphyton whereas the opposite was observed for pesticides for artificial sweeteners the absence of matrix effect was checked by assigning the value of the limit of quantification loq of each compound when its concentration was loq 3 3 periphyton characterization biomass nutrient stoichiometry and functions despite the measured increase in nutrient concentrations in the channels with increasing wastewater proportion periphyton biomass total algal bacterial did not differ among the treatments table 2 anova p 0 0632 p 0 1662 and p 0 2099 respectively importantly the increase of available nutrients in the water phase did not impact the stoichiometry of nutrients in periphyton as shown by the lack of significant differences among the treatments in the elemental ratios c n c p and n p table 2 anova p 0 4392 p 0 265 and p 0 2962 respectively furthermore the c n p ratios were about 126 18 1 and therefore closer to the one described for algae 106 16 1 redfield et al 1963 than for bacteria 45 9 1 goldman et al 1987 among the measured functional endpoints only bacterial secondary production significantly differed upon exposure to 30 wastewater compared to the control 0 wastewater while photosynthetic activity differed between 30 and 80 wastewater table 2 3 4 community tolerance to micropollutants tolerance of periphyton was assessed via short term assays with a micropollutant mixture extracted from the passive samplers that had been deployed in the buffer tank holding the wastewater a higher tolerance of phototrophs was found for periphyton exposed to wastewater table 3 and si fig 2 specifically the ec20 and ec50 values for photosynthetic efficiency were higher for the periphyton from 30 and 80 treatment than for the control 0 wastewater for algal primary production ec20 and ec50 values were significantly higher in the 80 wastewater treatment thanin the control corroborating an increased tolerance of phototrophs in contrast secondary production which is associated with heterotrophs did not indicate any wastewater related tolerance even with the highest tested micropollutant concentration si fig 2 3 5 diversity and taxonomic abundance of periphyton communities in order to investigate the impact of wastewater on community composition 18s and 16s rrna gene sequencing was used focussing on the richness diversity and composition of eukaryotes e g diatoms and green algae and prokaryotes e g cyanobacteria respectively alpha diversity i e the taxonomic richness and shannon diversity index of prokaryotes was higher in the 30 wastewater tukey s test p 0 05 whereas it did not differ from the control for the 80 wastewater fig 3 a and b for eukaryotes a similar trend was observed for taxonomic richness but not for diversity fig 3c and d except for the eukaryotic shannon index fig 3d alpha diversity in the community isolated from the wastewater buffer tank was similar to that of periphyton from the 80 wastewater treatment wastewater also led to a separation in the beta diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities permanova p 0 001 fig 4 this separation increased with wastewater proportion as attested by the significant differences between each periphyton group pairwise permanova p 0 05 in terms of abundance of taxa a total of 36 prokaryotic and 34 eukaryotic phyla were identified in periphyton and the community sampled from the wastewater buffer tank si figs 3 and 4 the notable proportion of taxa without affiliation na for eukaryotes reflects the lack of information in the databases in comparison to those for prokaryotes the relative abundance of the ten most abundant prokaryotic and eukaryotic phyla in periphyton and wastewater communities is shown in fig 5 wastewater effluent differentially influenced the relative abundance of prokaryotic phyla in periphyton fig 5a among the six phyla that were higher with increasing wastewater proportion acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi cyanobacteria and parcubacteria cyanobacteria i e phototrophic prokaryotes stood out in particular because their proportion was higher in periphyton with wastewater despite the fact that this phylum was present at low abundance in the wastewater buffer tank fig 5a a detailed analysis at the class level of proteobacteria in the bacterial community shows that the relative abundance of alpha and beta proteobacteria decreases with wastewater proportion while the opposite is observed for delta and epsilon proteobacteria si fig 5 several eukaryotic phyla annelida platyhelminthes and zoopagomycota were also higher with wastewater proportion even though similarly to cyanobacteria their abundance in the wastewater buffer tank was relatively low fig 5b in contrast cercozoa and discocea were dominant in the wastewater community but low in abundance in any of the artificial streams bacillariophyta diatoms and chlorophyta green algae negatively correlated with the wastewater proportion fig 5b however a detailed analysis at the genus level showed that responses to the wastewater exposure differed within each of these two phyla si figs 6 and 7 for instance while several diatoms e g cocconeis and nitzschia and green algae e g chlorochytrium and scenedesmus genera were not impacted the relative abundance of the diatom ulnaria and the green algae mychonastes were significantly higher in periphyton with the increase of wastewater proportion si figs 6 and 7 to shed light on the partitioning of taxa among periphyton and the community isolated from the wastewater buffer tank venn diagrams were constructed fig 6 in terms of prokaryotes fig 6a periphyton specific taxa dominated in all treatments by at least 64 relative abundance the taxa shared with the community from the wastewater buffer tank increased in relative abundance from 19 0 wastewater to 34 80 wastewater in terms of eukaryotes fig 6b periphyton specific taxa again dominated in relative abundance for all treatments but the proportion shared with that of the community in the wastewater buffer tank was higher than for prokaryotes reaching up to 53 4 discussion 4 1 validation of the experimental system by mixing treated wastewater and stream water proportionally the pre set percentages of wastewater were approximately reached this was confirmed by conductivity measurements experimental proportions of 11 8 and 23 9 wastewater were calculated for the intended 10 and 30 wastewater proportions respectively si fig 8 the general water chemistry data also indicate that our experimental system allowed exposing periphyton to distinct proportions of wastewater in the channels overall these results show that the experimental system provides for a purposeful control of mixing stream and wastewater while integrating the natural variations as would be typical in field situations with changes in environmental conditions e g rain events the slight deviations from the intended mixture values resulted from technical issues such as accumulation of solid particulates in the flow rotameters indeed particulate accumulation required daily cleaning and re adjustment of the mixture according to conductivity values this problem will be addressed in the future by setting up an online monitoring system for constant automatic fine tuning of the target mixture value 4 2 exposure to and accumulation of micropollutants in periphyton overall the grab water samples and passive sampler extracts were comparable for the majority of the analysed substances except for eight pesticides and eight pharmaceuticals these substances were either only quantified via passive sampling or occasionally in few of the grab water samples which indicates that they were not present all the time or present at concentrations below detection limits during grab sampling such results underline the fact that in contrast to grab sampling passive samplers better reflect the time integrated in situ exposure of periphyton to these compounds moschet et al 2015 the relative proportion of each substance group in periphyton differed from that found in the water with lower and higher proportions of artificial sweeteners and pesticides respectively in periphyton this shows that micropollutant composition and concentrations in periphyton also need to be characterized as grab water or passive sampling cannot reflect their association with periphyton indeed several factors may explain these differences the physicochemical properties of each substance such as hydrophobicity reflected by the octanol water partition coefficient kow can influence bioaccumulation for instance the three quantified artificial sweeteners are highly hydrophilic log kow 1 and therefore less prone to accumulate in phospho lipid structures according to log kow however hydrophobicity alone cannot fully explain our results since no significant correlation between log kow values and the ratios of micropollutant concentrations in periphyton and water was found when all the compounds n 44 micropollutants were taken into account pearson s r 0 23 p 0 14 si table 11 micropollutants can also undergo biotransformation processes within microbial cells reducing parent compound concentrations as it has been shown for the three artificial sweeteners cyclamate saccharine and acesulfame in periphyton communities downstream of a wwtp desiante et al 2021 presence within cells of specific molecular binding sites may as well influence bioaccumulation of micropollutants such as for the herbicides diuron terbutryn and isoproturon morin et al 2018 tlili et al 2011b thus explaining the high bcfs for these compounds compared to the other analysed micropollutants these are psii inhibitors that bind specifically to the protein d1 of the photosynthetic apparatus of phototrophic organisms such as diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria allen et al 1983 the physicochemical properties of the extracellular matrix of periphyton itself such as the presence of polysaccharide substances can also interfere with micropollutant uptake within periphyton bonnineau et al 2020 4 3 general descriptors of periphyton versus tolerance to micropollutants traditional descriptors such as biomass respiration and photosynthetic activity did not show a clear pattern in relation to the wastewater gradient as also previously shown in mesocosms pereda et al 2019 and field surveys lebkuecher et al 2018 tlili et al 2017 therefore these descriptors are not useful as specific indicators for wastewater borne stressors on periphyton yet exposure to passive sampler extracts derived from the wastewater buffer tank revealed that the phototrophic fraction of the biofilm had become tolerant upon exposure to wastewater indeed phototrophs responded less sensitively in terms of primary production and even less in terms of photosynthetic activity to the micropollutant mixture than the non exposed control communities did this outcome is in line with the reports on tolerance development in natural streams of periphyton exposed to wastewater extracts tlili et al 2017 2020 hence our engineered channel set up allowed reproducing to some extent the field conditions that are necessary for the development of tolerance upon exposure to wastewater effluents what is more the extract used for tolerance measurements was representative of the micropollutant mixture in wastewater si table 11 justifying its use in toxicity assays photosynthetic efficiency was more affected i e becoming more tolerant than primary production while both endpoints are proxies for photosynthesis their underlying processes are distinct specifically photosynthetic efficiency corresponds to light dependent reactions i e absorption of light energy by chlorophyll while primary production refers to light independent reactions i e assembly of sugar molecule from carbon dioxide yahia et al 2019 hence it is conceivable that their susceptibility to tolerance development may differ photosystem ii inhibitors i e those that were also found to preferentially accumulate in periphyton target photosynthetic efficiency specifically primary production on the other hand corresponds to the incorporation of carbon into biomass and may be affected by different classes of micropollutants with various modes of action this may therefore prevent the selection of tolerant taxa within the community when exposure levels are relatively low as in the 10 and 30 wastewater treatment in sharp contrast to phototrophs heterotrophs were not affected by the exposure to the passive sampler extract as shown with secondary production despite the presence of potential secondary production inhibitors within the mixture such as the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim bacterial secondary production has previously been used to assess the increased tolerance of heterotrophic communities in periphyton from downstream of wwtps tlili et al 2017 2020 in these studies bacterial secondary production was inhibited by micropollutant extracts from passive samplers deployed in wastewater effluents the reasons for the differences among studies are not yet clear but could be caused by a high level of baseline tolerance in the bacterial component of periphyton grown in the channels during the 4 week colonisation period including in the control communities without wastewater such results underline the importance of selecting reference communities with a relatively low baseline tolerance in pict studies 4 4 effect of wastewater on the structure of periphyton communities community structure was evaluated based on commonly used descriptors specifically beta diversity i e structural differences among several communities alpha diversity i e richness and shannon diversity index and relative abundance of taxa analysis of beta diversity revealed a differences of community structure with increasing wastewater proportion starting as low as 10 wastewater several field studies also reported on the impact of wastewater on the structure of periphyton communities from downstream of urban aubertheau et al 2017 lebkuecher et al 2018 romero et al 2019 and hospital chonova et al 2019 2018 effluents in contrast differences of alpha diversity indices did not strictly follow the wastewater gradient similar contrasting results between alpha and beta diversity indices have previously been reported in the field by comparing two upstream and two downstream sites of a wwtp lebkuecher et al 2018 and may be explained by several wastewater linked factors such as nutrients micropollutants microorganisms and metals nutrients may favour the growth of certain taxa while micropollutants may negatively influence the abundance of others van horn et al 2011 on the opposite antibiotics can also induce changes in the bacterial community structure of stream biofilms by favouring antibiotic resistant bacteria proia et al 2013 these changes may have consequences in terms of loss of biodiversity and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with potentially negative consequences for ecosystem functioning microorganisms originating from wwtps are also able to colonize downstream periphyton chonova et al 2019 mußmann et al 2013 thus likely influencing the structure of microbial community this may lead to two distinct communities with regard to beta diversity i e measuring the structural differences among several microbial communities being indistinguishable via alpha diversity indices i e richness and evenness of a given community the observed higher tolerance of the phototrophic component of periphyton to micropollutants may result from a direct effect of the wastewater on the abundance of phototrophs such as diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria for instance despite the fact that several diatom genera the dominating eukaryotic communities in periphyton battin et al 2016 were negatively impacted by the exposure to wastewater others were not impacted cocconeis and nitzschia or even stimulated ulnaria by the presence of wastewater and thus potentially contribute to the higher tolerance observed the higher abundance of cyanobacteria observed with increasing wastewater may also indicate potential contribution to the observed tolerance these phototrophic bacteria have already been shown to increase in the presence of wastewater in natural stream corcoll et al 2014 and microcosm carles and artigas 2020 romero et al 2019 studies indeed cyanobacteria can benefit from the protective environment given by periphyton and are known to be particularly tolerant to several micropollutants including herbicides forlani et al 2008 singh et al 2013 further experiments are needed to specifically investigate the direct link between pict and microbial community composition for instance by using simplified synthetic communities and sequential addition of each constituent of the wastewater effluent besides the direct impacts of wastewater on the phototrophic communities indirect effects may also occur through interspecific interactions and thereby contribute to the higher tolerance observed for instance micrograzers contribute significantly to the functioning of periphyton notably by modulating microbial populations via their grazing activity weitere et al 2018 in our study ciliophora abundance was higher in periphyton with increasing wastewater proportion potentially adding grazing pressure already at early stages of biofilm development böhme et al 2009 peng et al 2018 little is known to date about the role of micrograzers in periphyton tolerance to micropollutants and effects of wastewater on periphyton communities in general indeed most of the studies have focused on macro grazers feeding on periphyton for instance guasch et al 2016 have reported on synergistic effects of snails radix ovata lymnaeidae and the biocide triclosan on periphyton with a reduced capacity of detoxification and removal of dissolved nutrients complementary investigations are needed to specifically address this issue despite the fact that periphyton and wastewater communities correspond to two different life styles benthic vs planktonic and originate from distinct environments with different light conditions they share a non negligible proportion of their relative taxonomic abundance 20 and 43 for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively together with the observed increase of shared taxa between periphyton and wastewater and the decrease of taxa specific to wastewater this finding provides a first indication that tolerance may indeed arise at least in part from colonisation of periphyton by microorganisms from the wastewater this could be explained by a direct i e colonisation of periphyton by micropollutant tolerant taxa or an indirect effect of wastewater microorganisms on the structure of periphyton community the most plausible explanation is an indirect effect since phototrophs diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria for which the increased tolerance was observed were already present in control periphyton and almost not detected in wastewater several field surveys have shown that downstream bacterial i e prokaryotic community profiles in the water column were a mixture between the upstream and the effluent mansfeldt et al 2020 pascual benito et al 2020 price et al 2018 with an exception for cyanobacteria mansfeldt et al 2020 much less is known for periphyton communities one natural field study reported that several bacterial taxa considered to be indicators of wastewater effluents were also found in downstream periphyton even though they represented less than 5 of the total number of taxa in periphyton chonova et al 2019 mußmann et al 2013 have also shown that among all identified nitrifiers from wwtps only one taxon colonized in downstream periphyton overall a detailed characterization of the diversity profile of microorganisms from wastewater effluents that actively colonize downstream biofilms could help in identifying potential key players of the higher periphyton tolerance observed 5 conclusions the present study aimed at describing the differences in microbial community composition and diversity associated with the higher tolerance observed for periphyton exposed to a gradient of wastewater effluent we were able to grow periphyton in engineered flow through channels that allowed us to closely mimic natural conditions while being able to control flow and stream vs wastewater proportions the comprehensive set of biological and chemical analyses used led us to the following main conclusions the analysis of micropollutants in water and periphyton provided a comprehensive picture of exposure and bioavailability the relative proportion of each substance group in periphyton differed from that found in the water highlighting the need to consider bioaccumulation of micropollutants in periphyton in order to accurately link exposure to effects at the community level and the consequences for the ecosystem the exposure of periphyton to wastewater led to a higher tolerance of phototrophs to the mixture of micropollutants extracted from passive samplers compared to the control however we could not observe any inhibition of bacterial secondary production and consequently no increased tolerance for heterotrophs by the same micropollutant extract therefore the potential impact of micropollutants from the wastewater on periphyton was likely higher for phototrophs and may impact essential ecosystem functions provided by periphyton such as primary production and nutrient cycles wastewater induced significant differences in the structure of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities several wastewater constituents not only micropollutants but also nutrients microorganisms and metals may lead to these differences for instance our study provides additional indication of a transfer of microorganisms from wastewater to periphyton communities therefore the colonisation of periphyton by micropollutant tolerant microorganisms coming from the wastewater may contribute to the increased tolerance of periphyton downstream of wwtp future studies are needed to look specifically at the relative contribution of wastewater derived microorganisms in the establishment of periphyton tolerance to micropollutants for example this can be achieved by removing microorganisms from the effluent before measuring periphyton tolerance author contributions lc aj r i l e ks ns cs and at conceived and designed the study lc sw and aj

16723,introducing fermentation technology into sewage treatment is a sustainable development concept but future application still faces many challenges a novel partial nitrification fermentation based double denitrification bioprocess pn f double dn was achieved in three separated sbr type reactors simultaneously treating high ammonia 1766 6 mg l mature landfill leachate and external waste activated sludge was mlss 20 6 g l firstly nh4 n was oxidized to no2 n in partial nitrification reactor pn sbr with nitrite accumulation ratio nar of 96 5 next the pn sbr effluent no2 n 1529 8 mg l coupled with the was were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation denitrification ifd sbr the occurrence of fermentation was mainly attributed to free nitrous acid fna nitrite protonate form promoting the splitting decomposition of sludge spatial configuration and interfacial forces the released volatile fatty acids vfas were utilized in situ during the denitrification process no2 n n2 obtaining 0 6 kg m3 d nitrogen removal rate and 3 3 kg m3 d sludge reduction rate finally undesirable fermentation by products from ifd sbr nh4 n 119 2 mg l were further removed in the endogenous post denitrification reactor epd sbr through operational strategy of anaerobic aerobic anoxic by residual vfas as the carbon source in the epd sbr defluviicoccus 0 9 and candidatus competibacter 5 8 dominated carbon source storage and nitrogen removal acting as a typical denitrifying glycogen accumulating organism dgao with an intracellular carbon storage efficiency of 83 1 and nitrogen removal contribution of 93 7 after 200 days of operation the pn f double dn process provided effluent containing on average 1 86 mg l nh4 n and 5 5 mg l nox n with 98 5 tn removal compared with traditional bioprocesses pn f double dn allowed up to 25 saving in aeration energy consumption 100 decrease in carbon source demand and achieve 46 1 external was reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mature landfill leachate was fermentation intracellular carbon storage endogenous denitrification 1 introduction landfill leachate contains numerous imperishable inorganic and organic pollutants including salts heavy metals nh4 n and acids which significantly threaten the natural environment and human health the composition of landfill leachate varies according to landfill age with the chemical oxygen demand cod decreasing over time from 5000 23 000 mg l in early age landfill leachate to 1600 2100 mg l in mature landfill leachate harrad et al 2019 the early or medium age landfill leachate c n ratio 1 8 was previously treated by combined process of partial nitrification anammox and denitrification azari et al 2017a 2017b however the mature landfill leachate is difficult to be realize efficient nitrogen removal through biological process due to the characteristics of a high nh4 n load 1300 mg l and an extremely low c n ratio 1 1 8 zhang et al 2020a waste activated sludge was as wastewater treatment by product is also a widespread problem causing extensive environmental pollution a large amount of excess sludge is unavoidable produced in sewage treatment plants fang et al 2020 huang et al 2016 xu et al 2020b by the end of 2019 excess was 80 moisture content production reached 60 million tons year in china xu et al 2020b and the related treatment cost accounts for over 60 of the waste water treatment plant wwtp operation cost volatile fatty acid vfa production a promising technology in sludge resource recovery and stabilization has attracted growing attention for was treatment as a raw substrate vfas can be treated as raw substrate for bioenergy generation wang et al 2018 biodegradable plastic production lee et al 2014 and organic matter for nutrient removing microorganisms fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 significantly mature landfill leachate treatment needs carbon sources while vfas is potentially produced during was fermentation thus advanced nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate becomes possible through combination with sludge fermentation according to current literature physical treatments microwave thermal ultrasonic etc neumann et al 2017 yu et al 2010 chemical treatments ozone surfactant alkali free acid free nitrous acid huang et al 2015 lu et al 2020 and enzyme biological treatments fang et al 2020 yang et al 2010 could effectively improve the sludge fermentation performance although various techniques could enhance vfa generation from was fermentation it is currently unknown how to achieve acceptable interaction between sludge reduction and sewage treatment and subsequent removal of fermentation metabolites nitrogen and phosphorus due to the special physical or chemical environment required by fermentation the was disposal line is usually independent of the wastewater treatment process in actual wwtps therefore how to realize the combination of wastewater and was treatment in one single biological system is an urgent problem to be solved for the first time a novel partial nitrification fermentation based double denitrification bioprocess pn f double dn was used to simultaneously realize advanced nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate and external was fermentation mature landfill leachate was firstly introduced to an aerobic reactor for partial nitrification pn sbr next pn sbr effluent and concentration external was were pumped into an anoxic reactor to undergo integrated fermentation denitrification ifd sbr in our previous study the natural structure of sludge was found to be dismantled by fna biotoxicity inhibition zhang et al 2020b 2019b which further promotes the release of organic carbon source the discovery of this new mechanism provides an innovative approach for the collaborative treatment of wastewater and was finally the nh4 n released during the fermentation process was removed in the endogenous post denitrification reactor epd sbr through an anaerobic aerobic anoxic operation strategy in the epd sbr the carbon source generated from fermentation was assimilated by glycogen accumulating organisms and then transformed into polyhydroxyalkanoates phas inside the cell during the pre anaerobic stage that is the carbon source served as an electronic donor for the denitrification process during the post anoxic stage and avoided being consumed during the aerobic stage the objective of this study was to investigate the mature landfill leachate treatment performance of pn f double dn additionally the potential fermentation mechanism was explored from the perspective of sludge and extracellular polymeric substances eps physical structure transformation besides high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to identify the microbial structure of the epd system finally the environmental sustainability aeration energy consumption external carbon source demand and biomass production and engineering application potential nitrogen removal capacity and was reduction performance were evaluated to the best of our knowledge pn f double dn is the first attempt to achieve simultaneous treatment of mature landfill leachate and was 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation the pn f double dn process was operated for 200 days using three separated sbr type reactors fig 1 a the pn sbr 10 0 l working volume was fed with high nh4 n load mature landfill leachate 5 0 l nh4 n 1766 6 mg l by a peristaltic pump with a volume exchange ratio ver of 50 the pn sbr facilitated partial nitrification to produce no2 n and the duration was accurately controlled by real time parameters in which aeration was stopped immediately once the ammonia valley emerged on the ph profile supplementary fig s1 zhang et al 2017 the pn effluent was stored in a middle tank next concentrated external was 1 5 l mlss 20 6 g l coupled with half of

mixing duration of the ifd sbr was controlled by the nitrite apex in the ph profile supplementary fig s2 zhang et al 2019a and the reaction cycle was half of that in the pn sbr fig 1b effluent from two ifd sbr operational cycles was pumped to the epd sbr 10 0 l working volume 50 ver for a deep fermentation metabolic treatment nh4 n 119 2 mg l in the stable phase a typical epd sbr cycle consisted of a pre anaerobic stage 2 h a microaerobic dissolved oxygen do stage real time control and a post anoxic stage real time control fig 1b and c the duration of the aerobic and post anoxic stages were controlled by the ammonia valley and nitrite apex respectively on the ph profile the mixed liquid suspended solids of pn sbr ifd sbr and epd sbr were 3822 5 4218 4 mg l 126 533 2 17 092 1 mg l and 4631 5 5062 6 mg l respectively the pn f double dn process operated for 200 days four phases were divided according to the epd sbr operational characteristics table 1 during phase i 0 20 days the anaerobic aerobic anoxic operational strategy was applied in the epd sbr with a pre anaerobic duration of 0 5 h and 2 3 mg l do at aerobic stage during phase ii the pre anaerobic stage duration was prolonged to 2 h to strengthen intracellular carbon storage to achieve partial nitrification and avoid unnecessary waste of excess carbons source during the aerobic stage combined strategies of real time control low do concentration below 0 5 mg l and short sludge retention time srt 8 d were applied during phase iii after partial nitrification maintenance the srt was extended to 12 d to further enhance the reaction rate by enriching absolute ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 2 2 seeding biomass and wastewater all of the seeding biomass and concentrated was table s1 were collected from a

in the epd sbr the influent carbon source from the mature landfill leachate and fermentation production contained a large amount of refractory organics only vfas could be used as the preferred carbon

characterize the sludge physical structure in a typical ifd sbr operational cycle according to guan et al 1998 the sludge samples df and average particle size were investigated using a small angle light scattering analyzer malvern panalytical mastersizer 2000e briefly sludge samples 5 ml were collected from the ifd sbr at 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 and 16 h and then analyzed to obtain the wave vector and scattered light intensity of the light scattered in the range of 0 03 6 25 laser light scattering measurements were used to characterize the eps spatial configuration detailed eps extraction procedure using a dls sls spectrometer brookhaven bi 200sm is provided in supplementary information s2 according to previous literature xu et al 2020b the shape of eps is assumed to be spherical the precise differential refractomer was determined at 532 nm and 25 c with 0 16 ml g refractive index increments 2 7 analytical methods the sewage samples were collected daily and analyzed the concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n after filtering through 0 45 um paper mlss mlvss and cod were analyzed by the standard methods eaton et al 1966 the summation of poly b hydroxybutyrate phb and poly

1100 series via gas chromatography wtw multi 3420 was equipped to provide parameters ph and do for guiding real time control 3 results and discussion 3 1 partial nitrification performance of mature landfill leachate during the whole operation period pn sbr was continuously operated for 200 days at stable volume exchange ratio of 50 the ammonia transformation ratio atr reached to 98 4 with influent and effluent nh4 n concentrations of 1766 6 and 25 4 mg l respectively fig 2 a the average effluent nitrite concentration ranged between 1418 5 and 1696 4 mg l with a nitrite accumulation ratio nar of 96 5 fig 2b indicating a typical partial nitrification performance notably proliferation of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob always accompanied aob enrichment in which produced nitrite was further oxidized to nitrate by the nob kent et al 2019 wang et al 2020a 2016 in fact a desirable partial nitrification performance was mainly determined by the effective inhibition of nob high concentrations of free acid fa and real time control of ph were two main factors for stable partial nitrification because different fa inhibition thresholds exist for aob and nob wang et al 2020a 2020b concluded that the optimal fa for the maintenance of partial nitrification is between 16 4 and 32 1 mg l fig 2a during the initial operation 36 3 mg l fa was obtained after injection of the high nh4 n load mature landfill leachate real time ph parameter was also installed to accurately control the aeration duration and avoids further oxidation of no2 n to no3 n by nob supplementary fig s1 overall an average nar of 96 5 was obtained under the influent nh4 n tn and cod concentrations of 1766 6 1992 3 and 2112 9 mg l respectively 3 2 overview of was reduction and nitrogen removal capacity in ifd system 3 2 1 performance of fermentation and denitrification in the ifd sbr pn sbr effluent no2 n 1529 8 mg l coupled with concentrated external was mlss 20 6 g l was simultaneously injected to ifd sbr for integrated fermentation denitrification as the protonated form of no2 n free nitrous acid fna could dismantle the natural structure of the sludge via biotoxicity inhibition and effectively promote the fermentation performance for example previous studies have demonstrated that the was fermentative efficiency can be enhanced by 15 21 after pretreated with 0 2 mg l fna for 3 h duan et al 2020 while zhang emphasized that cell decay rate increased from 0 044 to 0 102 d with fna concentrations of 0 197 1 97 mg l which were significantly higher than that of the control group cell decay rate 0 012 d fna 0 mg l zhang et al 2020b during the long term operation the mlss concentration decreased from 20 603 1 to 11 093 2 mg l under initial fna of 0 31 mg l fig 3 a which corresponded to a 3 3 kg m3 d sludge reduction rate srr fig 3c organic matter in was that is released during the fermentation process subsequently serves as preferred organic matter for microorganisms replenishing deficient electronic donors for the denitrification process no2 n n2 in a typical ifd sbr cycle supplementary fig s2 the no2 n concentration decreased from 640 4 to 2 2 mg l over 10 7 h with a nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 6 kg m3d unlike the change in nitrite over time the vfas were first constant 0 10 5 h and then increased 10 5 h during the combined process which indicates that the carbon source consumption rate by denitrification was higher over the first 10 5 h than the fermentation rate and that vfas accumulated after complete denitrification as a result an average 356 8 mg cod l vfa was found in the ifd sbr effluent fig 3b fermentation and nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate were simultaneously achieved in the ifd sbr with a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 92 0 a sludge reduction efficiency sre of 46 1 and an effluent nox n concentration of 3 8 mg l fig 3 however as an undesirable fermentation metabolite 119 2 mg l of released nh4 n should be further treated to meet strict wastewater discharge standards 3 2 2 potential fermentation mechanism sludge and eps physical structure to reveal the manner in which fermentation is accelerated by fna sludge fractal dimension df and eps spatial configuration changes were explored during a typical ifd sbr cycle df is considered as important index to ascertain the sludge physical structure xu et al 2020a a higher df value usually reflects sludge with a compact physical structure small interior pores and low molecular mobility conversely a lower df value usually reflects sludge with a looser physical structure and greater organic molecular mobility wu et al 2020 the df value of different sludge samples ranged from 2 25 to 2 32 during the integrated fermentation denitrification process consistent with previous findings demonstrating rough surface irregular particles df values always changed between 2 0 to 3 0 wu et al 2002 the value of df decreased continuously with extension of reaction time which suggests that the physical structure of initial sludge was most compact and subsequently disintegrated due to fna fig 4 in our previous study the natural structure of the sludge was dismantled by fna biotoxicity inhibition zhang et al 2020b it is reasonable to assume that solubilization and hydrolysis of organics in the was were enhanced by disintegration of the sludge physical structure one interesting phenomenon was that df fluctuation during the initial 4 h was much higher than that in last 12 h which suggests that drastic physical structure changes occurred during the initial 4 h fig 4 this may be due to a series of substantial changes in the sludge structural stability which was formerly referred to as physical structure and latter referred to as thermodynamics of solid liquid interfaces xu et al 2020b eps is well acknowledged as the sludge backbone creating the sludge three dimensional matrix by bridging bacterial cells thus the sludge structural stability can also be responsible by the eps spatial configuration kazakov et al 2002 as indicators of biopolymer shape properties the z average root mean square radius of gyration rg and hydrodynamic radius rh are typically used to characterize the eps spatial configuration mahata et al 2021 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2020c notably biopolymer chain conformation and architecture are directly indicated by the parameter of ρ rg rh various eps spatial shapes can be identified by the ρ value ρ 2 0 rigid rod 2 0 ρ 1 0 random coil ρ 0 78 homogeneous non draining sphere and ρ 0 5 microgels qilin et al 2013 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020b as shown in fig 4 the initial shape of the eps on 1 h was a dense globule which was identified by a ρ value of 0 81 which is close to 0 78 an obvious change in the ρ value occurred at 6 h increasing from 0 81 to 1 1 spatial shape from dense globule to microgels indicating that a large number of biopolymer reactions occurred in the initial 6 h consistent with sludge carbon source hydrolyzation this result suggests that spatial extension of the biopolymer chains was significantly accelerated by fna according to previous literature this is conductive to biodegradation in which the degradation of random coil shaped biopolymers during the fermentation process was reportedly 32 higher than that of dense globules tang et al 2020 after 6 h eps spatial shape transformed from random coils to dense globules again with ρ values decreasing from 1 1 to 0 4 fig 4 a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon is that fna biocidal effect destroyed the interfacial forces that maintain the dense globule shape of the eps resulting in transformation of the eps from dense globules to random coils the biopolymer extended chains were subsequently degraded as fermentation progressed and then utilized in situ via denitrification leading to dense eps spatial shapes again and even to microgels due to the change of interfacial force 3 3 properties of tertiary nitrogen removal performance in the epd system in order to further treat fermentation metabolites nh4 n 119 2 mg l contained in the ifd sbr effluent the epd sbr was employed for tertiary nitrogen removal during the whole operation period the epd sbr was manually divided into 4 phases according to their strategies table 1 with an average influent nh4 n of 119 2 mg l nox n of 5 2 mg l and vfas of 356 8 mg cod l fig 5 a in phase i desirable nitrification was obtained with an ammonia oxidizing rate aor of 0 55 kg m3d fig 5b and nh4 n concentration of 2 6 mg l at the end of the aerobic stage fig 5a but anaerobic intracellular carbon storage and anoxic epd did not proceed well with an average e vfaintra of 9 4 fig 5c and effluent concentrations of 1 7 mg l nh4 n 0 3 mg l no2 n and 71 8 mg l no3 n and a tn removal efficiency of 35 2 fig 5d according to the poor intracellular carbon storage and nitrogen removal performance during phase i the extended anaerobic stage was employed in phase ii to strength the influent carbon source storage and provides sufficient electronic donors for snd and epd at the following aerobic and anoxic stages table 1 thereafter the vfa amount stored as intracellular carbon source increased from 9 4 on day 19 to 47 8 on day 36 fig 5c effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations gradually decreased to 2 8 0 5 and 49 5 mg l respectively followed by a 58 6 increase of the tn removal efficiency fig 5d as shown in fig 5d pre denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in the epd sbr after extending the pre anaerobic stage achieving a 41 1 nitrogen removal contribution moreover an average of 11 1 nitrogen was removed during the aerobic stage which indicates obvious simultaneous snd performance an average of 1 mg l no3 n was removed corresponding to 3 4 mg l pha consumed by the stoichiometric model calculation using 0 25 in mmoln mmolc nara pha values for dgaos during the aerobic stage wang et al 2016b in reality pha reduction was over 6 4 mg l for per no3 n removal during the aerobic stage detailed information provided by following text which was far greater than the theoretical value indicating excess intracellular was consumed by heterotrophic microorganisms without contributing to denitrification during the aerobic stage under high do concentrations 3 0 4 5 mg l table 1 conversely nh4 n was oxidized to no3 n by a combination of aob and nob during the aerobic stage in which endogenous denitrification for complete nitrate reduction consumed 1 6 times the phas of that in the nitrite pathway aggravating the carbon source consumption burden for post denitrification during the following anoxic stage to achieve partial nitrification and avoid unnecessary waste of excess carbons source during the aerobic stage combined strategies of real time control a low do concentration 0 5 mg l and a short srt 8 d were applied in phase iii 71 140 days as shown in fig 5a the nar was increased from 0 9 day 71 to 89 6 day 119 with average nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations of 2 4 43 6 and 1 3 mg l respectively at the end of the aerobic stage this result indicates that nob were gradually washed out by increasing the sludge discharge during the aerobic stage nh4 n was oxidized to no2 n and partially removed in situ with vfas or phas serving as electronic donors partial nitrification maintenance provided guaranteed energy saving for the epd system moreover due to the oxygen gradient in the flocculent sludge microenvironment under low do carbon source consumption by heterotrophic organisms was significantly reduced during the aeration stage allowing the snd to reach 29 6 fig 5d moreover the reduction amount of no2 n and no3 n increased to 42 8 and 3 4 mg l respectively during the anoxic stage corresponding to a 58 3 tn removal efficiency contributed by the epd extracellular carbon source utilization was strongly related to the nitrogen removal performance and the e vfaintra increased to 84 4 during the pre anaerobic stage fig 5c the vfa concentration at the end of the anaerobic stage was close to that of the effluent which indicates that the dominant carbon source from fermentation was synthesized as intracellular carbon guaranteeing sufficient electron donors for the subsequent anoxic stage the improved nitrogen removal performance was greatly aided by the full utilization of intracellular polymers and the stable maintenance of partial nitrification in which endogenous denitrification via nitrite only consumed 59 7 of the phas relative to the nitrate pathway with the nob washed out from system by increasing sludge discharge the low abundance of aob could not easily support the efficient operation of partial nitrification during the aerobic stage with the aor decreasing from 0 51 day 63 to 0 30 kg m3d day 105 fig 5b along with partial nitrification stabilization the reaction rate decreased as the aerobic stage duration increased by 150 3 4 5 h during phase iv the prerequisite was to enrich aob and further strengthen the nitrogen removal efficiency in the previous partial nitrification system the sludge concentration was elevated from 2168 9 to 3274 5 mg l by extending the srt and the corresponding aor increased from 0 23 to 0 41 kg m3d wu et al 2016 consequently the srt returned to 12 days in the epd sbr as a result the nar 94 3 and snd 34 5 during the aerobic stage were similar to that of phase iii stabilizing at 95 1 and 29 6 respectively and the aerobic stage duration was shortened from 4 5 h to 3 h table 1 effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 1 86 0 8 and 4 7 mg l respectively fig 5b and the corresponding nitrogen removal efficiency of snd and epd contributed up to 34 4 and 57 9 respectively fig 5d 3 4 mechanism confirmation of epd sbr stability 3 4 1 nutrient variation in a typical epd sbr operational cycle during different phases the nutrient transformation mechanism of the epd system was explored by analyzing typical operation cycles in phases ii day 68 fig 6 a and c and iv day 115 fig 6b and d the carbon source rich ifd sbr effluent vfa 356 8 mg cod l was continuously fed to the epd sbr for the initial 5 min during the anaerobic stage easily degradable carbon source from fermentation was metabolized to intracellular phas the pha concentrations reached peaked 2 8 mmolc l day 68 8 2 mmolc l day 115 within the 2 h of anaerobic stage with concomitant gly consumption fig 6c and d indicating that the carbon sources generated from fermentation in the ifd sbr were stored as intracellular carbon the ratios of gly pha 0 58 0 63 mmolc mmolc table 3 were similar to that of the gaos and dgaos gly pha of 0 62 0 65 mmolc mmolc reported by yuan et al 2020b zeng et al 2010a 2010b indicating that exogenous carbon source storage was driven by the gao metabolism pathway paos and gaos always coexist in enhanced biological phosphorus removal systems as suggested by li et al 2014 a small portion of phosphorus p c 0 01 is contained in raw mature landfill leachate which is conductive for gaos to outcompete and displace paos subsequently 80 of the extracellular carbon source was stored as phas by gaos under the low phosphorous carbon ratio of 0 1 additionally the concentration of nh4 n was stable during the anaerobic stage and the nox n decreased by 24 0 mg l and 4 4 mg l on days 68 day and 115 respectively the low carbon source demand for denitrification during phase iv led to a higher e vfaintra efficiency 86 2 relative to that of phase ii 44 5 during the aerobic stage an average of 53 6 mg l nh4 n was oxidized while interestingly only 37 2 mg l no2 n accumulated by the end of the aeration stage on day 115 with nar of 89 5 and snd of 27 2 fig 6b indeed poor partial nitrification was a widespread issue in the epd system due to the nob co existing with and outcompeting the aob the bottleneck problem of nob over proliferation was solved by the real time control strategy in which aeration was stopped immediately once the ammonia valley emerged fig 6b the discrepancy between decreased nh4 n and oxidized nox n was driven by the obvious simultaneous nitrification denitrification the snd demand for electronic donors was mainly contributed by the residual carbon source since vfas decreased obviously from 56 4 to 2 7 mg l during phase iv fig 6d most of the intracellular phas and gly avoided consumption by heterotrophic organisms during the aerobic stage with phas only decreasing from 8 2 to 7 8 mmolc l and gly only increasing from 6 2 to 6 7 mmol l the effect of snd also benefited from the do gradient in the flocculent sludge microenvironment under the low do concentration in which the snd efficiency increased by 17 6 from phases ii to iv fig 5d during the anoxic stage nox n exhibited an obvious decrease 5 8 mg l in phase ii 35 5 mg l in phase iv which was driven by pha degradation since almost no vfas were left after the aerobic stage fig 6a and b in phase iv nh4 n was almost oxidized to no2 n during the aerobic stage by real time control parameters in which endogenous denitrification for complete nitrite reduction consumed 57 of the phas relative to the nitrate pathway resulting in a desirable nitrogen removal performance moreover the reaction rate of endogenous denitrification 0 14 kg m3d during phase iv was much higher than that in phase ii 0 02 kg m3d during the anoxic stage in phase iv the nira pha ratio 0 44 mmoln mmolc and nira gly ratio 0 75 mmoln mmolc table 3 were similar to the dgaoni stoichiometry 0 28 0 54 mmoln mmolc and 0 27 0 32 mmoln mmolc respectively reported by previous literatures wang et al 2016a 2016b internal carbon source storage in dgaos drives the endogenous denitrification process during the subsequent anoxic stage compared with conventional nitrification denitrification the epd sbr could achieve advanced nitrogen removal by full utilization of the carbon sources in the influent 3 4 2 stoichiometry based evaluations of functional group contributions to carbon and nitrogen removal in order to better understand the competition and cooperation among gao dgaona dgaona ni dgaoni in the epd sbr the stoichiometry of intracellular carbon and nutrient transformation was explored via ex situ tests throughout the whole operational period variation in the intracellular pha generation over time from phases i to iv are shown in fig 7 a the maximal pha production appeared at approximately 2 h with concentrations varying between 7 3 and 7 8 mmolc l at the end of the 3 h anaerobic stage fig 7a this was consistent with the long term performance in parent reactor meaning that without considering carbon source consumption via denitrification during the anaerobic stage the storage efficiency of the internal carbon source in each phase was similar to each other this phenomenon could also be explained by previous approximations of pha codintra stoichiometry for paos 1 46 mmolc mmolc gaos 1

pphadgaoni pphagao and pphaothers are the percentage of pha synthesis contributed by dgaona dgaoni gao and other microorganisms respectively after completion of extracellular carbon source storage during the anaerobic stage the sludge was equally divided into 3 reactors reactor 2 4 fig 7b d for step ii with initial concentrations of no3 n of 40 mg l fig 7b no2 n of 40 mg l fig 7c and no nox n fig 7d in phase i 37 6 mg l no3 n was reduced to n2 via the endogenous denitrification process with a pha of 5 1 mmolc l and only 1 2 mg l nitrite accumulating fig 7b additionally nitrite gradually decreased from 40 mg l to 6 2 mg l followed by a pha of 4 9 mmolc l fig 7c the decreased pha performance was also observed in reactor 4 with the pha maintained at 1 1 mmolc l over 6 h fig 7d these results indicate that dgaona dgaoni and gao participated in extracellular carbon source transformation to intracellular phas dgaona dgaoni and gao proportions related to pha generation via external carbons source storage were calculated in eq 5 via stoichiometric models using 0 25 and 0 54 in mmoln mmolc nxra pha values for dgaona and dgaoni respectively therefore the gao dgaoni and dgaona contribution to the pha composition of phase i account for 14 6 18 7 and 66 7 respectively specifically the endogenous nitrite reduction rate increased from 0 08 to 0 11 kg m3 d from phase i to phase iv fig 7c with an average initial pha concentration of 7 5 mmolc l whilst over the same time the nitrate reduction rate decreased from 0 12 to 0 07 kg m3d fig 7b moreover with partial nitrification achieved in the parent reactor from phases i to iv dgaona were gradually eliminated and dgaoni were strengthened as calculated by eq 5 the pphadgaoni for phase iv 73 8 was almost four times of that for phase i thereby demonstrating that the dominant functional microorganisms gradually transformed from dgaona to dgaoni clearly the nitrogen reduction rate experienced a significant improvement under the same pha consumption which indicates that achieving partial nitrification under the combined strategy not only promotes the nitrogen reduction rate but also improves the pha utilization efficiency 3 5 microbial synergy and transformation in the epd system along with biomass activity variation and nitrogen removal performance functional groups in the epd system exhibited a relatively stable structure at the phylum level the dominant bacterial populations of phase i were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria and ignavibacteriae accounting for 48 1 18 3 7 5 5 3 and 3 4 of the total bacteria respectively fig 8 a after the 200 day operation proteobacteria remained the highest in abundance 63 5 while bacteroidetes actinobacteria and parcubacteria decreased slightly most the shared otus of bacterial communities in phase i ii and iv consisted of proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria supplementary fig s3 at the genus level nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus responsible for ammonia oxidation to nitrite were highly detected in phase iv with relative abundances of 2 1 and 0 18 respectively fig 8b moreover the abundance of typical nob nitrospira nitrobacter and nitrolacea were decreased gradually avoiding further nitrite oxidation to nitrate defluviicoccus and candidatus competibacter were considered as the dominant contributor for epd process reducing nox n to n2 mcilroy et al 2014 rubio rincón et al 2017 yuan et al 2020a zeng et al 2010a increasing from 0 1 and 1 2 respectively in phase i to 0 9 and 5 8 respectively in phase iv suppplementary table s3 it was further certificated by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish that the relative abundance of gaos accounted for 17 2 fig 8c and d in comparison thauera comamonadaceae thermomonas and denitratisoma which are capable of heterotrophic denitrification yuan et al 2020b decreased to a certain degree both defluviicoccus and candidatus competibacter capable of endogenous denitrification of no3 n were detected with increasing abundance on the contrary endogenous denitrification activity for dgaona no3 n n2 decreased from 0 15 kg m3 d phase i to 0 1 kg m3d phase iv as demonstrated by ex situ batch tests fig 7b moreover endogenous denitrification accounted for 57 9 of the nitrogen removal in the epd sbr system while only two functional dgao related genera were detected overall such a dominant role in endogenous no3 n and no2 n removal with specific dgao genus raising a brighten investigation in environmental molecular biology which requires further efforts to identify new genera with endogenous denitrification capabilities 3 6 engineering implications and environmental sustainability of pn f double dn this paper describes novel application of fermentation based system that features energy recovery and a driving force while simultaneously treating mature landfill leachate and was for 200 days taking the whole pn f double dn process into consideration nh4 n 1766 6 mg l in the mature landfill leachate was oxidized to no2 n 1529 8 mg l in the pn sbr with a nar of 96 5 compared with the required 4 57 g of o2 to oxidize 1 g of nh4 n during traditional nitrification nh4 n no3 n only 2 74 g of o2 was consumed in the partial nitrification process effluent of the pn sbr no2 n 1529 8 mg l coupled with concentrated was mlss 20 6 g l were simultaneously injected into the ifd sbr for integrated fermentation denitrification the sludge structure was dismantled by fna biotoxicity inhibition allowing the carbon source within the sludge to be utilized in situ by denitrification the no2 n concentration decreased from 640 4 mg l to 2 2 mg l in 10 7 h followed by an mlss reduction rate of 3 3 kg m3d additionally excess carbon source vfas 356 8 mg l in the ifd sbr effluent generated during fermentation subsequently served as electronic donors for removal of unwanted fermentation metabolites 119 2 mg l nh4 n in the epd sbr carbon sources from fermentation were first transformed into phas and gly in the pre anaerobic stage with an e vfaintra of 83 1 after nh4 n oxidation during the aerobic stage the intracellular carbon source served as an electronic donor for epd in the post anoxic phase with a nitrogen reduction efficiency of 93 7 overall the pn f double dn process achieved a total nre of 98 5 and a sre of 46 2 after the 200 day operation with influent nh4 n tn and cod concentrations of 1766 6 1992 3 and 2112 9 mg l respectively this fermentation based system represents an opportunity for accessible and stable double de thereby accelerating economic benefits and environmentally sustainable engineering implementation of mature landfill leachate treatment 4 conclusions pn f double dn process was developed to realize advanced nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate by was resource utilization with nre of 98 5 and sre of 41 6 respectively dgaos 0 9 defluviicoccus and 5 8 candidatus competibacter were responsible for the stability of carbon source storage and nitrogen removal in the epd sbr system with e vfaintra of 83 1 and a nitrogen removal contribution of 93 7 compared with

16723,introducing fermentation technology into sewage treatment is a sustainable development concept but future application still faces many challenges a novel partial nitrification fermentation based double denitrification bioprocess pn f double dn was achieved in three separated sbr type reactors simultaneously treating high ammonia 1766 6 mg l mature landfill leachate and external waste activated sludge was mlss 20 6 g l firstly nh4 n was oxidized to no2 n in partial nitrification reactor pn sbr with nitrite accumulation ratio nar of 96 5 next the pn sbr effluent no2 n 1529 8 mg l coupled with the was were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation denitrification ifd sbr the occurrence of fermentation was mainly attributed to free nitrous acid fna nitrite protonate form promoting the splitting decomposition of sludge spatial configuration and interfacial forces the released volatile fatty acids vfas were utilized in situ during the denitrification process no2 n n2 obtaining 0 6 kg m3 d nitrogen removal rate and 3 3 kg m3 d sludge reduction rate finally undesirable fermentation by products from ifd sbr nh4 n 119 2 mg l were further removed in the endogenous post denitrification reactor epd sbr through operational strategy of anaerobic aerobic anoxic by residual vfas as the carbon source in the epd sbr defluviicoccus 0 9 and candidatus competibacter 5 8 dominated carbon source storage and nitrogen removal acting as a typical denitrifying glycogen accumulating organism dgao with an intracellular carbon storage efficiency of 83 1 and nitrogen removal contribution of 93 7 after 200 days of operation the pn f double dn process provided effluent containing on average 1 86 mg l nh4 n and 5 5 mg l nox n with 98 5 tn removal compared with traditional bioprocesses pn f double dn allowed up to 25 saving in aeration energy consumption 100 decrease in carbon source demand and achieve 46 1 external was reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mature landfill leachate was fermentation intracellular carbon storage endogenous denitrification 1 introduction landfill leachate contains numerous imperishable inorganic and organic pollutants including salts heavy metals nh4 n and acids which significantly threaten the natural environment and human health the composition of landfill leachate varies according to landfill age with the chemical oxygen demand cod decreasing over time from 5000 23 000 mg l in early age landfill leachate to 1600 2100 mg l in mature landfill leachate harrad et al 2019 the early or medium age landfill leachate c n ratio 1 8 was previously treated by combined process of partial nitrification anammox and denitrification azari et al 2017a 2017b however the mature landfill leachate is difficult to be realize efficient nitrogen removal through biological process due to the characteristics of a high nh4 n load 1300 mg l and an extremely low c n ratio 1 1 8 zhang et al 2020a waste activated sludge was as wastewater treatment by product is also a widespread problem causing extensive environmental pollution a large amount of excess sludge is unavoidable produced in sewage treatment plants fang et al 2020 huang et al 2016 xu et al 2020b by the end of 2019 excess was 80 moisture content production reached 60 million tons year in china xu et al 2020b and the related treatment cost accounts for over 60 of the waste water treatment plant wwtp operation cost volatile fatty acid vfa production a promising technology in sludge resource recovery and stabilization has attracted growing attention for was treatment as a raw substrate vfas can be treated as raw substrate for bioenergy generation wang et al 2018 biodegradable plastic production lee et al 2014 and organic matter for nutrient removing microorganisms fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 significantly mature landfill leachate treatment needs carbon sources while vfas is potentially produced during was fermentation thus advanced nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate becomes possible through combination with sludge fermentation according to current literature physical treatments microwave thermal ultrasonic etc neumann et al 2017 yu et al 2010 chemical treatments ozone surfactant alkali free acid free nitrous acid huang et al 2015 lu et al 2020 and enzyme biological treatments fang et al 2020 yang et al 2010 could effectively improve the sludge fermentation performance although various techniques could enhance vfa generation from was fermentation it is currently unknown how to achieve acceptable interaction between sludge reduction and sewage treatment and subsequent removal of fermentation metabolites nitrogen and phosphorus due to the special physical or chemical environment required by fermentation the was disposal line is usually independent of the wastewater treatment process in actual wwtps therefore how to realize the combination of wastewater and was treatment in one single biological system is an urgent problem to be solved for the first time a novel partial nitrification fermentation based double denitrification bioprocess pn f double dn was used to simultaneously realize advanced nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate and external was fermentation mature landfill leachate was firstly introduced to an aerobic reactor for partial nitrification pn sbr next pn sbr effluent and concentration external was were pumped into an anoxic reactor to undergo integrated fermentation denitrification ifd sbr in our previous study the natural structure of sludge was found to be dismantled by fna biotoxicity inhibition zhang et al 2020b 2019b which further promotes the release of organic carbon source the discovery of this new mechanism provides an innovative approach for the collaborative treatment of wastewater and was finally the nh4 n released during the fermentation process was removed in the endogenous post denitrification reactor epd sbr through an anaerobic aerobic anoxic operation strategy in the epd sbr the carbon source generated from fermentation was assimilated by glycogen accumulating organisms and then transformed into polyhydroxyalkanoates phas inside the cell during the pre anaerobic stage that is the carbon source served as an electronic donor for the denitrification process during the post anoxic stage and avoided being consumed during the aerobic stage the objective of this study was to investigate the mature landfill leachate treatment performance of pn f double dn additionally the potential fermentation mechanism was explored from the perspective of sludge and extracellular polymeric substances eps physical structure transformation besides high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to identify the microbial structure of the epd system finally the environmental sustainability aeration energy consumption external carbon source demand and biomass production and engineering application potential nitrogen removal capacity and was reduction performance were evaluated to the best of our knowledge pn f double dn is the first attempt to achieve simultaneous treatment of mature landfill leachate and was 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation the pn f double dn process was operated for 200 days using three separated sbr type reactors fig 1 a the pn sbr 10 0 l working volume was fed with high nh4 n load mature landfill leachate 5 0 l nh4 n 1766 6 mg l by a peristaltic pump with a volume exchange ratio ver of 50 the pn sbr facilitated partial nitrification to produce no2 n and the duration was accurately controlled by real time parameters in which aeration was stopped immediately once the ammonia valley emerged on the ph profile supplementary fig s1 zhang et al 2017 the pn effluent was stored in a middle tank next concentrated external was 1 5 l mlss 20 6 g l coupled with half of

anaerobic aerobic anoxic operational strategy was applied in the epd sbr with a pre anaerobic duration of 0 5 h and 2 3 mg l do at aerobic stage during phase ii the pre anaerobic stage duration was prolonged to 2 h to strengthen intracellular carbon storage to achieve partial nitrification and avoid unnecessary waste of excess carbons source during the aerobic stage combined strategies of real time control low do concentration below 0 5 mg l and short sludge retention time srt 8 d were applied during phase iii after partial nitrification maintenance the srt was extended to 12 d to further enhance the reaction rate by enriching absolute ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 2 2 seeding biomass and wastewater all of the seeding biomass and concentrated was table s1 were collected from a

landfill leachate during the whole operation period pn sbr was continuously operated for 200 days at stable volume exchange ratio of 50 the ammonia transformation ratio atr reached to 98 4 with influent and effluent nh4 n concentrations of 1766 6 and 25 4 mg l respectively fig 2 a the average effluent nitrite concentration ranged between 1418 5 and 1696 4 mg l with a nitrite accumulation ratio nar of 96 5 fig 2b indicating a typical partial nitrification performance notably proliferation of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob always accompanied aob enrichment in which produced nitrite was further oxidized to nitrate by the nob kent et al 2019 wang et al 2020a 2016 in fact a desirable partial nitrification performance was mainly determined by the effective inhibition of nob high concentrations of free acid fa and real time control of ph were two main factors for stable partial nitrification because different fa inhibition thresholds exist for aob and nob wang et al 2020a 2020b concluded that the optimal fa for the maintenance of partial nitrification is between 16 4 and 32 1 mg l fig 2a during the initial operation 36 3 mg l fa was obtained after injection of the high nh4 n load mature landfill leachate real time ph parameter was also installed to accurately control the aeration duration and avoids further oxidation of no2 n to no3 n by nob supplementary fig s1 overall an average nar of 96 5 was obtained under the influent nh4 n tn and cod concentrations of 1766 6 1992 3 and 2112 9 mg l respectively 3 2 overview of was reduction and nitrogen removal capacity

ifd sbr for integrated fermentation denitrification as the protonated form of no2 n free nitrous acid fna could dismantle the natural structure of the sludge via biotoxicity inhibition and effectively promote the fermentation performance for example previous studies have demonstrated that the was fermentative efficiency can be enhanced by 15 21 after pretreated with 0 2 mg l fna for 3 h duan et al 2020 while zhang emphasized that cell decay rate increased from 0 044 to 0 102 d with fna concentrations of 0 197 1 97 mg l which were significantly higher than that of the control group cell decay rate 0 012 d fna 0 mg l zhang et al 2020b during the long term operation the mlss concentration decreased from 20 603 1 to 11 093 2 mg l under initial fna of 0 31 mg l fig 3 a which corresponded to a 3 3 kg m3 d sludge reduction rate srr fig 3c organic matter in was that is released during the fermentation process subsequently serves as preferred organic matter for microorganisms replenishing deficient electronic donors for the denitrification process no2 n n2 in a typical ifd sbr cycle supplementary fig s2 the no2 n concentration decreased from 640 4 to 2 2 mg l over 10 7 h with a nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 6 kg m3d unlike the change in nitrite over time the vfas were first constant 0 10 5 h and then increased 10 5 h during the combined process which indicates that the carbon source consumption rate by denitrification was higher over the first 10 5 h than the fermentation rate and that vfas accumulated after complete denitrification as a result an average 356 8 mg cod l vfa was found in the ifd sbr effluent fig 3b fermentation and nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate were simultaneously achieved in the ifd sbr with a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 92 0 a sludge reduction efficiency sre of 46 1 and an effluent nox n concentration of 3 8 mg l fig 3 however as an undesirable fermentation metabolite 119 2 mg l of released nh4 n should be further treated to meet strict wastewater discharge standards 3 2 2 potential fermentation mechanism sludge and eps physical structure to reveal the manner in which fermentation is accelerated by fna sludge fractal dimension df and eps spatial configuration changes were explored during a typical ifd sbr cycle df is considered as important index to ascertain the sludge physical structure xu et al 2020a a higher df value usually reflects sludge with a compact physical structure small interior pores and low molecular mobility conversely a lower df value usually reflects sludge with a looser physical structure and greater organic molecular mobility wu et al 2020 the df value of different sludge samples ranged from 2 25 to 2 32 during the integrated fermentation denitrification process consistent with previous findings demonstrating rough surface irregular particles df values always changed between 2 0 to 3 0 wu et al 2002 the value of df decreased continuously with extension of reaction time which suggests that the physical structure of initial sludge was most compact and subsequently disintegrated due to fna fig 4 in our previous study the natural structure of the sludge was dismantled by fna biotoxicity inhibition zhang et al 2020b it is reasonable to assume that solubilization and hydrolysis of organics in the was were enhanced by disintegration of the sludge physical structure one interesting phenomenon was that df fluctuation during the initial 4 h was much higher than that in last 12 h which suggests that drastic physical structure changes occurred during the initial 4 h fig 4 this may be due to a series of substantial changes in the sludge structural stability which was formerly referred to as physical structure and latter referred to as thermodynamics of solid liquid interfaces xu et al 2020b eps is well acknowledged as the sludge backbone creating the sludge three dimensional matrix by bridging bacterial cells thus the sludge structural stability can also be responsible by the eps spatial configuration kazakov et al 2002 as indicators of biopolymer shape properties the z average root mean square radius of gyration rg and hydrodynamic radius rh are typically used to characterize the eps spatial configuration mahata et al 2021 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2020c notably biopolymer chain conformation and architecture are directly indicated by the parameter of ρ rg rh various eps spatial shapes can be identified by the ρ value ρ 2 0 rigid rod 2 0 ρ 1 0 random coil ρ 0 78 homogeneous non draining sphere and ρ 0 5 microgels qilin et al 2013 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020b as shown in fig 4 the initial shape of the eps on 1 h was a dense globule which was identified by a ρ value of 0 81 which is close to 0 78 an obvious change in the ρ value occurred at 6 h increasing from 0 81 to 1 1 spatial shape from dense globule to microgels indicating that a large number of biopolymer reactions occurred in the initial 6 h consistent with sludge carbon source hydrolyzation this result suggests that spatial extension of the biopolymer chains was significantly accelerated by fna according to previous literature this is conductive to biodegradation in which the degradation of random coil shaped biopolymers during the fermentation process was reportedly 32 higher than that of dense globules tang et al 2020 after 6 h eps spatial shape transformed from random coils to dense globules again with ρ values decreasing from 1 1 to 0 4 fig 4 a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon is that fna biocidal effect destroyed the interfacial forces that maintain the dense globule shape of the eps resulting in transformation of the eps from dense globules to random coils the biopolymer extended chains were subsequently degraded as fermentation progressed and then utilized in situ via denitrification leading to dense eps spatial shapes again and even to microgels due to the change of interfacial force 3 3 properties of tertiary nitrogen removal performance in the epd system in order to further treat fermentation metabolites nh4 n 119 2 mg l contained in the ifd sbr effluent the epd sbr was employed for tertiary nitrogen removal during the whole operation period the epd sbr was manually divided into 4 phases according to their strategies table 1 with an average influent nh4 n of 119 2 mg l nox n of 5 2 mg l and vfas of 356 8 mg cod l fig 5 a in phase i desirable nitrification was obtained with an ammonia oxidizing rate aor of 0 55 kg m3d fig 5b and nh4 n concentration of 2 6 mg l at the end of the aerobic stage fig 5a but anaerobic intracellular carbon storage and anoxic epd did not proceed well with an average e vfaintra of 9 4 fig 5c and effluent concentrations of 1 7 mg l nh4 n 0 3 mg l no2 n and 71 8 mg l no3 n and a tn removal efficiency of 35 2 fig 5d according to the poor intracellular carbon storage and nitrogen removal performance during phase i the extended anaerobic stage was employed in phase ii to strength the influent carbon source storage and provides sufficient electronic donors for snd and epd at the following aerobic and anoxic stages table 1 thereafter the vfa amount stored as intracellular carbon source increased from 9 4 on day 19 to 47 8 on day 36 fig 5c effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations gradually decreased to 2 8 0 5 and 49 5 mg l respectively followed by a 58 6 increase of the tn removal efficiency fig 5d as shown in fig 5d pre denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in the epd sbr after extending the pre anaerobic stage achieving a 41 1 nitrogen removal contribution moreover an average of 11 1 nitrogen was removed during the aerobic stage which indicates obvious simultaneous snd performance an average of 1 mg l no3 n was removed corresponding to 3 4 mg l pha consumed by the stoichiometric model calculation using 0 25 in mmoln mmolc nara pha values for dgaos during the aerobic stage wang et al 2016b in reality pha reduction was over 6 4 mg l for per no3 n removal during the aerobic stage detailed information provided by following text which was far greater than the theoretical value indicating excess intracellular was consumed by heterotrophic microorganisms without contributing to denitrification during the aerobic stage under high do concentrations 3 0 4 5 mg l table 1 conversely nh4 n was oxidized to no3 n by a combination of aob and nob during the aerobic stage in which endogenous denitrification for complete nitrate reduction consumed 1 6 times the phas of that in the nitrite pathway aggravating the carbon source consumption burden for post denitrification during the following anoxic stage to achieve partial nitrification and avoid unnecessary waste of excess carbons source during the aerobic stage combined strategies of real time control a low do concentration 0 5 mg l and a short srt 8 d were applied in phase iii 71 140 days as shown in fig 5a the nar was increased from 0 9 day 71 to 89 6 day 119 with average nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations of 2 4 43 6 and 1 3 mg l respectively at the end of the aerobic stage this result indicates that nob were gradually washed out by increasing the sludge discharge during the aerobic stage nh4 n was oxidized to no2 n and partially removed in situ with vfas or phas serving as electronic donors partial nitrification maintenance provided guaranteed energy saving for the epd system moreover due to the oxygen gradient in the flocculent sludge microenvironment under low do carbon source consumption by heterotrophic organisms was significantly reduced during the aeration stage allowing the snd to reach 29 6 fig 5d moreover the reduction amount of no2 n and no3 n increased to 42 8 and 3 4 mg l respectively during the anoxic stage corresponding to a 58 3 tn removal efficiency contributed by the epd extracellular carbon source utilization was strongly related to the nitrogen removal performance and the e vfaintra increased to 84 4 during the pre anaerobic stage fig 5c the vfa concentration at the end of the anaerobic stage was close to that of the effluent which indicates that the dominant carbon source from fermentation was synthesized as intracellular carbon guaranteeing sufficient electron donors for the subsequent anoxic stage the improved nitrogen removal performance was greatly aided by the full utilization of intracellular polymers and the stable maintenance of partial nitrification in which endogenous denitrification via nitrite only consumed 59 7 of the phas relative to the nitrate pathway with the nob washed out from system by increasing sludge discharge the low abundance of aob could not easily support the efficient operation of partial nitrification during the aerobic stage with the aor decreasing from 0 51 day 63 to 0 30 kg m3d day 105 fig 5b along with partial nitrification stabilization the reaction rate decreased as the aerobic stage duration increased by 150 3 4 5 h during phase iv the prerequisite was to enrich aob and further strengthen the nitrogen removal efficiency in the previous partial nitrification system the sludge concentration was elevated from 2168 9 to 3274 5 mg l by extending the srt and the corresponding aor increased from 0 23 to 0 41 kg m3d wu et al 2016 consequently the srt returned to 12 days in the epd sbr as a result the nar 94 3 and snd 34 5 during the aerobic stage were similar to that of phase iii stabilizing at 95 1 and 29 6 respectively and the aerobic stage duration was shortened from 4 5 h to 3 h table 1 effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 1 86 0 8 and 4 7 mg l respectively fig 5b and the corresponding nitrogen removal efficiency of snd and epd contributed up to 34 4 and 57 9 respectively fig 5d 3 4 mechanism confirmation of epd sbr stability 3 4 1 nutrient variation in a typical epd sbr operational cycle during different phases the nutrient transformation mechanism of the epd system was explored by analyzing typical operation cycles in phases ii day 68 fig 6 a and c and iv day 115 fig 6b and d the carbon source rich ifd sbr effluent vfa 356 8 mg cod l was continuously fed to the epd sbr for the initial 5 min during the anaerobic stage easily degradable carbon source from fermentation was metabolized to intracellular phas the pha concentrations reached peaked 2 8 mmolc l day 68 8 2 mmolc l day 115 within the 2 h of anaerobic stage with concomitant gly consumption fig 6c and d indicating that the carbon sources generated from fermentation in the ifd sbr were stored as intracellular carbon the ratios of gly pha 0 58 0 63 mmolc mmolc table 3 were similar to that of the gaos and dgaos gly pha of 0 62 0 65 mmolc mmolc reported by yuan et al 2020b zeng et al 2010a 2010b indicating that exogenous carbon source storage was driven by the gao metabolism pathway paos and gaos always coexist in enhanced biological phosphorus removal systems as suggested by li et al 2014 a small portion of phosphorus p c 0 01 is contained in raw mature landfill leachate which is conductive for gaos to outcompete and displace paos subsequently 80 of the extracellular carbon source was stored as phas by gaos under the low phosphorous carbon ratio of 0 1 additionally the concentration of nh4 n was stable during the anaerobic stage and the nox n decreased by 24 0 mg l and 4 4 mg l on days 68 day and 115 respectively the low carbon source demand for denitrification during phase iv led to a higher e vfaintra efficiency 86 2 relative to that of phase ii 44 5 during the aerobic stage an average of 53 6 mg l nh4 n was oxidized while interestingly only 37 2 mg l no2 n accumulated by the end of the aeration stage on day 115 with nar of 89 5 and snd of 27 2 fig 6b indeed poor partial nitrification was a widespread issue in the epd system due to the nob co existing with and outcompeting the aob the bottleneck problem of nob over proliferation was solved by the real time control strategy in which aeration was stopped immediately once the ammonia valley emerged fig 6b the discrepancy between decreased nh4 n and oxidized nox n was driven by the obvious simultaneous nitrification denitrification the snd demand for electronic donors was mainly contributed by the residual carbon source since vfas decreased obviously from 56 4 to 2 7 mg l during phase iv fig 6d most of the intracellular phas and gly avoided consumption by heterotrophic organisms during the aerobic stage with phas only decreasing from 8 2 to 7 8 mmolc l and gly only increasing from 6 2 to 6 7 mmol l the effect of snd also benefited from the do gradient in the flocculent sludge microenvironment under the low do concentration in which the snd efficiency increased by 17 6 from phases ii to iv fig 5d during the anoxic stage nox n exhibited an obvious decrease 5 8 mg l in phase ii 35 5 mg l in phase iv which was driven by pha degradation since almost no vfas were left after the aerobic stage fig 6a and b in phase iv nh4 n was almost oxidized to no2 n during the aerobic stage by real time control parameters in which endogenous denitrification for complete nitrite reduction consumed 57 of the phas relative to the nitrate pathway resulting in a desirable nitrogen removal performance moreover the reaction rate of endogenous denitrification 0 14 kg m3d during phase iv was much higher than that in phase ii 0 02 kg m3d during the anoxic stage in phase iv the nira pha ratio 0 44 mmoln mmolc and nira gly ratio 0 75 mmoln mmolc table 3 were similar to the dgaoni stoichiometry 0 28 0 54 mmoln mmolc and 0 27 0 32 mmoln mmolc respectively reported by previous literatures wang et al 2016a 2016b internal carbon source storage in dgaos drives the endogenous denitrification process during the subsequent anoxic stage compared with conventional nitrification denitrification the epd sbr could achieve advanced nitrogen removal by full utilization of the carbon sources in the influent 3 4 2 stoichiometry based evaluations of functional group contributions to carbon and nitrogen removal in order to better understand the competition and cooperation among gao dgaona dgaona ni dgaoni in the epd sbr the stoichiometry of intracellular carbon and nutrient transformation was explored via ex situ tests throughout the whole operational period variation in the intracellular pha generation over time from phases i to iv are shown in fig 7 a the maximal pha production appeared at approximately 2 h with concentrations varying between 7 3 and 7 8 mmolc l at the end of the 3 h anaerobic stage fig 7a this was consistent with the long term performance in parent reactor meaning that without considering carbon source consumption via denitrification during the anaerobic stage the storage efficiency of the internal carbon source in each phase was similar to each other this phenomenon could also be explained by previous approximations of pha codintra stoichiometry for paos 1 46 mmolc mmolc gaos 1 85 mmolc mmolc and dgaos 1 91 mmolc mmolc 5 0 25 δ n o 3 n δ p h a d g a o n a 0 54 δ n o 2 n δ p h a d g a o n i 0 2 δ p h a g a o δ p h a d g a o n a δ p h a a n a e r o b i c 100 p p h a d g a o n

pphadgaoni pphagao and pphaothers are the percentage of pha synthesis contributed by dgaona dgaoni gao and other microorganisms respectively after completion of extracellular carbon source storage during the anaerobic stage the sludge was equally divided into 3 reactors reactor 2 4 fig 7b d for step ii with initial concentrations of no3 n of 40 mg l fig 7b no2 n of 40 mg l fig 7c and no nox n fig 7d in phase i 37 6 mg l no3 n was reduced to n2 via the endogenous denitrification process with a pha of 5 1 mmolc l and only 1 2 mg l nitrite accumulating fig 7b additionally nitrite gradually decreased from 40 mg l to 6 2 mg l followed by a pha of 4 9 mmolc l fig 7c the decreased pha performance was also observed in reactor 4 with the pha maintained at 1 1 mmolc l over 6 h fig 7d these results indicate that dgaona dgaoni and gao participated in extracellular carbon source transformation to intracellular phas dgaona dgaoni and gao proportions related to pha generation via external carbons source storage were calculated in eq 5 via stoichiometric models using 0 25 and 0 54 in mmoln mmolc nxra pha values for dgaona and dgaoni respectively therefore the gao dgaoni and dgaona contribution to the pha composition of phase i account for 14 6 18 7 and 66 7 respectively specifically the endogenous nitrite reduction rate increased from 0 08 to 0 11 kg m3 d from phase i to phase iv fig 7c with an average initial pha concentration of 7 5 mmolc l whilst over the same time the nitrate reduction rate decreased from 0 12 to 0 07 kg m3d fig 7b moreover with partial nitrification achieved in the parent reactor from phases i to iv dgaona were gradually eliminated and dgaoni were strengthened as calculated by eq 5 the pphadgaoni for phase iv 73 8 was almost four times of that for phase i thereby demonstrating that the dominant functional microorganisms gradually transformed from dgaona to dgaoni clearly the nitrogen reduction rate experienced a significant improvement under the same pha consumption which indicates that achieving partial nitrification under the combined strategy not only promotes the nitrogen reduction rate but also improves the pha utilization efficiency 3 5 microbial synergy and transformation in the epd system along with biomass activity variation and nitrogen removal performance functional groups in the epd system exhibited a relatively stable structure at the phylum level the dominant bacterial populations of phase i were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria and ignavibacteriae accounting for 48 1 18 3 7 5 5 3 and 3 4 of the total bacteria respectively fig 8 a after the 200 day operation proteobacteria remained the highest in abundance 63 5 while bacteroidetes actinobacteria and parcubacteria decreased slightly most the shared otus of bacterial communities in phase i ii and iv consisted of proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria supplementary fig s3 at the genus level nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus responsible for ammonia oxidation to nitrite were highly detected in phase iv with relative abundances of 2 1 and 0 18 respectively fig 8b moreover the abundance of typical nob nitrospira nitrobacter and nitrolacea were decreased gradually avoiding further nitrite oxidation to nitrate defluviicoccus and candidatus competibacter were considered as the dominant contributor for epd process reducing nox n to n2 mcilroy et al 2014 rubio rincón et al 2017 yuan et al 2020a zeng et al 2010a increasing from 0 1 and 1 2 respectively in phase i to 0 9 and 5 8 respectively in phase iv suppplementary table s3 it was further certificated by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish that the relative abundance of gaos accounted for 17 2 fig 8c and d in comparison thauera comamonadaceae thermomonas and denitratisoma which are capable of heterotrophic denitrification yuan et al 2020b decreased to a certain degree both defluviicoccus and candidatus competibacter capable of endogenous denitrification of no3 n were detected with increasing abundance on the contrary endogenous denitrification activity for dgaona no3 n n2 decreased from 0 15 kg m3 d phase i to 0 1 kg m3d phase iv as demonstrated by ex situ batch tests fig 7b moreover endogenous denitrification accounted for 57 9 of the nitrogen removal in the epd sbr system while only two functional dgao related genera were detected overall such a dominant role in endogenous no3 n and no2 n removal with specific dgao genus raising a brighten investigation in environmental molecular biology which requires further efforts to identify new genera with endogenous denitrification capabilities 3 6 engineering implications and environmental sustainability of pn f double dn this paper describes novel application of fermentation based system that features energy recovery and a driving force while simultaneously treating mature landfill leachate and was for 200 days taking the whole pn f double dn process into consideration nh4 n 1766 6 mg l in the mature landfill leachate was oxidized to no2 n 1529 8 mg l in the pn sbr with a nar of 96 5 compared with the required 4 57 g of o2 to oxidize 1 g of nh4 n during traditional nitrification nh4 n no3 n only 2 74 g of o2 was consumed in the partial nitrification process effluent of the pn sbr no2 n 1529 8 mg l coupled with concentrated was mlss 20 6 g l were simultaneously injected into the ifd sbr for integrated fermentation denitrification the sludge structure was dismantled by fna biotoxicity inhibition allowing the carbon source within the sludge to be utilized in situ by denitrification the no2 n concentration decreased from 640 4 mg l to 2 2 mg l in 10 7 h followed by an mlss reduction rate of 3 3 kg m3d additionally excess carbon source vfas 356 8 mg l in the ifd sbr effluent generated during fermentation subsequently served as electronic donors for removal of unwanted fermentation metabolites 119 2 mg l nh4 n in the epd sbr carbon sources from fermentation were first transformed into phas and gly in the pre anaerobic stage with an e vfaintra of 83 1 after nh4 n oxidation during the aerobic stage the intracellular carbon source served as an electronic donor for epd in the post anoxic phase with a nitrogen reduction efficiency of 93 7 overall the pn f double dn process achieved a total nre of 98 5 and a sre of 46 2 after the 200 day operation with influent nh4 n tn and cod concentrations of 1766 6 1992 3 and 2112 9 mg l respectively this fermentation based system represents an opportunity for accessible and stable double de thereby accelerating economic benefits and environmentally sustainable engineering implementation of mature landfill leachate treatment 4 conclusions pn f double dn process was developed to realize advanced nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate by was resource utilization with nre of 98 5 and sre of 41 6 respectively dgaos 0 9 defluviicoccus and 5 8 candidatus competibacter were responsible for the stability of carbon source storage and nitrogen removal in the epd sbr system with e vfaintra of 83 1 and a nitrogen removal contribution of 93 7 compared with traditional bioprocess pn f double dn has excellent large scale potential by saving 25 aeration energy consumption decreasing 100 external carbon source demand and achieving 46 1 external was

16724,red mud rm as waste of industrial aluminum production is piling up in huge ponds rm could be a cost effective adsorbent for heavy metals but adsorption is vulnerable to ph changes metal ions speciation and the occurrence of iron bearing minerals in this study the precipitation and elemental speciation transformation relevant to arsenic fate in responding to the addition of rm during arsenopyrite bio oxidation by sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was investigated the results show that the addition of rm significantly changed the arsenic precipitation and the solution chemistry and thus affected the arsenopyrite bio oxidation and arsenic fate an addition of a small amount 4 g l of rm substantially promoted arsenopyrite bio oxidation with formation of sio2 as fe al si spherical nanoparticles that can enhance the stability of the immobilized arsenic the sio2 based spherical nanoparticles precipitate was mainly composed of jarosites amorphous ferric arsenate and crystalline scorodite and its formation were controlled by fe3 concentration and solution ph an addition of increased amount of rm 6 g l resulted in a significant increase of the solution ph and a decrease in the fe2 bio oxidation activity and spherical nanoparticles were not formed consequently the dissolution of arsenopyrite was inhibited and the release of arsenic was blocked this study

process is much more complex when rm is added because of forming new phases during dissolution of rm phases there is no doubt that such a sophisticated evolution in elemental speciation transformation

dsm 9293t was used as the reference 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the rm on solution behavior during arsenopyrite bio oxidation rm addition had a pronounced effect on the arsenopyrite bio oxidation process fig 1 fig 1a shows that ph sharply increased when rm was added at day 1 5 the ph increased with the increased rm supplementation due to the high alkalinity of rm the ph increase before the addition of rm can be explained by the acid consuming process bio oxidation of fe2 eq 7 which was released via the dissolution of arsenopyrite eq 8 the reactions between h and aluminosilicates in rm e g cancrinite na6 al6si6o24 caco3 2h2o katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 8 and kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 eqs 9 11 made the solution ph continue to rise and reach a maximum at day 2 to 4 the ph decrease was due to the sulfur bio oxidation of s thermosulfidooxidans eq 12 as sulfur was formed as an intermediate during arsenopyrite bio oxidation these trends could also be verified by the results of xrd fig 3 and xps figs 5 6 s5 s7 7 4 fe 2 4 h o 2 4 fe 3 2 h 2 o 8 4 feass 11 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 fe 2 4 h 3 aso 3 4 so 4 2 9 na 6 al 6 si 6 o 24 caco 3 2 h 2 o 26 h 6 na ca 6 al 3 6 h 4 sio 4 co

mainly determined by fe3 aq fe2 aq zhang et al 2015 increased gradually in the initial stage the addition of rm provoked a rapid decrease in orp values at day 1 5 3 likely due to the quick precipitation of fe3 leading to the sharp increase in ph fig 1a that was reflected by the quick decrease in fet aq fig 1c and fe3 aq fig 1d the addition of rm at day 1 5 also inhibited the growth of cells and the inhibition effect was increased with the increase in the amount of rm added fig 1e at the later stage for the assay without rm added both so4 2 aq fig 1f and fet aq decreased gradually likely due to the formation of iron bearing secondary products such as jarosites mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 where m is a monovalent cation such as nh4 k or h3o eq 13 however the addition of rm resulted in a constant rise of so4 2 aq the formation and accumulation of jarosites depend on the fe3 aq so4 2 aq and solution ph that normally proceeds when ph is below 3 elwood madden et al 2012 the addition of rm can not only lead to the increase in ph but also adsorption of significant amount of fe3 from solution to rm surface supplementary fig s8b s10 result in the inhibition of jarosites formation fig 3 as a result so4 2 concentration increased continuously with the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite 13 3 fe 3 2 so 4 2 m 6 h 2 mfe 3 so 4 2 oh 6 6 h fig 1g shows that the maximum ast aq reached 2 72 1 76 1 35 1 04 0 72 and 0 41 when 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 g l of rm was added respectively i e ast aq obviously decreased with the increase in the amount of rm added comparing the ast aq with as iii aq fig 1h it could be found that the residual arsenic in the solution was mainly as iii during arsenopyrite bio oxidation with addition of rm it implies that rm can adsorb arsenic especially as v the other possibility is that rm could inhibit the dissolution of arsenopyrite other elements such as al si ca na and rare earths e g ce and nd were also found to be released with partial dissolution of aluminosilicates of rm supplementary fig s3 which seems mainly dependent on the amount of added rm and solution ph fig 1a 3 2 mineral morphology and phase composition analyzed by sem eds and xrd the sem results fig 2 show that when small amounts of rm 4 g l were added there occurred dissolution of arsenopyrite and rm with formation of spherical nanoparticles composed mainly of o as fe s al and si fig 2b c and supplementary fig s4a however the dissolution of arsenopyrite was obviously inhibited fig 2d f when the amount of rm was 6 g l furthermore the tightly wrapping of rm on the arsenopyrite surface as a barrier may prevent both the direct interaction between attached bacteria and arsenopyrite and the indirect reaction of fe3 with arsenopyrite fig 2a in contrast for the assay without rm added obvious fine and dense layers composed mainly of s0 and jarosites were formed fig 3 spherical nanoparticles were distributed on the cell surface in the residues for the assays with addition of 2 4 6 g l rm fig 2b c d the spherical nanoparticles became larger with the increase in the amount of rm added for the assay with 6 g l of rm added the spherical nanoparticles were encapsulated by amorphous substances composed mainly of o as fe s al and si fig s4b xrd results fig 3 indicate that a faster disappearance of arsenopyrite and most rm phases occurred with a faster eliminating of s0 and formation of jarosites and crystalline scorodite feaso4 2h2o when 2 g l of rm was added if compared to the assay without rm added or the one with 4 g l of rm when the amount of rm 6 g l the dissolution of arsenopyrite was inhibited and gypsum caso4 2h2o was formed more gypsums were accumulated when more rm were added gypsum seems favoring the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate fig 4 and may promote the inhibition of arsenopyrite dissolution jia and demopoulos 2008 3 3 as fe s al and si speciation transformation analyzed by xps and xanes the distributions of arsenic species derived from the xps of as 3d 5 2 for the residues bio oxidized for 14 days are shown in table s3 and fig s5 it can be found that the arsenic species with different valences and bonding states mainly include as i s as 0 as i o as iii o and as v o in all assays indicating the occurring of arsenic oxidation for all tests of note for the assays with 2 g l and 4 g l of rm the percentages of as v were 70 27 and 64 71 respectively which were obviously higher than that for the assays with 6 g l of rm 56 23 this indicates that a small amount of rm 4 g l is an effective approach to promote arsenic oxidation to further evaluate the arsenic speciation occurrence the as k edge xanes analysis and the linear combination fitting lcf were performed fig 4 the results show that the peak at 11 868 ev for arsenopyrite as i disappeared when 2 or 4 g l of rm were added and the peaks at 11 871 3 and 11 875 ev for as iii and as v became the main valence states of arsenic in the residues after bio oxidation for 14 days fig 4 left the lcf results fig 4 right clearly showed that the formation of both crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa were promoted when 2 or 4 g l of rm was added however the formation of scorodite and amorphous fa were significantly inhibited when 6 g l of rm was added these results indicate that small amount of rm 4 g l can promote the speciation transformation of arsenic and the precipitation of as v in form of crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa which may favor the arsenopyrite dissolution and arsenic immobilization the spherical nanoparticles fig 2b c formed from rm dissolution may provide more attachment and reactive sites for fe3 and as v and thus promote the formation of crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa however excess rm supplement of rm 6 g l covered on the arsenopyrite surface can block the generation of fe3 consequently the oxidation of as iii to as v eq 14 and the formation of crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa eq 15 were hindered 14 2 fe 3 h 3 aso 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h 3 aso 4 2 h 15 h 3 aso 4 fe 3 feaso 4 3 h the fe l edge xanes spectra for the residues supplementary fig s6 showed that both the l3 edge and l2 edge contained two peaks which corresponded to fe ii 706 8 and 720 0 ev and fe iii 708 4 and 722 0 ev species the results show that fe ii was gradually oxidized to fe iii on the mineral surface and such oxidation became more dramatic when 4 g l of rm were added when rm supplementation exceeded 4 g l the peak intensity for fe ii gradually increased with the increase in rm addition amount while the intensity for fe iii decreased indicating clearly that an excess of alkaline rm would inhibit the iron oxidation on the arsenopyrite surface the xps spectra of s 2p 3 2 for the residues after bio oxidation for 14 days fig 5 and supplementary table s4 showed that the sulfur species for all assays were mainly so4 2 169 4 ev s0 164 3 ev ass 2 162 45 ev so3 2 166 5 ev and sn 2 163 3 ev by comparing the distributions of these sulfur species in the residue bio oxidized without rm added fig 5a it can be found that the sulfur oxidation was obviously enhanced when 4 g l of rm was added fig 5b c however the excessive supplement of rm 6 g l would inhibit the sulfur bio oxidation fig 5d f it is worth noting that the oxidation of iron and sulfur under acidic conditions is mainly driven by acidophilic microorganisms e g s thermosulfidooxidans and this microbial driven process is significantly affected by ph millero et al 1987 vera et al 2013 overload of rm 6 g l resulted in higher ph 3 fig 1a which was out of the optimal ph range for the growth of s thermosulfidooxidans and therefore a reduction in the apparent cell iron and sulfur oxidation activities occurred fig 1e f the speciation occurrences of aluminum and silicon from rm dissolution were also investigated as indicated by the al 2p supplementary fig s7 and table s5 and si 2p xps fig 6 and supplementary table s6 the percentages of the main aluminosilicates including cancrinite na6 al6si6o24 caco3 2h2o muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 8 and katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 2 gradually decreased this confirms that some of the rm was dissolved during arsenopyrite bio oxidation with formation of other al si containing precipitates i e so4 2 al iii o supplementary fig s7 and sio2 gel fig 6 these changes became more significant when 2 or 4 g l of rm was added in addition a high ph value caused by more rm addition significantly inhibited these processes the tem eds image fig 7 clearly shows that the sio2 gel encapsulated the spherical nanoparticles that were mainly composed of amorphous fa crystalline scorodite jarosites s0 and some remaining minerals in rm forming sio2 as fe al si residues of core shell structure which is crucial to the stable immobilization and long term storage of arsenic 3 4 effect of rm on cell s surface feature and arsenic distribution the changes of cell s surface feature caused by overload of rm 6 g l may be another key to influence arsenopyrite bio oxidation and arsenic fate therefore the cell s surface feature and arsenic distribution for the cases with and without rm added were further comparatively investigated by using sem eds and stxm the sem eds results fig 8 show that the cells in the assay with 6 g l of rm fig 8a were obviously larger tightly wrapped by spherical nanoparticles with more fe 10 69 al 2 58 si 1 09 and s 4 44 especially as 14 4 fig 8a eds if comparing to the cells for the case of no rm added fe 6 07 al 0 si 0 s 2 42 as 1 73 fig 8b stxm results fig 9 show that the cells cultivated with addition of rm 6 g l adsorbed 3 36 10 5 0 75 10 5 g cm2 as iii fig 9a which was higher than the amount of as v 3 11 10 5 0 67 10 5 g cm2 fig 9b by contrast cells adsorbed less as iii 2 43 10 5 0 78 10 5 g cm2 fig 9c and as v 3 18 10 5 0 86 10 5 g cm2 fig 9d when cultivated without rm by comparing with the changes of solution parameters it was found that the spherical nanoparticles tightly wrapped on the cells surface can result in a decrease in fe2 oxidizing activity of the cells and therefore it leaded to a reduction in the fe3 aq and orp 350 mv figs 1b d such reduction of fe3 aq and orp effectively inhibited the dissolution of arsenopyrite and the oxidation of as iii as shown in fig 8 right this phenomenon has also been observed in previous studies yu et al 2007 patel et al 2019 wiertz et al 2006 based on the above results it can be concluded that the amount of the added rm had a strong influence on solution parameters mineral and cell morphologies mineral phases and speciation transformation of as fe s al and si during arsenopyrite bio oxidation the addition of small amount of rm 4 g l favored the dissolution of both arsenopyrite and rm and leaded to the formation of spherical nanoparticles bearing a core shell structure of sio2 as fe al si composite the species in the bio oxidized residues mainly included amorphous fa jarosites crystalline scorodite s0 and sio2 gel besides some remaining minerals e g hematite fe2o3 diaspore alo oh muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 8 and katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 2 in rm the lower ph ph 2 was favorable for the transformation of amorphous fa into crystalline scorodite figs 1a and 4 gonzalez contreras et al 2012 the formation of both amorphous fa and jarosites are beneficial for arsenic immobilization through sorption and or co precipitation vega hernandez et al 2019 hosokawa and okawa 2013 asta et al 2009 langmuir et al 2006 gonzalez contreras et al 2010 importantly the sio2 gel formed due to the dissolution of rm encapsulated as fe al si composite to form the core shell structure described above fig 7 likely enhanced the stability of these arsenic containing precipitates wu et al 2020b el moselhy et al 2017 adelman et al 2015 le 2003 roberts et al 2004 which is crucial to stabilize the immobilization and long term storage of arsenic the higher ph and lower orp caused by the addition of excessive amounts of rm 6 g l resulted in a lower biological s and fe oxidation activity and thus lead to an inhibition of arsenopyrite dissolution and the speciation transformation of as fe s al and si the transcriptome analysis results supplementary tables s11 12 show that when 2 g l rm was added the sulfur and iron oxidizing related genes are obviously upregulated especially the gene coding for sulfur oxygenase reductase sor the cytoplasmic s0 oxidizing enzymes johnson et al 2008 guo et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 was upregulated by 40 folds and tusa gene for persulfidic sulfur rs sh transfer was upregulated up to 7 6 fold these results indicate that addition of 2 g l of rm promoted the sulfur iron oxidizing activities of strain yn 22 this is consistent with the results above that the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite was promoted when rm 4 g l was added interestingly the genes encoding proteins related to motility e g flagellar biosynthesis proteins were downregulated by when 2 g l rm was added supplementary table s13 this seems to be closely related to the formation of spherical nanoparticles on cell surface due to rm addition 3 5 evaluation of spherical nanoparticles formation and the arsenic adsorption mechanism 3 5 1 effect of fe3 on the formation of spherical nanoparticles the fe3 ions generated during arsenopyrite bio oxidation may determine the formation of spherical nanoparticles and thus the arsenic fate therefore investigations aiming for a better understanding of the effects of fe3 on spherical nanoparticles formation and the arsenic adsorption mechanism were performed supplementary fig s8 shows that the orp values obviously decreased with significantly decrease of fe3 aq when rm was added in the acidic solution containing different fe3 while the concentrations of other elements i e al si ca and na increased due to the partial dissolution of some aluminosilicates in rm supplementary fig s9 sem results supplementary fig s10 show that the presence of fe3 obviously changed the surface morphologies of rm from irregular flaky type structure to nanosphere like structure which was just like the morphology of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residues with addition of 4 g l rm fig 2b c moreover the contents of al and si on the residue surface decreased with increasing concentration of fe3 while the contents of fe o ca and s obviously increased supplementary fig s10f g ft ir results supplementary fig s11 show that the intensity of the bands attributed to al o at 671 cm 1 si o at 995 and 474 cm 1 and co3 2 ions in calcite around 1400 1500 cm 1 in rm decreased significantly with increase of supplement amount of fe3 while the intensity of the bands attributed to s o so4 2 at 1124 cm 1 fe o at 1389 and 590 cm 1 increased obviously these results indicate that most of fe3 and so4 2 were adsorbed on the rm surface to displace some al and si under acidic conditions which is crucial for the formation of spherical nanoparticles 3 5 2 arsenic adsorption as shown in supplementary fig s12 both as v and as iii adsorption abilities of the rm based adsorbent increased with the increase in fe3 from 0 to 3 g l which was attributed to the increase of surface adsorption sites ahmad et al 2020 after adsorption for 48 h 24 4 54 3 83 9 95 2 and 98 1 of 165 7 mg l as v solution was adsorbed by 2 g l of the rm based adsorbents modified by 0 0 5 1 2 and 3 g l of fe3 respectively these are much higher than that of as iii 5 8 15 1 24 5 30 0 and 34 2 fig 10 clearly shows that the adsorbents maintained the original spherical structure and the content of as v was significantly higher than that of as iii after adsorbing arsenic 3 5 3 kinetics and isotherms studies fig 11 a shows that the adsorption rate of as v increased rapidly in the initial 60 min and reached equilibrium after approximately 25 h moreover more as v was adsorbed compared to as iii fig 11b by comparing the correlation coefficients r2 in supplementary tables s7 and s8 the pseudo second order is more suitable to describe the adsorption of both as v and as iii onto rm based adsorbents indicating that the adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption the adsorption isotherms fig 11c d and the corresponding parameters of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models supplementary tables s9 s10 clearly show that the adsorption mechanism of as v is quite different from that of as iii for that of as v it was close to the freundlich model when the rm based adsorbent was not modified by fe3 but more in accordance to the langmuir model after the rm based adsorbent was modified by fe3 this indicates that a change of the multilayer adsorption to monolayer one occurred after the adsorbent was modified by fe3 langmuir 1918 while for that of as iii it was better described by the freundlich model regardless whether the adsorbent was modified by fe3 or not the maximum adsorption capacities qm of the rm based adsorbents modified by 0 0 5 1 2 and 3 g l of fe3 for as v were 18 61 30 21 40 76 48 49 and 61 46 mg g supplementary table s9 which were much higher than those of as iii 3 38 15 21 21 40 26 63 and 26 89 mg g supplementary table s10 the surface properties of rm based adsorbents after different amounts of arsenic adsorbed were further investigated by ft ir spectra fig 12 the results show that the peak intensity for fe o at 1389 cm 1 supplementary fig s11 decreased obviously and shifted gradually to 1384 cm 1 fig 12a with increase in the adsorption amount of as v and the peak at 827 cm 1 for as v o fe of amorphous fa appeared gradually jia et al 2007 gomez et al 2011 carlson et al 2002 in contrast no considerable change were observed in the ft ir spectra for the adsorbents after adsorbed as iii fig 12b these results suggest that most of the oh groups on the rm based adsorbents were bound to fe3 under acidic conditions ph 3 resulting in the formation of bound hydroxylated fe iii with positive charge that can further predominately bind with as v anions fig 12c cumbal and sengupta 2005 4 conclusions this study demonstrates a cost effective process for mitigation of arsenic pollution under acidic conditions via regulating of as bearing sulfide minerals absms bio oxidation by using rm an industrial solid waste of huge quantity worldwide the main conclusions drawn from the current work can be summarized as follows 1 rm exhibits a complex and important role in regulating arsenopyrite bio oxidation and arsenic occurrence depending on its addition amount 2 small amount of rm 4 g l can promote arsenopyrite bio dissolution and the formation of amorphous fa and crystalline scorodite 3 the fe3 and h ions generated by the bio oxidation of fe2 and sulfur are favoring the dissolution of rm and the formation of spherical nanoparticles with a core shell structure of sio2 as fe al si composite and thus enhancing the stability of these arsenic containing precipitates 4 the excessive amount of rm addition resulted in a decrease in fe and s oxidizing activity of the cells the remained rm was tightly wrapped on the arsenopyrite surface which is likely blocking both the direct interaction between bacteria and arsenopyrite and the indirect reaction of fe3 with arsenopyrite and thus significantly inhibits the dissolution of arsenopyrite declaration of competing interest the

16724,red mud rm as waste of industrial aluminum production is piling up in huge ponds rm could be a cost effective adsorbent for heavy metals but adsorption is vulnerable to ph changes metal ions speciation and the occurrence of iron bearing minerals in this study the precipitation and elemental speciation transformation relevant to arsenic fate in responding to the addition of rm during arsenopyrite bio oxidation by sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was investigated the results show that the addition of rm significantly changed the arsenic precipitation and the solution chemistry and thus affected the arsenopyrite bio oxidation and arsenic fate an addition of a small amount 4 g l of rm substantially promoted arsenopyrite bio oxidation with formation of sio2 as fe al si spherical nanoparticles that can enhance the stability of the immobilized arsenic the sio2 based spherical nanoparticles precipitate was mainly composed of jarosites amorphous ferric arsenate and crystalline scorodite and its formation were controlled by fe3 concentration and solution ph an addition of increased amount of rm 6 g l resulted in a significant increase of the solution ph and a decrease in the fe2 bio oxidation activity and spherical nanoparticles were not formed consequently the dissolution of arsenopyrite was inhibited and the release of arsenic was blocked this study

2006 lópez garcía et al 2017 gupta et al 2001 lyu et al 2020 it was shown that 99 2 of as v could be removed by using spherical shaped magnetite nano particles from rm in natural water sample having 1570 g l of as v akin et al 2012 adsorptive capacity of rm could be increased by acid treatment altundogan et al 2002 generated polymeric inorganic hybrid adsorbent by dispersing rm and magnetite in

arsenic bhatnagar et al 2011 mohan and pittman jr 2007 siddiqui and chaudhry 2017 of note rm is alkaline it can react with h through ion exchange and lead to an increase in solution ph khairul et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a this indicates that rm could be a cost effective regulator for source controlling of the bio oxidation of absms and arsenic fate during the bio oxidation of absms complex speciation transformation of arsenic iron and sulfur with formation of various secondary products such as schwertmannite jarosites scorodite elemental sulfur s0 and orpiment as2s3 occurs zhu et al

process is much more complex when rm is added because of forming new phases during dissolution of rm phases there is no doubt that such a sophisticated evolution in elemental speciation transformation and its relatedness to the fate of arsenic are elaborated up to date however this subject has been investigated to a limited extend in this study we selected the most typical absm arsenopyrite 40 45 wt as and got insights into the relatedness of arsenic occurrence and fate by studying morphology phase transition and speciation transformation of as s al and si during arsenopyrite bio oxidation

dsm 9293t was used as the reference 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the rm on solution behavior during arsenopyrite bio oxidation rm addition had a pronounced effect on the arsenopyrite bio oxidation process fig 1 fig 1a shows that ph sharply increased when rm was added at day 1 5 the ph increased with the increased rm supplementation due to the high alkalinity of rm the ph increase before the addition of rm can be explained by the acid consuming process bio oxidation of fe2 eq 7 which was released via the dissolution of arsenopyrite eq 8 the reactions between h and aluminosilicates in rm e g cancrinite na6 al6si6o24 caco3 2h2o katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 8 and kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 eqs 9 11 made the solution ph continue to rise and reach a maximum at day 2 to 4 the ph decrease was due to the sulfur bio oxidation of s thermosulfidooxidans eq 12 as sulfur was formed as an intermediate during arsenopyrite bio oxidation these trends could also be verified by the results of xrd fig 3 and xps figs 5 6 s5 s7 7 4 fe 2 4 h o 2 4 fe 3 2 h 2 o 8 4 feass 11 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 fe 2 4 h 3 aso 3 4 so 4 2 9 na 6 al 6 si 6 o 24 caco 3 2 h 2 o 26 h 6 na ca 6 al 3 6 h 4 sio 4 co

mainly determined by fe3 aq fe2 aq zhang et al 2015 increased gradually in the initial stage the addition of rm provoked a rapid decrease in orp values at day 1 5 3 likely due to the quick precipitation of fe3 leading to the sharp increase in ph fig 1a that was reflected by the quick decrease in fet aq fig 1c and fe3 aq fig 1d the addition of rm at day 1 5 also inhibited the growth of cells and the inhibition effect was increased with the increase in the amount of rm added fig 1e at the later stage for the assay without rm added both so4 2 aq fig 1f and fet aq decreased gradually likely due to the formation of iron bearing secondary products such as jarosites mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 where m is a monovalent cation such as nh4 k or h3o eq 13 however the addition of rm resulted in a constant rise of so4 2 aq the formation and accumulation of jarosites depend on the fe3 aq so4 2 aq and solution ph that normally proceeds when ph is below 3 elwood madden et al 2012 the addition of rm can not only lead to the increase in ph but also adsorption of significant amount of fe3 from solution to rm surface supplementary fig s8b s10 result in the inhibition of jarosites formation fig 3 as a result so4 2 concentration increased continuously with the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite 13 3 fe 3 2 so 4 2 m 6 h 2 mfe 3 so 4 2 oh 6 6 h fig 1g shows that the maximum ast aq reached 2 72 1 76 1 35 1 04 0 72 and 0 41 when 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 g l of rm was added respectively i e ast aq obviously decreased with the increase in the amount of rm added comparing the ast aq with as iii aq fig 1h it could be found that the residual arsenic in the solution was mainly as iii during arsenopyrite bio oxidation with addition of rm it implies that rm can adsorb arsenic especially as v the other possibility is that rm could inhibit the dissolution of arsenopyrite other elements such as al si ca na and rare earths e g ce and nd were also found to be released with partial dissolution of aluminosilicates of rm supplementary fig s3 which seems mainly dependent on the amount of added rm and solution ph fig 1a 3 2 mineral morphology and phase composition analyzed by sem eds and xrd the sem results fig 2 show that when small amounts of rm 4 g l were added there occurred dissolution of arsenopyrite and rm with formation of spherical nanoparticles composed mainly of o as fe s al and si fig 2b c and supplementary fig s4a however the dissolution of arsenopyrite was obviously inhibited fig 2d f when the amount of rm was 6 g l furthermore the tightly wrapping of rm on the arsenopyrite surface as a barrier may prevent both the direct interaction between attached bacteria and arsenopyrite and the indirect reaction of fe3 with arsenopyrite fig 2a in contrast for the assay without rm added obvious fine and dense layers composed mainly of s0 and jarosites were formed fig 3 spherical nanoparticles were distributed on the cell surface in the residues for the assays with addition of 2 4 6 g l rm fig 2b c d the spherical nanoparticles became larger with the increase in the amount of rm added for the assay with 6 g l of rm added the spherical nanoparticles were encapsulated by amorphous substances composed mainly of o as fe s al and si fig s4b xrd results fig 3 indicate that a faster disappearance of arsenopyrite and most rm phases occurred with a faster eliminating of s0 and formation of jarosites and crystalline scorodite feaso4 2h2o when 2 g l of rm was added if compared to the assay without rm added or the one with 4 g l of rm when the amount of rm 6 g l the dissolution of arsenopyrite was inhibited and gypsum caso4 2h2o was formed more gypsums were accumulated when more rm were added gypsum seems favoring the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate fig 4 and may promote the inhibition of arsenopyrite dissolution jia and demopoulos 2008 3 3 as fe s al and si speciation transformation analyzed by xps and xanes the distributions of arsenic species derived from the xps of as 3d 5 2 for the residues bio oxidized for 14 days are shown in table s3 and fig s5 it can be found that the arsenic species with different valences and bonding states mainly include as i s as 0 as i o as iii o and as v o in all assays indicating the occurring of arsenic oxidation for all tests of note for the assays with 2 g l and 4 g l of rm the percentages of as v were 70 27 and 64 71 respectively which were obviously higher than that for the assays with 6 g l of rm 56 23 this indicates that a small amount of rm 4 g l is an effective approach to promote arsenic oxidation to further evaluate the arsenic speciation occurrence the as k edge xanes analysis and the linear combination fitting lcf were performed fig 4 the results show that the peak at 11 868 ev for arsenopyrite as i disappeared when 2 or 4 g l of rm were added and the peaks at 11 871 3 and 11 875 ev for as iii and as v became the main valence states of arsenic in the residues after bio oxidation for 14 days fig 4 left the lcf results fig 4 right clearly showed that the formation of both crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa were promoted when 2 or 4 g l of rm was added however the formation of scorodite and amorphous fa were significantly inhibited when 6 g l of rm was added these results indicate that small amount of rm 4 g l can promote the speciation transformation of arsenic and the precipitation of as v in form of crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa which may favor the arsenopyrite dissolution and arsenic immobilization the spherical nanoparticles fig 2b c formed from rm dissolution may provide more attachment and reactive sites for fe3 and as v and thus promote the formation of crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa however excess rm supplement of rm 6 g l covered on the arsenopyrite surface can block the generation of fe3 consequently the oxidation of as iii to as v eq 14 and the formation of crystalline scorodite and amorphous fa eq 15 were hindered 14 2 fe 3 h 3 aso 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h 3 aso 4 2 h 15 h 3 aso 4 fe 3 feaso 4 3 h the fe l edge xanes spectra for the residues supplementary fig s6 showed that both the l3 edge and l2 edge contained two peaks which corresponded to fe ii 706 8 and 720 0 ev and fe iii 708 4 and 722 0 ev species the results show that fe ii was gradually oxidized to fe iii on the mineral surface and such oxidation became more dramatic when 4 g l of rm were added when rm supplementation exceeded 4 g l the peak intensity for fe ii gradually increased with the increase in rm addition amount while the intensity for fe iii decreased indicating clearly that an excess of alkaline rm would inhibit the iron oxidation on the arsenopyrite surface the xps spectra of s 2p 3 2 for the residues after bio oxidation for 14 days fig 5 and supplementary table s4 showed that the sulfur species for all assays were mainly so4 2 169 4 ev s0 164 3 ev ass 2 162 45 ev so3 2 166 5 ev and sn 2 163 3 ev by comparing the distributions of these sulfur species in the residue bio oxidized without rm added fig 5a it can be found that the sulfur oxidation was obviously enhanced when 4 g l of rm was added fig 5b c however the excessive supplement of rm 6 g l would inhibit the sulfur bio oxidation fig 5d f it is worth noting that the oxidation of iron and sulfur under acidic conditions is mainly driven by acidophilic microorganisms e g s thermosulfidooxidans and this microbial driven process is significantly affected by ph millero et al 1987 vera et al 2013 overload of rm 6 g l resulted in higher ph 3 fig 1a which was out of the optimal ph range for the growth of s thermosulfidooxidans and therefore a reduction in the apparent cell iron and sulfur oxidation activities occurred fig 1e f the speciation occurrences of aluminum and silicon from rm dissolution were also investigated as indicated by the al 2p supplementary fig s7 and table s5 and si 2p xps fig 6 and supplementary table s6 the percentages of the main aluminosilicates including cancrinite na6 al6si6o24 caco3 2h2o muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 8 and katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 2 gradually decreased this confirms that some of the rm was dissolved during arsenopyrite bio oxidation with formation of other al si containing precipitates i e so4 2 al iii o supplementary fig s7 and sio2 gel fig 6 these changes became more significant when 2 or 4 g l of rm was added in addition a high ph value caused by more rm addition significantly inhibited these processes the tem eds image fig 7 clearly shows that the sio2 gel encapsulated the spherical nanoparticles that were mainly composed of amorphous fa crystalline scorodite jarosites s0 and some remaining minerals in rm forming sio2 as fe al si residues of core shell structure which is crucial to the stable immobilization and long term storage of arsenic 3 4 effect of rm on cell s surface feature and arsenic distribution the changes of cell s surface feature caused by overload of rm 6 g l may be another key to influence arsenopyrite bio oxidation and arsenic fate therefore the cell s surface feature and arsenic distribution for the cases with and without rm added were further comparatively investigated by using sem eds and stxm the sem eds results fig 8 show that the cells in the assay with 6 g l of rm fig 8a were obviously larger tightly wrapped by spherical nanoparticles with more fe 10 69 al 2 58 si 1 09 and s 4 44 especially as 14 4 fig 8a eds if comparing to the cells for the case of no rm added fe 6 07 al 0 si 0 s 2 42 as 1 73 fig 8b stxm results fig 9 show that the cells cultivated with addition of rm 6 g l adsorbed 3 36 10 5 0 75 10 5 g cm2 as iii fig 9a which was higher than the amount of as v 3 11 10 5 0 67 10 5 g cm2 fig 9b by contrast cells adsorbed less as iii 2 43 10 5 0 78 10 5 g cm2 fig 9c and as v 3 18 10 5 0 86 10 5 g cm2 fig 9d when cultivated without rm by comparing with the changes of solution parameters it was found that the spherical nanoparticles tightly wrapped on the cells surface can result in a decrease in fe2 oxidizing activity of the cells and therefore it leaded to a reduction in the fe3 aq and orp 350 mv figs 1b d such reduction of fe3 aq and orp effectively inhibited the dissolution of arsenopyrite and the oxidation of as iii as shown in fig 8 right this phenomenon has also been observed in previous studies yu et al 2007 patel et al 2019 wiertz et al 2006 based on the above results it can be concluded that the amount of the added rm had a strong influence on solution parameters mineral and cell morphologies mineral phases and speciation transformation of as fe s al and si during arsenopyrite bio oxidation the addition of small amount of rm 4 g l favored the dissolution of both arsenopyrite and rm and leaded to the formation of spherical nanoparticles bearing a core shell structure of sio2 as fe al si composite the species in the bio oxidized residues mainly included amorphous fa jarosites crystalline scorodite s0 and sio2 gel besides some remaining minerals e g hematite fe2o3 diaspore alo oh muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 8 and katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 2 in rm the lower ph ph 2 was favorable for the transformation of amorphous fa into crystalline scorodite figs 1a and 4 gonzalez contreras et al 2012 the formation of both amorphous fa and jarosites are beneficial for arsenic immobilization through sorption and or co precipitation vega hernandez et al 2019 hosokawa and okawa 2013 asta et al 2009 langmuir et al 2006 gonzalez contreras et al 2010 importantly the sio2 gel formed due to the dissolution of rm encapsulated as fe al si composite to form the core shell structure described above fig 7 likely enhanced the stability of these arsenic containing precipitates wu et al 2020b el moselhy et al 2017 adelman et al 2015 le 2003 roberts et al 2004 which is crucial to stabilize the immobilization and long term storage of arsenic the higher ph and lower orp caused by the addition of excessive amounts of rm 6 g l resulted in a lower biological s and fe oxidation activity and thus lead to an inhibition of arsenopyrite dissolution and the speciation transformation of as fe s al and si the transcriptome analysis results supplementary tables s11 12 show that when 2 g l rm was added the sulfur and iron oxidizing related genes are obviously upregulated especially the gene coding for sulfur oxygenase reductase sor the cytoplasmic s0 oxidizing enzymes johnson et al 2008 guo et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 was upregulated by 40 folds and tusa gene for persulfidic sulfur rs sh transfer was upregulated up to 7 6 fold these results indicate that addition of 2 g l of rm promoted the sulfur iron oxidizing activities of strain yn 22 this is consistent with the results above that the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite was promoted when rm 4 g l was added interestingly the genes encoding proteins related to motility e g flagellar biosynthesis proteins were downregulated by when 2 g l rm was added supplementary table s13 this seems to be closely related to the formation of spherical nanoparticles on cell surface due to rm addition 3 5 evaluation of spherical nanoparticles formation and the arsenic adsorption mechanism 3 5 1 effect of fe3 on the formation of spherical nanoparticles the fe3 ions generated during arsenopyrite bio oxidation may determine the formation of spherical nanoparticles and thus the arsenic fate therefore investigations aiming for a better understanding of the effects of fe3 on spherical nanoparticles formation and the arsenic adsorption mechanism were performed supplementary fig s8 shows that the orp values obviously decreased with significantly decrease of fe3 aq when rm was added in the acidic solution containing different fe3 while the concentrations of other elements i e al si ca and na increased due to the partial dissolution of some aluminosilicates in rm supplementary fig s9 sem results supplementary fig s10 show that the presence of fe3 obviously changed the surface morphologies of rm from irregular flaky type structure to nanosphere like structure which was just like the morphology of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residues with addition of 4 g l rm fig 2b c moreover the contents of al and si on the residue surface decreased with increasing concentration of fe3 while the contents of fe o ca and s obviously increased supplementary fig s10f g ft ir results supplementary fig s11 show that the intensity of the bands attributed to al o at 671 cm 1 si o at 995 and 474 cm 1 and co3 2 ions in calcite around 1400 1500 cm 1 in rm decreased significantly with increase of supplement amount of fe3 while the intensity of the bands attributed to s o so4 2 at 1124 cm 1 fe o at 1389 and 590 cm 1 increased obviously these results indicate that most of fe3 and so4 2 were adsorbed on the rm surface to displace some al and si under acidic conditions which is crucial for the formation of spherical nanoparticles 3 5 2 arsenic adsorption as shown in supplementary fig s12 both as v and as iii adsorption abilities of the rm based adsorbent increased with the increase in fe3 from 0 to 3 g l which was attributed to the increase of surface adsorption sites ahmad et al 2020 after adsorption for 48 h 24 4 54 3 83 9 95 2 and 98 1 of 165 7 mg l as v solution was adsorbed by 2 g l of the rm based adsorbents modified by 0 0 5 1 2 and 3 g l of fe3 respectively these are much higher than that of as iii 5 8 15 1 24 5 30 0 and 34 2 fig 10 clearly shows that the adsorbents maintained the original spherical structure and the content of as v was significantly higher than that of as iii after adsorbing arsenic 3 5 3 kinetics and isotherms studies fig 11 a shows that the adsorption rate of as v increased rapidly in the initial 60 min and reached equilibrium after approximately 25 h moreover more as v was adsorbed compared to as iii fig 11b by comparing the correlation coefficients r2 in supplementary tables s7 and s8 the pseudo second order is more suitable to describe the adsorption of both as v and as iii onto rm based adsorbents indicating that the adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption the adsorption isotherms fig 11c d and the corresponding parameters of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models supplementary tables s9 s10 clearly show that the adsorption mechanism of as v is quite different from that of as iii for that of as v it was close to the freundlich model when the rm based adsorbent was not modified by fe3 but more in accordance to the langmuir model after the rm based adsorbent was modified by fe3 this indicates that a change of the multilayer adsorption to monolayer one occurred after the adsorbent was modified by fe3 langmuir 1918 while for that of as iii it was better described by the freundlich model regardless whether the adsorbent was modified by fe3 or not the maximum adsorption capacities qm of the rm based adsorbents modified by 0 0 5 1 2 and 3 g l of fe3 for as v were 18 61 30 21 40 76 48 49 and 61 46 mg g supplementary table s9 which were much higher than those of as iii 3 38 15 21 21 40 26 63 and 26 89 mg g supplementary table s10 the surface properties of rm based adsorbents after different amounts of arsenic adsorbed were further investigated by ft ir spectra fig 12 the results show that the peak intensity for fe o at 1389 cm 1 supplementary fig s11 decreased obviously and shifted gradually to 1384 cm 1 fig 12a with increase in the adsorption amount of as v and the peak at 827 cm 1 for as v o fe of amorphous fa appeared gradually jia et al 2007 gomez et al 2011 carlson et al 2002 in contrast no considerable change were observed in the ft ir spectra for the adsorbents after adsorbed as iii fig 12b these results suggest that most of the oh groups on the rm based adsorbents were bound to fe3 under acidic conditions ph 3 resulting in the formation of bound hydroxylated fe iii with positive charge that can further predominately bind with as v anions fig 12c cumbal and sengupta 2005 4 conclusions this study demonstrates a cost effective process for mitigation of arsenic pollution under acidic conditions via regulating of as bearing sulfide minerals absms bio oxidation by using rm an industrial solid waste of huge quantity worldwide the main conclusions drawn from the current work can be summarized as follows 1 rm exhibits a complex and important role in regulating arsenopyrite bio oxidation and arsenic occurrence depending on its addition amount 2 small amount of rm 4 g l can promote arsenopyrite bio dissolution and the formation of amorphous fa and crystalline scorodite 3 the fe3 and h ions generated by the bio oxidation of fe2 and sulfur are favoring the dissolution of rm and the formation of spherical nanoparticles with a core shell structure of sio2 as fe al si composite and thus enhancing the stability of these arsenic containing precipitates 4 the excessive amount of rm addition resulted in a decrease in fe and s oxidizing activity of the cells the remained rm was tightly wrapped on the arsenopyrite surface which is likely blocking both the direct interaction between bacteria and arsenopyrite and the indirect reaction of fe3 with arsenopyrite and thus significantly inhibits the dissolution of arsenopyrite declaration of competing interest the
