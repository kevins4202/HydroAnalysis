understanding the groundwater circulation mechanism is essential for studying the hydrological effect of permafrost degradation in alpine regions in this study potential water sources and origin of solutes in the groundwater of a typical alpine region were studied using hydrochemistry 18o 2h and 3h analyses this research is essential for studying the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation new hydrological insights for the region upon moving from the mountainous region to the plains the renewal rate decreases from 10 5 to 0 6 and the mean transit time increases from 5 30 to 20 32 years groundwater is mainly recharged by ground ice meltwater and infiltration of glacier meltwater snow meltwater and precipitation in mountainous areas and by deep groundwater near faults discharge to surface water evaporation and overflow into springs are the main drainage modes water ice rock soil interactions such as dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals are the main factors

hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the nagqu river basin was studied using the environmental tracers 18o 2h and 3h the results reveal that the hydrochemical evolution is affected by water rock interaction as altitude decreases the renewal rate decreases from 10 5 to 0 6 and the mean transit time increases from 5 30 to 20 32 years groundwater is mainly recharged by precipitation ice snow meltwater and ground ice meltwater the main drainage modes are discharge to surface water evaporation and overflow into springs ga1 keywords hydrochemistry isotope tracer groundwater permafrost qinghai tibet plateau data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction in recent decades climate warming has led to permafrost degradation at a global scale chadburn et al 2017 which has a significant impact on the hydrological cycle and alpine ecosystems karlsson et al 2012 cochand et al 2020 fortier et al 2020 the gradual degradation of permafrost may lead to the thickening of the active layer and collapse of drainage channels this can lead to an expansion of taliks which may promote hydraulic connectivity among supra permafrost water sub permafrost water and surface water wan et al 2019a 2019b the release of frozen soil moisture and increase in groundwater recharge areas may lead to changes in the groundwater recharge structure this in turn affects groundwater chemistry and reserves frey and mcclelland 2009 kurylyk and walvoord 2020 degradation of permafrost may aggravate the weathering of mineral soil bedrock and permafrost further the products of weathering and thawing can lead to an increased mineral signature of surface water and groundwater toohey et al 2016 the groundwater chemical composition is the result of long term interactions between water and its surrounding environment and is indicative of the environmental conditions therefore comprehensive studies on the hydrochemical evolution and groundwater flow paths in permafrost regions are of great significance for understanding how the water cycle is affected by climate change cochand et al 2019 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is known as one of the asian water tower in this area the thermal response of permafrost to global warming has reached depths greater than 30 m zhang et al 2020 this significantly changes the spatial temporal pattern and characteristic distribution of the groundwater flow system chang et al 2018 degradation of continuous permafrost leads to lower water yields and runoff and the increase in groundwater storage is insignificant in the extensive discontinuous permafrost area additional water from the ground ice melt water increases the runoff in the zones of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost the runoff recharged by groundwater and meltwater is reduced and the reduction of groundwater flow subsequently enhances the effect of evaporation gao et al 2019 jiang 2020 the nagqu river basin nrb is on the interior qtp and functions as the headwater area of the nu salween river dong et al 2018 the nrb also experiences extensive permafrost and seasonal frost the effects of ice and snow melt permafrost degradation changes in elevational distribution of alpine vegetation belts and enhanced evaporation rates in the past 50 years zou et al 2019 lin et al 2020 yang et al 2020d have led to an increase in groundwater recharge in high altitude regions this is also accompanied by an increase in natural discharge of groundwater in the relatively low altitude regions weng et al 2020 in recent years several studies have been carried out to determine hydrological responses to permafrost degradation in the qtp wang et al 2017 2020 qin et al 2020 sun et al 2020 compared with low altitude areas knowledge of hydrogeological processes in the nrb is limited owing to the difficulty of monitoring and data collection the highly heterogeneous nature of alpine areas is in contrast with its low data density in most existing studies the focus has been on hydrological systems which includes studying the evolution of surface water composition affected by climate change and determining the contribution of groundwater to rivers in regions of degrading permafrost using plankton indicators and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes chen et al 2018 weng et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the results show that snow and ice melt and groundwater are the main components of runoff in the nrb however the combined effects of climate warming and permafrost degradation on groundwater flow systems and hydro geochemistry in the nrb are less known groundwater is an important and secure long term resource for water supply and surface water recharge in the nrb man et al 2019 yang et al 2020c exploring the origin of solutes in groundwater and its potential recharge sources are important for studying the hydrological effect of permafrost degradation further this will provide guidance for avoiding an imbalance between water supply and utilization due to climate change and will also ensure the sustainable development and management of water resources of the upper nu salween river the aim of this study was to reveal the potential water sources and origin of solutes in groundwater in the nrb using chemical and isotopic tracers the specific goals were as follows 1 perform an integrated hydrogeochemical analysis to determine the groundwater types and main factors for affecting the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater 2 explore the potential water sources of groundwater using a multi tracer approach 3 quantify the groundwater renewal rate and groundwater mean transit time mtt in the flow system to analyze the groundwater renewal capacity and 4 clarify the relationship between groundwater renewal ability groundwater types and potential water sources 2 study region and methods 2 1 study area and hydrogeological units 2 1 1 study area the nrb is in the central part of the qtp fig 1a between 30 50 32 44 n and 91 08 93 01 e and covers a watershed area of 16 967 4 km2 yang et al 2021 the elevation of the nrb varies between 4140 and 5897 m above sea level a s l it acts as the headwater area of the nu salween river the nrb is in the semi arid climate zone weng et al 2020 it is affected by the south asian summer monsoon hence 88 of the annual total precipitation occurs from may to september deng and zhang 2018 the study area has an 180 day freezing period from october to next april yang et al 2020b the surface soil has a typical graded structure fine sand and clay in the upper part and coarse sand and gravel in the lower part and the main vegetation types are alpine grassland and meadow the study area is limited by the southern slopes of the tanggula mountains and the northern slope of the nyenchen tanglha mountains the mountains constituting the natural groundwater divide of the study area include the tanggula mountains in the north 4800 m a s l the nyenchen tanglha mountains in the south 4800 m a s l and the mountains in the east and west 4800 m a s l glaciers are located in the northeastern region of the basin covering an area of 3 53 km2 seasonal frost is widely distributed and accounts for about 72 of the nrb discontinuous permafrost is distributed in the north east and south zou et al 2017 affected by climate warming and human activities discontinuous permafrost is degrading into seasonal frost fig 1b groundwater is located in pores fissures and karst aquifers in the unconsolidated and clastic water bearing rocks of the basin fig 1c owing to the effect of the alpine climate bedrock fissure water which has an altitude of over 4650 m a s l is the aquifer type in the northern southern and eastern parts of the basin the geological structure of the study area is complex and composed of ew trending faults cut by nw ne and approximately ns directional faults under the action of river erosion and deposition large amounts of sediments have accumulated on the gently sloping land thus forming a valley plain the groundwater runoff from the exposed bedrock mountains varies in space and time with a clear seasonal pattern and is the primary supply of water to the valley plain the groundwater of the central valley plain is in the pores of loose rocks affected by the basal and hydrogeological structure the aquifer properties vary and the groundwater runoff is concentrated in the valley plains valley plains are not only the main accumulation zone water resources but are also the key locations for their development and utilization 2 1 2 hydrogeological units the landscape of the nrb can be divided into four units based on the altitude and permafrost distribution fig 1a 1 the continuous permafrost zone of the northern mountainous area cpnm it has an elevation exceeding 4650 m a s l which locally reaches 5500 m a s l and forms the northeastern boundary glaciers can be found in the northern cpnm 2 the area of seasonal frost of the valley plain sfp it has an average elevation of 4500 m a s l and is the main catchment area of the basin 3 the discontinuous permafrost zone of the southern mountainous area dpsm it has an elevation varying between 4700 and 5900 m a s l and forms the southern boundary of the basin 4 the discontinuous permafrost zone of the eastern mountainous area dpem it has an elevation varying between 4650 and 5900 m a s l and forms the eastern boundary of the basin 2 2 sampling sites and laboratory methods five field campaigns were conducted at the nrb research site between 2017 and 2020 water samples were collected from precipitation groundwater springs surface water lakes and ice and snow cover in several permafrost regions in total 66 river samples 65 groundwater samples 60 from wells and 5 from springs and 61 precipitation samples 42 from rain and 19 from snow were collected fig 1c shows the locations of all groundwater samples all samples were stored in 500 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were sealed with parafilm and capped then they were stored at 4 c prior to the analyses stable isotopes of water expressed as δ18o and δ2h were analyzed in all water samples in addition natural tracers including major ions ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl hco3 co3 2 and total alkalinity and nutrients nh4 no3 no2 total inorganic n and total inorganic p were measured in all water samples collected in 2019 and 2020 and tritium 3h was used for groundwater age dating water physicochemical parameters including the ph temperature electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in the field using a multi parameter probe ysi pro plus to verify the quality of the experiments 10 of the samples were used for duplicate measurements the δ18o and δ2h measurements were carried out using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds and a picarro l2130 i water isotope analyzer the analytical precision was 0 025 and 0 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the results are presented as delta notation δ relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow per mil which compares the heavy and light isotope ratios of a sample the 3h concentration of the water samples was determined using a liquid scintillation counting spectrometer tri carb 3170tr sl the data are presented as absolute values in tritium units tu with a total analytical uncertainty of less than 0 4 tu concentrations of total dissolved solids tds were determined by summing the concentrations of cations and anions 2 3 calculation methods 2 3 1 3h concentration series of precipitation reconstruction precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge therefore estimating the 3h concentration in the precipitation is crucial for determining the input function for the calculation models affolter et al 2020 lászló et al 2020 knowledge of the temporal and spatial distribution of 3h in precipitation is limited in the nrb doney et al 1992 used factor analysis to develop a global model function for distribution of 3h concentration in precipitation from 1960 to 1986 and reported two factor scores and coefficient maps doney et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 improved the factor analysis method and made the model applicable to specific stations and unnormalized observations in this study the factor analysis method was selected to recover the precipitation 3h concentration series in the nrb from long term continuous measurements of the 3h concentration in regions near the study area table 1 these included the hong kong lhasa and zhangye stations the 3h time series data were obtained from the international atomic energy agency iaea the recovered precipitation 3h concentration time series at the study area is shown in fig 2 2 3 2 mean transit time calculation the concept for the groundwater tritium based age classification system is based on an understanding of how concentrations of 3h in groundwater vary given the temporal variation of 3h in precipitation the groundwater recharged prior to 1953 is considered as premodern water and recharged in 1953 or later is considered as modern water the determination methods of 3h thresholds of modern water and premodern water are as follows 1 the modern threshold is set at the minimum post peak concentration of decayed 3h in precipitation and it is considered that 3h concentrations in modern water are higher than the threshold 2 the premodern threshold is set at the 3h concentration after decay from 1952 to the sampling date and it is considered that 3h concentrations in premodern water are no more than the threshold and 3 concentrations of 3h in groundwater that are between the premodern and modern thresholds are considered mixed lindsey et al 2019 according to the 3h concentration series of precipitation the thresholds of modern water and premodern water in nrb are 0 34 tu and 1 81 tu respectively in this study 3h activities were used in conjunction with lumped parameter models lpms implemented in the tracerlpm version 1 1 0 to investigate the mean transit times mtts jurgens et al 2016 the lpm solves for the transit time distribution model parameters i e mean age and mixing parameter by matching the observed tracer concentration at a given time with the predicted tracer concentration obtained by the convolution of the tracer input history tracer decay and an analytical weighting function hagedorn et al 2018 in previous studies of using lpms different weighting functions were applied these included the piston flow model the exponential model and the exponential piston flow model the groundwater in the nrb is recharged by lateral runoff and vertical infiltration of precipitation which is composed of exponential flow and piston flow the exponential piston flow model jurgens et al 2016 was used in this study 2 3 3 groundwater renewal rate determination the well mixed reservoir model has been proven as a useful tool in the estimation of groundwater renewal rates using 3h content in groundwater salle et al 2001 cheng et al 2017 li et al 2019c based on the principle of mass balance and the assumption that the groundwater supplied in different years is completely mixed in the groundwater system and including radioisotope decay an empirical equation can be used for calculating the 3h concentration of groundwater salle et al 2001 1 a g i 1 r i a g i 1 e λ r i a o i 2 r i r p i p m where i is the calculation year a g i is 3h concentration tu in the groundwater in year i a g i 1 is the 3h concentration tu in year i 1 a o i is the 3h concentration tu of water recharge in year i λ is the decay constant 3h 0 055764 a 1 r i is the annual renewal rate of groundwater in year i r is the mean annual renewal rate p i mm is annual precipitation and p m mm is annual mean precipitation the calculation years ranged from 1953 before atmospheric nuclear explosions to 2019 before 1952 the 3h concentration in precipitation was assumed constant at 10 tu a 0 clark and fritz 1997 thomas and rose 2003 gleeson et al 2015 subsequently the 3h concentration in groundwater in 1952 was calculated as follows 3 a g1952 a 0 λ r 1 combining the restored 3h concentration series of precipitation the 3h output concentration a g of the groundwater corresponding to the different groundwater renewal rates r in 2019 was calculated with eq 1 this was then used to generate the curve representing the correlation between a g and r for the study area 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical composition during the thawing period fig 3 shows the variation of the major ion hydrochemistry for different water samples the methods for graphical representation and interpretation of the major ions are based on piper diagrams piper 1944 in most of the groundwater samples hco3 and ca2 are the dominant anions and cations respectively the tds concentration of well water is generally low ranging from 98 2 to 793 mg l with an average of 296 mg l the ph values range from 6 94 to 8 21 the major chemical types of groundwater are ca hco3 ca na hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 in mountain areas whereas they are ca mg hco3 and na ca hco3 in the plain areas the groundwater samples near the fault and permafrost of mountain areas show higher tds along with higher mg2 na and so4 2 the groundwater in the sfp showed lower so4 2 concentration than in the mountain areas and the concentrations of mg2 so4 2 and tds increased along the flow path spring samples represent na hco3 and na ca hco3 water with tds concentrations ranging from 381 to 3 76 103 mg l in most surface water samples anions are dominated by hco3 and so4 2 these samples have higher so4 2 concentrations and lower hco3 and cl contents than those of the groundwater samples the cations are dominated by ca2 and mg2 these samples have higher mg2 and lower ca2 and na concentrations than those of the groundwater samples the major water types in the tributaries are ca mg hco3 na ca mg hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 the main stream has a higher concentration of tds na cl and so4 2 than that in the tributaries and the main water type is na ca mg hco3 the ph values range from 7 43 to 8 83 thus representing mildly alkaline water when compared with the groundwater and spring water the precipitation is characterized by relatively low tds and ph values and the chemical compositions of precipitation surface water and groundwater are relatively constant in space the cl and na values are highest in groundwater followed by surface water and precipitation these results reﬂect increases in the cl and na concentrations with increasing water transformation from input to output 3 2 stable isotope characteristics the δ 2h and δ 18o data analyzed in this work are presented in the δ 2h δ 18o space in fig 4 since precipitation is the initial input analyzing the δ 2h and δ 18o isotopes of precipitation is important for studying the formation and evolution of surface water and groundwater the 61 precipitation samples collected in different seasons from 2017 to 2020 exhibited large variations in isotopic compositions and had δ 2h values ranging from 212 21 to 4 53 and δ 18o values varying from 26 93 to 2 11 the mean values i e δ 18o of 16 64 and δ 2h of 124 30 are most likely to be representative of the present local precipitation the mean values of δ 18o and δ 2h in snow 12 90 and 90 00 respectively are more abundant than those in rainfall 18 34 and 139 80 respectively these data lie close to the global meteoric water line gmwl and can be defined as the local meteoric water line lmwl δ 2h 7 57δ 18o 1 73 the δ 18o and δ 2h values of the well water varying from 17 59 to 11 21 and from 139 36 to 93 00 respectively and thus fall to the bottom right of the lmwl the mean δ 18o and δ 2h values 15 27 and 117 17 respectively are higher than those of spring water δ 18o 18 72 and δ 2h 147 35 the slope of the groundwater line gwl δ 2h 7 78 δ 18o 1 31 is slightly greater than that of the lmwl which infers that precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge the drastic revaporization during infiltration may lead to isotopic fractionation resulting in deviation hence mixing of different waterbodies and water rock isotopic exchange reactions may be alternative factors affecting the variations in the h and o isotopic compositions in relation to the lmwl the δ 18o values of the surface water vary from 17 80 to 10 18 and the δ2h values range from 138 53 to 79 05 the mean values plot on the lmwl δ 18o 14 464 and δ 2h 111 37 these results suggest that the stable isotopic composition of surface waters originates from precipitation the δ 18o and δ 2h values of surface water samples are mainly distributed toward the bottom right of the gmwl and lmwl furthermore the deviation of the surface water line swl δ 2h 5 99 δ 18o 24 67 from the lmwl is greater than that of groundwater samples and it increases with decreasing altitude the spatial distributions of stable isotope compositions of surface water and groundwater are consistent which indicates a strong interaction between surface water and groundwater within the watershed from northwest to southeast the stable isotopes gradually become more depleted the cpnm region with faults and permafrost is most abundant in δ 18o and δ 2h in the dpem and dpsm the areas with faults have higher stable isotope concentrations than in areas without this indicates that groundwater may be recharged by deep groundwater in the large fault zones the δ 18o and δ 2h values of groundwater in the sfp area gradually decrease along the groundwater flow path thus indicating the presence of water with low stable isotope concentrations recharging the groundwater 3 3 mean transit time and renewal rate determination by 3h the estimated results are shown in table 2 the 3h concentrations of the spring water are less than 1 3 tu thus indicating that the spring water is a mix of modern and premodern water the groundwater in the watershed has 3h concentrations ranging from 2 7 0 4 to 10 1 0 4 tu this indicates that the groundwater in the nrb is modern water in the dpsm and southern dpem with discontinuous permafrost the 3h concentrations in groundwater are between 9 5 and 10 1 tu the r ranges from 10 to 15 and the mtt is less than 6 a however the 3h concentrations in the mountainous areas cpnm and northern dpem were between 3 4 and 5 8 tu with an r value below 2 50 and an mtt of 15 30 a in the valley plains with season frost the 3h concentrations range from 2 7 to 5 7 tu and the r is below 2 and the mtt ranges from 20 to 35 a the renewal rate of the groundwater increases with increasing altitude it can be concluded that groundwater is indeed recharged by modern water at high elevations the flow paths are mainly controlled by the topography i e by horizontal runoff glacial meltwater and the recharge of sub permafrost water from taliks or faults may be responsible for the lower 3h concentration of the groundwater in the continuous permafrost areas as compared with that of the discontinuous permafrost areas 4 discussion 4 1 transformation mechanism of groundwater ions as mentioned above hydrogeochemical composition in mountainous regions and valley plains show different characteristics it is thus important to explore the reasons for these differences during recharge and discharge in different regions a gibbs schematic diagram gibbs 1970 was used to explore the hydrochemical evolution of precipitation surface water and groundwater fig 5 shows that the na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 ratios of most of the groundwater and surface water samples have a wide range they are distributed with the control lines of rock dominance which reflects that water ice rock soil interactions are the main controlling factors for the hydrochemical evolution the spring evolves from rock dominance to evaporation concentrating dominance the na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 ratios of the groundwater in mountainous areas cpnm dpem and dpsm are relatively lower than those in the valley plain groundwater with high tds and cl concentrations can be attributed to the long migration path of groundwater containing prominent water ice rock soil interactions additionally higher ionic ratios of the groundwater on the valley plain may also be attributed to evaporation and to the exchange and absorption of ions in groundwater of alpine meadows li and gao 2019 li et al 2019b the gaillardet and ion proportion coefficient diagrams were drawn to explore the effect of water ice rock soil interactions on the groundwater chemistry yang et al 2020a the main sources of ions in water are divided into evaporite dissolution i e halite gypsum and chemical weathering of silicates i e feldspar ca plagioclase and olivine and carbonate i e calcite and dolomite rock li et al 2020b the ratios of ca2 na and mg2 na were used to distinguish the effect of dilution and evaporation on hydrochemistry fig 6a shows that from mountainous regions to valley plains the transformation from carbonate to silicate rocks and to evaporites is the main influencing factor of hydrochemical composition evolution for either surface waters or groundwater well and spring waters are more affected by evaporite dissolution than surface water the ratio of na cl concentrations is often used to explain evaporite dissolution as shown in fig 6b the na cl ratios for most of groundwater samples are much higher than 1 hence in addition to halite groundwater also dissolves other sodium containing minerals such as aluminosilicates ca2 in water may also exchange with na in soil therefore the concentration of na may become higher than that of cl however the na cl ratios of water samples near permafrost and faults in mountainous areas are 1 which suggests that na and cl originate from halite dissolution the na ca2 and mg2 ca2 ratios were used to explain the source of chemical weathering in carbonate rock li et al 2020b low ratios suggest that the hydrochemical composition is due to the dissolution of calcite whereas high ratios indicate that the hydrochemical composition originates from the dissolution of dolomite as shown in fig 6c the ratios of na ca2 and mg2 ca2 of the groundwater and surface water on the valley plain are much higher than the 1 1 line this indicates that they are mainly affected by dolomite weathering and dissolution however the ratios in water near permafrost and faults in mountainous areas are low and mainly concentrated near the 1 1 line thus indicating that the hydrochemical composition is affected by calcite the ca2 mg2 so4 2 ratio is often used to represent the dissolution of carbonate and aluminosilicate minerals in groundwater systems since the ratios of all samples are greater than 1 fig 6d the results indicate that the chemical composition of the groundwater is mainly dominated by the dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals the ratio of ca2 mg2 to ca2 mg2 na k is applied to explain the effects of various minerals liu et al 2016 li et al 2019a on the valley plain the ratios in water are mainly concentrated in the lower right of the 1 2 line whereas the opposite trend can be observed in mountainous areas this elucidates that the hydrochemical composition of groundwater is affected by ca plagioclase and olivine dissolution in the valley plain and by feldspar dissolution in mountainous areas figs 6e and 6f 4 2 recharge of groundwater along the flow path groundwater recharge components in alpine areas can generally be divided into five types 1 precipitation recharge 2 glacier snow and ground ice meltwater recharge 3 surface water recharge i e temporary or seasonal and perennial stream infiltration recharge 4 mountain block recharge spatially distributed subsurface inflow and 5 groundwater inflow that occurs along discrete permeable geologic features such as faults since different water sources produce completely different temporal and spatial responses to climate change it is necessary to distinguish the potential sources of groundwater in different regions markovich et al 2021 in groundwater systems major ion hydrochemistry and stable isotope signatures of individual samples are primarily a reﬂection of its source water mixture and ﬂow paths kpegli et al 2018 moran et al 2019 mtt and recharge rates reflect the length and mean velocity of the groundwater flow paths the multi tracer approach can be used to comprehensively analyze the potential sources of groundwater in the cpnm the supra permafrost water is enriched with stable isotopes and dissolved ions and the mtts are longer than those in the dpsm in high altitude mountainous areas however they are shorter than those in the sfp this indicates that precipitation is not the only recharge mechanism in the cpnm area further the cpnm region is closer to the glaciers and to the water transmitted faults these results indicate that the ground ice near the permafrost table of the qtp is characterized by high stable isotope concentrations and salinity wang et al 2018 2019 gao et al 2020 hence ground ice is more enriched than the groundwater value in the nrb under a warming climate continuous permafrost thaws extensively and ice and snow melt intensively hence resulting in ground ice melt water with sufficient water ice rock soil interactions that recharge the supra permafrost water this ultimately leads to higher tds δ 18o and δ 2h in addition supra permafrost water may be recharged by the deep groundwater flowing through the fault which is characterized by higher ions and lower 3h content in the dpsm the hydrochemical types and stable isotopic characteristics of the groundwater surface water and precipitation are similar the terrain significantly fluctuates and the mountains on both sides are inclined to the river channel therefore groundwater may discharge to the river but it is rarely supplied by the river groundwater especially near unstable permafrost is more enriched in cl and heavy isotopes than the surface water and rainfall due to ground ice and snow melt recharge discontinuous permafrost limits the vertical movement of supra permafrost water thus resulting in short mtts and a high r subsequently it leads to limited water ice rock soil interactions thus groundwater is also recharged by precipitation at similar altitudes the undulating terrain provides suitable conditions for supra permafrost water to overflow upwards to the surface li et al 2020a subsequent to land overflow concentration the brook converges with glacier meltwater and here the precipitation and snow water contribute to the surface water yang et al 2021 in the dpem the spatial variations of hydrochemistry and isotopes δ 18o δ 2h and 3h are significant the δ 18o and δ 2h concentrations decrease from north to south while the tds and 3h concentrations increase this can be attributed to a structural change in the groundwater recharge source structure the tds δ 18o and δ 2h concentrations of the northern dpem with unstable permafrost are slightly lower than those of the cpnm it can be speculated that the groundwater in the northern dpem is recharged by precipitation and ground ice and snow meltwater lower δ 18o and δ 2h along with shorter residence times of the groundwater are found in the southern dpem indicate that the location of the recharge area is relatively close however the tds concentration is relatively high which cannot be explained with natural variability in modern precipitation it can be inferred that the groundwater is recharged by precipitation in the nearby highlands and is strongly affected by evaporation and water ice rock soil interactions in the sfp the groundwater lacks 3h and is enriched with 18o and dissolved ions as compared with other regions in the nrb west to east trending faults are distributed in the sfp which provide channels for preferential groundwater flow deep hot springs and groundwater wells with a large water yield are distributed close to these hydrogeological faults hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater and surface water are similar whereas there is a small difference of precipitation in different regions this can be attributed to the altitude effect of isotopes this indicates that precipitation is not the only source of recharge in the plains high mtts and low r values confirm that the groundwater is recharged by upstream and deep groundwater rather than by local precipitation groundwater is enriched in cl na and tds because evaporation and duration of water ice rock soil interactions increases with increasing flow path lengths ion exchange and the uptake of groundwater by vegetation such as in alpine meadows may also affect the groundwater hydrochemistry and stable isotopes rao et al 2020 generally it can be inferred that groundwater in the sfp is mainly recharged by groundwater from the upstream mountainous area in addition it is also recharged by deep groundwater along the faults during migration and infiltration groundwater is subject to evaporation and water ice rock soil interactions the main drainage mode of groundwater which is partially discharged to surface waters is evaporation springs are formed due to overflow at the intersection of aquitards and the ground surface 5 conclusions environmental tracers including major ions stable isotopes and 3h were used in this study to characterize groundwater flow in a basin within a discontinuous permafrost zone in the qtp nrb in china groundwater in the nrb is affected by the altitude hydrogeological faults and permafrost distribution it is characterized by unique circulation and hydrochemical evolution the main conclusions are as follows in mountainous areas major chemical types of groundwater are ca hco3 ca na hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 water ice rock soil interactions such as the dissolution of feldspar minerals are the main factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution in these areas water near permafrost and faults is also affected by halite and calcite dissolution ground ice meltwater ice snow melt and precipitation are the main water sources in the cpnm the mtts range between 15 and 30 a and the r is less than 2 50 shallow groundwater is mainly recharged by deep groundwater ground ice meltwater and ice snow meltwater in the dpsm the mtts are less than 6 a and r is 10 15 groundwater in the dpsm is mainly recharged by precipitation and snow meltwater at similar altitudes the dpem exhibits spatial variability in the structure of groundwater recharge sources the mtts range between 5 and 24 a and the r value is 1 01 13 71 groundwater in the northern dpem is mainly fed by ground ice meltwater ice snow melt precipitation and lateral groundwater recharge groundwater in the southern dpem is recharged by precipitation in the nearby highlands and is more affected by water ice rock soil interactions the discharge mode of groundwater in mountainous areas is either surface overflow or local discharge which form springs or contribute to the surface water respectively in the valley plain the major chemical types of groundwater are ca mg hco3 and na ca hco3 the water is enriched with ions and isotopes the mtts range between 20 and 35 a and the r is below 2 the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater is affected by the weathering and dissolution of sodium bearing and dolomite minerals additionally evaporation concentration ion exchange and absorption of ions in groundwater in alpine meadows are also important factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution in these areas although groundwater is mainly recharged by upstream groundwater it can also be recharged by surface water and precipitation evaporation and discharge to surface water are the main discharge modes this study advances the understanding of alpine groundwater systems that control circulation and hydrochemical evolution however investigation of the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of solid state water in the alpine region has not been carried out additionally there is no long term groundwater level and flow data to further study the groundwater flow paths therefore long term and large scale future research on the groundwater cycle

8005,study region the nagqu river basin in the central part of the qinghai tibet plateau china study focus groundwater flow systems in permafrost regions are characterized by a unique circulation understanding the groundwater circulation mechanism is essential for studying the hydrological effect of permafrost degradation in alpine regions in this study potential water sources and origin of solutes in the groundwater of a typical alpine region were studied using hydrochemistry 18o 2h and 3h analyses this research is essential for studying the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation new hydrological insights for the region upon moving from the mountainous region to the plains the renewal rate decreases from 10 5 to 0 6 and the mean transit time increases from 5 30 to 20 32 years groundwater is mainly recharged by ground ice meltwater and infiltration of glacier meltwater snow meltwater and precipitation in mountainous areas and by deep groundwater near faults discharge to surface water evaporation and overflow into springs are the main drainage modes water ice rock soil interactions such as dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals are the main factors

qinghai tibet plateau data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction in recent decades climate warming has led to permafrost degradation at a global scale chadburn et al 2017 which has a significant impact on the hydrological cycle and alpine ecosystems karlsson et al 2012 cochand et al 2020 fortier et al 2020 the gradual degradation of permafrost may lead to the thickening of the active layer and collapse of drainage channels this can lead to an expansion of taliks which may promote hydraulic connectivity among supra permafrost water sub permafrost water and surface water wan et al 2019a 2019b the release of frozen soil moisture and increase in groundwater recharge areas may lead to changes in the groundwater recharge structure this in turn affects groundwater chemistry and reserves frey and mcclelland 2009 kurylyk and walvoord 2020 degradation of permafrost may aggravate the weathering of mineral soil bedrock and permafrost further the products of weathering and thawing can lead to an increased mineral signature of surface water and groundwater toohey et al 2016 the groundwater chemical composition is the result of long term interactions between water and its surrounding environment and is indicative of the environmental conditions therefore comprehensive studies on the hydrochemical evolution and groundwater flow paths in permafrost regions are of great significance for understanding how the water cycle is affected by climate change cochand et al 2019 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is known as one of the asian water tower in this area the thermal response of permafrost to global warming has reached depths greater than 30 m zhang et al 2020 this significantly changes the spatial temporal pattern and characteristic distribution of the groundwater flow system chang et al 2018 degradation of continuous permafrost leads to lower water yields and runoff and the increase in groundwater storage is insignificant in the extensive discontinuous permafrost area additional water from the ground ice melt water increases the runoff in the zones of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost the runoff recharged by groundwater and meltwater is reduced and the reduction of groundwater flow subsequently enhances the effect of evaporation gao et al 2019 jiang 2020 the nagqu river basin nrb is on the interior qtp and functions as the headwater area of the nu salween river dong et al 2018 the nrb also experiences extensive permafrost and seasonal frost the effects of ice and snow melt permafrost degradation changes in elevational distribution of alpine vegetation belts and enhanced evaporation rates in the past 50 years zou et al 2019 lin et al 2020 yang et al 2020d have led to an increase in groundwater recharge in high altitude regions this is also accompanied by an increase in natural discharge of groundwater in the relatively low altitude regions weng et al 2020 in recent years several studies have been carried out to determine hydrological responses to permafrost degradation in the qtp wang et al 2017 2020 qin et al 2020 sun et al 2020 compared with low altitude areas knowledge of hydrogeological processes in the nrb is limited owing to the difficulty of monitoring and data collection the highly heterogeneous nature of alpine areas is in contrast with its low data density in most existing studies the focus has been on hydrological systems which includes studying the evolution of surface water composition affected by climate change and determining the contribution of groundwater to rivers in regions of degrading permafrost using plankton indicators and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes chen et al 2018 weng et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the results show that snow and ice melt and groundwater are the main components of runoff in the nrb however the combined effects of climate warming and permafrost degradation on groundwater flow systems and hydro geochemistry in the nrb are less known groundwater is an important and secure long term resource for water supply and surface water recharge in the nrb man et al 2019 yang et al 2020c exploring the origin of solutes in groundwater and its potential recharge sources are important for studying the hydrological effect of permafrost degradation further this will provide guidance for avoiding an imbalance between water supply and utilization due to climate change and will also ensure the sustainable development and management of water resources of the upper nu salween river the aim of this study was to reveal the potential water sources and origin of solutes in groundwater in the nrb using chemical and isotopic tracers the specific goals were as follows 1 perform an integrated hydrogeochemical analysis to determine the groundwater types and main factors for affecting the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater 2 explore the potential water sources of groundwater using a multi tracer approach 3 quantify the groundwater renewal rate and groundwater mean transit time mtt in the flow system to analyze the groundwater renewal capacity and 4 clarify the relationship between groundwater renewal ability groundwater types and potential water sources 2 study region and methods 2 1 study area and hydrogeological units 2 1 1 study area the nrb is in the central part of the qtp fig 1a between 30 50 32 44 n and 91 08 93 01 e and covers a watershed area of 16 967 4 km2 yang et al 2021 the elevation of the nrb varies between 4140 and 5897 m above sea level a s l it acts as the headwater area of the nu salween river the nrb is in the semi arid climate zone weng et al 2020 it is affected by the south asian summer monsoon hence 88 of the annual total precipitation occurs from may to september deng and zhang 2018 the study area has an 180 day freezing period from october to next april yang et al 2020b the surface soil has a typical graded structure fine sand and clay in the upper part and coarse sand and gravel in the lower part and the main vegetation types are alpine grassland and meadow the study area is limited by the southern slopes of the tanggula mountains and the northern slope of the nyenchen tanglha mountains the mountains constituting the natural groundwater divide of the study area include the tanggula mountains in the north 4800 m a s l the nyenchen tanglha mountains in the south 4800 m a s l and the mountains in the east and west 4800 m a s l glaciers are located in the northeastern region of the basin covering an area of 3 53 km2 seasonal frost is widely distributed and accounts for about 72 of the nrb discontinuous permafrost is distributed in the north east and south zou et al 2017 affected by climate warming and human activities discontinuous permafrost is degrading into seasonal frost fig 1b groundwater is located in pores fissures and karst aquifers in the unconsolidated and clastic water bearing rocks of the basin fig 1c owing to the effect of the alpine climate bedrock fissure water which has an altitude of over 4650 m a s l is the aquifer type in the northern southern and eastern parts of the basin the geological structure of the study area is complex and composed of ew trending faults cut by nw ne and approximately ns directional faults under the action of river erosion and deposition large amounts of sediments have accumulated on the gently sloping land thus forming a valley plain the groundwater runoff from the exposed bedrock mountains varies in space and time with a clear seasonal pattern and is the primary supply of water to the valley plain the groundwater of the central valley plain is in the pores of loose rocks affected by the basal and hydrogeological structure the aquifer properties vary and the groundwater runoff is concentrated in the valley plains valley plains are not only the main accumulation zone water resources but are also the key locations for their development and utilization 2 1 2 hydrogeological units the landscape of the nrb can be divided into four units based on the altitude and permafrost distribution fig 1a 1 the continuous permafrost zone of the northern mountainous area cpnm it has an elevation exceeding 4650 m a s l which locally reaches 5500 m a s l and forms the northeastern boundary glaciers can be found in the northern cpnm 2 the area of seasonal frost of the valley plain sfp it has an average elevation of 4500 m a s l and is the main catchment area of the basin 3 the discontinuous permafrost zone of the southern mountainous area dpsm it has an elevation varying between 4700 and 5900 m a s l and forms the southern boundary of the basin 4 the discontinuous permafrost zone of the eastern mountainous area dpem it has an elevation varying between 4650 and 5900 m a s l and forms the eastern boundary of the basin 2 2 sampling sites and laboratory methods five field campaigns were conducted at the nrb research site between 2017 and 2020 water samples were collected from precipitation groundwater springs surface water lakes and ice and snow cover in several permafrost regions in total 66 river samples 65 groundwater samples 60 from wells and 5 from springs and 61 precipitation samples 42 from rain and 19 from snow were collected fig 1c shows the locations of all groundwater samples all samples were stored in 500 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were sealed with parafilm and capped then they were stored at 4 c prior to the analyses stable isotopes of water expressed as δ18o and δ2h were analyzed in all water samples in addition natural tracers including major ions ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl hco3 co3 2 and total alkalinity and nutrients nh4 no3 no2 total inorganic n and total inorganic p were measured in all water samples collected in 2019 and 2020 and tritium 3h was used for groundwater age dating water physicochemical parameters including the ph temperature electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in the field using a multi parameter probe ysi pro plus to verify the quality of the experiments 10 of the samples were used for duplicate measurements the δ18o and δ2h measurements were carried out using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds and a picarro l2130 i water isotope analyzer the analytical precision was 0 025 and 0 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the results are presented as delta notation δ relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow per mil which compares the heavy and light isotope ratios of a sample the 3h concentration of the water samples was determined using a liquid scintillation counting spectrometer tri carb 3170tr sl the data are presented as absolute values in tritium units tu with a total analytical uncertainty of less than 0 4 tu concentrations of total dissolved solids tds were determined by summing the concentrations of cations and anions 2 3 calculation methods 2 3 1 3h concentration series of precipitation reconstruction precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge therefore estimating the 3h concentration in the precipitation is crucial for determining the input function for the calculation models affolter et al 2020 lászló et al 2020 knowledge of the temporal and spatial distribution of 3h in precipitation is limited in the nrb doney et al 1992 used factor analysis to develop a global model function for distribution of 3h concentration in precipitation from 1960 to 1986 and reported two factor scores and coefficient maps doney et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 improved the factor analysis method and made the model applicable to specific stations and unnormalized observations in this study the factor analysis method was selected to recover the precipitation 3h concentration series in the nrb from long term continuous measurements of the 3h concentration in regions near the study area table 1 these included the hong kong lhasa and zhangye stations the 3h time series data were obtained from the international atomic energy agency iaea the recovered precipitation 3h concentration time series at the study area is shown in fig 2 2 3 2 mean transit time calculation the concept for the groundwater tritium based age classification system is based on an understanding of how concentrations of 3h in groundwater vary given the temporal variation of 3h in precipitation the groundwater recharged prior to 1953 is considered as premodern water and recharged in 1953 or later is considered as modern water the determination methods of 3h thresholds of modern water and premodern water are as follows 1 the modern threshold is set at the minimum post peak concentration of decayed 3h in precipitation and it is considered that 3h concentrations in modern water are higher than the threshold 2 the premodern threshold is set at the 3h concentration after decay from 1952 to the sampling date and it is considered that 3h concentrations in premodern water are no more than the threshold and 3 concentrations of 3h in groundwater that are between the premodern and modern thresholds are considered mixed lindsey et al 2019 according to the 3h concentration series of precipitation the thresholds of modern water and premodern water in nrb are 0 34 tu and 1 81 tu respectively in this study 3h activities were used in conjunction with lumped parameter models lpms implemented in the tracerlpm version 1 1 0 to investigate the mean transit times mtts jurgens et al 2016 the lpm solves for the transit time distribution model parameters i e mean age and mixing parameter by matching the observed tracer concentration at a given time with the predicted tracer concentration obtained by the convolution of the tracer input history tracer decay and an analytical weighting function hagedorn et al 2018 in previous studies of using lpms different weighting functions were applied these included the piston flow model the exponential model and the exponential piston flow model the groundwater in the nrb is recharged by lateral runoff and vertical infiltration of precipitation which is composed of exponential flow and piston flow the exponential piston flow model jurgens et al 2016 was used in this study 2 3 3 groundwater renewal rate determination the well mixed reservoir model has been proven as a useful tool in the estimation of groundwater renewal rates using 3h content in groundwater salle et al 2001 cheng et al 2017 li et al 2019c based on the principle of mass balance and the assumption that the groundwater supplied in different years is completely mixed in the groundwater system and including radioisotope decay an empirical equation can be used for calculating the 3h concentration of groundwater salle et al 2001 1 a g i 1 r i a g i 1 e λ r i a o i 2 r i r p i p m where i is the calculation year a g i is 3h concentration tu in the groundwater in year i a g i 1 is the 3h concentration tu in year i 1 a o i is the 3h concentration tu of water recharge in year i λ is the decay constant 3h 0 055764 a 1 r i is the annual renewal rate of groundwater in year i r is the mean annual renewal rate p i mm is annual precipitation and p m mm is annual mean precipitation the calculation years ranged from 1953 before atmospheric nuclear explosions to 2019 before 1952 the 3h concentration in precipitation was assumed constant at 10 tu a 0 clark and fritz 1997 thomas and rose 2003 gleeson et al 2015 subsequently the 3h concentration in groundwater in 1952 was calculated as follows 3 a g1952 a 0 λ r 1 combining the restored 3h concentration series of precipitation the 3h output concentration a g of the groundwater corresponding to the different groundwater renewal rates r in 2019 was calculated with eq 1 this was then used to generate the curve representing the correlation between a g and r for the study area 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical composition during the thawing period fig 3 shows the variation of the major ion hydrochemistry for different water samples the methods for graphical representation and interpretation of the major ions are based on piper diagrams piper 1944 in most of the groundwater samples hco3 and ca2 are the dominant anions and cations respectively the tds concentration of well water is generally low ranging from 98 2 to 793 mg l with an average of 296 mg l the ph values range from 6 94 to 8 21 the major chemical types of groundwater are ca hco3 ca na hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 in mountain areas whereas they are ca mg hco3 and na ca hco3 in the plain areas the groundwater samples near the fault and permafrost of mountain areas show higher tds along with higher mg2 na and so4 2 the groundwater in the sfp showed lower so4 2 concentration than in the mountain areas and the concentrations of mg2 so4 2 and tds increased along the flow path spring samples represent na hco3 and na ca hco3 water with tds concentrations ranging from 381 to 3 76 103 mg l in most surface water samples anions are dominated by hco3 and so4 2 these samples have higher so4 2 concentrations and lower hco3 and cl contents than those of the groundwater samples the cations are dominated by ca2 and mg2 these samples have higher mg2 and lower ca2 and na concentrations than those of the groundwater samples the major water types in the tributaries are ca mg hco3 na ca mg hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 the main stream has a higher concentration of tds na cl and so4 2 than that in the tributaries and the main water type is na ca mg hco3 the ph values range from 7 43 to 8 83 thus representing mildly alkaline water when compared with the groundwater and spring water the precipitation is characterized by relatively low tds and ph values and the chemical compositions of precipitation surface water and groundwater are relatively constant in space the cl and na values are highest in groundwater followed by surface water and precipitation these results reﬂect increases in the cl and na concentrations with increasing water transformation from input to output 3 2 stable isotope characteristics the δ 2h and δ 18o data analyzed in this work are presented in the δ 2h δ 18o space in fig 4 since precipitation is the initial input analyzing the δ 2h and δ 18o isotopes of precipitation is important for studying the formation and evolution of surface water and groundwater the 61 precipitation samples collected in different seasons from 2017 to 2020 exhibited large variations in isotopic compositions and had δ 2h values ranging from 212 21 to 4 53 and δ 18o values varying from 26 93 to 2 11 the mean values i e δ 18o of 16 64 and δ 2h of 124 30 are most likely to be representative of the present local precipitation the mean values of δ 18o and δ 2h in snow 12 90 and 90 00 respectively are more abundant than those in rainfall 18 34 and 139 80 respectively these data lie close to the global meteoric water line gmwl and can be defined as the local meteoric water line lmwl δ 2h 7 57δ 18o 1 73 the δ 18o and δ 2h values of the well water varying from 17 59 to 11 21 and from 139 36 to 93 00 respectively and thus fall to the bottom right of the lmwl the mean δ 18o and δ 2h values 15 27 and 117 17 respectively are higher than those of spring water δ 18o 18 72 and δ 2h 147 35 the slope of the groundwater line gwl δ 2h 7 78 δ 18o 1 31 is slightly greater than that of the lmwl which infers that precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge the drastic revaporization during infiltration may lead to isotopic fractionation resulting in deviation hence mixing of different waterbodies and water rock isotopic exchange reactions may be alternative factors affecting the variations in the h and o isotopic compositions in relation to the lmwl the δ 18o values of the surface water vary from 17 80 to 10 18 and the δ2h values range from 138 53 to 79 05 the mean values plot on the lmwl δ 18o 14 464 and δ 2h 111 37 these results suggest that the stable isotopic composition of surface waters originates from precipitation the δ 18o and δ 2h values of surface water samples are mainly distributed toward the bottom right of the gmwl and lmwl furthermore the deviation of the surface water line swl δ 2h 5 99 δ 18o 24 67 from the lmwl is greater than that of groundwater samples and it increases with decreasing altitude the spatial distributions of stable isotope compositions of surface water and groundwater are consistent which indicates a strong interaction between surface water and groundwater within the watershed from northwest to southeast the stable isotopes gradually become more depleted the cpnm region with faults and permafrost is most abundant in δ 18o and δ 2h in the dpem and dpsm the areas with faults have higher stable isotope concentrations than in areas without this indicates that groundwater may be recharged by deep groundwater in the large fault zones the δ 18o and δ 2h values of groundwater in the sfp area gradually decrease along the groundwater flow path thus indicating the presence of water with low stable isotope concentrations recharging the groundwater 3 3 mean transit time and renewal rate determination by 3h the estimated results are shown in table 2 the 3h concentrations of the spring water are less than 1 3 tu thus indicating that the spring water is a mix of modern and premodern water the groundwater in the watershed has 3h concentrations ranging from 2 7 0 4 to 10 1 0 4 tu this indicates that the groundwater in the nrb is modern water in the dpsm and southern dpem with discontinuous permafrost the 3h concentrations in groundwater are between 9 5 and 10 1 tu the r ranges from 10 to 15 and the mtt is less than 6 a however the 3h concentrations in the mountainous areas cpnm and northern dpem were between 3 4 and 5 8 tu with an r value below 2 50 and an mtt of 15 30 a in the valley plains with season frost the 3h concentrations range from 2 7 to 5 7 tu and the r is below 2 and the mtt ranges from 20 to 35 a the renewal rate of the groundwater increases with increasing altitude it can be concluded that groundwater is indeed recharged by modern water at high elevations the flow paths are mainly controlled by the topography i e by horizontal runoff glacial meltwater and the recharge of sub permafrost water from taliks or faults may be responsible for the lower 3h concentration of the groundwater in the continuous permafrost areas as compared with that of the discontinuous permafrost areas 4 discussion 4 1 transformation mechanism of groundwater ions as mentioned above hydrogeochemical composition in mountainous regions and valley plains show different characteristics it is thus important to explore the reasons for these differences during recharge and discharge in different regions a gibbs schematic diagram gibbs 1970 was used to explore the hydrochemical evolution of precipitation surface water and groundwater fig 5 shows that the na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 ratios of most of the groundwater and surface water samples have a wide range they are distributed with the control lines of rock dominance which reflects that water ice rock soil interactions are the main controlling factors for the hydrochemical evolution the spring evolves from rock dominance to evaporation concentrating dominance the na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 ratios of the groundwater in mountainous areas cpnm dpem and dpsm are relatively lower than those in the valley plain groundwater with high tds and cl concentrations can be attributed to the long migration path of groundwater containing prominent water ice rock soil interactions additionally higher ionic ratios of the groundwater on the valley plain may also be attributed to evaporation and to the exchange and absorption of ions in groundwater of alpine meadows li and gao 2019 li et al 2019b the gaillardet and ion proportion coefficient diagrams were drawn to explore the effect of water ice rock soil interactions on the groundwater chemistry yang et al 2020a the main sources of ions in water are divided into evaporite dissolution i e halite gypsum and chemical weathering of silicates i e feldspar ca plagioclase and olivine and carbonate i e calcite and dolomite rock li et al 2020b the ratios of ca2 na and mg2 na were used to distinguish the effect of dilution and evaporation on hydrochemistry fig 6a shows that from mountainous regions to valley plains the transformation from carbonate to silicate rocks and to evaporites is the main influencing factor of hydrochemical composition evolution for either surface waters or groundwater well and spring waters are more affected by evaporite dissolution than surface water the ratio of na cl concentrations is often used to explain evaporite dissolution as shown in fig 6b the na cl ratios for most of groundwater samples are much higher than 1 hence in addition to halite groundwater also dissolves other sodium containing minerals such as aluminosilicates ca2 in water may also exchange with na in soil therefore the concentration of na may become higher than that of cl however the na cl ratios of water samples near permafrost and faults in mountainous areas are 1 which suggests that na and cl originate from halite dissolution the na ca2 and mg2 ca2 ratios were used to explain the source of chemical weathering in carbonate rock li et al 2020b low ratios suggest that the hydrochemical composition is due to the dissolution of calcite whereas high ratios indicate that the hydrochemical composition originates from the dissolution of dolomite as shown in fig 6c the ratios of na ca2 and mg2 ca2 of the groundwater and surface water on the valley plain are much higher than the 1 1 line this indicates that they are mainly affected by dolomite weathering and dissolution however the ratios in water near permafrost and faults in mountainous areas are low and mainly concentrated near the 1 1 line thus indicating that the hydrochemical composition is affected by calcite the ca2 mg2 so4 2 ratio is often used to represent the dissolution of carbonate and aluminosilicate minerals in groundwater systems since the ratios of all samples are greater than 1 fig 6d the results indicate that the chemical composition of the groundwater is mainly dominated by the dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals the ratio of ca2 mg2 to ca2 mg2 na k is applied to explain the effects of various minerals liu et al 2016 li et al 2019a on the valley plain the ratios in water are mainly concentrated in the lower right of the 1 2 line whereas the opposite trend can be observed in mountainous areas this elucidates that the hydrochemical composition of groundwater is affected by ca plagioclase and olivine dissolution in the valley plain and by feldspar dissolution in mountainous areas figs 6e and 6f 4 2 recharge of groundwater along the flow path groundwater recharge components in alpine areas can generally be divided into five types 1 precipitation recharge 2 glacier snow and ground ice meltwater recharge 3 surface water recharge i e temporary or seasonal and perennial stream infiltration recharge 4 mountain block recharge spatially distributed subsurface inflow and 5 groundwater inflow that occurs along discrete permeable geologic features such as faults since different water sources produce completely different temporal and spatial responses to climate change it is necessary to distinguish the potential sources of groundwater in different regions markovich et al 2021 in groundwater systems major ion hydrochemistry and stable isotope signatures of individual samples are primarily a reﬂection of its source water mixture and ﬂow paths kpegli et al 2018 moran et al 2019 mtt and recharge rates reflect the length and mean velocity of the groundwater flow paths the multi tracer approach can be used to comprehensively analyze the potential sources of groundwater in the cpnm the supra permafrost water is enriched with stable isotopes and dissolved ions and the mtts are longer than those in the dpsm in high altitude mountainous areas however they are shorter than those in the sfp this indicates that precipitation is not the only recharge mechanism in the cpnm area further the cpnm region is closer to the glaciers and to the water transmitted faults these results indicate that the ground ice near the permafrost table of the qtp is characterized by high stable isotope concentrations and salinity wang et al 2018 2019 gao et al 2020 hence ground ice is more enriched than the groundwater value in the nrb under a warming climate continuous permafrost thaws extensively and ice and snow melt intensively hence resulting in ground ice melt water with sufficient water ice rock soil interactions that recharge the supra permafrost water this ultimately leads to higher tds δ 18o and δ 2h in addition supra permafrost water may be recharged by the deep groundwater flowing through the fault which is characterized by higher ions and lower 3h content in the dpsm the hydrochemical types and stable isotopic characteristics of the groundwater surface water and precipitation are similar the terrain significantly fluctuates and the mountains on both sides are inclined to the river channel therefore groundwater may discharge to the river but it is rarely supplied by the river groundwater especially near unstable permafrost is more enriched in cl and heavy isotopes than the surface water and rainfall due to ground ice and snow melt recharge discontinuous permafrost limits the vertical movement of supra permafrost water thus resulting in short mtts and a high r subsequently it leads to limited water ice rock soil interactions thus groundwater is also recharged by precipitation at similar altitudes the undulating terrain provides suitable conditions for supra permafrost water to overflow upwards to the surface li et al 2020a subsequent to land overflow concentration the brook converges with glacier meltwater and here the precipitation and snow water contribute to the surface water yang et al 2021 in the dpem the spatial variations of hydrochemistry and isotopes δ 18o δ 2h and 3h are significant the δ 18o and δ 2h concentrations decrease from north to south while the tds and 3h concentrations increase this can be attributed to a structural change in the groundwater recharge source structure the tds δ 18o and δ 2h concentrations of the northern dpem with unstable permafrost are slightly lower than those of the cpnm it can be speculated that the groundwater in the northern dpem is recharged by precipitation and ground ice and snow meltwater lower δ 18o and δ 2h along with shorter residence times of the groundwater are found in the southern dpem indicate that the location of the recharge area is relatively close however the tds concentration is relatively high which cannot be explained with natural variability in modern precipitation it can be inferred that the groundwater is recharged by precipitation in the nearby highlands and is strongly affected by evaporation and water ice rock soil interactions in the sfp the groundwater lacks 3h and is enriched with 18o and dissolved ions as compared with other regions in the nrb west to east trending faults are distributed in the sfp which provide channels for preferential groundwater flow deep hot springs and groundwater wells with a large water yield are distributed close to these hydrogeological faults hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater and surface water are similar whereas there is a small difference of precipitation in different regions this can be attributed to the altitude effect of isotopes this indicates that precipitation is not the only source of recharge in the plains high mtts and low r values confirm that the groundwater is recharged by upstream and deep groundwater rather than by local precipitation groundwater is enriched in cl na and tds because evaporation and duration of water ice rock soil interactions increases with increasing flow path lengths ion exchange and the uptake of groundwater by vegetation such as in alpine meadows may also affect the groundwater hydrochemistry and stable isotopes rao et al 2020 generally it can be inferred that groundwater in the sfp is mainly recharged by groundwater from the upstream mountainous area in addition it is also recharged by deep groundwater along the faults during migration and infiltration groundwater is subject to evaporation and water ice rock soil interactions the main drainage mode of groundwater which is partially discharged to surface waters is evaporation springs are formed due to overflow at the intersection of aquitards and the ground surface 5 conclusions environmental tracers including major ions stable isotopes and 3h were used in this study to characterize groundwater flow in a basin within a discontinuous permafrost zone in the qtp nrb in china groundwater in the nrb is affected by the altitude hydrogeological faults and permafrost distribution it is characterized by unique circulation and hydrochemical evolution the main conclusions are as follows in mountainous areas major chemical types of groundwater are ca hco3 ca na hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 water ice rock soil interactions such as the dissolution of feldspar minerals are the main factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution in these areas water near permafrost and faults is also affected by halite and calcite dissolution ground ice meltwater ice snow melt and precipitation are the main water sources in the cpnm the mtts range between 15 and 30 a and the r is less than 2 50 shallow groundwater is mainly recharged by deep groundwater ground ice meltwater and ice snow meltwater in the dpsm the mtts are less than 6 a and r is 10 15 groundwater in the dpsm is mainly recharged by precipitation and snow meltwater at similar altitudes the dpem exhibits spatial variability in the structure of groundwater recharge sources the mtts range between 5 and 24 a and the r value is 1 01 13 71 groundwater in the northern dpem is mainly fed by ground ice meltwater ice snow melt precipitation and lateral groundwater recharge groundwater in the southern dpem is recharged by precipitation in the nearby highlands and is more affected by water ice rock soil interactions the discharge mode of groundwater in mountainous areas is either surface overflow or local discharge which form springs or contribute to the surface water respectively in the valley plain the major chemical types of groundwater are ca mg hco3 and na ca hco3 the water is enriched with ions and isotopes the mtts range between 20 and 35 a and the r is below 2 the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater is affected by the weathering and dissolution of sodium bearing and dolomite minerals additionally evaporation concentration ion exchange and absorption of ions in groundwater in alpine meadows are also important factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution in these areas although groundwater is mainly recharged by upstream groundwater it can also be recharged by surface water and precipitation evaporation and discharge to surface water are the main discharge modes this study advances the understanding of alpine groundwater systems that control circulation and hydrochemical evolution however investigation of the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of solid state water in the alpine region has not been carried out additionally there is no long term groundwater level and flow data to further study the groundwater flow paths therefore long term and large scale future research on the groundwater cycle

8006,the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission and its follow on mission grace follow on can accurately track the earth s mass variations which have been successfully used in various geoscience researches related to global and regional hydrological process in this study satellite gravimetry grace and gracr follow on and hydrological model gldas are used to estimate the tws variations over lbb in 2003 2020 as the world s largest freshwater lake by volume the terrestrial water storage tws variations in lake baikal basin lbb significantly affect the surrounding ecological environment however the spatial scale of lbb is relatively small when compared to approximately 300 km spatial resolution of grace and grace follow on mission therefore the forward modeling method is used to alleviate the leakage errors during satellite gravimetry data processing to assess the performance of forward modeling method a close loop simulation study is designed in noise contaminated condition the simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of forward modeling method in accurately estimating tws variations over lbb after appropriate leakage correction the inter annual tws from satellite gravimetry agrees well with gldas the tws variations over lbb demonstrate that 1 there are drastic variations and periodic characteristics around 4 5 years and the drought events are observed in 2003 2007 2011 and 2015 as relatively smaller twss 2 the soil moisture and groundwater are the major contributors to tws variations with the correlation coefficient of 0 88 and 0 89 and the surface water is the main contributor to the seasonal variations over lbb 3 the tws presents about 6 moths delay to precipitation variations while the precipitation is still the major driver to affect the hydrological processes over this region keywords lake baikal basin grace grace follow on terrestrial water storage forward modeling method gldas cru 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws represents the summation of groundwater snow water soil moisture surface water and canopy water since the tws is a major component in the hydrological cycle monitoring tws variations is helpful for deeply exploring the hydrological and meteorological issues relevant to water budget tapley et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 pan et al 2017 as the largest freshwater lake in the world lake baikal holds more 20 of the world s total fresh water resource therefore it is one of the precious freshwater resources of human beings as observed by törnqvist et al 2014 the temperature in lake baikal region raises nearly twice as fast warming as the global average in 1938 2009 and it predicts an obvious further future warming implying continued permafrost thaw in the last few decades the precipitation has slightly increased and the land cover has also changed significantly in lbb dorjsuren et al 2018a the special geographical location and various hydro meteorological characteristic of lbb have drawn the attention to numerous scientists in the past decades shimaraev et al 2019 bondarenko et al 2019 izmest eva et al 2016 timoshkin et al 2018 however these studies mostly focus on the natural ecological environment changes and the state of water quality of lake baikal region but they scarcely study the tws variations in this region due to the semi arid climates in lbb its tws variations significantly affect the surrounding ecological environment moreover the water storages in baikal lake region already become unstable due to the severe climate changes therefore it is greatly significant to accurately explore the tws variations in lbb before the development of spatial geodesy the seasonal terrestrial water cycle at medium and long spatial scales is rarely known several techniques of monitoring tws variations include situ observations remote sensing and global hydrological model these traditional observation methods have intrinsic disadvantages for instance the traditional ground observation stations can directly obtain the long term changes of local hydrological signals zhou et al 2016 while they are limited by observation conditions e g mountains and deserts resulting in uneven spatial distribution the traditional altimetry satellites and remote sensing satellites can only monitor surface water changes and shallow soil moisture content xiong et al 2021 while the variations of deep soil moisture and groundwater are difficultly tracked the hydrological models can effectively describe the water cycle process but the models have great uncertainties and need to be verified by other observation data scanlon et al 2018 in contrast to traditional techniques the grace mission and grace follow on grace fo mission provide the unprecedented observations to monitor spatial temporal mass redistribution in terms of tws variations tapley et al 2004 ciracì et al 2020 which vertically integrate water storage variations from the surface water to the deepest aquifers the application of grace and grace fo have made a creative contribution to the study of global and regional hydrological cycle and environmental changes in hydrology geology and oceanology e g andersen et al 2005 chen et al 2009 famiglietti and rodell 2013 morishita and heki 2008 zhang et al 2015 yi et al 2016 ciracì et al 2020 the typical application scopes include the mass variations in polar glaciers e g chen et al 2007 velicogna and wahr 2006 syed et al 2007 ocean e g chen et al 2005 leuliette and miller 2009 and terrestrial water storage variations at global or basin scales e g chen et al 2009 luo et al 2016 huang et al 2012 li et al 2016 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 over the land the mass variations from grace and grace fo estimates include all hydrological factors such as surface water soil moisture groundwater snow water and canopy water however grace grace fo temporal gravity field models are contaminated by noise accurately quantitative measuring surface mass changes from grace grace fo is still challenging during processing grace grace fo spherical harmonic sh solutions it is necessary to suppress noise in high degree shs chen et al 2016a 2016b therefore the sh coefficients are truncated to a certain order and spatial filtering is essential however the limited shs and additional spatial filtering inevitably cause biased grace estimates the errors caused by these post processing procedures are collectively called leakage errors wahr et al 1998 swenson and wahr 2002 on the one hand the leakage errors refer to the signal leakage from the aimed area to the outside of the aimed area and on the other hand the signal leakage from the outside of the aimed area to the inside of the aimed area they are collectively known as signal leakage klees et al 2007 in order to estimate accurately twss in a target area it is necessary to apply some additional operators to reduce leakage errors here several leakage error reduction operators are summarized wahr et al 1998 first proposed the method of dividing signals into land signals and ocean signals commonly referred to as signal separation method however this method is generally used to explore the global sea water mass changes and to deduct the leakage errors from land to sea landerer and swenson 2012 proposed a scale factor method based on signal distribution characteristics in hydrological models this method can provide the scale factor in grid scale or in a specific basin scale which has been widely used to global or regional studies e g tangdamrongsub et al 2016 long et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2013 chen et al 2014 proposed a forward modeling method to restore the leaked signal and it has been applied to study the sea level changes and regional tws variations e g chen et al 2015 2016a 2016b 2017 in contrast to the scale factor method which is entirely relying on prior hydrological models the forward modeling method does not require any external prior information notably the leakage correction is accurately estimated when the forward modeling method is applied in the special areas where the geographical locations of the signal changes are distinguishable and the local signal is dominant chen et al 2015 2017 as the local temporal signal over lbb is dominant we use the forward modeling method to reduce the leakage errors during grace grace f o data processing the forward modeling method has been widely used in various geoscience applications jin and zou 2015 re estimated the glacier mass loss in greenland from grace by correcting the land ocean leakage errors based on the forward modeling method ni et al 2017 estimated the tws variations of lake volta from grace observations and the grace estimations show excellent consistency with those derived from satellite altimetry observations yi et al 2017 investigated the tws variations in the longyangxia reservoir which demonstrates the great potential of grace estimates in monitoring water storage changes in such a small reservoir in addition wu et al 2015 tangdamrongsub et al 2016 and zhou et al 2018 also demonstrate the great performances of forward modeling method in reducing leakage errors over typical small basins however the performance of forward modeling method over lbb has never been assessed therefore we design a close loop and noise contaminated simulation environment to evaluate the performance of forward modeling method over lbb and then quantify the tws variations to understand the characteristic of hydrological processes over this region according to previous researches in global and regional scale the climate changes and human activities are the two main drivers to affect the hydrological processes hampton et al 2008 malsy et al 2017 the natural climate factors are commonly the main reason of the total tws variations which dominate the trends of water storages in large scale basins human activities not only have direct impacts on tws variations in basin scale but also have magnifying effects on the changes of natural factors for instance the increase of population leads to the expansion of agricultural land minderlein and menzel 2015 karthe et al 2015 and the expansion of agriculture and the augment of irrigative demand results in the increase of water utilization in recent decades the consumption of water resources in lbb has significantly increased due to the increase of mongolia s population karthe et al 2017 dorjsuren et al 2018b however as lake baikal basin is located in the sensitive area of global climate changes the tws variations in this region may be still seriously affected by the natural climate changes the driving factors of tws variations in this region are still unclear therefore for the first time we accurately estimate the driving factors of tws variations over lbb which may provide guidance on local freshwater management the purposes of this study are to 1 validate the performance of the forward modeling method in lbb by a close loop simulation study 2 estimate tws variations over lbb between 2003 and 2020 using grace grace fo and gldas hydrological model 3 analyze the main driver of tws variations over lbb based on meteorological data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area lake baikal basin is located in the middle of eurasia which is a cross border basin between mongolia and russia see fig 1 lake baikal has 336 rivers flowing into the lake covering an area of water catchment of 560 000 km2 the main inflows include the selenga the barguzin and the upper angara however these is only one outflow i e the angara of lake baikal there are large diurnal and annual temperature difference in lake baikal basin moreover this region has a continental climate with cold and long winters the basin boundary is defined following the global runoff data centre grdc a summary of the geographical and climatic characteristics about this region can be seen in table 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace and grace follow on the center for space research csr german research centre for geosciences gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl release 06 monthly gravity field solution product are used to calculate the tws from january 2003 to december 2020 over lbb the three sh products are all processed as follows firstly the c1 coefficients are provided by swenson et al 2008 and the c20 coefficients are replaced by cheng and tapley 2004 secondly the long term mean of spherical harmonic coefficients shc is removed and then the gaussian filter is used to suppress the high frequency noise and the de correlation filter is used to reduce the correlated errors in grace grace fo data swenson and wahr 2006 finally the tws variations are calculated following wahr et al 1998 meanwhile the forward modeling method is applied to alleviate leakage errors furthermore the csr release 06 monthly mascon product save 2020 is used to validate our estimates via sh solutions grace gracr fo mascon solutions reduce the temporal noise during gravity inversion process which need no additional post processing steps such as gaussian filtering and de correlation filtering save et al 2012 2016 watkins et al 2015 chen et al 2017 note that grace grace fo mascon solutions offer improved spatial resolution relative to sh solutions but its leakage errors still need to be appropriately processed in order to accurately estimate regional mass changes schrama et al 2014 the long term mean of mascon estimates is also removed 2 2 2 gldas hydrology model the gldas 2 1 global hydrology model is used to calculate the hydrological components variations and tws variations over lbb in this paper its results are expected to prove the tws estimates from grace grace fo data at present there are four land surface models driven by the gldas which include noah variable infiltration capacity vic community land model clm and catchment land surface model clsm rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 unlike others the clsm in gldas simulates the shallow groundwater changes in lbb the groundwater changes may seriously affect the local hydrological cycle therefore the clsm datasets of gldas are used in this study 2 2 3 altimetry data we use the hydrolare product to calculate water level changes of lake baikal the hydrolare data derive from the international data centre on hydrology of lakes and reservoirs it is produced by the state hydrological institute in russia crétaux et al 2011 currently this product has offered hydrological data of the world big lakes and reservoirs e g the water level variations and surface volume variations 2 2 4 climatic research unit we use the gridded climatic research unit cru climate data 0 5 0 5 in 2003 2019 to investigate climate characteristics over lbb in this study including temperature and precipitation changes the cru product belongs to the monthly gridded data which is established by the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia harris et al 2020 it derives from the world s observation data of weather stations by reprocessing this datasets are usually employed to study climatic and meteorological changes whose variables include precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and vapor pressure etc 2 3 methods since the publicly available grace grace fo shc products contain high frequency errors the spatial filters are usually applied to suppress these errors during calculating twss however the application of spatial filters will lead to the spatial leakage errors as shown in fig 2 we use simulated data to demonstrate how the leakage errors formed during postprocessing fig 2a is a simulated original signal in lake baikal basin fig 2b is obtained by spherical harmonic expansion with limited truncation order 60 compared with fig 2a the signals in fig 2b leak out of the region and the signals inside the region are also weakened fig 2c and fig 2d are respectively obtained by applying the 300 km gaussian smoothing and 500 km gaussian smoothing to fig 2b as shown in fig 2c and fig 2d the signals further leak out of the region and the signals inside the region is further weakened the larger radius of gaussian smoothing is applied and the larger leakage errors are observed as shown above spherical harmonic truncation error and additional gaussian smoothing during grace data processing inevitably lead to leakage errors therefore an important problem to be solved in processing the grace sh solutions is to correct reasonably the leakage errors in this paper similar to the approach presented chen et al 2015 and zhou et al 2018 the forward modeling method is applied to mitigate the sh solutions leakage errors the details of this method are shown in fig 3 1 after the de correlation filtering and gaussian filtering are applied to the original shcs product results from section 3 1 the observed tws twsobs can be obtained these parameters setting of filtering methods can be determined after simulation study 2 in the first loop the initial value of candidate tws called tws candidate is set to the twsobs moreover the tws candidate is set to zero outside the aimed region and then the new tws candidate is converted into shcs within limited degrees and orders similar to 1 the same gaussian filtering is used to obtain the predicted tws twspre 3 the δt is obtained by calculating the difference between observed tws and predicted tws here the stopping criterion can be achieved by setting a threshold α or the number of iterations if this criterion is met the iteration will stop otherwise a new iteration will continue and the candidate tws will be also updated in this study we achieve the stopping criterion by setting the number of iterations following the recommendation of chen et al 2013 an acceleration factor is used to δt when reaching the stopping criterion the twsobs is generally consistent with the twspre since the twspre is obtained by the same filter as twsobs the tws candidate can be regarded as the true signal that is not affected by leakage errors to evaluate the performance of forward modeling method in lbb we set a simulation study under noise contaminated condition in the simulation study the full noise components including instrument noise and model errors are included the way to add the noise into the spherical harmonic coefficients shcs is similar to those presented in zhou et al 2019 2020 2021 the earth system model esm is taken as the true temporal signal dobslaw et al 2016 the noise contaminated earth system model esm is retrieved by a close loop simulation which includes a forward procedure and a backward procedure fig 4 in the forward procedure the observations contain the information to true background geophysical models and the instrument noise in the backward procedure all of the geophysical signals except for temporal signals are removed note that the static field ocean tide and de aliasing product in the backward procedure are different from those in forward procedure in this way the background model errors are fully considered which are similar to those in the real grace data processing procedure based on these observations the noise contaminated temporal model is determined via a standard least square adjustment theoretically the noise contaminated model contains the esm his temporal signals we therefore can use this model to assess the performance of different filtering approaches or leakage correction approaches more results about this simulation study are shown in section 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of forward modeling method there are unavoidable leakage errors during calculating twss via gauss filtered shs to alleviate the leakage errors the forward modeling method is applied in this study to assess the performance of forward modeling method over lbb a simulation study in noise contaminated condition is implemented as shown in fig 5 with the increase of iterations there is an obvious decrease in terms of root mean square rms of residuals between twsobs and twspre the rmss are smaller than 0 02 cm which indicate a good convergence in forward modeling process the convergent result also implies that the number of iterations as 50 is sufficient to assess the performance of forward modeling method in spatial domain we compare the observed twss twsobs predicted twss twspre and their discrepancies over lbb fig 6 fig 6a shows the twsobs which are calculated by applying 500 km gaussian smoothing and p3m6 de correlation filtering to simulated original signal fig 6b is the twspre derived from forward modeling process and fig 6c shows the difference between fig 6a and fig 6b the distributions of twspre are almost identical to that of twsobs meanwhile the mean discrepancies as shown in fig 6c are all smaller than 0 02 cm which are less than 1 2 of the signal amplitude of twspre and twsobs the identical spatial distribution and small discrepancies demonstrate the good performance of forward modeling method in reducing leakage errors over lbb according to the simulation study the twss over lbb present notable differences in amplitude variations before and after applying forward modeling method fig 7a and table 2 meanwhile the simulated true tws variations and four leakage corrected twss series present good consistency in fig 7b which demonstrates the reliability of forward modeling method in retrieving temporal signals over lbb in addition the key issues of implementing forward modeling method are the radius of gaussian filter and the necessity of applying de correlation filter according to the results in fig 7b and table 2 applying gaussian filters with different radius lead to similar results based on the statistics in table 2 we finally select the forward modeling method with 500 km gauss filter and p3m6 de correlation filter as the optimal processing strategy for further analysis 3 2 estimating tws variations based on grace grace fo data since the performance of forward modeling method is good over lbb we use this method to calculate the tws variations respectively based on gfz jpl and csr release 06 sh products fig 8 the tws variations derived from three agencies jpl gfz and csr are compared in fig 8a and the corresponding inter annual tws variations are presented in fig 8b generally the results derived from three different agencies are in good consistency in terms of original or inter annual tws variations however it should be noted that there are obvious discrepancies between gfz estimations and those derived from other two agencies meanwhile since the jpl estimations are almost identical to csr estimations with a correlation coefficient of 0 90 we are confident to only use csr estimations to monitor the tws variations over lbb in our subsequent research to verify the sh estimates we also calculate twss in lbb from grace grace fo mascon estimates fig 9 as shown in fig 9b the mascon results show slight larger magnitudes than the sh estimates without forward modeling confirming the relatively less leakage errors of mascon solutions when compared to conventional sh solutions meanwhile the magnitude of mascon estimates is significantly smaller than the leakage corrected sh estimates via forward modeling method it demonstrates that the mascon estimates over lbb are also affected by leakage errors to correct the leakage errors of mascon estimates the similar processing procedure as chen et al 2017 is applied here after applying appropriate leakage corrections the corrected estimates fluctuate obviously larger than the corresponding uncorrected time series no matter for grace grace fo spherical harmonic sh results fig 9a or mascon mc results fig 9b the results shown in fig 9 demonstrate the necessity of applying appropriate leakage corrected operator for tws estimations over lbb after reallocating all mascon grids within 200 km from the boundary of the lbb into the lbb the leakage corrected mascon results show an obvious overall decreasing trend when compared to sh solutions which may be caused by the different processing algorithms for mascon and sh solutions to eliminate the contribution of the long term change of hydrological signal the linear trend of sh and mascon estimates are both removed in fig 10a since we are more concerned with the inter annual twss in lbb we can obtain the inter annual tws variations by removing seasonal signal and linear trend from original tws series as shown in fig 10b the inter annual sh and mascon estimates show good consistency with the correlation coefficients of 0 81 and the rms residuals of 2 3 cm the consistency between forward modeling results and mascon products also demonstrate the reliability of our inter annual tws estimations over lbb based on the inter annual tws estimations fig 10b the relatively smaller twss are observed in 2003 2007 2011 and 2015 indicting the droughts at these years meanwhile during the observation period of grace and grace follow on the high water storage positive twss alternates with low water storage negative twss forming a multi year cycle about 4 5 years in addition the sh and mascon estimates show that the inter annual tws variations in lbb are quite drastic from about 10 to 10 cm which may be caused by the continental climate characteristic of our study region wang et al 2018 3 3 tws variations from hydrological model the grace grace fo twss include the mass changes of groundwater gws snow swe soil moisture sms surface water sws and canopy cws apart from grace grace fo data we present the result derived from gldas to analyze the contribution of each hydrological component as shown in fig 11 there are obvious inter annual signals rather than seasonal signals in gws and sms variations meanwhile the good agreement is found between grace grace fo inter annual tws and the gws and sms estimates with a correlation coefficient of 0 88 and 0 89 fig 12a it demonstrates the gws and sms are the main contributors of inter annual tws over lbb finally we also remove the linear trend and seasonal signal in gldas estimates to analyze the inter annual characteristic again the inter annual tws variations from gldas are in good agreement with those derived from grace grace fo fig 13a this consistency demonstrates not only the certainty of tws estimates from satellite gravimetry but also the feasibility of depicting the inter annual water storage variations via gldas over lbb meanwhile a multi year cycle about 4 5 years are also observed in the gldas inter annual results with the highest tws of 6 73 cm in 2010 and the lowest tws 6 44 cm in 2015 the consistent result between gldas and grace grace follow on enhances the reliability of our conclusion of 4 5 years inter annual twss cycle over lbb apart from the drivers of inter annual tws variations we also try to figure out the main contributor of seasonal tws variations as shown in fig 12b the swe presents obviously seasonal characteristics which reflects the snow melting and accumulating over lbb however there are notable phase discrepancies about 3months between swe estimates and grace grace fo twss the phase discrepancies demonstrate that the swe is not the major contributor to the seasonal variations over lbb note that sws is not included in gldas model therefore we subtract the gldas estimates from the grace grace fo twss to obtain the sws estimates the sws estimates present similar seasonal variations as grace grace fo twss the correlation coefficient between sws estimates and grace grace fo tws is 0 74 which is larger than that of swe as 0 43 it demonstrates that the sws is the major contributor to the seasonal tws over lbb in addition the water level changes of lake baikal which are recorded by altimeter satellites are also compared with the sws estimates in fig 13b the similar seasonal characteristics are observed among these two kinds of observations with the correlation coefficients of 0 66 it demonstrates that the water level variations of lake baikal would seriously affect the seasonal water storage variations over the whole basin 3 4 drivers of tws changes the hydrological system of a basin is always greatly affected by its precipitation and temperature changes to analyze the drivers of tws variations over lbb we use the cru meteorological data to estimate the precipitation and temperature changes in 2003 2019 as shown in fig 14 the mean precipitation and temperature of each month demonstrate that the regularly high low precipitation and temperature at summer winter the discrepancy of precipitation temperature between summer and winter reaches to about 86 07 mm 40 89 revealing the clearly seasonal characteristics over lbb it also should be noted that the relatively larger precipitation and larger temperature during 2012 2019 when compared with the period of 2003 2011 specifically the temperature has an obvious increasing trend of 0 042 year during 2003 2019 demonstrating the intense climate warming over lbb fig 15 further presents the precipitation and temperature features at each year it helps us to better understand the low tws throughout 2015 when the smallest precipitation 309 83 mm and relatively larger temperature 1 44 are observed similarly the drought in 2007 is also caused by low precipitation 363 68 mm and high temperature 0 69 while the drought in 2011 is mainly derived from the low precipitation 353 09 mm to further understand the relationship between precipitation temperature and tws in lbb we also calculate their long term accumulated values and use a moving average filter with 12 months to filter the annual trend fig 16 according to this result the following conclusions are summarized 1 there is a good agreement but time lag between tws and precipitation fig 16a as illustrated in zhang et al 2019 the time lag between tws and precipitation is related to various features of different regions such as the temperature precipitation latitude longitude elevation slope and etc in lbb the time lag is about 6 months when the correlation coefficient between tws and precipitation is as high as 0 73 it implies that the precipitation is the main driver to tws variations in lbb 2 fig 16b presents that the long term trend of tws and temperature are consistent in 2003 2006 while it is completely opposite in 2007 2016 the completely opposite variations of precipitation and temperature make the inter annual tws to be more dramatic during 2007 2016 than other periods 3 5 recommendations for hydrologic applications of grace and grace fo over lbb due to the limitation of spatial resolution grace and grace fo are seldom used to investigate the mass changes in a small scale region although the ability of grace to detect gravity signal changes has been questioned a few scholars have proved the potential of grace in detecting small signal size for instance ni et al 2017 and yi et al 2017 respectively investigated the water storage changes in lake volta and longyangxia reservoir by applying the forward modeling method and they both demonstrated the ability of grace to detect the small signal size in this paper based on the noise contaminated esm model the performance of forward modeling method over lbb is evaluated via a close loop simulation study on this basis we use different grace and grace fo solutions from the csr gfz and jpl to estimate the tws variations over lbb the well consistency between grace estimates and other source data further demonstrates the forward modeling method can accurately obtain the tws variations in such a small basin which will provide technical support for the follow up similar hydrological research in small basins and become a foundation for further studies in the future monitoring and quantifying the inter annual tws variations in a region from grace data have always been of great interest to hydrologists e g andersen et al 2005 yildiz et al 2010 vey et al 2012 singh et al 2012 he et al 2020 the grace and grace fo data are used to investigate the inter annual tws variation characteristics over lbb in 2003 2020 in this paper the results show the high tws alternates with low tws to present a multi year cycle of 4 5 years which are helpful for us to better understand the tws variations rules in this region combined with the meteorological data the driving factors of water storage changes are analyzed the long term accumulated tws change trends are consistent with that of precipitation and the tws variations in lbb show 6 months delay response to precipitation the results will be helpful to further understand the water cycle in this region and to provide guidance for macro control of local water storage the hydrological process at high latitudes is difficultly described due to the presence of permafrost zhang et al 2019 investigated the response of tws anomalies to precipitation over 168 global basins and its results show that the lag between tws anomalies and precipitation in the high latitude basins is about 6 9 months the finding is consistent with the 6 months lag in lbb of our results studying the rule of tws response to meteorological data can help us to further understand the interaction and mechanism operating between climate conditions and tws changes and also provide a basis for the study of global or regional climate changes beyond the above findings the future studies should monitor and predict the regional flood events and drought events by using these progressive satellite observations and hydrological models meanwhile based on the available twss from grace and grace fo data multi source data are expected to reconstruct the long term continuous and dynamic tws series in the global or regional scale of course our results still need to be further verified when the more and real reliable in situ water gauge or groundwater station observation data become available in the future 4 conclusions in this study we analyze the inter annual tws variations over lbb during 2003 2020 based on grace grace fo and gldas and further figure out the major driver of tws variations via meteorological data to reduce the leakage errors during grace grace follow on data processing we introduce the forward modeling method to ensure the reliability of our tws estimations the result via a close loop simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of retrieving tws variations over lbb via the forward modeling method meanwhile the leakage corrected grace grace fo tws estimates derived from geo potential coefficients are also in good agreements with those derived from mascon products enhancing the reliability of our tws estimations via grace grace fo results based on these inter annual tws estimates the obvious periodical characteristics around 4 5 year are observed over lbb the relatively smaller inter annual tws estimates are observed in 2007 2011 2015 which reflects the severe drought events at these years in addition the comparison between gldas model and grace grace fo estimates reveals that the sms and gws are the major contributors to the inter annual tws variations while sws is the major contributor to the seasonal temporal signal over lbb finally according to the meteorological data the drought in 2015 mainly attributes to the smallest precipitation 309 83 mm and relatively higher temperature 1 44 during 2007 2016 the more intensive variations of temperature and precipitation result in the more

8006,the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission and its follow on mission grace follow on can accurately track the earth s mass variations which have been successfully used in various geoscience researches related to global and regional hydrological process in this study satellite gravimetry grace and gracr follow on and hydrological model gldas are used to estimate the tws variations over lbb in 2003 2020 as the world s largest freshwater lake by volume the terrestrial water storage tws variations in lake baikal basin lbb significantly affect the surrounding ecological environment however the spatial scale of lbb is relatively small when compared to approximately 300 km spatial resolution of grace and grace follow on mission therefore the forward modeling method is used to alleviate the leakage errors during satellite gravimetry data processing to assess the performance of forward modeling method a close loop simulation study is designed in noise contaminated condition the simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of forward modeling method in accurately estimating tws variations over lbb after appropriate leakage correction the inter annual tws from satellite gravimetry agrees well with gldas the tws variations over lbb demonstrate that 1 there are drastic variations and periodic characteristics around 4 5 years and the drought events are observed in 2003 2007 2011 and 2015 as relatively smaller twss 2 the soil moisture and groundwater are the major contributors to tws variations with the correlation coefficient of 0 88 and 0 89 and the surface water is the main contributor to the seasonal variations over lbb 3 the tws presents about 6 moths delay to precipitation variations while the precipitation is still the major driver to affect the hydrological processes over this region keywords lake baikal basin grace grace follow on terrestrial water storage forward modeling method gldas cru 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws represents the summation of groundwater snow water soil moisture surface water and canopy water since the tws is a major component in the hydrological cycle monitoring tws variations is helpful for deeply exploring the hydrological and meteorological issues relevant to water budget tapley et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 pan et al 2017 as the largest freshwater lake in the world lake baikal holds more 20 of the world s total fresh water resource therefore it is one of the precious freshwater resources of human beings as observed by törnqvist et al 2014 the temperature in lake baikal region raises nearly twice as fast warming as the global average in 1938 2009 and it predicts an obvious further future warming implying continued permafrost thaw in the last few decades the precipitation has slightly increased and the land cover has also changed significantly in lbb dorjsuren et al 2018a the special geographical location and various hydro meteorological characteristic of lbb have drawn the attention to numerous scientists in the past decades shimaraev et al 2019 bondarenko et al 2019 izmest eva et al 2016 timoshkin et al 2018 however these studies mostly focus on the natural ecological environment changes and the state of water quality of lake baikal region but they scarcely study the tws variations in this region due to the semi arid climates in lbb its tws variations significantly affect the surrounding ecological environment moreover the water storages in baikal lake region already become unstable due to the severe climate changes therefore it is greatly significant to accurately explore the tws variations in lbb before the development of spatial geodesy the seasonal terrestrial water cycle at medium and long spatial scales is rarely known several techniques of monitoring tws variations include situ observations remote sensing and global hydrological model these traditional observation methods have intrinsic disadvantages for instance the traditional ground observation stations can directly obtain the long term changes of local hydrological signals zhou et al 2016 while they are limited by observation conditions e g mountains and deserts resulting in uneven spatial distribution the traditional altimetry satellites and remote sensing satellites can only monitor surface water changes and shallow soil moisture content xiong et al 2021 while the variations of deep soil moisture and groundwater are difficultly tracked the hydrological models can effectively describe the water cycle process but the models have great uncertainties and need to be verified by other observation data scanlon et al 2018 in contrast to traditional techniques the grace mission and grace follow on grace fo mission provide the unprecedented observations to monitor spatial temporal mass redistribution in terms of tws variations tapley et al 2004 ciracì et al 2020 which vertically integrate water storage variations from the surface water to the deepest aquifers the application of grace and grace fo have made a creative contribution to the study of global and regional hydrological cycle and environmental changes in hydrology geology and oceanology e g andersen et al 2005 chen et al 2009 famiglietti and rodell 2013 morishita and heki 2008 zhang et al 2015 yi et al 2016 ciracì et al 2020 the typical application scopes include the mass variations in polar glaciers e g chen et al 2007 velicogna and wahr 2006 syed et al 2007 ocean e g chen et al 2005 leuliette and miller 2009 and terrestrial water storage variations at global or basin scales e g chen et al 2009 luo et al 2016 huang et al 2012 li et al 2016 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 over the land the mass variations from grace and grace fo estimates include all hydrological factors such as surface water soil moisture groundwater snow water and canopy water however grace grace fo temporal gravity field models are contaminated by noise accurately quantitative measuring surface mass changes from grace grace fo is still challenging during processing grace grace fo spherical harmonic sh solutions it is necessary to suppress noise in high degree shs chen et al 2016a 2016b therefore the sh coefficients are truncated to a certain order and spatial filtering is essential however the limited shs and additional spatial filtering inevitably cause biased grace estimates the errors caused by these post processing procedures are collectively called leakage errors wahr et al 1998 swenson and wahr 2002 on the one hand the leakage errors refer to the signal leakage from the aimed area to the outside of the aimed area and on the other hand the signal leakage from the outside of the aimed area to the inside of the aimed area they are collectively known as signal leakage klees et al 2007 in order to estimate accurately twss in a target area it is necessary to apply some additional operators to reduce leakage errors here several leakage error reduction operators are summarized wahr et al 1998 first proposed the method of dividing signals into land signals and ocean signals commonly referred to as signal separation method however this method is generally used to explore the global sea water mass changes and to deduct the leakage errors from land to sea landerer and swenson 2012 proposed a scale factor method based on signal distribution characteristics in hydrological models this method can provide the scale factor in grid scale or in a specific basin scale which has been widely used to global or regional studies e g tangdamrongsub et al 2016 long et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2013 chen et al 2014 proposed a forward modeling method to restore the leaked signal and it has been applied to study the sea level changes and regional tws variations e g chen et al 2015 2016a 2016b 2017 in contrast to the scale factor method which is entirely relying on prior hydrological models the forward modeling method does not require any external prior information notably the leakage correction is accurately estimated when the forward modeling method is applied in the special areas where the geographical locations of the signal changes are distinguishable and the local signal is dominant chen et al 2015 2017 as the local temporal signal over lbb is dominant we use the forward modeling method to reduce the leakage errors during grace grace f o data processing the forward modeling method has been widely used in various geoscience applications jin and zou 2015 re estimated the glacier mass loss in greenland from grace by correcting the land ocean leakage errors based on the forward modeling method ni et al 2017 estimated the tws variations of lake volta from grace observations and the grace estimations show excellent consistency with those derived from satellite altimetry observations yi et al 2017 investigated the tws variations in the longyangxia reservoir which demonstrates the great potential of grace estimates in monitoring water storage changes in such a small reservoir in addition wu et al 2015 tangdamrongsub et al 2016 and zhou et al 2018 also demonstrate the great performances of forward modeling method in reducing leakage errors over typical small basins however the performance of forward modeling method over lbb has never been assessed therefore we design a close loop and noise contaminated simulation environment to evaluate the performance of forward modeling method over lbb and then quantify the tws variations to understand the characteristic of hydrological processes over this region according to previous researches in global and regional scale the climate changes and human activities are the two main drivers to affect the hydrological processes hampton et al 2008 malsy et al 2017 the natural climate factors are commonly the main reason of the total tws variations which dominate the trends of water storages in large scale basins human activities not only have direct impacts on tws variations in basin scale but also have magnifying effects on the changes of natural factors for instance the increase of population leads to the expansion of agricultural land minderlein and menzel 2015 karthe et al 2015 and the expansion of agriculture and the augment of irrigative demand results in the increase of water utilization in recent decades the consumption of water resources in lbb has significantly increased due to the increase of mongolia s population karthe et al 2017 dorjsuren et al 2018b however as lake baikal basin is located in the sensitive area of global climate changes the tws variations in this region may be still seriously affected by the natural climate changes the driving factors of tws variations in this region are still unclear therefore for the first time we accurately estimate the driving factors of tws variations over lbb which may provide guidance on local freshwater management the purposes of this study are to 1 validate the performance of the forward modeling method in lbb by a close loop simulation study 2 estimate tws variations over lbb between 2003 and 2020 using grace grace fo and gldas hydrological model 3 analyze the main driver of tws variations over lbb based on meteorological data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area lake baikal basin is located in the middle of eurasia which is a cross border basin between mongolia and russia see fig 1 lake baikal has 336 rivers flowing into the lake covering an area of water catchment of 560 000 km2 the main inflows include the selenga the barguzin and the upper angara however these is only one outflow i e the angara of lake baikal there are large diurnal and annual temperature difference in lake baikal basin moreover this region has a continental climate with cold and long winters the basin boundary is defined following the global runoff data centre grdc a summary of the geographical and climatic characteristics about this region can be seen in table 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace and grace follow on the center for space research csr german research centre for geosciences gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl release 06 monthly gravity field solution product are used to calculate the tws from january 2003 to december 2020 over lbb the three sh products are all processed as follows firstly the c1 coefficients are provided by swenson et al 2008 and the c20 coefficients are replaced by cheng and tapley 2004 secondly the long term mean of spherical harmonic coefficients shc is removed and then the gaussian filter is used to suppress the high frequency noise and the de correlation filter is used to reduce the correlated errors in grace grace fo data swenson and wahr 2006 finally the tws variations are calculated following wahr et al 1998 meanwhile the forward modeling method is applied to alleviate leakage errors furthermore the csr release 06 monthly mascon product save 2020 is used to validate our estimates via sh solutions grace gracr fo mascon solutions reduce the temporal noise during gravity inversion process which need no additional post processing steps such as gaussian filtering and de correlation filtering save et al 2012 2016 watkins et al 2015 chen et al 2017 note that grace grace fo mascon solutions offer improved spatial resolution relative to sh solutions but its leakage errors still need to be appropriately processed in order to accurately estimate regional mass changes schrama et al 2014 the long term mean of mascon estimates is also removed 2 2 2 gldas hydrology model the gldas 2 1 global hydrology model is used to calculate the hydrological components variations and tws variations over lbb in this paper its results are expected to prove the tws estimates from grace grace fo data at present there are four land surface models driven by the gldas which include noah variable infiltration capacity vic community land model clm and catchment land surface model clsm rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 unlike others the clsm in gldas simulates the shallow groundwater changes in lbb the groundwater changes may seriously affect the local hydrological cycle therefore the clsm datasets of gldas are used in this study 2 2 3 altimetry data we use the hydrolare product to calculate water level changes of lake baikal the hydrolare data derive from the international data centre on hydrology of lakes and reservoirs it is produced by the state hydrological institute in russia crétaux et al 2011 currently this product has offered hydrological data of the world big lakes and reservoirs e g the water level variations and surface volume variations 2 2 4 climatic research unit we use the gridded climatic research unit cru climate data 0 5 0 5 in 2003 2019 to investigate climate characteristics over lbb in this study including temperature and precipitation changes the cru product belongs to the monthly gridded data which is established by the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia harris et al 2020 it derives from the world s observation data of weather stations by reprocessing this datasets are usually employed to study climatic and meteorological changes whose variables include precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and vapor pressure etc 2 3 methods since the publicly available grace grace fo shc products contain high frequency errors the spatial filters are usually applied to suppress these errors during calculating twss however the application of spatial filters will lead to the spatial leakage errors as shown in fig 2 we use simulated data to demonstrate how the leakage errors formed during postprocessing fig 2a is a simulated original signal in lake baikal basin fig 2b is obtained by spherical harmonic expansion with limited truncation order 60 compared with fig 2a the signals in fig 2b leak out of the region and the signals inside the region are also weakened fig 2c and fig 2d are respectively obtained by applying the 300 km gaussian smoothing and 500 km gaussian smoothing to fig 2b as shown in fig 2c and fig 2d the signals further leak out of the region and the signals inside the region is further weakened the larger radius of gaussian smoothing is applied and the larger leakage errors are observed as shown above spherical harmonic truncation error and additional gaussian smoothing during grace data processing inevitably lead to leakage errors therefore an important problem to be solved in processing the grace sh solutions is to correct reasonably the leakage errors in this paper similar to the approach presented chen et al 2015 and zhou et al 2018 the forward modeling method is applied to mitigate the sh solutions leakage errors the details of this method are shown in fig 3 1 after the de correlation filtering and gaussian filtering are applied to the original shcs product results from section 3 1 the observed tws twsobs can be obtained these parameters setting of filtering methods can be determined after simulation study 2 in the first loop the initial value of candidate tws called tws candidate is set to the twsobs moreover the tws candidate is set to zero outside the aimed region and then the new tws candidate is converted into shcs within limited degrees and orders similar to 1 the same gaussian filtering is used to obtain the predicted tws twspre 3 the δt is obtained by calculating the difference between observed tws and predicted tws here the stopping criterion can be achieved by setting a threshold α or the number of iterations if this criterion is met the iteration will stop otherwise a new iteration will continue and the candidate tws will be also updated in this study we achieve the stopping criterion by setting the number of iterations following the recommendation of chen et al 2013 an acceleration factor is used to δt when reaching the stopping criterion the twsobs is generally consistent with the twspre since the twspre is obtained by the same filter as twsobs the tws candidate can be regarded as the true signal that is not affected by leakage errors to evaluate the performance of forward modeling method in lbb we set a simulation study under noise contaminated condition in the simulation study the full noise components including instrument noise and model errors are included the way to add the noise into the spherical harmonic coefficients shcs is similar to those presented in zhou et al 2019 2020 2021 the earth system model esm is taken as the true temporal signal dobslaw et al 2016 the noise contaminated earth system model esm is retrieved by a close loop simulation which includes a forward procedure and a backward procedure fig 4 in the forward procedure the observations contain the information to true background geophysical models and the instrument noise in the backward procedure all of the geophysical signals except for temporal signals are removed note that the static field ocean tide and de aliasing product in the backward procedure are different from those in forward procedure in this way the background model errors are fully considered which are similar to those in the real grace data processing procedure based on these observations the noise contaminated temporal model is determined via a standard least square adjustment theoretically the noise contaminated model contains the esm his temporal signals we therefore can use this model to assess the performance of different filtering approaches or leakage correction approaches more results about this simulation study are shown in section 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of forward modeling method there are unavoidable leakage errors during calculating twss via gauss filtered shs to alleviate the leakage errors the forward modeling method is applied in this study to assess the performance of forward modeling method over lbb a simulation study in noise contaminated condition is implemented as shown in fig 5 with the increase of iterations there is an obvious decrease in terms of root mean square rms of residuals between twsobs and twspre the rmss are smaller than 0 02 cm which indicate a good convergence in forward modeling process the convergent result also implies that the number of iterations as 50 is sufficient to assess the performance of forward modeling method in spatial domain we compare the observed twss twsobs predicted twss twspre and their discrepancies over lbb fig 6 fig 6a shows the twsobs which are calculated by applying 500 km gaussian smoothing and p3m6 de correlation filtering to simulated original signal fig 6b is the twspre derived from forward modeling process and fig 6c shows the difference between fig 6a and fig 6b the distributions of twspre are almost identical to that of twsobs meanwhile the mean discrepancies as shown in fig 6c are all smaller than 0 02 cm which are less than 1 2 of the signal amplitude of twspre and twsobs the identical spatial distribution and small discrepancies demonstrate the good performance of forward modeling method in reducing leakage errors over lbb according to the simulation study the twss over lbb present notable differences in amplitude variations before and after applying forward modeling method fig 7a and table 2 meanwhile the simulated true tws variations and four leakage corrected twss series present good consistency in fig 7b which demonstrates the reliability of forward modeling method in retrieving temporal signals over lbb in addition the key issues of implementing forward modeling method are the radius of gaussian filter and the necessity of applying de correlation filter according to the results in fig 7b and table 2 applying gaussian filters with different radius lead to similar results based on the statistics in table 2 we finally select the forward modeling method with 500 km gauss filter and p3m6 de correlation filter as the optimal processing strategy for further analysis 3 2 estimating tws variations based on grace grace fo data since the performance of forward modeling method is good over lbb we use this method to calculate the tws variations respectively based on gfz jpl and csr release 06 sh products fig 8 the tws variations derived from three agencies jpl gfz and csr are compared in fig 8a and the corresponding inter annual tws variations are presented in fig 8b generally the results derived from three different agencies are in good consistency in terms of original or inter annual tws variations however it should be noted that there are obvious discrepancies between gfz estimations and those derived from other two agencies meanwhile since the jpl estimations are almost identical to csr estimations with a correlation coefficient of 0 90 we are confident to only use csr estimations to monitor the tws variations over lbb in our subsequent research to verify the sh estimates we also calculate twss in lbb from grace grace fo mascon estimates fig 9 as shown in fig 9b the mascon results show slight larger magnitudes than the sh estimates without forward modeling confirming the relatively less leakage errors of mascon solutions when compared to conventional sh solutions meanwhile the magnitude of mascon estimates is significantly smaller than the leakage corrected sh estimates via forward modeling method it demonstrates that the mascon estimates over lbb are also affected by leakage errors to correct the leakage errors of mascon estimates the similar processing procedure as chen et al 2017 is applied here after applying appropriate leakage corrections the corrected estimates fluctuate obviously larger than the corresponding uncorrected time series no matter for grace grace fo spherical harmonic sh results fig 9a or mascon mc results fig 9b the results shown in fig 9 demonstrate the necessity of applying appropriate leakage corrected operator for tws estimations over lbb after reallocating all mascon grids within 200 km from the boundary of the lbb into the lbb the leakage corrected mascon results show an obvious overall decreasing trend when compared to sh solutions which may be caused by the different processing algorithms for mascon and sh solutions to eliminate the contribution of the long term change of hydrological signal the linear trend of sh and mascon estimates are both removed in fig 10a since we are more concerned with the inter annual twss in lbb we can obtain the inter annual tws variations by removing seasonal signal and linear trend from original tws series as shown in fig 10b the inter annual sh and mascon estimates show good consistency with the correlation coefficients of 0 81 and the rms residuals of 2 3 cm the consistency between forward modeling results and mascon products also demonstrate the reliability of our inter annual tws estimations over lbb based on the inter annual tws estimations fig 10b the relatively smaller twss are observed in 2003 2007 2011 and 2015 indicting the droughts at these years meanwhile during the observation period of grace and grace follow on the high water storage positive twss alternates with low water storage negative twss forming a multi year cycle about 4 5 years in addition the sh and mascon estimates show that the inter annual tws variations in lbb are quite drastic from about 10 to 10 cm which may be caused by the continental climate characteristic of our study region wang et al 2018 3 3 tws variations from hydrological model the grace grace fo twss include the mass changes of groundwater gws snow swe soil moisture sms surface water sws and canopy cws apart from grace grace fo data we present the result derived from gldas to analyze the contribution of each hydrological component as shown in fig 11 there are obvious inter annual signals rather than seasonal signals in gws and sms variations meanwhile the good agreement is found between grace grace fo inter annual tws and the gws and sms estimates with a correlation coefficient of 0 88 and 0 89 fig 12a it demonstrates the gws and sms are the main contributors of inter annual tws over lbb finally we also remove the linear trend and seasonal signal in gldas estimates to analyze the inter annual characteristic again the inter annual tws variations from gldas are in good agreement with those derived from grace grace fo fig 13a this consistency demonstrates not only the certainty of tws estimates from satellite gravimetry but also the feasibility of depicting the inter annual water storage variations via gldas over lbb meanwhile a multi year cycle about 4 5 years are also observed in the gldas inter annual results with the highest tws of 6 73 cm in 2010 and the lowest tws 6 44 cm in 2015 the consistent result between gldas and grace grace follow on enhances the reliability of our conclusion of 4 5 years inter annual twss cycle over lbb apart from the drivers of inter annual tws variations we also try to figure out the main contributor of seasonal tws variations as shown in fig 12b the swe presents obviously seasonal characteristics which reflects the snow melting and accumulating over lbb however there are notable phase discrepancies about 3months between swe estimates and grace grace fo twss the phase discrepancies demonstrate that the swe is not the major contributor to the seasonal variations over lbb note that sws is not included in gldas model therefore we subtract the gldas estimates from the grace grace fo twss to obtain the sws estimates the sws estimates present similar seasonal variations as grace grace fo twss the correlation coefficient between sws estimates and grace grace fo tws is 0 74 which is larger than that of swe as 0 43 it demonstrates that the sws is the major contributor to the seasonal tws over lbb in addition the water level changes of lake baikal which are recorded by altimeter satellites are also compared with the sws estimates in fig 13b the similar seasonal characteristics are observed among these two kinds of observations with the correlation coefficients of 0 66 it demonstrates that the water level variations of lake baikal would seriously affect the seasonal water storage variations over the whole basin 3 4 drivers of tws changes the hydrological system of a basin is always greatly affected by its precipitation and temperature changes to analyze the drivers of tws variations over lbb we use the cru meteorological data to estimate the precipitation and temperature changes in 2003 2019 as shown in fig 14 the mean precipitation and temperature of each month demonstrate that the regularly high low precipitation and temperature at summer winter the discrepancy of precipitation temperature between summer and winter reaches to about 86 07 mm 40 89 revealing the clearly seasonal characteristics over lbb it also should be noted that the relatively larger precipitation and larger temperature during 2012 2019 when compared with the period of 2003 2011 specifically the temperature has an obvious increasing trend of 0 042 year during 2003 2019 demonstrating the intense climate warming over lbb fig 15 further presents the precipitation and temperature features at each year it helps us to better understand the low tws throughout 2015 when the smallest precipitation 309 83 mm and relatively larger temperature 1 44 are observed similarly the drought in 2007 is also caused by low precipitation 363 68 mm and high temperature 0 69 while the drought in 2011 is mainly derived from the low precipitation 353 09 mm to further understand the relationship between precipitation temperature and tws in lbb we also calculate their long term accumulated values and use a moving average filter with 12 months to filter the annual trend fig 16 according to this result the following conclusions are summarized 1 there is a good agreement but time lag between tws and precipitation fig 16a as illustrated in zhang et al 2019 the time lag between tws and precipitation is related to various features of different regions such as the temperature precipitation latitude longitude elevation slope and etc in lbb the time lag is about 6 months when the correlation coefficient between tws and precipitation is as high as 0 73 it implies that the precipitation is the main driver to tws variations in lbb 2 fig 16b presents that the long term trend of tws and temperature are consistent in 2003 2006 while it is completely opposite in 2007 2016 the completely opposite variations of precipitation and temperature make the inter annual tws to be more dramatic during 2007 2016 than other periods 3 5 recommendations for hydrologic applications of grace and grace fo over lbb due to the limitation of spatial resolution grace and grace fo are seldom used to investigate the mass changes in a small scale region although the ability of grace to detect gravity signal changes has been questioned a few scholars have proved the potential of grace in detecting small signal size for instance ni et al 2017 and yi et al 2017 respectively investigated the water storage changes in lake volta and longyangxia reservoir by applying the forward modeling method and they both demonstrated the ability of grace to detect the small signal size in this paper based on the noise contaminated esm model the performance of forward modeling method over lbb is evaluated via a close loop simulation study on this basis we use different grace and grace fo solutions from the csr gfz and jpl to estimate the tws variations over lbb the well consistency between grace estimates and other source data further demonstrates the forward modeling method can accurately obtain the tws variations in such a small basin which will provide technical support for the follow up similar hydrological research in small basins and become a foundation for further studies in the future monitoring and quantifying the inter annual tws variations in a region from grace data have always been of great interest to hydrologists e g andersen et al 2005 yildiz et al 2010 vey et al 2012 singh et al 2012 he et al 2020 the grace and grace fo data are used to investigate the inter annual tws variation characteristics over lbb in 2003 2020 in this paper the results show the high tws alternates with low tws to present a multi year cycle of 4 5 years which are helpful for us to better understand the tws variations rules in this region combined with the meteorological data the driving factors of water storage changes are analyzed the long term accumulated tws change trends are consistent with that of precipitation and the tws variations in lbb show 6 months delay response to precipitation the results will be helpful to further understand the water cycle in this region and to provide guidance for macro control of local water storage the hydrological process at high latitudes is difficultly described due to the presence of permafrost zhang et al 2019 investigated the response of tws anomalies to precipitation over 168 global basins and its results show that the lag between tws anomalies and precipitation in the high latitude basins is about 6 9 months the finding is consistent with the 6 months lag in lbb of our results studying the rule of tws response to meteorological data can help us to further understand the interaction and mechanism operating between climate conditions and tws changes and also provide a basis for the study of global or regional climate changes beyond the above findings the future studies should monitor and predict the regional flood events and drought events by using these progressive satellite observations and hydrological models meanwhile based on the available twss from grace and grace fo data multi source data are expected to reconstruct the long term continuous and dynamic tws series in the global or regional scale of course our results still need to be further verified when the more and real reliable in situ water gauge or groundwater station observation data become available in the future 4 conclusions in this study we analyze the inter annual tws variations over lbb during 2003 2020 based on grace grace fo and gldas and further figure out the major driver of tws variations via meteorological data to reduce the leakage errors during grace grace follow on data processing we introduce the forward modeling method to ensure the reliability of our tws estimations the result via a close loop simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of retrieving tws variations over lbb via the forward modeling method meanwhile the leakage corrected grace grace fo tws estimates derived from geo potential coefficients are also in good agreements with those derived from mascon products enhancing the reliability of our tws estimations via grace grace fo results based on these inter annual tws estimates the obvious periodical characteristics around 4 5 year are observed over lbb the relatively smaller inter annual tws estimates are observed in 2007 2011 2015 which reflects the severe drought events at these years in addition the comparison between gldas model and grace grace fo estimates reveals that the sms and gws are the major contributors to the inter annual tws variations while sws is the major contributor to the seasonal temporal signal over lbb finally according to the meteorological data the drought in 2015 mainly attributes to the smallest precipitation 309 83 mm and relatively higher temperature 1 44 during 2007 2016 the more intensive variations of temperature and precipitation result in the more dramatical tws variations over lbb considering the unique ecological status of lake baikal our results are expected to provide reference value for the utilization of water resources and ecosystem protection in this region credit authorship contribution statement min wei and hao zhou proposed the idea of the manuscript hao zhou designed the experiments and min wei conducted the simulation study

8007,understanding the factors controlling groundwater recharge in arid vadose zones is critical for sustainable groundwater management in the face of climate variability and change here we estimated groundwater recharge in data sparse regions under arid climate by implementing a multi model approach using hydrus 1d for a century long time series of meteorological data and site specific regolith hydraulic properties of a bare soil and a mulga savanna type soil in central australia grain size analysis provided a contiguous 12 m deep profile of hydraulic properties that were generated by means of pedotransfer functions to account for conceptual model uncertainty in hydraulic properties eleven pedotransfer functions were applied climate data from three stations accounted for spatial heterogeneity in local climate of the ti tree basin study area simulated water fluxes in the vadose zone indicated that only rainfall events of more than 150 200 mm resulted in groundwater recharge recharge was linked to extreme rainfall associated with monsoonal cyclones based on the 130 year climate record average recharge for the savanna type vegetation ranged from 4 3 to 7 4 mm a across the three climate stations with an overall mean of 4 6 mm a the bare soil had an overall mean recharge of 29 5 mm a ranging from 23 5 to 35 8 mm a results from this study provide a better understanding of

national research council 2012 facing the threat of water deficits the accurate quantification of recharge rates and a sound understanding of the effects of climate variations and change on groundwater replenishment are essential for sustainable groundwater management especially in arid regions with often limited water resources determining the sustainability of groundwater resources requires accurate estimates of the groundwater balance i e the storage volumes extraction and recharge rates chen et al 2014 in semi arid and arid regions increasing the reliability of estimates of available water resources will to a large degree depend on the ability to reduce the uncertainty about the rate of groundwater recharge de vries and simmers 2002 ntgov northern territory government 2009 scanlon et al 2006 main impediments to the estimation of recharge in arid and semi arid regions are the low values of total annual recharge amounts and the highly infrequent nature of recharge that is not necessarily coupled to seasonality berry et al 2011 morton et al 2011 recharge in arid and semi arid regions is hypothesised to be highly intermittent and related to extreme precipitation and associated flooding events villeneuve et al 2015 in australia s arid interior recharge to aquifers is related to soil infiltration of rainfall during extreme rainfall events seepage from river channels and other topographic depression and the infiltration from flood out areas harrington et al 1999 2002 magee 2009 read and tickell 2007 zhang et al 1999a 1999b recharge estimation in australia s arid zones have most often relied on the use of environmental tracers for instance using a tracer based approach harrington et al 2002 found that rainfall events of at least 150 200 mm are required to generate significant recharge in the ti tree basin northern territory despite numerous other studies on recharge in central australia s arid regions e g calf et al 1991 harrington et al 1999 harrington et al 2002 knapton 2005 2006a 2007 ride 1968 wood et al 2014 recharge rates are found to vary widely depending on the methodology for instance recharge varied between 0 1 and 50 mm a mean 3 5 mm a based on a c 14 tracer approach while recharge derived from the chloride mass balance method was between 0 1 and 2 mm a mean 0 8 mm a harrington et al 2002 for the same region analysis of groundwater level data resulted in a recharge rate of 2 mm a ntgov northern territory government 2009 an alternative approach to estimating recharge from tracer analysis is by means of simulation modelling of vadose zone processes garcia et al 2011 hydrodynamic process based vadose zone models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 are commonly used tools for the estimation of groundwater recharge however comprehensive vadose zone modelling is often limited by the requirement for many input parameters for climate soil and vegetation gaiser et al 2000 unfortunately the availability of reliable data on water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity of soils in arid and semi arid regions is often poor gaiser et al 2000 as a result the complexity and variability of the relationships between rainfall soil water flow and groundwater recharge remain insufficiently understood one way to overcome the paucity of soil hydraulic properties is through pedotransfer functions that use readily available soil data in statistical relationships to obtain soil hydraulic properties they have proven to be a valuable tool to close this data gap bouma 1989 gaiser et al 2000 guber

approach to gain a better understanding of highly episodic and landcover dependent recharge in an arid environment by identifying recharge generating events we analyse local recharge mechanisms and annual recharge rates based on the vadose zone simulator hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 we generate hydraulic properties for the approximately 12 m thick unsaturated regolith from a set of 11 pedotransfer functions ptfs that use grain size organic matter and bulk density data collected from core samples as predictor variables multiple ptfs were used to account for conceptual model uncertainty in generating hydraulic properties the value of multi model approaches to address conceptual model uncertainty in hydrogeology was recently highlighted by enemark et al 2019 the study area is placed within the ti tree basin northern territory located in australia s arid interior to cover sufficient temporal variability in rainfall data and thus temporal variability in recharge meteorological records over a century long timescale were used the variability in recharge across the landscape due to spatial variability in climatologic boundary conditions will be tackled by running the simulations for several meteorological datasets recorded at three different weather stations throughout the study area the effect of landcover variability on recharge was tested by considering a bare soil and a soil covered by a savanna type vegetation 2 materials and method 2 1 site characteristics the ti tree basin covers an area of approximately 5500 km2 between latitude 22

located within the undifferentiated sandy tertiary and quaternary sediments magee 2009 the main stratigraphic sequence of the basin is built up by an upper low permeability layer and a basal layer with higher permeability magee 2009 the depth to the groundwater table varies from up to 50 m depth in the south western and south eastern parts of the basin to less than 2 m depth in the north harrington et al 2002 read and tickell 2007 magee 2009 natural discharge from the aquifer is mainly limited to the northern part of the basin where shallow groundwater tables result in water loss by evaporation through the vadose zone magee 2009 among the several monitoring wells in the ti tree basin only two rn005507 and rn006543 fig 1 had a sufficiently long record of groundwater levels between

overlain by a clay layer monitoring well rn006543 has its screen from 43 7 to 91 7 m in tertiary to quaternary sediments groundwater level data will be used in a qualitative comparison with time series of predicted groundwater recharge as a means to test the different ptfs the surface hydrology of the basin is determined by four ephemeral rivers and creeks harrington et al 2002 these ephemeral rivers and creeks are flooded only after significant rainfall events e g villeneuve et al 2015 documented that the woodforde river flooded on 34 occasions in 16 years villeneuve et al 2015 the predominant soil types are red earthy sands with fine to medium grain sizes silt loam covering most of the surface area in the central basin alluvial deposits such as gravels and coarse sands are

average annual precipitation rate of 320 mm a 1981 2016 average and an average number of 30 rain days per year were measured at the meteorological station territory grape farm station in the centre of the basin bom bureau of meteorology australia 2015 2016 the actual evapotranspiration rate in the region was estimated by the australian bureau of meteorology bom to be around 300 400 mm a arid regions in central australia experience most of the annual rainfall during extreme rainfall events in the summer months those events are generally linked to monsoonal thunderstorms that arise in the tropics travel southwards and precipitate over central australia hobday and lough 2011 thus spatial and temporal variability of precipitation can be very high throughout the basin to account for the spatial variability in rainfall climate records from three nearby stations were used meteorological data including daily precipitation wind speed solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperatures

2013 dunkerley 2002 garcia et al 2011 scanlon et al 2005 2006 simulated recharge rates at 4 m soil depth for the ti tree basin by chen et al 2014 varied from an average of 6 mm per year for vegetated soil to an average of 236 mm per year for bare soil for relatively short timeseries 1981 2012 several lysimeter studies in arid environments showed that evapotranspiration from vegetated soils were up to 10 times higher than evaporation rates from bare soils at the nevada test site us scanlon et al 2002 2005 walvoord et al 2002 2004 studies of recharge rates in un vegetated and vegetated areas in the tengger desert china and the chihuahuan and mojave deserts us indicated that vegetation inhibited recharge up to 100 wang et al 2004 scanlon et al 2005 vegetation in the ti tree basin is limited in its diversity due to the arid climatic conditions the most common vegetation are small mulga trees acacia aneura and related species fig 1 that grow predominantly on dark red massive clay and loam rich soil and large areas of spinifex grass trioda spp that cover the better drained red earthy sands mulga shrubs generally reach a canopy height of 2 8 m with an average height of about 6 5 m and a relatively shallow rooting depth chen et al 2014 eamus et al 2013 studies by anderson et al 2008 and hill and hill 2003 indicated that root water uptake by mulga trees becomes irrelevant at soil depths greater than 5 m even under extremely dry conditions chen et al 2014 and eamus et al 2013 derived a maximum rooting depth for mulga trees of 4 m estimated leaf area indices lai for vegetation

pedotransfer functions detailed parameterisation of soil water retention characteristics and the hydraulic conductivity are required for any vadose zone flow modelling guber et al 2006 wang et al 2009 wösten et al 2001 however temporal and spatial variability in hydraulic characteristics of the soil as well as costly and time consuming measurements with sophisticated instruments often impede the collection of field data on water retention characteristics especially if large areas need to be covered pedotransfer functions ptfs have proven to be a cost effective tool for the estimation of soil hydraulic properties based on readily available soil data such as textural fractions bulk density and organic matter content guber et al 2006 jacques and mallants 2009 minasny and mcbratney 2000 vereecken et al 1989 wang et al 2009 wösten et al 2001 to account for conceptual model uncertainty in generated soil hydraulic properties we adopted a multi model approach using eleven different ptfs the selection of ptfs was based on available input data obtained from core samples and on their applicability to generate the van genuchten mualem model parameters mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 that were used for the numerical simulations with hydrus 1d the parametric van genuchten water retention model describes the mathematical relation between soil pressure head h l and the soil moisture content θ l3 l3 van genuchten 1980 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water content l3 l3 respectively and α l 1 n and m 1 1 n are curve shape parameters the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity relationship is defined by the 2 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t s e θ θ r θ s θ r is effective saturation and l is the pore connectivity parameter set to 0 5 mualem 1976 three types of ptfs were used point estimation parametric and class ptfs ptfs based on point estimation table 1 ptfs 1 6 generate specific water content pressure head points θ h on the water retention curve most commonly the soil water content at field capacity 33 kpa and at the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa is estimated those two point estimates are necessary to determine water availability for plants minasny et al 1999 the point estimation ptfs used in this approach provided only those two points of the soil water retention curve two additional points were generated by fixing the residual water content θ r at 0 001 l3 l3 while the saturated water content θ s was set equal to the total porosity η derived from the measured bulk density fixing mineral density at 2 65 g cm3 e g jacques and mallants 2009 this approach generates a total number of four θ h data points that are used as input for the nonlinear least squares optimisation program retc to fit the van genuchten parameters θ r θ s α and n van genuchten et al 1991 parametric ptfs table 1 ptfs 7 8 consist of parametric functions that can be used to directly predict parameters of a certain retention model such as the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the brooks and corey 1964 model or the campbell 1974 model as such those ptfs yield continuous water retention curves and are therefore considered very suitable for soil water balance modelling finally class averaged ptfs table 1 ptfs 9 11 provide average estimates of soil hydraulic properties based on textural classes in the usda united states department of agriculture 1951 or the fao food and agriculture organisation 1990 classification schemes the resulting van genuchten 1980 water retention curves from using the eleven ptfs for the three identified soil materials silt loam loamy sand and sand are illustrated in fig 3 for parametric values see supp mat 1 3 in general water retention curves display a similar shape with an expected degree of conceptual variability however there are some curves that deviate from the main group including the ptf of varallyay et al 1982 and gupta and larson 1979 both are point estimation ptfs the point estimation ptf by gupta and larson 1979 predicts a retention curve which has the overall smallest n parameter for material 2 1 192 and 3 1 134 combined with a large α parameter for material 2 0 713 and material 3 0 107 the curves show a relatively straight trend with relatively high water contents even at high negative pressure heads as will be shown later simulations with soil properties calculated with the ptf by gupta and larson 1979 result in the lowest and second lowest recharge for the bare and vegetated soil respectively water retention curves estimated with the ptf by varallyay et al 1982 show another distinct trend where the water content barely changes up to negative pressure heads of around 1000 cm material 1 and 3 and 500 cm material 2 consistent with the very small values for the α parameter supp mat 2 3 for the vegetated soil this ptf results in the lowest recharge whereas for a bare soil the recharge ranks 7 11 see further a 12 m deep regolith profile with hydraulic properties was generated from each of the 11 ptfs the ensemble of profiles thus generated is considered to capture conceptual uncertainty associated with the soil hydraulic models which are highly approximative an inherent drawback of ptfs espino et al 1995 only a limited number of ptfs applied in this study also provided an approach to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated with the class averaged ptfs by meyer et al 1997 schaap et al 2001 and wösten et al 1999 rawls et al 1998 calculated median values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for 12 different usda textural classes in an analytical approach guber et al 2006 rawls et al 1998 average values of k s for 12 usda textural classes reported by rawls et al 1998 were used here for the ptf models that did not provide estimates of k s i e all parametric and point estimation ptfs as a result the variability in hydraulic conductivity relationships will be smaller compared to the variability of water retention curves however even though mean values of the hydraulic conductivities from rawls et al 1998 were combined with most of the ptf generated water retention curves unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves plotted versus the saturation degree s e eq 2 still display significant differences as they use parametric values for α and n from their respective water retention models fig 3 2 6 multi model recharge simulation the numerical model was set up within hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 which uses a finite element scheme to numerically solve the richards equation for variably saturated flow soil hydraulic properties are described using the analytical functions by van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 see eqs 1 and 2 simulations were conducted for each of the 11 different profiles of soil hydraulic properties to account for spatial variability in climate throughout the basin three different meteorological input datasets were applied for each of the soil datasets time series of daily meteorological data span the period from january 1889 to december 2015 although only two out of three climate stations are within the catchment boundary tea tree well and territory grape farm and located relatively close to the studied soil profile we assumed that similar soil profiles exist at or nearby the alice springs station located outside the catchment each simulation was run for a bare soil and for a vegetated soil to quantify the effect of plant water uptake on recharge runoff and hysteresis were considered negligible in this study initial conditions of the water content were selected to be at field capacity in hydrus 1d the atmospheric upper boundary condition with surface layer was selected which allows water to build up on the soil surface once the infiltration capacity has been exceeded the depth of this ponding water layer will increase with precipitation and decrease due to infiltration and evapotranspiration šimůnek et al 2013 the maximum ponding depth prior to runoff initiation was set to 10 cm in order to display realistic conditions for depression storage in desert soils e g garcia et al 2011 especially during cyclone events the lower boundary condition was set to free drainage a condition which is applied when the water table lies well below the bottom of the soil profile šimůnek et al 2013 here deeper than 12 m average values for the specific leaf area index lai of mulga vegetation found in literature ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 e g chen et al 2014 cleverly et al 2013 eamus et al 2013 the mean annual lai for mulga vegetation reported by chen et al 2014 from the same study site as ours ranged from 0 12 to 0 35 m2 m2 for the overstory canopy and 0 07 0 21 m2 m2 for the understory canopy in this study we applied an average canopy height of 6 5 m a mean rooting depth of 5 m and an average annual lai of 0 3 m2 m2 based on the studies mentioned above 3 results 3 1 rainfall statistics mean annual rainfall amounts recorded at the three different pluviographic stations ranged from 262 mm a at alice springs airport 277 mm a at tea tree well up to 320 mm a at territory grape farm due to the daily resolution of the applied silo climate datasets bom bureau of meteorology australia 2016 rainfall events were defined as a continuous time period of rainfall separated by at least 24 h of dry weather conditions using this definition a single rainfall event can include several bursts of rainfall with short periods i e 24 h of dry weather in between heavy rainfall events were defined as events of 100 mm of rainfall or more and further differentiated into extreme rainfall events if the total amount of rain exceeded 150 mm or more fig 4 rainfall events of 50 100 mm precipitation were found to occur approximately every year rainfall events of 100 150 mm were recorded with an average return period of approximately 3 5 years at the weather stations tea tree well and territory grape farm and alice springs airport and less frequent with approximately 5 years recurrence period at tea tree well fig 5 these heavy rainfall events up to 150 mm were generally most likely to occur during the summer wet season december february extreme rainfall events with total rainfall amounts between 150 and 200 mm were found to have an average return period of approximately 9 years at alice springs airport and 11 6 years at tea tree well and territory grape farm events with more than 200 mm of precipitation occurred less frequent at tea tree well station approximately once every 16 years than at alice springs airport once every 12 8 years while at territory grape farm they are equally frequent as the 150 200 mm events most of the 150 200 mm and 200 mm events took place between february and april during the summer monsoon season november april and can be linked to the el niño southern oscillation enso king et al 2014 3 2 simulated soil water balance for vegetated soil estimated mean annual recharge rates for a mulga savanna type vegetated soil calculated for the three weather stations ranged from 0 18 model 4 to 27 03 model 7 mm a between the different ptf models with an average of 5 49 mm a across all three stations and all ptf models fig 6 see supp mat 4 for details in general estimated recharge rates are highest for the tea tree well with an average annual recharge rate of 7 36 mm a compared to the territory grape farm 4 87 mm a and the alice springs airport 4 25 mm a datasets the uncertainty in hydraulic properties captured by the multi model approach is largest for the tea tree well site range is from 0 18 to 27 03 mm a and smallest for the alice springs airport dataset range is from 0 18 to 15 12 mm a estimated mean annual actual evapotranspiration rates for bare soil ranged from about 368 mm a class averaged ptf by wösten et al 1999 to approximately 268 mm a point estimation ptf by varallyay et al 1982 averaging at about 317 7 mm a root water uptake plant transpiration ranged greatly between the different models from 33 mm a point estimation ptf by varallyay et al 1982 to 130 mm a parametric ptf by vereecken et al 1989 supp mat 5 for vegetated soil the three lowest recharge rates were all from point estimation ptfs models 6 3 and 4 while the highest and second highest recharge were from a parametric model 7 and a class averaged model 11 ptf the overall lowest recharge rates were simulated using soil hydraulic properties calculated with the point estimation ptfs by varallyay et al 1982 model 6 gupta and larson 1979 model 3 and hall et al 1977 model 4 the largest recharge 27 0 mm a was 150 times larger than the smallest 0 18 mm a the estimation of soil hydraulic properties with the ptf model by varallyay et al 1982 resulted in water retention curves that were very similar for the three soil materials with the parameters α 0 001 0 002 0 001 and n 4 3 4 185 4 957 for materials 1 2 and 3 respectively and a distinct shape that is more typical for a clayey soil during major precipitation events rainfall rates easily exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil with water then building up on the surface and evaporating this is reflected in the low water uptake by transpiration and high evaporation rates calculated with the ptf model by varallyay et al 1982 the gupta and larson 1979 ptf is distinct from the others as it has the overall smallest n parameters for all three materials typical of a clay soil this results in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values that are much smaller than all the other models fig 3 reducing the ability of the model to transmit water to deeper layers the hydraulic properties generated with the ptf model 4 by hall et al 1977 also resulted in relatively low recharge rates 0 38 mm a the ability to retain more soil moisture in the surface layers resulted in estimated transpiration rates that were moderately higher compared to the other point estimation models 102 mm a compared to 85 mm a for model 3 thus most of the infiltrating water did not pass the root zone supp material 5 the parametric ptf model by vereecken et al 1989 model 7 and the class averaged ptfs by meyer et al 1997 model 9 and wösten et al 1999 model 11 resulted in the highest station averaged recharge estimates 20 mm a 7 mm a and 14 1 mm a the corresponding water retention curves are more characteristic for sandy soils that release pore water relatively easy for all three materials fig 3 actual evapotranspiration rates among the three sites displayed a different behaviour compared to recharge supp material 5 tea tree well now has the largest uncertainty range is from 277 57 to 357 27 mm a while alice springs airport has the smallest uncertainty range is from 299 33 to 338 53 mm a 3 3 simulated soil water balance bare soil versus vegetated soil as is evident from the previous discussion water uptake by plants exerted a significant influence on recharge estimates with all estimates equal to or smaller than 20 mm a simulated recharge rates for a bare soil on the other hand were up to 157 times higher 28 3 versus 0 18 mm a than for a savanna type vegetation when calculated with the ptf model after varallyay et al 1982 and about 5 times higher than the average of all ptfs 29 5 versus 5 5 mm a fig 6 and supp mat 4 the smallest difference between bare and vegetated was about a factor 2 5 using the pft model from vereecken et al 1989 the overall largest recharge value for bare soil at tea tree well territory grape farm and alice springs airport was 69 45 57 52 and 53 63 mm a respectively supp mat 5 the largest recharge 69 5 mm a was 24 times larger than the smallest 2 9 mm a estimated mean annual evaporation rates from the bare soil ranged from 218 03 mm a calculated with pft after bruand et al 1994 for alice springs airport to 276 71 mm a calculated with the class averaged ptf by wösten et al 1999 averaging at about 245 50 mm a the highest estimate of evaporation 264 mm a was up to 1 2 times higher than the smallest estimate 219 mm a for all three stations thus showing a very similar range between the different ptf approaches compared to simulated evapotranspiration rates highest 1 25 times larger than smallest the variation in evapotranspiration introduced by using different pfts is thus much smaller than the variation in recharge thus different components of the soil water balance display different sensitivity towards the use of different ptfs because considerable portions of the arid zone landscape where recharge occurs have patches of bare soil cleverly et al 2013 large spatial heterogeneity in recharge is expected based on the above differences between bare and vegetated surfaces such heterogeneities complicate the estimation of regional scale recharge values and require explicit consideration of land cover variability for recharge calculations topographic depressions that accumulate runoff will further contribute to recharge heterogeneity an example of such focused recharge is available from wood et al 2017 who using a groundwater model calibrated to c 14 and hydraulic head data found the highest recharge rates between 10 and 15 mm a in the inferred flood out area of the allungra creek ti tree basin 3 4 space time analysis of intermittent recharge numerically simulated water contents for vegetated soil in the unsaturated regolith displayed in a space time window illustrate the relationship between extreme rainfall events at the tea tree well climate station and deep recharge at the bottom of the 12 m model profile fig 7 these graphs were based on simulated grid data with a vertical spatial resolution of approximately 1 cm i e 1000 data points and a temporal resolution of 134 days 346 data points this dataset revealed the highest number of recorded extreme rainfall events and resulted in the highest simulated recharge rates the depth time visualisations of simulated water content based on the ptf models by gupta and larson 1979 hall et al 1977 and varallyay et al 1982 illustrate that the water content in the bottom layer barely changes over the entire time series and that the major amount of infiltrating water did not pass through the root zone and thus did not reach the bottom of the soil profile these models resulted in the lowest estimates of mean recharge rates simulations based on the ptf models by vereecken et al 1989 meyer et al 1997 petersen et al 1968 and wösten et al 1999 resulted in the highest estimates of annual recharge this is also reflected in the corresponding visualisations of the water content distribution throughout the profile that illustrate elevated water contents in the bottom layer of the profile after extreme rainfall events fig 7 the corresponding bottom flux at the lowest layer of the soil profile for both bare and vegetated soil is illustrated for these pft models in fig 8 4 discussion the large variation in water retention curves and hydraulic conductivity relationships and the corresponding variation in estimated recharge emphasises the large conceptual model uncertainty introduced when estimating soil hydraulic properties using different ptfs the significant difference in estimated soil hydraulic properties emphasises the importance of a multi model approach in order to capture such uncertainty and provide an ensemble of outputs rather than a single output based on a single ptf e g wang et al 2009 our study revealed that the recharge component of the water balance model is most sensitive to the specified soil properties especially to those of the upper soil layer guber et al 2006 stated that the uncertainty in ptf predictions due to their use outside of the geographical regions where they were derived represents one of the major limitations about ptfs in this study no ptfs developed for australian soils were implemented although several studies regarding water retention characteristics are available for australian soils bristow et al 1997 cresswell and paydar 1996 kaur et al 2002 williams et al 1992 smettem and gregory 1996 minasny et al 1999 noted that due to the distinctive properties of australian soils ptfs developed for other regions might not be suitable to yield appropriate estimates when applied to australian soils despite these recommendations many studies have used a range of ptfs developed for various types of soil from specific geographical regions for the estimation of soil hydraulic properties in other regions e g cresswell et al 2006 jacques and mallants 2009 wang et al 2009 thus rather than using a single ptf multiple ptfs were used in this study to account for conceptual model uncertainty in generating soil hydraulic properties as proposed by several authors e g gaiser et al 2000 guber et al 2006 jacques and mallants 2009 wang et al 2009 wösten et al 2001 this approach yielded average annual recharge rates for a vegetated soil of approximately 5 49 mm a station averaged range 0 18 20 mm a which is roughly consistent with results from previous studies in the same study area but using different approaches harrington et al 2002 conducted a study in the ti tree basin using radiocarbon 14c as a tracer for local groundwater recharge and estimated recharge rates in flood out areas along the ephemeral streams woodforde river and allungra creek ranged from approximately 0 2 to 50 mm a while estimated rates of diffuse recharge for other regions in the basin were generally less than 1 mm a another approach based on the chloride mass balance method by the same authors resulted in recharge rates with a range of 0 1 to approximately 2 mm a in a modelling study in the ti tree basin chen et al 2014 used the coupled water and carbon ecohydrological model waves water atmosphere vegetation energy and solutes and found annual mean average recharge rates of approximately 6 mm a under mulga vegetation harrington et al 2002 used the stable isotopes deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o as tracers to identify the spatial extent of local and diffuse recharge mechanisms they concluded that groundwater had been evaporated to a certain extent prior to recharge due to its isotopic composition by comparing the general trend of groundwater 2h and 18o compositions relative to the mean composition of monthly rainfall and the rainfall line the authors found that events of 150 200 mm rainfall are required to provide significant recharge furthermore large variations in measured 2h and 18o compositions of the basin s groundwater indicated large spatial and temporal variability in recharge rates and recharge mechanisms throughout the basin harrington et al 2002 while these observations are consistent with our numerical study simulated fluxes at the bottom of the regolith profile over a century long time scale realised in this study indicated that only events of more than 200 mm led to a significant replenishment of the aquifer the simulated bottom flux response to extreme rainfall events for most selected ptfs also correlates well with relatively high values for the standardized precipitation index spi fig 9 the spi represents a probability index for the identification of wet and dry climatic cycles that can be used as an indicator for soil moisture small time scales of several months reservoir storage and groundwater table development long time scales of 12 months or more mckee et al 1993 negative values indicate various levels of drought with values as low as 2 referred to as extreme drought mckee et al 1995 although this study focusses on wet conditions and not on drought the positive spi values are a useful indicator of recharge generating wet spells the spi used in our study compared 12 consecutive months of precipitation record to the mean value based on the long term precipitation record the highest consecutive spi for several months was reached in 1974 and 1975 where the spi reaches up to 3 for almost two years except for a short period in between during this time two relatively short separated 200 mm events were recorded at tea tree well the largest downward bottom flux was simulated around 1974 77 corresponding to a record series of consecutive extreme rainfall events separated by relatively short time intervals fig 9 for the years 1982 1984 the spi is almost constantly above 1 and reached a maximum of above 2 in 1984 the peak in spi in 1984 can be linked to single high rainfall events of almost 190 mm in february 1982 and of about 350 mm in march 1983 fig 4 all of the displayed significant bottom fluxes seem to respond to these wet periods for the 1983 event response times between the extreme rain event and peak recharge vary between ptf approaches by up to 6 months the large bottom flux in 1984 is generated by the extreme rainfall event in march 1983 350 mm in combination with the wetter antecedent soil conditions that were caused mainly by the event in february 1982 190 mm between 1989 and 2000 significant rainfall events occurred very infrequently and the spi depicts a pronounced frequency of dry periods i e negative spi values reflected in relatively low bottom fluxes less than 0 01 mm a fig 9 another relatively wet period with two 200 mm events in april 2000 and january 2001 again results in considerable bottom fluxes the impact of the antecedent moisture conditions is very pronounced also for the alice springs airport case fig 10 shows simulation results for soil moisture variations in the vadose zone at different depth and the bottom flux for the pft after vereecken et al 1989 and meyer et al 1997 and the corresponding spi 12 for the alice springs airport data set the effect of antecedent moisture can be demonstrated by comparing the effects of the 200 mm event in 1972 that is preceded by a dry period with negative spi with those of the 200 mm event in 1974 that happens within a wet period and is preceded by several month of positive spi for the vereecken et al 1989 pft the 1972 event displays an infiltrating water front that is only pronounced in the upper layers of the soil profile at 0 9 and 3 5 m depth while after the event in 1974 the water front progressed until the lowest layers of the profile and thus generated a significant bottom flux this effect is also noticeable for the smaller 150 200 mm events in 1976 where the wetter than usual soil condition generated a significant bottom flux another factor that contributed to the magnitude of recharge next to the soil moisture condition is the water that is provided to the soil profile by subsequent rainfall events for the first event in 1972 there is little or no additional rainfall whereas for the events in 1974 and 1976 there is considerable additional rainfall after the extreme events that contributed to the generation of recharge the propagation of the water pulse through the vadose zone is similar for all recharge generating events with the peak in bottom flux occurring approximately 200 days after the rainfall events for the ptf after meyer et al 1997 only the two events in 1976 that happened in close temporal proximity and are both preceded by a significant period of wetter soil conditions as well as followed by again a relatively long and pronounced wet period led to a significant bottom flux further details of the rain events with total rainfall exceeding 150 mm for tea tree well and territory grape farm stations are provided in table 2 for the period 1970 1990 the period 1970 1979 represents the wettest decade of the entire 130 year rainfall record with 449 mm year on average based on tea tree well although the period 1980 1989 was not particularly wet 283 mm year on average it was added to the previous decade to have a sufficiently long time series for analysis both stations are within the ti tree basin and separated by approximately 40 km with both stations at nearly the same distance from the drill site especially the first decade of this period is characterised as relatively wet with six rain events 150 mm in the period 1972 1977 the longest period of uninterrupted rain days was 14 with a total rainfall of 353 4 mm tea tree well by comparison the long term annual mean rainfall at tea tree well station is 277 mm daily rainfall distribution during these eight events is similar correlation coefficient 0 91 between tea tree well and territory grape farm station see supp material 6 start and end of these rain events is nearly identical although the total rain amount does differ with the largest difference nearly 80 mm for event 4 table 2 the recharge events linked to each of these rain events will be discussed next based on the rainfall data from tea tree well as example as discussed above this station produced the largest average recharge across all ptfs supp material 4 out of the eight events listed in table 2 only three experienced ponding conditions event 1 2 and 6 the ponding depth was typically less than 2 cm while the duration of the ponding was 0 5 day for event 1 1 day for event 2 and 1 5 days for event 6 this shows that at least for the time series 1970 1990 the assumption of 10 cm maximum head at the surface is justified note that for the entire period 1889 2016 the threshold of 10 cm pressure head was exceeded only once 1991 due to a rainfall event that recorded 293 mm in just two days in reality ponding is likely to occur more frequently and with greater ponding depths however the simulations are limited by the daily timestep at which rainfall data is available because the rainfall intensities are averaged out over an entire day there is probably and underestimation of higher intensity rain bursts within a day indeed rainfall intensity duration curves e g for alice springs clearly show high intensity short duration sub daily rain events up to 50 mm h for an hourly event given a return period of 20 years gyasi agyei and mahbub 2007 the effect of using hourly or daily rainfall data on runoff and recharge was demonstrated by batalha et al 2018 for fine textured soil in brazil their simulations showed considerable runoff for hourly rainfall data compared to almost no runoff for daily data as a result recharge for hourly data was smaller by a factor of 2 than when daily data was used the rainfall distribution from 1970 to 1990 is shown in fig 11 with indication of eight rain events that exceeded 150 mm numbers as per table 2 the water flux at the bottom of the soil profile calculated with the ptf of vereecken for bare and vegetated soil can be linked to nearly all these events fig 11 as will be shown later this is the only ptf for which the bottom flux responds to nearly each rain event 150 mm only the first rain event does not generate any significant recharge above the background this is due to the drier antecedent moisture conditions compared to the subsequent events for the rain events 2 6 the time between the occurrence of the rain and the peak flux ranges from 200 event 2 to 300 event 6 days for rain event 7 and 8 it takes between 440 event 8 and 500 event 7 days for the rain event to propagate through the entire soil profile the larger transit times for events 7 and 8 compared to events 2 6 are due to the drier antecedent moisture conditions for the former the impact of the antecedent moisture condition is also visible when comparing fluxes calculated for the bare and vegetated soil for the latter fluxes are nearly as high as those for the bare soil only when the previous history was wet e g for events 4 5 and 6 when the prior condition was drier as for event 2 3 and 7 and 8 the fluxes from vegetated soil are considerably smaller than for the bare soil fig 11 the predictive capacity of the pfts to generate realistic fluxes was tested by comparison with observed groundwater levels in two nearby monitoring wells rn005507 and rn006543 the response of the groundwater levels to major rain events is clearly visible fig 11 bottom panel with groundwater levels increasing by approximately 2 m for rn005507 and 2 5 m for rn006543 in response to a series of rain events 2 6 the observed response has a limited temporal resolution of one month at best therefore the response curve is somewhat smoothed and reflect the integral effect of several events rather than showing detailed responses to each individual event nevertheless the series of calculated fluxes agree relatively well in terms of their timing and relative magnitude rain event 5 generates the overall largest flux which corresponds with the greatest single increase in groundwater level rain events 7 and 8 generate a visibly smaller bottom flux which again is relatively well represented in the groundwater level for both monitoring wells fig 11 bottom panel there is again a good agreement with the timing of the increase in groundwater level while the magnitude of the increase is proportional to the flux roughly 0 5 m rn005507 for a peak flux of about 0 03 cm day event 8 versus 2 m for a maximum peak flux of 0 15 cm day events 2 6 after a peak in groundwater level linked to event 5 a decreasing trend in groundwater level is observed there may be several reasons why event 6 does not result in a significant increase in groundwater level one possible reason is the highly localised nature of some of the rain events note that the distance between groundwater bores and the tea tree well weather station was about 10 km testing this assumption based on total rainfall across the tea tree well station and territory grape farm approximately 30 km from the groundwater bores revealed a total cumulative rainfall of 324 mm for tea tree well station event 6 included 12 consecutive days of rain while 293 mm for territory grape farm based on 11 consecutive days of rain while these amounts are not the same they are of a similar magnitude and therefore rainfall variability could be discounted as explanation a more plausible explanation is that the groundwater response due to recharge from event 6 is masked to some degree by the already high groundwater level after the greatest recharge flux associated with event 5 close inspection of groundwater bore rn006543 shows some flattening of the groundwater level at the time of the peak flux i e at year 1978 in other words event 6 causes a delay in the decrease in groundwater level after reaching its highest level about 16 5 m below ground surface for rn006543 and just over 14 m for rn005507 linked to event 5 the good agreement between timing of peak bottom fluxes and observed rise in groundwater level is not unique for the ptf of vereecken three more ptfs display a relatively similar behaviour fig 12 meyer petersen and woesten c while each of the time series of bottom fluxes is unique for a given ptf their overall behaviour is very similar there are several spikes corresponding to the series of rain events 2 6 while only a single flux is predicted for the rain events 7 8 within each of these two groups of events the magnitude of the fluxes is comparatively similar each of these four ptfs therefore has a similar ability to predict groundwater recharge the cumulative recharge averaged over the period 1970 1989 for the ptfs of vereecken woesten c petersen and meyer is 84 84 72 and 43 mm a respectively these 20 year averaged recharge values correspond to 23 23 20 and 12 of the total annual rainfall based on tea tree well the annual rainfall for the period 1970 1989 amounts to 366 mm compared to 277 mm as the long term average or 31 higher than the average recall that the long term average recharge of rainfall in tea tree well in parentheses for these four ptfs was 27 9 8 17 8 6 2 10 4 3 8 and 10 7 3 9 mm a supp mat 4 among the ptfs that displayed a minimal recharge rate even for the wetter period 1970 1989 only the ptfs of bruand canarche and schaap showed a response to the series of extreme rain events while the ptfs of gupta hall and woesten f remained unresponsive fig 12 the cumulative recharge averaged over the period 1970 1989 for the ptfs of bruand canarche and schaap is 19 21 and 20 mm year respectively these 20 year averaged recharge values correspond to 5 6 and 5 of the total annual rainfall based on tea tree well estimated total recharge for the period 1970 1989 was calculated on the basis of recharge from events 2 6 and from events 7 8 for the first series of events total recharge amounted to 1044 and 202 mm or 1246 mm in total this represents 75 of the total recharge for the 20 year period based on the recharge generated for the full 130 year timeseries 3442 mm the 1970 1989 recharge represents 36 of overall total recharge the recharge generated during the wettest decade 1970 1979 only corresponds to 30 of the overall total recharge for events 2 6 the total duration of recharge was calculated to be 1463 days for events 7 8 the recharge lasted 1344 days these results underscore again the importance of consecutive extreme rainfall events in generating significant groundwater recharge the more these events are clustered in this case five extreme events in three years the more they generate recharge owing to wetter starting conditions at the onset of the rain events analysis of climate data from the study area revealed a high spatial variability in rainfall throughout the basin running the simulations with multiple profiles of soil hydraulic properties for several different climate datasets as well as for a bare and a vegetated soil revealed that the spatial variation of precipitation soil hydraulic properties vegetation and hydrologic conditions results in essentially diversifying groundwater recharge across the landscape although mean annual rainfall amounts recorded at territory grape farm were higher compared to the mean annual record at tea tree well and alice springs airport the highest annual recharge rates were calculated for the tea tree well dataset analysis of rainfall records from the three different pluviography stations revealed that a smaller number of extreme rainfall events with more than 200 mm was recorded at the weather station tea tree well average return period of about 16 years than at the other two stations average return period of 11 6 and 12 8 years at territory grape farm and alice springs airport respectively this emphasises again the hypothesis that local recharge rates are not governed by the total annual rainfall but rather by highly infrequent and geographically constrained extreme rainfall events for regional scale estimates of recharge simulations should account for spatial variations in soil properties and topographic features of the region especially topographic depressions stream beds and flood out areas in general vadose zone methods provide estimates of potential recharge while techniques based on groundwater data yield estimates of actual recharge scanlon et al 2002 thus implications for a further extension of the numerical model include the incorporation of topographic characteristics such as the percentage of surface area that experiences flooding after extreme rainfall events and specific ponding characteristics of the soil e g depression storage ephemeral streams flood plains this would allow the application of the model to a regional scale and the estimation of regional scale total recharge amounts furthermore a combination of a modelling approach and tracer based studies could be useful to validate and constrain the hydrologic model and to accurately identify the provenance of infiltrating water several global circulation models indicate that the frequency of extreme rainfall events will decrease while both variability and unpredictability of those events will increase cai et al 2012 charles et al 2008 according to csiro commonwealth scientific and industrial research 2015 global and regional studies point towards a lower frequency of tropical cyclones but with greater proportion of high intensity events heavy precipitation and strong winds under the assumption that those extreme rainfall events represent the major source of groundwater recharge a decrease of those events would potentially entail a decrease of groundwater replenishment we see future research potential in studying those boundary conditions under the assumption of potential climate pathways e g less frequent but higher magnitude rainfall events the uncertainties in different recharge estimation methods emphasises the importance of applying multiple models to increase the reliability of estimates scanlon et al 2002 furthermore realistic estimations of water use by vegetation and a sound understanding of climate related land cover changes are essential for the realistic estimation of groundwater recharge which is a key input to sustainable groundwater management chen et al 2014 zhang et al 1999a 1999b estimated mean annual evapotranspiration rates of about 324 mm a are consistent with actual evapotranspiration rates calculated by the australian bureau of meteorology bom bureau of meteorology australia 2016 the comparison of simulations for bare soil and vegetated soil emphasises the significant effect of vegetation on local recharge rates the influence of vegetation on hydrologic fluxes in shallow desert soils and thick unsaturated zones was previously demonstrated by garcia et al 2011 and scanlon et al 2006 in their study garcia et al 2011 analysed the effects of plant water uptake and its interaction with vapour flow processes in the unsaturated zone they found that plant roots are mainly supplied by thermally driven vapour fluxes and corresponding condensation supplemented moisture during the dry seasons and emphasised the major effects of plant water uptake on water balances in desert soils where total water fluxes are generally low furthermore the same authors determined that root water uptake is also coupled with non isothermal vapour flow thus a combination of the present modelling approach of water fluxes and root water uptake with vapour flow modelling could provide a more profound overview of hydrologic fluxes in the unsaturated zone in arid environments chen et al 2014 and eamus et al 2013 found that seasonal variations of the lai and vegetation water use have a significant influence on root water uptake variations in simulated lai of 0 12 0 35 for the overstory canopy and 0 07 0 21 for the understory canopy resulted in a change of the annual plant water uptake ranging from 64 to 600 mm a chen et al 2014 furthermore scanlon et al 2006 found that a rapid increase in vegetation productivity due to an elevation in seasonal water supply by precipitation reduced the soil pore water volume by half inhibiting groundwater recharge hence the implementation of time variable vegetation parameters seasonal variations of the lai and seasonal root growth tables to account for seasonal changes in land cover and vegetation characteristics can help to draw a more realistic scenario of vegetation properties in this semi arid region however an accurate incorporation of root growth tables into the model can prove to be a challenging task as native vegetation does not mainly change due to seasonality but its growth is rather coupled to the infrequent water supply 5 conclusions this study used a vadose zone numerical modelling study conducted in the ti tree basin central australia to confirm the hypothesis that recharge in the arid ti tree basin is strongly dependent on infrequent extreme rainfall events analysis of the century long precipitation records revealed extreme rainfall events linked to monsoonal thunderstorms during the summer months that have an average return period of 11 12 years for a 150 mm rainfall event and up to almost 16 years for events with more than 200 mm rainfall a multi model approach by means of multiple ptfs provided a convenient tool when facing data scarcity on soil properties results of the century long recharge simulations revealed the highly infrequent nature of groundwater recharge in arid central australia and the strong dependency of the regional water budget on extreme rainfall events analysis of detailed moisture content distributions throughout the soil profile over the century long time series revealed that events of at least 200 mm are required to overcome evaporation and root water uptake and thus to potentially generate recharge to the aquifer multiple extreme rainfall events occurring within shorter time frames are more likely to result in a replenishment of the groundwater aquifer due to the higher antecedent moisture condition of the soil results from this study contribute to a better comprehension of highly episodic and land cover dependent recharge in this semi arid environment by identifying and quantifying recharge generating events and drawing an important connection between groundwater replenishment and specific climatological features further characterisation of vegetation parameters will help to minimise the model uncertainty and to yield a more realistic depiction on vegetation water use the current model can be extended regarding temperature gradients and vapour flow processes which have an influence on vegetation properties and evapotranspiration processes an integrated modelling approach would combine this model with a land surface component that can yield regional scale recharge values such an integrated model could be used to assess and predict future recharge amounts the effects of climate change and changes in land

8007,understanding the factors controlling groundwater recharge in arid vadose zones is critical for sustainable groundwater management in the face of climate variability and change here we estimated groundwater recharge in data sparse regions under arid climate by implementing a multi model approach using hydrus 1d for a century long time series of meteorological data and site specific regolith hydraulic properties of a bare soil and a mulga savanna type soil in central australia grain size analysis provided a contiguous 12 m deep profile of hydraulic properties that were generated by means of pedotransfer functions to account for conceptual model uncertainty in hydraulic properties eleven pedotransfer functions were applied climate data from three stations accounted for spatial heterogeneity in local climate of the ti tree basin study area simulated water fluxes in the vadose zone indicated that only rainfall events of more than 150 200 mm resulted in groundwater recharge recharge was linked to extreme rainfall associated with monsoonal cyclones based on the 130 year climate record average recharge for the savanna type vegetation ranged from 4 3 to 7 4 mm a across the three climate stations with an overall mean of 4 6 mm a the bare soil had an overall mean recharge of 29 5 mm a ranging from 23 5 to 35 8 mm a results from this study provide a better understanding of

national research council 2012 facing the threat of water deficits the accurate quantification of recharge rates and a sound understanding of the effects of climate variations and change on groundwater replenishment are essential for sustainable groundwater management especially in arid regions with often limited water resources determining the sustainability of groundwater resources requires accurate estimates of the groundwater balance i e the storage volumes extraction and recharge rates chen et al 2014 in semi arid and arid regions increasing the reliability of estimates of available water resources will to a large degree depend on the ability to reduce the uncertainty about the rate of groundwater recharge de vries and simmers 2002 ntgov northern territory government 2009 scanlon et al 2006 main impediments to the estimation of recharge in arid and semi arid regions are the low values of total annual recharge amounts and the highly infrequent nature of recharge that is not necessarily coupled to seasonality berry et al 2011 morton et al 2011 recharge in arid and semi arid regions is hypothesised to be highly intermittent and related to extreme precipitation and associated flooding events villeneuve et al 2015 in australia s arid interior recharge to aquifers is related to soil infiltration of rainfall during extreme rainfall events seepage from river channels and other topographic depression and the infiltration from flood out areas harrington et al 1999 2002 magee 2009 read and tickell 2007 zhang et al 1999a 1999b recharge estimation in australia s arid zones have most often relied on the use of environmental tracers for instance using a tracer based approach harrington et al 2002 found that rainfall events of at least 150 200 mm are required to generate significant recharge in the ti tree basin northern territory despite numerous other studies on recharge in central australia s arid regions e g calf et al 1991 harrington et al 1999 harrington et al 2002 knapton 2005 2006a 2007 ride 1968 wood et al 2014 recharge rates are found to vary widely depending on the methodology for instance recharge varied between 0 1 and 50 mm a mean 3 5 mm a based on a c 14 tracer approach while recharge derived from the chloride mass balance method was between 0 1 and 2 mm a mean 0 8 mm a harrington et al 2002 for the same region analysis of groundwater level data resulted in a recharge rate of 2 mm a ntgov northern territory government 2009 an alternative approach to estimating recharge from tracer analysis is by means of simulation modelling of vadose zone processes garcia et al 2011 hydrodynamic process based vadose zone models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 are commonly used tools for the estimation of groundwater recharge however comprehensive vadose zone modelling is often limited by the requirement for many input parameters for climate soil and vegetation gaiser et al 2000 unfortunately the availability of reliable data on water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity of soils in arid and semi arid regions is often poor gaiser et al 2000 as a result the complexity and variability of the relationships between rainfall soil water flow and groundwater recharge remain insufficiently understood one way to overcome the paucity of soil hydraulic properties is through pedotransfer functions that use readily available soil data in statistical relationships to obtain soil hydraulic properties they have proven to be a valuable tool to close this data gap bouma 1989 gaiser et al 2000 guber

approach to gain a better understanding of highly episodic and landcover dependent recharge in an arid environment by identifying recharge generating events we analyse local recharge mechanisms and annual recharge rates based on the vadose zone simulator hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 we generate hydraulic properties for the approximately 12 m thick unsaturated regolith from a set of 11 pedotransfer functions ptfs that use grain size organic matter and bulk density data collected from core samples as predictor variables multiple ptfs were used to account for conceptual model uncertainty in generating hydraulic properties the value of multi model approaches to address conceptual model uncertainty in hydrogeology was recently highlighted by enemark et al 2019 the study area is placed within the ti tree basin northern territory located in australia s arid interior to cover sufficient temporal variability in rainfall data and thus temporal variability in recharge meteorological records over a century long timescale were used the variability in recharge across the landscape due to spatial variability in climatologic boundary conditions will be tackled by running the simulations for several meteorological datasets recorded at three different weather stations throughout the study area the effect of landcover variability on recharge was tested by considering a bare soil and a soil covered by a savanna type vegetation 2 materials and method 2 1 site characteristics the ti tree basin covers an area of approximately 5500 km2 between latitude 22

regions in central australia experience most of the annual rainfall during extreme rainfall events in the summer months those events are generally linked to monsoonal thunderstorms that arise in the tropics travel southwards and precipitate over central australia hobday and lough 2011 thus spatial and temporal variability of precipitation can be very high throughout the basin to account for the spatial variability in rainfall climate records from three nearby stations were used meteorological data including daily precipitation wind speed solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperatures

2013 dunkerley 2002 garcia et al 2011 scanlon et al 2005 2006 simulated recharge rates at 4 m soil depth for the ti tree basin by chen et al 2014 varied from an average of 6 mm per year for vegetated soil to an average of 236 mm per year for bare soil for relatively short timeseries 1981 2012 several lysimeter studies in arid environments showed that evapotranspiration from vegetated soils were up

the tengger desert china and the chihuahuan and mojave deserts us indicated that vegetation inhibited recharge up to 100 wang et al 2004 scanlon et al 2005 vegetation in the ti tree basin is limited in its diversity due to the arid climatic conditions the most common vegetation are small mulga trees acacia aneura and related species fig 1 that grow predominantly on dark red massive clay and loam rich soil and large areas of spinifex grass trioda spp that cover the better drained red earthy sands mulga shrubs generally reach a canopy height of 2 8 m with an average height of about 6 5 m and a relatively shallow rooting depth chen et al 2014 eamus et al 2013 studies by anderson et al 2008 and hill and hill 2003 indicated that root water uptake by mulga trees becomes irrelevant at soil

soil sampling and analysis undisturbed core samples were obtained from a drill core collected in the centre of the basin rn018894c 133 586059 long 22 282595 lat and were taken every 0 5 m from 0 to 12

pedotransfer functions detailed parameterisation of soil water retention characteristics and the hydraulic conductivity are required for any vadose zone flow modelling guber et al 2006 wang et al 2009 wösten et al 2001 however temporal and spatial variability in hydraulic characteristics of the soil as well as costly and time consuming measurements with sophisticated instruments often impede the collection of field data on water retention characteristics especially if large areas need to be covered pedotransfer functions ptfs have proven to be a cost effective tool for the estimation of soil hydraulic properties based on readily available soil data such as textural fractions bulk density and organic matter content guber et al 2006 jacques and mallants 2009 minasny and mcbratney 2000 vereecken et al 1989 wang et al 2009 wösten et al 2001 to account for conceptual model uncertainty in generated soil hydraulic properties we adopted a multi model approach using eleven different ptfs the selection of ptfs was based on available input data obtained from core samples and on their applicability to generate the van genuchten mualem model parameters mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 that were used for the numerical simulations with hydrus 1d the parametric van genuchten water retention model describes the mathematical relation between soil pressure head h l and the soil moisture content θ l3 l3 van genuchten 1980 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water content l3 l3 respectively and α l 1 n and m 1 1 n are curve shape parameters the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity relationship is defined by the 2 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t s e θ θ r θ s θ r is effective saturation and l is the pore connectivity parameter set to 0 5 mualem 1976 three types of ptfs were used point estimation parametric and class ptfs ptfs based on point estimation table 1 ptfs 1 6 generate specific water content pressure head points θ h on the water retention curve most commonly the soil water content at field capacity 33 kpa and at the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa is estimated those two point estimates are necessary to determine water availability for plants minasny et al 1999 the point estimation ptfs used in this approach provided only those two points of the soil water retention curve two additional points were generated by fixing the residual water content θ r at 0 001 l3 l3 while the saturated water content θ s was set equal to the total porosity η derived from the measured bulk density fixing mineral density at 2 65 g cm3 e g jacques and mallants 2009 this approach generates a total number of four θ h data points that are used as input for the nonlinear least squares optimisation program retc to fit the van genuchten parameters θ r θ s α and n van genuchten et al 1991 parametric ptfs table 1 ptfs 7 8 consist of parametric functions that can be used to directly predict parameters of a certain retention model such as the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the brooks and corey 1964 model or the campbell 1974 model as such those ptfs yield continuous water retention curves and are therefore considered very suitable for soil water balance modelling finally class averaged ptfs table 1 ptfs 9 11 provide average estimates of soil hydraulic properties based on textural classes in the usda united states department of agriculture 1951 or the fao food and agriculture organisation 1990 classification schemes the resulting van genuchten 1980 water retention curves from using the eleven ptfs for the three identified soil materials silt loam loamy sand and sand are illustrated in fig 3 for parametric values see supp mat 1 3 in general water retention curves display a similar shape with an expected degree of conceptual variability however there are some curves that deviate from the main group including the ptf of varallyay et al 1982 and gupta and larson 1979 both are point estimation ptfs the point estimation ptf by gupta and larson 1979 predicts a retention curve which has the overall smallest n parameter for material 2 1 192 and 3 1 134 combined with a large α parameter for material 2 0 713 and material 3 0 107 the curves show a relatively straight trend with relatively high water contents even at high negative pressure heads as will be shown later simulations with soil properties calculated with the ptf by gupta and larson 1979 result in the lowest and second lowest recharge for the bare and vegetated soil respectively water retention curves estimated with the ptf by varallyay et al 1982 show another distinct trend where the water content barely changes up to negative pressure heads of around 1000 cm material 1 and 3 and 500 cm material 2 consistent with the very small values for the α parameter supp mat 2 3 for the vegetated soil this ptf results in the lowest recharge whereas for a bare soil the recharge ranks 7 11 see further a 12 m deep regolith profile with hydraulic properties was generated from each of the 11 ptfs the ensemble of profiles thus generated is considered to capture conceptual uncertainty associated with the soil hydraulic models which are highly approximative an inherent drawback of ptfs espino et al 1995 only a limited number of ptfs applied in this study also provided an approach to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated with the class averaged ptfs by meyer et al 1997 schaap et al 2001 and wösten et al 1999 rawls et al 1998 calculated median values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for 12 different usda textural classes in an analytical approach guber et al 2006 rawls et al 1998 average values of k s for 12 usda textural classes reported by rawls et al 1998 were used here for the ptf models that did not provide estimates of k s i e all parametric and point estimation ptfs as a result the variability in hydraulic conductivity relationships will be smaller compared to the variability of water retention curves however even though mean values of the hydraulic conductivities from rawls et al 1998 were combined with most of the ptf generated water retention curves unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves plotted versus the saturation degree s e eq 2 still display significant differences as they use parametric values for α and n from their respective water retention models fig 3 2 6 multi model recharge simulation the numerical model was set up within hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 which uses a finite element scheme to numerically solve the richards equation for variably saturated flow soil hydraulic properties are described using the analytical functions by van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 see eqs 1 and 2 simulations were conducted for each of the 11 different profiles of soil hydraulic properties to account for spatial variability in climate throughout the basin three different meteorological input datasets were applied for each of the soil datasets time series of daily meteorological data span the period from january 1889 to december 2015 although only two out of three climate stations are within the catchment boundary tea tree well and territory grape farm and located relatively close to the studied soil profile we assumed that similar soil profiles exist at or nearby the alice springs station located outside the catchment each simulation was run for a bare soil and for a vegetated soil to quantify the effect of plant water uptake on recharge runoff and hysteresis were considered negligible in this study initial conditions of the water content were selected to be at field capacity in hydrus 1d the atmospheric upper boundary condition with surface layer was selected which allows water to build up on the soil surface once the infiltration capacity has been exceeded the depth of this ponding water layer will increase with precipitation and decrease due to infiltration and evapotranspiration šimůnek et al 2013 the maximum ponding depth prior to runoff initiation was set to 10 cm in order to display realistic conditions for depression storage in desert soils e g garcia et al 2011 especially during cyclone events the lower boundary condition was set to free drainage a condition which is applied when the water table lies well below the bottom of the soil profile šimůnek et al 2013 here deeper than 12 m average values for the specific leaf area index lai of mulga vegetation found in literature ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 e g chen et al 2014 cleverly et al 2013 eamus et al 2013 the mean annual lai for mulga vegetation reported by chen et al 2014 from the same study site as ours ranged from 0 12 to 0 35 m2 m2 for the overstory canopy and 0 07 0 21 m2 m2 for the understory canopy in this study we applied an average canopy height of 6 5 m a mean rooting depth of 5 m and an average annual lai of 0 3 m2 m2 based on the studies mentioned above 3 results 3 1 rainfall statistics mean annual rainfall amounts recorded at the three different pluviographic stations ranged from 262 mm a at alice springs airport 277 mm a at tea tree well up to 320 mm a at territory grape farm due to the daily resolution of the applied silo climate datasets bom bureau of meteorology australia 2016 rainfall events were defined as a continuous time period of rainfall separated by at least 24 h of dry weather conditions using this definition a single rainfall event can include several bursts of rainfall with short periods i e 24 h of dry weather in between heavy rainfall events were defined as events of 100 mm of rainfall or more and further differentiated into extreme rainfall events if the total amount of rain exceeded 150 mm or more fig 4 rainfall events of 50 100 mm precipitation were found to occur approximately every year rainfall events of 100 150 mm were recorded with an average return period of approximately 3 5 years at the weather stations tea tree well and territory grape farm and alice springs airport and less frequent with approximately 5 years recurrence period at tea tree well fig 5 these heavy rainfall events up to 150 mm were generally most likely to occur during the summer wet season december february extreme rainfall events with total rainfall amounts between 150 and 200 mm were found to have an average return period of approximately 9 years at alice springs airport and 11 6 years at tea tree well and territory grape farm events with more than 200 mm of precipitation occurred less frequent at tea tree well station approximately once every 16 years than at alice springs airport once every 12 8 years while at territory grape farm they are equally frequent as the 150 200 mm events most of the 150 200 mm and 200 mm events took place between february and april during the summer monsoon season november april and can be linked to the el niño southern oscillation enso king et al 2014 3 2 simulated soil water balance for vegetated soil estimated mean annual recharge rates for a mulga savanna type vegetated soil calculated for the three weather stations ranged from 0 18 model 4 to 27 03 model 7 mm a between the different ptf models with an average of 5 49 mm a across all three stations and all ptf models fig 6 see supp mat 4 for details in general estimated recharge rates are highest for the tea tree well with an average annual recharge rate of 7 36 mm a compared to the territory grape farm 4 87 mm a and the alice springs airport 4 25 mm a datasets the uncertainty in hydraulic properties captured by the multi model approach is largest for the tea tree well site range is from 0 18 to 27 03 mm a and smallest for the alice springs airport dataset range is from 0 18 to 15 12 mm a estimated mean annual actual evapotranspiration rates for bare soil ranged from about 368 mm a class averaged ptf by wösten et al 1999 to approximately 268 mm a point estimation ptf by varallyay et al 1982 averaging at about 317 7 mm a root water uptake plant transpiration ranged greatly between the different models from 33 mm a point estimation ptf by varallyay et al 1982 to 130 mm a parametric ptf by vereecken et al 1989 supp mat 5 for vegetated soil the three lowest recharge rates were all from point estimation ptfs models 6 3 and 4 while the highest and second highest recharge were from a parametric model 7 and a class averaged model 11 ptf the overall lowest recharge rates were simulated using soil hydraulic properties calculated with the point estimation ptfs by varallyay et al 1982 model 6 gupta and larson 1979 model 3 and hall et al 1977 model 4 the largest recharge 27 0 mm a was 150 times larger than the smallest 0 18 mm a the estimation of soil hydraulic properties with the ptf model by varallyay et al 1982 resulted in water retention curves that were very similar for the three soil materials with the parameters α 0 001 0 002 0 001 and n 4 3 4 185 4 957 for materials 1 2 and 3 respectively and a distinct shape that is more typical for a clayey soil during major precipitation events rainfall rates easily exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil with water then building up on the surface and evaporating this is reflected in the low water uptake by transpiration and high evaporation rates calculated with the ptf model by varallyay et al 1982 the gupta and larson 1979 ptf is distinct from the others as it has the overall smallest n parameters for all three materials typical of a clay soil this results in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values that are much smaller than all the other models fig 3 reducing the ability of the model to transmit water to deeper layers the hydraulic properties generated with the ptf model 4 by hall et al 1977 also resulted in relatively low recharge rates 0 38 mm a the ability to retain more soil moisture in the surface layers resulted in estimated transpiration rates that were moderately higher compared to the other point estimation models 102 mm a compared to 85 mm a for model 3 thus most of the infiltrating water did not pass the root zone supp material 5 the parametric ptf model by vereecken et al 1989 model 7 and the class averaged ptfs by meyer et al 1997 model 9 and wösten et al 1999 model 11 resulted in the highest station averaged recharge estimates 20 mm a 7 mm a and 14 1 mm a the corresponding water retention curves are more characteristic for sandy soils that release pore water relatively easy for all three materials fig 3 actual evapotranspiration rates among the three sites displayed a different behaviour compared to recharge supp material 5 tea tree well now has the largest uncertainty range is from 277 57 to 357 27 mm a while alice springs airport has the smallest uncertainty range is from 299 33 to 338 53 mm a 3 3 simulated soil water balance bare soil versus vegetated soil as is evident from the previous discussion water uptake by plants exerted a significant influence on recharge estimates with all estimates equal to or smaller than 20 mm a simulated recharge rates for a bare soil on the other hand were up to 157 times higher 28 3 versus 0 18 mm a than for a savanna type vegetation when calculated with the ptf model after varallyay et al 1982 and about 5 times higher than the average of all ptfs 29 5 versus 5 5 mm a fig 6 and supp mat 4 the smallest difference between bare and vegetated was about a factor 2 5 using the pft model from vereecken et al 1989 the overall largest recharge value for bare soil at tea tree well territory grape farm and alice springs airport was 69 45 57 52 and 53 63 mm a respectively supp mat 5 the largest recharge 69 5 mm a was 24 times larger than the smallest 2 9 mm a estimated mean annual evaporation rates from the bare soil ranged from 218 03 mm a calculated with pft after bruand et al 1994 for alice springs airport to 276 71 mm a calculated with the class averaged ptf by wösten et al 1999 averaging at about 245 50 mm a the highest estimate of evaporation 264 mm a was up to 1 2 times higher than the smallest estimate 219 mm a for all three stations thus showing a very similar range between the different ptf approaches compared to simulated evapotranspiration rates highest 1 25 times larger than smallest the variation in evapotranspiration introduced by using different pfts is thus much smaller than the variation in recharge thus different components of the soil water balance display different sensitivity towards the use of different ptfs because considerable portions of the arid zone landscape where recharge occurs have patches of bare soil cleverly et al 2013 large spatial heterogeneity in recharge is expected based on the above differences between bare and vegetated surfaces such heterogeneities complicate the estimation of regional scale recharge values and require explicit consideration of land cover variability for recharge calculations topographic depressions that accumulate runoff will further contribute to recharge heterogeneity an example of such focused recharge is available from wood et al 2017 who using a groundwater model calibrated to c 14 and hydraulic head data found the highest recharge rates between 10 and 15 mm a in the inferred flood out area of the allungra creek ti tree basin 3 4 space time analysis of intermittent recharge numerically simulated water contents for vegetated soil in the unsaturated regolith displayed in a space time window illustrate the relationship between extreme rainfall events at the tea tree well climate station and deep recharge at the bottom of the 12 m model profile fig 7 these graphs were based on simulated grid data with a vertical spatial resolution of approximately 1 cm i e 1000 data points and a temporal resolution of 134 days 346 data points this dataset revealed the highest number of recorded extreme rainfall events and resulted in the highest simulated recharge rates the depth time visualisations of simulated water content based on the ptf models by gupta and larson 1979 hall et al 1977 and varallyay et al 1982 illustrate that the water content in the bottom layer barely changes over the entire time series and that the major amount of infiltrating water did not pass through the root zone and thus did not reach the bottom of the soil profile these models resulted in the lowest estimates of mean recharge rates simulations based on the ptf models by vereecken et al 1989 meyer et al 1997 petersen et al 1968 and wösten et al 1999 resulted in the highest estimates of annual recharge this is also reflected in the corresponding visualisations of the water content distribution throughout the profile that illustrate elevated water contents in the bottom layer of the profile after extreme rainfall events fig 7 the corresponding bottom flux at the lowest layer of the soil profile for both bare and vegetated soil is illustrated for these pft models in fig 8 4 discussion the large variation in water retention curves and hydraulic conductivity relationships and the corresponding variation in estimated recharge emphasises the large conceptual model uncertainty introduced when estimating soil hydraulic properties using different ptfs the significant difference in estimated soil hydraulic properties emphasises the importance of a multi model approach in order to capture such uncertainty and provide an ensemble of outputs rather than a single output based on a single ptf e g wang et al 2009 our study revealed that the recharge component of the water balance model is most sensitive to the specified soil properties especially to those of the upper soil layer guber et al 2006 stated that the uncertainty in ptf predictions due to their use outside of the geographical regions where they were derived represents one of the major limitations about ptfs in this study no ptfs developed for australian soils were implemented although several studies regarding water retention characteristics are available for australian soils bristow et al 1997 cresswell and paydar 1996 kaur et al 2002 williams et al 1992 smettem and gregory 1996 minasny et al 1999 noted that due to the distinctive properties of australian soils ptfs developed for other regions might not be suitable to yield appropriate estimates when applied to australian soils despite these recommendations many studies have used a range of ptfs developed for various types of soil from specific geographical regions for the estimation of soil hydraulic properties in other regions e g cresswell et al 2006 jacques and mallants 2009 wang et al 2009 thus rather than using a single ptf multiple ptfs were used in this study to account for conceptual model uncertainty in generating soil hydraulic properties as proposed by several authors e g gaiser et al 2000 guber et al 2006 jacques and mallants 2009 wang et al 2009 wösten et al 2001 this approach yielded average annual recharge rates for a vegetated soil of approximately 5 49 mm a station averaged range 0 18 20 mm a which is roughly consistent with results from previous studies in the same study area but using different approaches harrington et al 2002 conducted a study in the ti tree basin using radiocarbon 14c as a tracer for local groundwater recharge and estimated recharge rates in flood out areas along the ephemeral streams woodforde river and allungra creek ranged from approximately 0 2 to 50 mm a while estimated rates of diffuse recharge for other regions in the basin were generally less than 1 mm a another approach based on the chloride mass balance method by the same authors resulted in recharge rates with a range of 0 1 to approximately 2 mm a in a modelling study in the ti tree basin chen et al 2014 used the coupled water and carbon ecohydrological model waves water atmosphere vegetation energy and solutes and found annual mean average recharge rates of approximately 6 mm a under mulga vegetation harrington et al 2002 used the stable isotopes deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o as tracers to identify the spatial extent of local and diffuse recharge mechanisms they concluded that groundwater had been evaporated to a certain extent prior to recharge due to its isotopic composition by comparing the general trend of groundwater 2h and 18o compositions relative to the mean composition of monthly rainfall and the rainfall line the authors found that events of 150 200 mm rainfall are required to provide significant recharge furthermore large variations in measured 2h and 18o compositions of the basin s groundwater indicated large spatial and temporal variability in recharge rates and recharge mechanisms throughout the basin harrington et al 2002 while these observations are consistent with our numerical study simulated fluxes at the bottom of the regolith profile over a century long time scale realised in this study indicated that only events of more than 200 mm led to a significant replenishment of the aquifer the simulated bottom flux response to extreme rainfall events for most selected ptfs also correlates well with relatively high values for the standardized precipitation index spi fig 9 the spi represents a probability index for the identification of wet and dry climatic cycles that can be used as an indicator for soil moisture small time scales of several months reservoir storage and groundwater table development long time scales of 12 months or more mckee et al 1993 negative values indicate various levels of drought with values as low as 2 referred to as extreme drought mckee et al 1995 although this study focusses on wet conditions and not on drought the positive spi values are a useful indicator of recharge generating wet spells the spi used in our study compared 12 consecutive months of precipitation record to the mean value based on the long term precipitation record the highest consecutive spi for several months was reached in 1974 and 1975 where the spi reaches up to 3 for almost two years except for a short period in between during this time two relatively short separated 200 mm events were recorded at tea tree well the largest downward bottom flux was simulated around 1974 77 corresponding to a record series of consecutive extreme rainfall events separated by relatively short time intervals fig 9 for the years 1982 1984 the spi is almost constantly above 1 and reached a maximum of above 2 in 1984 the peak in spi in 1984 can be linked to single high rainfall events of almost 190 mm in february 1982 and of about 350 mm in march 1983 fig 4 all of the displayed significant bottom fluxes seem to respond to these wet periods for the 1983 event response times between the extreme rain event and peak recharge vary between ptf approaches by up to 6 months the large bottom flux in 1984 is generated by the extreme rainfall event in march 1983 350 mm in combination with the wetter antecedent soil conditions that were caused mainly by the event in february 1982 190 mm between 1989 and 2000 significant rainfall events occurred very infrequently and the spi depicts a pronounced frequency of dry periods i e negative spi values reflected in relatively low bottom fluxes less than 0 01 mm a fig 9 another relatively wet period with two 200 mm events in april 2000 and january 2001 again results in considerable bottom fluxes the impact of the antecedent moisture conditions is very pronounced also for the alice springs airport case fig 10 shows simulation results for soil moisture variations in the vadose zone at different depth and the bottom flux for the pft after vereecken et al 1989 and meyer et al 1997 and the corresponding spi 12 for the alice springs airport data set the effect of antecedent moisture can be demonstrated by comparing the effects of the 200 mm event in 1972 that is preceded by a dry period with negative spi with those of the 200 mm event in 1974 that happens within a wet period and is preceded by several month of positive spi for the vereecken et al 1989 pft the 1972 event displays an infiltrating water front that is only pronounced in the upper layers of the soil profile at 0 9 and 3 5 m depth while after the event in 1974 the water front progressed until the lowest layers of the profile and thus generated a significant bottom flux this effect is also noticeable for the smaller 150 200 mm events in 1976 where the wetter than usual soil condition generated a significant bottom flux another factor that contributed to the magnitude of recharge next to the soil moisture condition is the water that is provided to the soil profile by subsequent rainfall events for the first event in 1972 there is little or no additional rainfall whereas for the events in 1974 and 1976 there is considerable additional rainfall after the extreme events that contributed to the generation of recharge the propagation of the water pulse through the vadose zone is similar for all recharge generating events with the peak in bottom flux occurring approximately 200 days after the rainfall events for the ptf after meyer et al 1997 only the two events in 1976 that happened in close temporal proximity and are both preceded by a significant period of wetter soil conditions as well as followed by again a relatively long and pronounced wet period led to a significant bottom flux further details of the rain events with total rainfall exceeding 150 mm for tea tree well and territory grape farm stations are provided in table 2 for the period 1970 1990 the period 1970 1979 represents the wettest decade of the entire 130 year rainfall record with 449 mm year on average based on tea tree well although the period 1980 1989 was not particularly wet 283 mm year on average it was added to the previous decade to have a sufficiently long time series for analysis both stations are within the ti tree basin and separated by approximately 40 km with both stations at nearly the same distance from the drill site especially the first decade of this period is characterised as relatively wet with six rain events 150 mm in the period 1972 1977 the longest period of uninterrupted rain days was 14 with a total rainfall of 353 4 mm tea tree well by comparison the long term annual mean rainfall at tea tree well station is 277 mm daily rainfall distribution during these eight events is similar correlation coefficient 0 91 between tea tree well and territory grape farm station see supp material 6 start and end of these rain events is nearly identical although the total rain amount does differ with the largest difference nearly 80 mm for event 4 table 2 the recharge events linked to each of these rain events will be discussed next based on the rainfall data from tea tree well as example as discussed above this station produced the largest average recharge across all ptfs supp material 4 out of the eight events listed in table 2 only three experienced ponding conditions event 1 2 and 6 the ponding depth was typically less than 2 cm while the duration of the ponding was 0 5 day for event 1 1 day for event 2 and 1 5 days for event 6 this shows that at least for the time series 1970 1990 the assumption of 10 cm maximum head at the surface is justified note that for the entire period 1889 2016 the threshold of 10 cm pressure head was exceeded only once 1991 due to a rainfall event that recorded 293 mm in just two days in reality ponding is likely to occur more frequently and with greater ponding depths however the simulations are limited by the daily timestep at which rainfall data is available because the rainfall intensities are averaged out over an entire day there is probably and underestimation of higher intensity rain bursts within a day indeed rainfall intensity duration curves e g for alice springs clearly show high intensity short duration sub daily rain events up to 50 mm h for an hourly event given a return period of 20 years gyasi agyei and mahbub 2007 the effect of using hourly or daily rainfall data on runoff and recharge was demonstrated by batalha et al 2018 for fine textured soil in brazil their simulations showed considerable runoff for hourly rainfall data compared to almost no runoff for daily data as a result recharge for hourly data was smaller by a factor of 2 than when daily data was used the rainfall distribution from 1970 to 1990 is shown in fig 11 with indication of eight rain events that exceeded 150 mm numbers as per table 2 the water flux at the bottom of the soil profile calculated with the ptf of vereecken for bare and vegetated soil can be linked to nearly all these events fig 11 as will be shown later this is the only ptf for which the bottom flux responds to nearly each rain event 150 mm only the first rain event does not generate any significant recharge above the background this is due to the drier antecedent moisture conditions compared to the subsequent events for the rain events 2 6 the time between the occurrence of the rain and the peak flux ranges from 200 event 2 to 300 event 6 days for rain event 7 and 8 it takes between 440 event 8 and 500 event 7 days for the rain event to propagate through the entire soil profile the larger transit times for events 7 and 8 compared to events 2 6 are due to the drier antecedent moisture conditions for the former the impact of the antecedent moisture condition is also visible when comparing fluxes calculated for the bare and vegetated soil for the latter fluxes are nearly as high as those for the bare soil only when the previous history was wet e g for events 4 5 and 6 when the prior condition was drier as for event 2 3 and 7 and 8 the fluxes from vegetated soil are considerably smaller than for the bare soil fig 11 the predictive capacity of the pfts to generate realistic fluxes was tested by comparison with observed groundwater levels in two nearby monitoring wells rn005507 and rn006543 the response of the groundwater levels to major rain events is clearly visible fig 11 bottom panel with groundwater levels increasing by approximately 2 m for rn005507 and 2 5 m for rn006543 in response to a series of rain events 2 6 the observed response has a limited temporal resolution of one month at best therefore the response curve is somewhat smoothed and reflect the integral effect of several events rather than showing detailed responses to each individual event nevertheless the series of calculated fluxes agree relatively well in terms of their timing and relative magnitude rain event 5 generates the overall largest flux which corresponds with the greatest single increase in groundwater level rain events 7 and 8 generate a visibly smaller bottom flux which again is relatively well represented in the groundwater level for both monitoring wells fig 11 bottom panel there is again a good agreement with the timing of the increase in groundwater level while the magnitude of the increase is proportional to the flux roughly 0 5 m rn005507 for a peak flux of about 0 03 cm day event 8 versus 2 m for a maximum peak flux of 0 15 cm day events 2 6 after a peak in groundwater level linked to event 5 a decreasing trend in groundwater level is observed there may be several reasons why event 6 does not result in a significant increase in groundwater level one possible reason is the highly localised nature of some of the rain events note that the distance between groundwater bores and the tea tree well weather station was about 10 km testing this assumption based on total rainfall across the tea tree well station and territory grape farm approximately 30 km from the groundwater bores revealed a total cumulative rainfall of 324 mm for tea tree well station event 6 included 12 consecutive days of rain while 293 mm for territory grape farm based on 11 consecutive days of rain while these amounts are not the same they are of a similar magnitude and therefore rainfall variability could be discounted as explanation a more plausible explanation is that the groundwater response due to recharge from event 6 is masked to some degree by the already high groundwater level after the greatest recharge flux associated with event 5 close inspection of groundwater bore rn006543 shows some flattening of the groundwater level at the time of the peak flux i e at year 1978 in other words event 6 causes a delay in the decrease in groundwater level after reaching its highest level about 16 5 m below ground surface for rn006543 and just over 14 m for rn005507 linked to event 5 the good agreement between timing of peak bottom fluxes and observed rise in groundwater level is not unique for the ptf of vereecken three more ptfs display a relatively similar behaviour fig 12 meyer petersen and woesten c while each of the time series of bottom fluxes is unique for a given ptf their overall behaviour is very similar there are several spikes corresponding to the series of rain events 2 6 while only a single flux is predicted for the rain events 7 8 within each of these two groups of events the magnitude of the fluxes is comparatively similar each of these four ptfs therefore has a similar ability to predict groundwater recharge the cumulative recharge averaged over the period 1970 1989 for the ptfs of vereecken woesten c petersen and meyer is 84 84 72 and 43 mm a respectively these 20 year averaged recharge values correspond to 23 23 20 and 12 of the total annual rainfall based on tea tree well the annual rainfall for the period 1970 1989 amounts to 366 mm compared to 277 mm as the long term average or 31 higher than the average recall that the long term average recharge of rainfall in tea tree well in parentheses for these four ptfs was 27 9 8 17 8 6 2 10 4 3 8 and 10 7 3 9 mm a supp mat 4 among the ptfs that displayed a minimal recharge rate even for the wetter period 1970 1989 only the ptfs of bruand canarche and schaap showed a response to the series of extreme rain events while the ptfs of gupta hall and woesten f remained unresponsive fig 12 the cumulative recharge averaged over the period 1970 1989 for the ptfs of bruand canarche and schaap is 19 21 and 20 mm year respectively these 20 year averaged recharge values correspond to 5 6 and 5 of the total annual rainfall based on tea tree well estimated total recharge for the period 1970 1989 was calculated on the basis of recharge from events 2 6 and from events 7 8 for the first series of events total recharge amounted to 1044 and 202 mm or 1246 mm in total this represents 75 of the total recharge for the 20 year period based on the recharge generated for the full 130 year timeseries 3442 mm the 1970 1989 recharge represents 36 of overall total recharge the recharge generated during the wettest decade 1970 1979 only corresponds to 30 of the overall total recharge for events 2 6 the total duration of recharge was calculated to be 1463 days for events 7 8 the recharge lasted 1344 days these results underscore again the importance of consecutive extreme rainfall events in generating significant groundwater recharge the more these events are clustered in this case five extreme events in three years the more they generate recharge owing to wetter starting conditions at the onset of the rain events analysis of climate data from the study area revealed a high spatial variability in rainfall throughout the basin running the simulations with multiple profiles of soil hydraulic properties for several different climate datasets as well as for a bare and a vegetated soil revealed that the spatial variation of precipitation soil hydraulic properties vegetation and hydrologic conditions results in essentially diversifying groundwater recharge across the landscape although mean annual rainfall amounts recorded at territory grape farm were higher compared to the mean annual record at tea tree well and alice springs airport the highest annual recharge rates were calculated for the tea tree well dataset analysis of rainfall records from the three different pluviography stations revealed that a smaller number of extreme rainfall events with more than 200 mm was recorded at the weather station tea tree well average return period of about 16 years than at the other two stations average return period of 11 6 and 12 8 years at territory grape farm and alice springs airport respectively this emphasises again the hypothesis that local recharge rates are not governed by the total annual rainfall but rather by highly infrequent and geographically constrained extreme rainfall events for regional scale estimates of recharge simulations should account for spatial variations in soil properties and topographic features of the region especially topographic depressions stream beds and flood out areas in general vadose zone methods provide estimates of potential recharge while techniques based on groundwater data yield estimates of actual recharge scanlon et al 2002 thus implications for a further extension of the numerical model include the incorporation of topographic characteristics such as the percentage of surface area that experiences flooding after extreme rainfall events and specific ponding characteristics of the soil e g depression storage ephemeral streams flood plains this would allow the application of the model to a regional scale and the estimation of regional scale total recharge amounts furthermore a combination of a modelling approach and tracer based studies could be useful to validate and constrain the hydrologic model and to accurately identify the provenance of infiltrating water several global circulation models indicate that the frequency of extreme rainfall events will decrease while both variability and unpredictability of those events will increase cai et al 2012 charles et al 2008 according to csiro commonwealth scientific and industrial research 2015 global and regional studies point towards a lower frequency of tropical cyclones but with greater proportion of high intensity events heavy precipitation and strong winds under the assumption that those extreme rainfall events represent the major source of groundwater recharge a decrease of those events would potentially entail a decrease of groundwater replenishment we see future research potential in studying those boundary conditions under the assumption of potential climate pathways e g less frequent but higher magnitude rainfall events the uncertainties in different recharge estimation methods emphasises the importance of applying multiple models to increase the reliability of estimates scanlon et al 2002 furthermore realistic estimations of water use by vegetation and a sound understanding of climate related land cover changes are essential for the realistic estimation of groundwater recharge which is a key input to sustainable groundwater management chen et al 2014 zhang et al 1999a 1999b estimated mean annual evapotranspiration rates of about 324 mm a are consistent with actual evapotranspiration rates calculated by the australian bureau of meteorology bom bureau of meteorology australia 2016 the comparison of simulations for bare soil and vegetated soil emphasises the significant effect of vegetation on local recharge rates the influence of vegetation on hydrologic fluxes in shallow desert soils and thick unsaturated zones was previously demonstrated by garcia et al 2011 and scanlon et al 2006 in their study garcia et al 2011 analysed the effects of plant water uptake and its interaction with vapour flow processes in the unsaturated zone they found that plant roots are mainly supplied by thermally driven vapour fluxes and corresponding condensation supplemented moisture during the dry seasons and emphasised the major effects of plant water uptake on water balances in desert soils where total water fluxes are generally low furthermore the same authors determined that root water uptake is also coupled with non isothermal vapour flow thus a combination of the present modelling approach of water fluxes and root water uptake with vapour flow modelling could provide a more profound overview of hydrologic fluxes in the unsaturated zone in arid environments chen et al 2014 and eamus et al 2013 found that seasonal variations of the lai and vegetation water use have a significant influence on root water uptake variations in simulated lai of 0 12 0 35 for the overstory canopy and 0 07 0 21 for the understory canopy resulted in a change of the annual plant water uptake ranging from 64 to 600 mm a chen et al 2014 furthermore scanlon et al 2006 found that a rapid increase in vegetation productivity due to an elevation in seasonal water supply by precipitation reduced the soil pore water volume by half inhibiting groundwater recharge hence the implementation of time variable vegetation parameters seasonal variations of the lai and seasonal root growth tables to account for seasonal changes in land cover and vegetation characteristics can help to draw a more realistic scenario of vegetation properties in this semi arid region however an accurate incorporation of root growth tables into the model can prove to be a challenging task as native vegetation does not mainly change due to seasonality but its growth is rather coupled to the infrequent water supply 5 conclusions this study used a vadose zone numerical modelling study conducted in the ti tree basin central australia to confirm the hypothesis that recharge in the arid ti tree basin is strongly dependent on infrequent extreme rainfall events analysis of the century long precipitation records revealed extreme rainfall events linked to monsoonal thunderstorms during the summer months that have an average return period of 11 12 years for a 150 mm rainfall event and up to almost 16 years for events with more than 200 mm rainfall a multi model approach by means of multiple ptfs provided a convenient tool when facing data scarcity on soil properties results of the century long recharge simulations revealed the highly infrequent nature of groundwater recharge in arid central australia and the strong dependency of the regional water budget on extreme rainfall events analysis of detailed moisture content distributions throughout the soil profile over the century long time series revealed that events of at least 200 mm are required to overcome evaporation and root water uptake and thus to potentially generate recharge to the aquifer multiple extreme rainfall events occurring within shorter time frames are more likely to result in a replenishment of the groundwater aquifer due to the higher antecedent moisture condition of the soil results from this study contribute to a better comprehension of highly episodic and land cover dependent recharge in this semi arid environment by identifying and quantifying recharge generating events and drawing an important connection between groundwater replenishment and specific climatological features further characterisation of vegetation parameters will help to minimise the model uncertainty and to yield a more realistic depiction on vegetation water use the current model can be extended regarding temperature gradients and vapour flow processes which have an influence on vegetation properties and evapotranspiration processes an integrated modelling approach would combine this model with a land surface component that can yield regional scale recharge values such an integrated model could be used to assess and predict future recharge amounts the effects of climate change and changes in land

installed by the earthquake commission to assess liquefaction risk in christchurch the apn is comprised of 1000 shallow piezometers with 249 of these containing sensors measuring water level and temperature but not electrical conductivity every 10 min rutter unpublished results a large number of the piezometers used in the present study were selected from this monitored shallow piezometer network the christchurch coastal aquifer system is a multi layered aquifer system alternating between productive gravel dominated alluvial deposits and low permeability marine sediments as a result of glacial and interglacial periods during the quaternary period brown and weeber 2001 the deepest bore drilled in christchurch to a depth of 240 m below ground revealed seven layers of gravel dominated deposits alternating with low permeability sediments brown 1998 as cited in begg et al 2015 christchurch is a groundwater discharge zone while groundwater recharge is sourced from waimakariri river seepage a gravel bed braided river located north of christchurch and rainfall on the plains further inland west of christchurch and the area between the waimakariri river and christchurch stewart 2012

selected for sampling these comprised 98 piezometers from the apn one piezometer from the christchurch city council groundwater monitoring network four piezometers installed for the current project and three piezometers installed by an environmental consultancy for christchurch city council the apn piezometers were drilled using the sonic method environment canterbury 2021a the pvc standpipes are capped at the bottom with depths of up to 7 5 m below ground level and screen lengths of one to three metres long from the bottom of the well van ballegooy et al 2014 further details on individual piezometers are provided in the supplementary spreadsheet several parameters were considered during the selection of piezometers used for water quality analysis in this study first the inland boundary of the sampling area was determined using the five metre thickness contour line of the christchurch formation from begg et al 2015 fig 2 second the sampling density was chosen depending on the proximity of the piezometers to tidal water features this is because tidal water features including the ocean lagoons estuaries and tidal reaches of rivers pose greater saltwater intrusion risk than fresh or non tidal surface water bodies buffer zones were created around surface water bodies and the width of these buffer zones was dependent on whether the surface water body was tidal 1000 m buffer zone transitional 500 m buffer zone or non tidal 250 m buffer zone a 500 m2 sampling grid was used to select wells within the buffer zones while a 1000 m2 sampling grid was used outside the buffer zones aiming for a minimum of one well in each grid at both resolutions fig 2 the tidal status of major christchurch rivers fig 2 was statistically derived by van ballegooy et al 2014 solely using river level data i e how far the tidal oscillation can travel up the river as such the actual position of the saltwater wedge within christchurch rivers is not captured by these tidal status lines however they are considered conservative estimates of river salinity since the tidal oscillation would travel further upstream compared to the saltwater wedge within the river 2 2 shallow groundwater measurements in this study specific conductivity sc was used as a proxy for salinity which is a standard practice jiao and post 2019 sc measures the ability of water to conduct electrical current at a reference temperature usually 25 c and depends on the amount of dissolved ions present the shallow groundwater sc measurements were conducted from 8 september to 21 october 2020 a survey during springtime likely represents a conservative measure of shallow groundwater salinity from a hazard perspective as winter recharge often increases groundwater level and reduces salinity e g abliz et al 2016 to sample each well an isco ptp 150 portable pump isco inc 1992 was used and approximately three times the standing water volume was pumped from each well before sampling to remove standing water and ensure a representative sample while monitoring water quality parameters temperature sc at 25 c ph and dissolved oxygen to ensure stabilisation daughney et al 2006 the wells that did not meet these criteria e g dried following some pumping were removed from the analysis the pump outflow was connected to a ysi 6850 flow cell ysi inc 2021 the water quality parameters were recorded during and after pumping using the ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument ysi inc 2009 to identify if the elevated sc is caused by seawater intrusion rather than another source of dissolved ions such as sewage leakage from damaged waterwater pipes wolf et al 2004 the shallow groundwater was also sampled for chloride and bicarbonate concentrations chloride is the dominant ion in seawater with a typical concentration of 19 000 mg l whereas fresh groundwater contains significantly less chloride with a concentration of 300 mg l oude essink 2001 therefore the relationship between groundwater sc and chloride concentration can identify if increases in sc are caused by seawater intrusion chang et al 2019 in addition bicarbonate is a major constituent of fresh groundwater and found in negligible amounts in seawater thus the chloride to bicarbonate ratio is also a useful indicator of seawater intrusion revelle 1941 out of the 106 measured sites spot check samples from 27 randomly selected piezometers were measured for alkalinity as calcium carbonate in the field using a hach digital titrator model 16900 hach company 2013 calcium carbonate was converted into bicarbonate concentration based on rice et al 2017 the filtered samples from these 27 piezometers were also analysed for chloride concentration in the laboratory using a thermo fisher scientific dionex ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific 2012 the previously mentioned four piezometers installed for the current project and the three piezometers installed by an environmental consultancy for christchurch city council were equipped with water level temperature and electrical conductivity data loggers of which details are presented in the supplementary spreadsheet seven sc data points were obtained from these instrumented shallow piezometers fig 2 and were added to the sc map these time averaged data points therefore capture some temporal variation such as variation over tidal cycles in addition 18 surface water sc measurements at selected sites in close proximity to the shallow piezometers were taken using a solinst 107 tlc meter solinst canada ltd 2017 tidal stage can influence coastal groundwater salinity with various time lags e g kim et al 2008 therefore the tide condition during the time of measurement is shown in fig 2 and the supplementary spreadsheet as average tide or above and average tide or below the time lags between high tide and maximum salinity in individual piezometers were unknown however the tidal influence was approximated to have little influence on the salinity patterns at the relatively large scale of the analysis 2 3 spatial interpolation method the shallow groundwater sc was spatially interpolated in arcgis pro 2 7 esri 2021 using universal kriging with log transformation due to the right skewness of the data and a constant order of trend removal was imposed since this resulted in the lowest root mean square compared to other orders of trend removal a standard error of prediction layer was produced using this interpolation method and is provided in the supplementary document fig s1 the interpolated sc surface was categorised into salinity groupings of fresh 500 μs cm marginal 500 1500 μs cm brackish at 3 9 seawater 1500 5000 μs cm brackish at 9 28 seawater 5 000 15000 μs cm and brackish at 28 seawater 15000 μs cm the reference for seawater sc used was 53 000 μs cm jiao and post 2019 although a recirculating plume of seawater may be present at the coastline within the shallow aquifer caused by tides and waves werner et al 2013 no boundary conditions were imposed in the interpolation process e g seawater salinity at the coastline however an interpolated map of shallow groundwater sc with an ocean boundary sc of 53 000 μs cm imposed along the coast using universal kriging with log transformation and first order of trend removal chosen due to the lowest root mean square compared to other orders of trend removal is provided in fig s2 of the supplementary document this surface was not used owing to a lack of sufficient data to fully characterise the near coastal zone and the non ocean boundary scenario statistically provided a better overall fit 2 4 analyses of municipal assets within the interpolated brackish groundwater areas municipal assets not designed to operate in saline environments but that are inadvertently exposed to saline groundwater can be at risk of premature deterioration the assets that are co located with the interpolated brackish areas section 2 3 were analysed in arcgis pro 2 7 esri 2021 the location of parks and subsurface pipes in christchurch including the wastewater water supply and storm water pipes and their construction material were sourced from a spatial data set supplied by the christchurch city council 2021a the number and area of parks and the total length of pipes and their construction material within the interpolated brackish shallow groundwater areas were derived using the clip tool to evaluate the potential for downward contamination of the underlying deeper aquifer riccarton gravel by saltwater the vertical hydraulic gradients within or near the interpolated brackish groundwater areas were analysed the vertical hydraulic gradients in nested piezometer sites were derived by dividing the difference in hydraulic heads sourced from environment canterbury unpublished between the two piezometers at the nested sites by the vertical distance between the mid point of well screens the piezometer details are presented in table 2 3 results 3 1 sc measurements and interpolation the groundwater sc measurements follow a right skewed distribution histogram provided in fig s3 of the supplementary document and ranged from 107 to 22 851 µs cm with a mean of 608 µs cm median of 297 µs cm and mode of 310 µs cm out of the 106 wells that were sampled 82 wells were classified as fresh 14 as marginal 6 as brackish at 3 9 seawater none as brackish at 9 28 seawater and 4 as brackish at 28 seawater fig 3 thirty eight out of 53 piezometers 72 located greater than four kilometres from the coast were fresh the shallow groundwater sc surface interpolated brackish groundwater at 28 seawater in southshore bexley and new brighton fig 4 the root mean square of the interpolation was 3025 µs cm and the standard error ranged from 1 to 11 550 µs cm fig s1 of the supplementary document marginal groundwater was interpolated in the area between the two major rivers ōtākaro avon and ōpāwaho heathcote rivers which also had the largest uncertainty due to the lack of piezometers mostly fresh groundwater was measured in the north and northeast of the christchurch cbd on the other hand areas of marginal groundwater were measured in several locations more than four kilometres from the coast e g the south and west of the christchurch cbd which is an otherwise fresh groundwater area long term median shallow groundwater level contours in metres below ground for the period of 4 september 2010 30 november 2013 developed by van ballegooy et al 2014 are also provided in fig s4 of the supplementary document the most saline groundwater was measured in the suburb of southshore which is built on sand dunes of a spit between the ihutai avon heathcote estuary and the ocean fig 3 and fig 4 however the three piezometers at the southshore spit had a large variation in sc from north to south at 509 µs cm marginal 22 851 µs cm brackish at 28 seawater and 1885 µs cm brackish at 3 9 seawater respectively taken during average tide or above conditions fig 2 inside the tidal ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley groundwater sc was brackish at 28 seawater and ranged between 15 471 and 17 200 µs cm however on the outside of the meander groundwater was brackish at 3 9 seawater with an sc of 4395 µs cm 5 m from the river and sc of 1946 µs cm 23 m from the river there were seven wells located along the tidal ōtākaro avon river meander that were equipped with data loggers fig 2 and fig 3 where time averaged sc was recorded the sc of surface water bodies measured in close proximity to the piezometers ranged from 157 to 29 000 μs cm fig 4 the details of individual measurements and their relation to ocean tide levels are shown in the supplementary spreadsheet as expected the salinity of surface water measurements trended higher downstream towards the coast except for one measurement taken at the ōtākaro avon river mouth during low tide fig 4 higher sc values were measured further upstream in the ōtākaro avon river than the ōpāwaho heathcote river despite that both waterways are tidal and connected to the estuary groundwater adjacent to the ōtākaro avon river was consistently more saline than that adjacent to the ōpāwaho heathcote river a strong positive correlation r2 0 92 was found between groundwater sc and chloride concentration as well as between groundwater sc and chloride to bicarbonate ratio r2 0 87 in 27 randomly selected shallow bores 3 2 exposure of municipal assets to brackish shallow groundwater 3 2 1 subsurface infrastructure the total length of the stormwater wastewater and water supply pipes within the interpolated brackish groundwater area was 118 kilometres the majority of stormwater pipes 69 and 17 of wastewater pipes are constructed from steel reinforced concrete and 24 of water supply pipes are constructed from asbestos cement within the interpolated brackish areas the other category not elaborated in table 1 includes i metal systems such as steel with and without concrete lining galvanised steel cast iron ductile iron with and without cement lining ii ceramic systems such as vitrified clay and iii plastic systems such as glass reinforced plastic 3 2 2 parks there were 41 parks and reserves within the interpolated brackish areas totalling 236 ha including the residential red zone christchurch city council 2021a the three largest parks within the interpolated brackish areas are the ōtākaro corridor residential red zone bexley park and southshore beach park 3 2 3 wastewater treatment plant in the bromley wastewater treatment plant the salinity and chloride concentration of wastewater have not been regularly monitored and generally have not been of concern although spot checks have been conducted l liaw personal communication 28 april 2021 furthermore no particular issues with regards to salinity have been observed and no salinity thresholds have been established with regards to specific wastewater treatment processes at the plant 3 2 4 deeper aquifer and drinking supply wells the vertical hydraulic gradient between the christchurch formation and riccarton gravel units from january 2020 to january 2021 was positive indicating upward groundwater flow at marine parade and humphrey s drive table 2 and see fig 2 for nested piezometer locations based on water quality data from the environment canterbury database https www ecan govt nz data water quality data and measurements from the current study we assume that the groundwater in the nested piezometers was fresh and therefore does not require density correction additionally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess whether downward flow can be induced under salinized shallow groundwater conditions of 50 seawater and 100 seawater density corrected using the freshwater head equation in post et al 2018 supplementary spreadsheet positive hydraulic gradient was maintained under the two salinized shallow groundwater scenarios and downward flow was not induced 4 discussion 4 1 sc measurements and interpolation the piezometers to the north and northeast of the christchurch cbd had mostly fresh shallow groundwater fig 4 possibly due to their location being closer to the waimakariri river the dominant source for groundwater recharge on the other hand marginal groundwater was measured in inland areas greater than four kilometres from the coast a potential reason for the marginal groundwater areas could be leakage from earthquake damaged wastewater laterals i e pipes that carry wastewater from private properties to the state owned wastewater main that have not been repaired christchurch city council n d the well at the southshore spit with the highest specific conductance overall was also the deepest well suggesting that the freshwater lens system at the sand dunes was transitioning into seawater at a depth of about seven metres below ground level at the time of the investigation following the ces and damage to subsurface pipes a wastewater pumping station in southshore pumped saline water which damaged the system d pinkney personal communication 26 february 2021 indicating that the saltwater freshwater interface in the lens system may be proximal to the depths of the wastewater pipes the shallow groundwater inside of the tidal ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley was brackish at 28 seawater while the outside of the meander was brackish at 3 9 seawater the factors that influence the difference in salinity between the inside and the outside of the meander may be the variation in aquifer hydraulic conductivity identified by the different soil drainage historical landscape and vulnerability to liquefaction and hydraulic gradient aquifer hydraulic conductivity influences the extent and severity of saltwater intrusion from saline rivers into shallow aquifers for example shalem et al 2019 found that saltwater intrusion into a low hydraulic conductivity unit such as silty clay resulted in the entrapment of saltwater due to the difficulty in flushing out or displacing saltwater with freshwater in the system the inside of river meanders are depositional zones where the river flow is slowest and sediment build up occurs slowly through individual lateral accretions during floods when the deposits are submerged jackson et al 2005 reineck and singh 2012 inside the ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley the soil down to one metre from ground level is dominantly silt and poorly drained landcare research 2019 in contrast the soil outside the river meander is dominantly sand and well drained moreover prior to land drainage by european settlers the inside of the meander was a wetland whereas the outside of the meander was sand hills environment canterbury et al 2019 furthermore the inside of the meander suffered severe liquefaction following the ces resulting in government acquisition of the land whereas the outside of the meander was not as severely impacted earthquake commission 2012 implying that the inside and the outside of the meander have different soils the distinction in soil drainage historical landscape and vulnerability to liquefaction between the inside and the outside of the ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley suggests that the different salinity levels reflect differences in near surface geology and aquifer hydraulic conductivity in addition the river aquifer hydraulic gradient may also be a factor influencing groundwater salinity smith and turner 2001 though it was not measured in this study the groundwater sc measured in areas that experienced land subsidence following the ces was more saline than in the areas that experienced uplift following the ces the bexley area inside the meander of the ōtākaro avon river experienced land subsidence of 0 52 m on average whereas ferrymead around the ōpāwaho heathcote river mouth area experienced uplift of 0 14 m where data exists hughes 2015 quigley et al 2016 the median post ces land elevation in bexley is 1 1 m lower than in woolston processed from dataset land information new zealand 2015 the land subsidence in the lower reach of the ōtākaro avon river uniquely mimicking a local sea level rise effect see orchard et al 2020 would result in the ability for seawater to travel further upstream than before increasing the risk for saltwater intrusion from the tidal river into the adjacent shallow aquifer uplift in the lower reach of the ōpāwaho heathcote area would have the opposite effect the strong positive correlation between groundwater sc and chloride concentration r2 0 91 as well as between groundwater sc and chloride to bicarbonate ratio r2 0 79 in 27 randomly selected shallow bores indicate that the majority of brackish wells are exposed to seawater however outliers exist such as at a former market garden site in marshland where groundwater pollution may have occurred environment canterbury 2015 and brackish groundwater was found despite its distance from the coastline and any tidal reaches 4 2 exposure of municipal assets to brackish shallow groundwater 4 2 1 subsurface infrastructure the majority of stormwater pipes 69 and 17 of wastewater pipes are constructed from steel reinforced concrete and 24 of water supply pipes are constructed from asbestos cement within the interpolated brackish areas in addition to the global issue of ageing infrastructure e g houlihan 1994 a proportion of the earthquake damaged wastewater lateral pipes that lie on private land may have not been repaired christchurch city council 2021 when damaged or degraded the steel reinforcement within the concrete pipe can become exposed to the water it carries and the surrounding groundwater environment the steel reinforcement in concrete is vulnerable to premature failure when exposed to chloride underwater and is even more significantly sensitive in wetting drying conditions luo et al 2015 groundwater levels in coastal aquifer systems can fluctuate in response to tides jiao and post 2019 further exacerbating the groundwater conditions for vulnerable materials when they are exposed to groundwater such as the steel reinforcement in concrete other ferrous metal structures present in the brackish groundwater areas such as steel and cast iron pipes are also vulnerable to corrosion triggered by high salinity groundwater and the presence of aggressive salts such as chloride and sulphate cole and marney 2012 luo et al 2015 concrete structures are also vulnerable to attacks from these aggressive salts resulting in premature deterioration however they are significantly more resistant to corrosion than steel structures luo et al 2015 on the other hand plastic pipes including polyvinyl chloride polyethylene and glass reinforced plastic and ceramic pipes including earthenware and vitrified clay present within the interpolated brackish groundwater areas are chemically resistant seymour 1953 walsh 2011 and may not be vulnerable to premature failure from brackish groundwater exposure despite this there are other aspects to be considered that are not covered in this paper when deciding which pipe material to install at a given site in addition to subsurface pipes building foundations can be exposed to brackish or saline water tables which may induce premature deterioration depending on various factors department of environment and climate change new south wales 2008 the data for building foundation depths and materials are not recorded in christchurch and they are only available on individual building plans preventing a wide spread analysis for this paper other subsurface infrastructure not considered in this analysis include highway and road foundations utility pipelines and underground structures such as building basements and tunnels 4 2 2 parks groundwater salinity is an aspect of groundwater quality that determines which species might survive in an environment in addition to groundwater level and flux eamus et al 2016 shallow groundwater salinization can have several effects including coastal forest loss due to the failure of seedlings to germinate yield reductions in agricultural land eutrophication in surface water bodies invasion of salt tolerant species marsh migration upland tully et al 2019 and reduction of biodiversity zeng et al 2020 there were 41 parks and reserves within the interpolated brackish areas totalling 236 ha including the residential red zone christchurch city council 2021a the salinity tolerance thresholds of different plant species need to be considered when deciding what species to plant in areas with brackish or saline water table the salinization of shallow groundwater can threaten the survival of groundwater dependent salt intolerant species greene et al 2016 for example impacts of increased salinity intrusion up the ōpāwaho heathcote river and salinization of the adjacent shallow groundwater include the death of trees as well as the slumping of river banks watts 2011 in addition evapotranspiration increases soil salinity especially when the depth to water table is less than four metres below ground greene et al 2016 which is the case in this part of christchurch van ballegooy et al 2014 saltmarsh vegetation has also been observed in areas that overlap with the brackish regions bexley southshore and ferrymead orchard et al 2020 alternatively the natural landward migration of saltmarsh which provides abundant ecosystem services can be achieved depending on the availability and the hydrologic connectivity of intertidal space as has been observed in southshore with careful planning infrastructure design and protection of saltmarsh land orchard et al 2020 4 2 3 wastewater treatment plant saline groundwater can travel into wastewater pipes through pipe cracks and faults and increase wastewater salinity and hydraulic load coming into treatment plants miranda et al 2019 high salinity wastewater can corrode wastewater assets increase sulphide generation miranda et al 2019 impact the operation of wastewater treatment plants and limit the reusability of the treated water osman et al 2017 for example saline wastewater decreases sedimentation due to its greater buoyancy force compared to wastewater jang et al 2013 saline wastewater has also been shown to reduce microbial activity and diversity in activated sludge processes wu et al 2008 the biological treatment of wastewater has been shown to be acceptable up to a total dissolved solids tds of 4000 mg l equivalent to an sc of 7243 µs cm and inhibited above a tds of 8000 mg l alipour et al 2017 the salinity and chloride concentration of wastewater have not been regularly monitored and generally have not been of concern at the bromley wastewater treatment plant although wastewater salinity is not currently a pressing issue the monitoring of wastewater salinity can be useful to detect changes early on and future proof the optimality of wastewater assets especially under climate change impacts hughes et al 2021 singh and tiwari 2019 4 2 4 deeper aquifer and drinking supply wells the vertical hydraulic gradient between the christchurch formation and riccarton gravel units from january 2020 to january 2021 was positive indicating upward groundwater flow at marine parade and humphrey s drive under fresh groundwater conditions table 2 and see fig 2 for nested piezometer locations furthermore a vertical hydraulic gradient sensitivity analysis supplementary spreadsheet showed that positive hydraulic gradient would be maintained under hypothetical salinized shallow groundwater conditions of 50 seawater and 100 seawater calculated using freshwater head post et al 2018 therefore the riccarton gravel aquifer may not have been vulnerable to downward contamination by saltwater within this measurement period at these sites interestingly the vertical hydraulic gradient has increased compared to the values described in lough and williams 2009 and hertel 1998 who recorded a downward hydraulic gradient at the humphrey s drive site there are three community drinking supply wells that extract from the riccarton gravel aquifer located less than 2 8 kilometres from the ihutai estuary environment canterbury 2017 these wells may be vulnerable to saltwater intrusion if the vertical hydraulic gradient shifts downward a downward hydraulic gradient due to excessive pumping can result in the flow of contaminants from shallow to deeper confined aquifers as has been observed in cities such as jakarta and bangkok onodera et al 2008 this has also been observed in christchurch previously in the suburb of woolston where saline water moved from the ihutai avon heathcote estuary into the underlying semi confined riccarton gravel aquifer hertel 1998 in response to this pumping restrictions were put in place to ensure an upward vertical hydraulic gradient callander et al 2011 low lying coastal areas with leaky confining layers may be more vulnerable to seawater intrusion under downward hydraulic gradient and would warrant close monitoring 4 3 limitations and recommendations for future research the tidal variations were approximated to have minor influence on the groundwater salinity patterns at the overall scale of the analysis and the groundwater salinity was approximated to be at dynamic equilibrium over the majority of the study area some temporal variations in the groundwater salinity would be expected during the sampling period within tidally influenced areas but those areas would be limited and generally only indicate oscillations rather than event based or long term changes this study did not consider the piezometer depths in the interpolated map output although the piezometer depths were shown in fig 3 parts of the interpolated area are sparser in data points compared to other parts such as the area between the ōtākaro avon and ōpāwaho heathcote rivers the interpolated sc values need to be interpreted with caution and should be considered as indicative values or trends only for future research we recommend a wider analysis of chemical markers to confirm the source of shallow groundwater salinity such as boron concentrations to investigate the presence of wastewater in addition to shallow groundwater chloride concentrations other useful parameters to measure and map include ph and sulphate concentrations to assess groundwater conditions and the potential vulnerability of exposed subsurface infrastructure luo et al 2015 extensive hydraulic head data from the apn could be used to inform which piezometers are tidally influenced and it would be worthwhile installing data loggers to monitor sc over time the elevation of subsurface infrastructure could be analysed in relation to hydraulic head data which can be used to assess the vulnerability of underground assets especially in combination with groundwater sc data 5 conclusion in this study shallow groundwater salinity was measured and mapped in a low lying coastal city in new zealand christchurch and the municipal assets located within the brackish groundwater areas were highlighted brackish shallow groundwater at greater than 9 seawater sc 5000 µs cm was found in the suburb of southshore located on a sand dune spit between the ihutai avon heathcote estuary and the ocean and bexley located inside of the meander of the ōtākaro avon river tidal reach pockets of marginal sc 500 1500 µs cm shallow groundwater were found inland potentially attributed to wastewater leakage shallow groundwater north and northeast of the christchurch cbd was mostly fresh sc 500 µs cm potentially due to the close proximity to the recharge source the waimakariri river the municipal assets located within the brackish groundwater areas were highlighted the majority of stormwater pipes 69 and 17 of wastewater pipes in these areas are made of steel reinforced concrete which if damaged is vulnerable to premature deterioration when exposed to chloride underwater especially under wetting drying conditions luo et al 2015 there were 41 parks totalling 236 ha that lie within the brackish groundwater areas where groundwater dependent salt intolerant species can be at risk the salinity and chloride concentration of wastewater coming into the wastewater treatment plant have not been regularly monitored and generally have not been of concern the lack of information could present a vulnerability in itself in addition the vertical hydraulic gradient between the surficial christchurch formation aquifer and the underlying semi confined riccarton gravel aquifer was upward at the two nested piezometer sites within or near brackish groundwater areas in january 2020 to january 2021 therefore the riccarton gravel was not vulnerable to downward contamination by saltwater during the analysed time period key attributes that can inform other low lying coastal cities include monitoring shallow groundwater salinity is crucial for water resources management in low lying coastal cities with implications for park management subsurface pipes wastewater assets and deeper aquifers groundwater salinity could be taken into account when deciding what subsurface infrastructure material to install if it will interact with groundwater whether constantly or periodically additionally brackish groundwater conditions could be factored in to the expected service life of existing subsurface infrastructure that are exposed to it and inform decisions on maintenance or infrastructure monitoring efforts the salinity of shallow groundwater at a planting site could be taken into account when deciding what species to plant and their salinity thresholds to support plant survival saline groundwater can infiltrate into wastewater pipes through cracks and faults and increase wastewater salinity and hydraulic load coming into treatment plants it is therefore important to monitor the salinity of wastewater to inform management decisions and future proof the optimality of wastewater assets useful areas to install piezometers include i areas near tidal surface water bodies ii transects of piezometers perpendicular to a tidal surface water body in particular can show how groundwater salinity changes with distance iii low elevation areas with the water table close to the ground surface higher likelihood of interaction between shallow groundwater and subsurface infrastructure as well as vegetation root systems iv areas where downward saltwater contamination is of concern e g installation of nested piezometers near water supply wells to monitor vertical hydraulic gradient and groundwater salinity this study expands on the current literature by linking areas of saline groundwater to the existing municipal assets that reside within those areas which will continue to become more vulnerable under climate change conditions in addition the compilation of the cascading impacts of shallow groundwater salinization while drawing on examples in christchurch new zealand can be useful to groundwater managers and decision makers in similar urban settings lastly the identified potentially vulnerable municipal assets from saline shallow groundwater exposure can then be prioritised for further monitoring and management credit authorship contribution statement irene setiawan conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis

8008,study region christchurch new zealand study focus low lying coastal cities worldwide are vulnerable to shallow groundwater salinization caused by saltwater intrusion and anthropogenic activities shallow groundwater salinization can have cascading negative impacts on municipal assets but this is rarely considered compared to impacts of salinization on water supply here shallow groundwater salinity was sampled at high spatial resolution 1 3 piezometer km2 then mapped and spatially interpolated this was possible due to a uniquely extensive set of shallow piezometers installed in response to the 2010 11 canterbury earthquake sequence to assess liquefaction risk the municipal assets located within the brackish groundwater areas were highlighted new hydrological insights for the region brackish groundwater areas were centred on a spit of coastal sand dunes and inside the meander of a tidal river with poorly drained soils the municipal assets located within these areas include i wastewater and stormwater pipes constructed from steel reinforced concrete which if damaged are vulnerable to premature failure when exposed to chloride underwater and ii 41 parks and reserves

of christchurch new zealand and the municipal assets located within brackish groundwater areas were highlighted the study adds to the current literature by discussing the potential impacts of shallow groundwater salinization to existing municipal assets in an urban setting 1 1 study area christchurch built on drained swampland wilson 1989 is the second most populated city in new zealand with a

installed by the earthquake commission to assess liquefaction risk in christchurch the apn is comprised of 1000 shallow piezometers with 249 of these containing sensors measuring water level and temperature but not electrical conductivity every 10 min rutter unpublished results a large number of the piezometers used in the present study were selected from this monitored shallow piezometer network the christchurch coastal aquifer system is a multi layered aquifer system alternating between productive gravel dominated alluvial deposits and low permeability marine sediments as a result of

selected for sampling these comprised 98 piezometers from the apn one piezometer from the christchurch city council groundwater monitoring network four piezometers installed for the current project and three piezometers installed by an environmental consultancy for christchurch city council the apn piezometers were drilled using the sonic method environment canterbury 2021a the pvc standpipes are capped at the bottom with depths of up to 7 5 m below ground level and screen lengths of one to three metres long from the bottom of the well van ballegooy et al 2014 further details on individual piezometers are provided in the supplementary spreadsheet several parameters were considered during the selection of piezometers used for water quality analysis in this study first the inland boundary of the sampling area was determined using the five metre thickness contour line of the christchurch formation from begg et al 2015 fig 2 second the sampling density was chosen depending on the proximity of the piezometers to tidal water features this is because tidal water features including the ocean lagoons estuaries and tidal reaches of rivers pose greater saltwater intrusion risk than fresh or non tidal surface water bodies buffer zones were created around surface water bodies and the width of these buffer zones was dependent on whether the surface water body was tidal 1000 m buffer zone transitional 500 m buffer zone or non tidal 250 m buffer zone a 500 m2 sampling grid was used to select wells within the buffer zones while a 1000 m2 sampling grid was used outside the buffer zones aiming for a minimum of one well in each grid at both resolutions fig 2 the tidal status of major christchurch rivers fig 2 was statistically derived by van ballegooy et al 2014 solely using river level data i e how far the tidal oscillation can travel up the river as such the actual position of the saltwater wedge within christchurch rivers is not captured by these tidal status lines however they are considered conservative estimates of river salinity since the tidal oscillation would travel further upstream compared to the saltwater wedge within the river 2 2 shallow groundwater measurements in this study specific conductivity sc was used as a proxy for salinity which is a standard practice jiao and post 2019 sc measures the ability of water to conduct electrical current at a reference temperature usually 25 c and depends on the amount of dissolved ions present the shallow groundwater sc measurements were conducted from 8 september to 21 october 2020 a survey during springtime likely represents a conservative measure of shallow groundwater salinity from a hazard perspective as winter recharge often increases groundwater level and reduces salinity e g abliz et al 2016 to sample each well an isco ptp 150 portable pump isco inc 1992 was used and approximately three times the standing water volume was pumped from each well before sampling to remove standing water and ensure a representative sample while monitoring water quality parameters temperature sc at 25 c ph and dissolved oxygen to ensure stabilisation daughney et al 2006 the wells that did not meet these criteria e g dried following some pumping were removed from the analysis the pump outflow was connected to a ysi 6850 flow cell ysi inc 2021 the water quality parameters were recorded during and after pumping using the ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument ysi inc 2009 to identify if the elevated sc is caused by seawater intrusion rather than another source of dissolved ions such as sewage leakage from damaged waterwater pipes wolf et al 2004 the shallow groundwater was also sampled for chloride and bicarbonate concentrations chloride is the dominant ion in seawater with a typical concentration of 19 000 mg l whereas fresh groundwater contains significantly less chloride with a concentration of 300 mg l oude essink 2001 therefore the relationship between groundwater sc and chloride concentration can identify if increases in sc are caused by seawater intrusion chang et al 2019 in addition bicarbonate is a major constituent of fresh groundwater and found in negligible amounts in seawater thus the chloride to bicarbonate ratio is also a useful indicator of seawater intrusion revelle 1941 out of the 106 measured sites spot check samples from 27 randomly selected piezometers were measured for alkalinity as calcium carbonate in the field using a hach digital titrator model 16900 hach company 2013 calcium carbonate was converted into bicarbonate concentration based on rice et al 2017 the filtered samples from these 27 piezometers were also analysed for chloride concentration in the laboratory using a thermo fisher scientific dionex ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific 2012 the previously mentioned four piezometers installed for the current project and the three piezometers installed by an environmental consultancy for christchurch city council were equipped with water level temperature and electrical conductivity data loggers of which details are presented in the supplementary spreadsheet seven sc data points were obtained from these instrumented shallow piezometers fig 2 and were added to the sc map these time averaged data points therefore capture some temporal variation such as variation over tidal cycles in addition 18 surface water sc measurements at selected sites in close proximity to the shallow piezometers were taken using a solinst 107 tlc meter solinst canada ltd 2017 tidal stage can influence coastal groundwater salinity with various time lags e g kim et al 2008 therefore the tide condition during the time of measurement is shown in fig 2 and the supplementary spreadsheet as average tide or above and average tide or below the time lags between high tide and maximum salinity in individual piezometers were unknown however the tidal influence was approximated to have little influence on the salinity patterns at the relatively large scale of the analysis 2 3 spatial interpolation method the shallow groundwater sc was spatially interpolated in arcgis pro 2 7 esri 2021 using universal kriging with log transformation due to the right skewness of the data and a constant order of trend removal was imposed since this resulted in the lowest root mean square compared to other orders of trend removal a standard error of prediction layer was produced using this interpolation method and is provided in the supplementary document fig s1 the interpolated sc surface was categorised into salinity groupings of fresh 500 μs cm marginal 500 1500 μs cm brackish at 3 9 seawater 1500 5000 μs cm brackish at 9 28 seawater 5 000 15000 μs cm and brackish at 28 seawater 15000 μs cm the reference for seawater sc used was 53 000 μs cm jiao and post 2019 although a recirculating plume of seawater may be present at the coastline within the shallow aquifer caused by tides and waves werner et al 2013 no boundary conditions were imposed in the interpolation process e g seawater salinity at the coastline however an interpolated map of shallow groundwater sc with an ocean boundary sc of 53 000 μs cm imposed along the coast using universal kriging with log transformation and first order of trend removal chosen due to the lowest root mean square compared to other orders of trend removal is provided in fig s2 of the supplementary document this surface was not used owing to a lack of sufficient data to fully characterise the near coastal zone and the non ocean boundary scenario statistically provided a better overall fit 2 4 analyses of municipal assets within the interpolated brackish groundwater areas municipal assets not designed to operate in saline environments but that are inadvertently exposed to saline groundwater can be at risk of premature deterioration the assets that are co located with the interpolated brackish areas section 2 3 were analysed in arcgis pro 2 7 esri 2021 the location of parks and subsurface pipes in christchurch including the wastewater water supply and storm water pipes and their construction material were sourced from a spatial data set supplied by the christchurch city council 2021a the number and area of parks and the total length of pipes and their construction material within the interpolated brackish shallow groundwater areas were derived using the clip tool to evaluate the potential for downward contamination of the underlying deeper aquifer riccarton gravel by saltwater the vertical hydraulic gradients within or near the interpolated brackish groundwater areas were analysed the vertical hydraulic gradients in nested piezometer sites were derived by dividing the difference in hydraulic heads sourced from environment canterbury unpublished between the two piezometers at the nested sites by the vertical distance between the mid point of well screens the piezometer details are presented in table 2 3 results 3 1 sc measurements and interpolation the groundwater sc measurements follow a right skewed distribution histogram provided in fig s3 of the supplementary document and ranged from 107 to 22 851 µs cm with a mean of 608 µs cm median of 297 µs cm and mode of 310 µs cm out of the 106 wells that were sampled 82 wells were classified as fresh 14 as marginal 6 as brackish at 3 9 seawater none as brackish at 9 28 seawater and 4 as brackish at 28 seawater fig 3 thirty eight out of 53 piezometers 72 located greater than four kilometres from the coast were fresh the shallow groundwater sc surface interpolated brackish groundwater at 28 seawater in southshore bexley and new brighton fig 4 the root mean square of the interpolation was 3025 µs cm and the standard error ranged from 1 to 11 550 µs cm fig s1 of the supplementary document marginal groundwater was interpolated in the area between the two major rivers ōtākaro avon and ōpāwaho heathcote rivers which also had the largest uncertainty due to the lack of piezometers mostly fresh groundwater was measured in the north and northeast of the christchurch cbd on the other hand areas of marginal groundwater were measured in several locations more than four kilometres from the coast e g the south and west of the christchurch cbd which is an otherwise fresh groundwater area long term median shallow groundwater level contours in metres below ground for the period of 4 september 2010 30 november 2013 developed by van ballegooy et al 2014 are also provided in fig s4 of the supplementary document the most saline groundwater was measured in the suburb of southshore which is built on sand dunes of a spit between the ihutai avon heathcote estuary and the ocean fig 3 and fig 4 however the three piezometers at the southshore spit had a large variation in sc from north to south at 509 µs cm marginal 22 851 µs cm brackish at 28 seawater and 1885 µs cm brackish at 3 9 seawater respectively taken during average tide or above conditions fig 2 inside the tidal ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley groundwater sc was brackish at 28 seawater and ranged between 15 471 and 17 200 µs cm however on the outside of the meander groundwater was brackish at 3 9 seawater with an sc of 4395 µs cm 5 m from the river and sc of 1946 µs cm 23 m from the river there were seven wells located along the tidal ōtākaro avon river meander that were equipped with data loggers fig 2 and fig 3 where time averaged sc was recorded the sc of surface water bodies measured in close proximity to the piezometers ranged from 157 to 29 000 μs cm fig 4 the details of individual measurements and their relation to ocean tide levels are shown in the supplementary spreadsheet as expected the salinity of surface water measurements trended higher downstream towards the coast except for one measurement taken at the ōtākaro avon river mouth during low tide fig 4 higher sc values were measured further upstream in the ōtākaro avon river than the ōpāwaho heathcote river despite that both waterways are tidal and connected to the estuary groundwater adjacent to the ōtākaro avon river was consistently more saline than that adjacent to the ōpāwaho heathcote river a strong positive correlation r2 0 92 was found between groundwater sc and chloride concentration as well as between groundwater sc and chloride to bicarbonate ratio r2 0 87 in 27 randomly selected shallow bores 3 2 exposure of municipal assets to brackish shallow groundwater 3 2 1 subsurface infrastructure the total length of the stormwater wastewater and water supply pipes within the interpolated brackish groundwater area was 118 kilometres the majority of stormwater pipes 69 and 17 of wastewater pipes are constructed from steel reinforced concrete and 24 of water supply pipes are constructed from asbestos cement within the interpolated brackish areas the other category not elaborated in table 1 includes i metal systems such as steel with and without concrete lining galvanised steel cast iron ductile iron with and without cement lining ii ceramic systems such as vitrified clay and iii plastic systems such as glass reinforced plastic 3 2 2 parks there were 41 parks and reserves within the interpolated brackish areas totalling 236 ha including the residential red zone christchurch city council 2021a the three largest parks within the interpolated brackish areas are the ōtākaro corridor residential red zone bexley park and southshore beach park 3 2 3 wastewater treatment plant in the bromley wastewater treatment plant the salinity and chloride concentration of wastewater have not been regularly monitored and generally have not been of concern although spot checks have been conducted l liaw personal communication 28 april 2021 furthermore no particular issues with regards to salinity have been observed and no salinity thresholds have been established with regards to specific wastewater treatment processes at the plant 3 2 4 deeper aquifer and drinking supply wells the vertical hydraulic gradient between the christchurch formation and riccarton gravel units from january 2020 to january 2021 was positive indicating upward groundwater flow at marine parade and humphrey s drive table 2 and see fig 2 for nested piezometer locations based on water quality data from the environment canterbury database https www ecan govt nz data water quality data and measurements from the current study we assume that the groundwater in the nested piezometers was fresh and therefore does not require density correction additionally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess whether downward flow can be induced under salinized shallow groundwater conditions of 50 seawater and 100 seawater density corrected using the freshwater head equation in post et al 2018 supplementary spreadsheet positive hydraulic gradient was maintained under the two salinized shallow groundwater scenarios and downward flow was not induced 4 discussion 4 1 sc measurements and interpolation the piezometers to the north and northeast of the christchurch cbd had mostly fresh shallow groundwater fig 4 possibly due to their location being closer to the waimakariri river the dominant source for groundwater recharge on the other hand marginal groundwater was measured in inland areas greater than four kilometres from the coast a potential reason for the marginal groundwater areas could be leakage from earthquake damaged wastewater laterals i e pipes that carry wastewater from private properties to the state owned wastewater main that have not been repaired christchurch city council n d the well at the southshore spit with the highest specific conductance overall was also the deepest well suggesting that the freshwater lens system at the sand dunes was transitioning into seawater at a depth of about seven metres below ground level at the time of the investigation following the ces and damage to subsurface pipes a wastewater pumping station in southshore pumped saline water which damaged the system d pinkney personal communication 26 february 2021 indicating that the saltwater freshwater interface in the lens system may be proximal to the depths of the wastewater pipes the shallow groundwater inside of the tidal ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley was brackish at 28 seawater while the outside of the meander was brackish at 3 9 seawater the factors that influence the difference in salinity between the inside and the outside of the meander may be the variation in aquifer hydraulic conductivity identified by the different soil drainage historical landscape and vulnerability to liquefaction and hydraulic gradient aquifer hydraulic conductivity influences the extent and severity of saltwater intrusion from saline rivers into shallow aquifers for example shalem et al 2019 found that saltwater intrusion into a low hydraulic conductivity unit such as silty clay resulted in the entrapment of saltwater due to the difficulty in flushing out or displacing saltwater with freshwater in the system the inside of river meanders are depositional zones where the river flow is slowest and sediment build up occurs slowly through individual lateral accretions during floods when the deposits are submerged jackson et al 2005 reineck and singh 2012 inside the ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley the soil down to one metre from ground level is dominantly silt and poorly drained landcare research 2019 in contrast the soil outside the river meander is dominantly sand and well drained moreover prior to land drainage by european settlers the inside of the meander was a wetland whereas the outside of the meander was sand hills environment canterbury et al 2019 furthermore the inside of the meander suffered severe liquefaction following the ces resulting in government acquisition of the land whereas the outside of the meander was not as severely impacted earthquake commission 2012 implying that the inside and the outside of the meander have different soils the distinction in soil drainage historical landscape and vulnerability to liquefaction between the inside and the outside of the ōtākaro avon river meander in bexley suggests that the different salinity levels reflect differences in near surface geology and aquifer hydraulic conductivity in addition the river aquifer hydraulic gradient may also be a factor influencing groundwater salinity smith and turner 2001 though it was not measured in this study the groundwater sc measured in areas that experienced land subsidence following the ces was more saline than in the areas that experienced uplift following the ces the bexley area inside the meander of the ōtākaro avon river experienced land subsidence of 0 52 m on average whereas ferrymead around the ōpāwaho heathcote river mouth area experienced uplift of 0 14 m where data exists hughes 2015 quigley et al 2016 the median post ces land elevation in bexley is 1 1 m lower than in woolston processed from dataset land information new zealand 2015 the land subsidence in the lower reach of the ōtākaro avon river uniquely mimicking a local sea level rise effect see orchard et al 2020 would result in the ability for seawater to travel further upstream than before increasing the risk for saltwater intrusion from the tidal river into the adjacent shallow aquifer uplift in the lower reach of the ōpāwaho heathcote area would have the opposite effect the strong positive correlation between groundwater sc and chloride concentration r2 0 91 as well as between groundwater sc and chloride to bicarbonate ratio r2 0 79 in 27 randomly selected shallow bores indicate that the majority of brackish wells are exposed to seawater however outliers exist such as at a former market garden site in marshland where groundwater pollution may have occurred environment canterbury 2015 and brackish groundwater was found despite its distance from the coastline and any tidal reaches 4 2 exposure of municipal assets to brackish shallow groundwater 4 2 1 subsurface infrastructure the majority of stormwater pipes 69 and 17 of wastewater pipes are constructed from steel reinforced concrete and 24 of water supply pipes are constructed from asbestos cement within the interpolated brackish areas in addition to the global issue of ageing infrastructure e g houlihan 1994 a proportion of the earthquake damaged wastewater lateral pipes that lie on private land may have not been repaired christchurch city council 2021 when damaged or degraded the steel reinforcement within the concrete pipe can become exposed to the water it carries and the surrounding groundwater environment the steel reinforcement in concrete is vulnerable to premature failure when exposed to chloride underwater and is even more significantly sensitive in wetting drying conditions luo et al 2015 groundwater levels in coastal aquifer systems can fluctuate in response to tides jiao and post 2019 further exacerbating the groundwater conditions for vulnerable materials when they are exposed to groundwater such as the steel reinforcement in concrete other ferrous metal structures present in the brackish groundwater areas such as steel and cast iron pipes are also vulnerable to corrosion triggered by high salinity groundwater and the presence of aggressive salts such as chloride and sulphate cole and marney 2012 luo et al 2015 concrete structures are also vulnerable to attacks from these aggressive salts resulting in premature deterioration however they are significantly more resistant to corrosion than steel structures luo et al 2015 on the other hand plastic pipes including polyvinyl chloride polyethylene and glass reinforced plastic and ceramic pipes including earthenware and vitrified clay present within the interpolated brackish groundwater areas are chemically resistant seymour 1953 walsh 2011 and may not be vulnerable to premature failure from brackish groundwater exposure despite this there are other aspects to be considered that are not covered in this paper when deciding which pipe material to install at a given site in addition to subsurface pipes building foundations can be exposed to brackish or saline water tables which may induce premature deterioration depending on various factors department of environment and climate change new south wales 2008 the data for building foundation depths and materials are not recorded in christchurch and they are only available on individual building plans preventing a wide spread analysis for this paper other subsurface infrastructure not considered in this analysis include highway and road foundations utility pipelines and underground structures such as building basements and tunnels 4 2 2 parks groundwater salinity is an aspect of groundwater quality that determines which species might survive in an environment in addition to groundwater level and flux eamus et al 2016 shallow groundwater salinization can have several effects including coastal forest loss due to the failure of seedlings to germinate yield reductions in agricultural land eutrophication in surface water bodies invasion of salt tolerant species marsh migration upland tully et al 2019 and reduction of biodiversity zeng et al 2020 there were 41 parks and reserves within the interpolated brackish areas totalling 236 ha including the residential red zone christchurch city council 2021a the salinity tolerance thresholds of different plant species need to be considered when deciding what species to plant in areas with brackish or saline water table the salinization of shallow groundwater can threaten the survival of groundwater dependent salt intolerant species greene et al 2016 for example impacts of increased salinity intrusion up the ōpāwaho heathcote river and salinization of the adjacent shallow groundwater include the death of trees as well as the slumping of river banks watts 2011 in addition evapotranspiration increases soil salinity especially when the depth to water table is less than four metres below ground greene et al 2016 which is the case in this part of christchurch van ballegooy et al 2014 saltmarsh vegetation has also been observed in areas that overlap with the brackish regions bexley southshore and ferrymead orchard et al 2020 alternatively the natural landward migration of saltmarsh which provides abundant ecosystem services can be achieved depending on the availability and the hydrologic connectivity of intertidal space as has been observed in southshore with careful planning infrastructure design and protection of saltmarsh land orchard et al 2020 4 2 3 wastewater treatment plant saline groundwater can travel into wastewater pipes through pipe cracks and faults and increase wastewater salinity and hydraulic load coming into treatment plants miranda et al 2019 high salinity wastewater can corrode wastewater assets increase sulphide generation miranda et al 2019 impact the operation of wastewater treatment plants and limit the reusability of the treated water osman et al 2017 for example saline wastewater decreases sedimentation due to its greater buoyancy force compared to wastewater jang et al 2013 saline wastewater has also been shown to reduce microbial activity and diversity in activated sludge processes wu et al 2008 the biological treatment of wastewater has been shown to be acceptable up to a total dissolved solids tds of 4000 mg l equivalent to an sc of 7243 µs cm and inhibited above a tds of 8000 mg l alipour et al 2017 the salinity and chloride concentration of wastewater have not been regularly monitored and generally have not been of concern at the bromley wastewater treatment plant although wastewater salinity is not currently a pressing issue the monitoring of wastewater salinity can be useful to detect changes early on and future proof the optimality of wastewater assets especially under climate change impacts hughes et al 2021 singh and tiwari 2019 4 2 4 deeper aquifer and drinking supply wells the vertical hydraulic gradient between the christchurch formation and riccarton gravel units from january 2020 to january 2021 was positive indicating upward groundwater flow at marine parade and humphrey s drive under fresh groundwater conditions table 2 and see fig 2 for nested piezometer locations furthermore a vertical hydraulic gradient sensitivity analysis supplementary spreadsheet showed that positive hydraulic gradient would be maintained under hypothetical salinized shallow groundwater conditions of 50 seawater and 100 seawater calculated using freshwater head post et al 2018 therefore the riccarton gravel aquifer may not have been vulnerable to downward contamination by saltwater within this measurement period at these sites interestingly the vertical hydraulic gradient has increased compared to the values described in lough and williams 2009 and hertel 1998 who recorded a downward hydraulic gradient at the humphrey s drive site there are three community drinking supply wells that extract from the riccarton gravel aquifer located less than 2 8 kilometres from the ihutai estuary environment canterbury 2017 these wells may be vulnerable to saltwater intrusion if the vertical hydraulic gradient shifts downward a downward hydraulic gradient due to excessive pumping can result in the flow of contaminants from shallow to deeper confined aquifers as has been observed in cities such as jakarta and bangkok onodera et al 2008 this has also been observed in christchurch previously in the suburb of woolston where saline water moved from the ihutai avon heathcote estuary into the underlying semi confined riccarton gravel aquifer hertel 1998 in response to this pumping restrictions were put in place to ensure an upward vertical hydraulic gradient callander et al 2011 low lying coastal areas with leaky confining layers may be more vulnerable to seawater intrusion under downward hydraulic gradient and would warrant close monitoring 4 3 limitations and recommendations for future research the tidal variations were approximated to have minor influence on the groundwater salinity patterns at the overall scale of the analysis and the groundwater salinity was approximated to be at dynamic equilibrium over the majority of the study area some temporal variations in the groundwater salinity would be expected during the sampling period within tidally influenced areas but those areas would be limited and generally only indicate oscillations rather than event based or long term changes this study did not consider the piezometer depths in the interpolated map output although the piezometer depths were shown in fig 3 parts of the interpolated area are sparser in data points compared to other parts such as the area between the ōtākaro avon and ōpāwaho heathcote rivers the interpolated sc values need to be interpreted with caution and should be considered as indicative values or trends only for future research we recommend a wider analysis of chemical markers to confirm the source of shallow groundwater salinity such as boron concentrations to investigate the presence of wastewater in addition to shallow groundwater chloride concentrations other useful parameters to measure and map include ph and sulphate concentrations to assess groundwater conditions and the potential vulnerability of exposed subsurface infrastructure luo et al 2015 extensive hydraulic head data from the apn could be used to inform which piezometers are tidally influenced and it would be worthwhile installing data loggers to monitor sc over time the elevation of subsurface infrastructure could be analysed in relation to hydraulic head data which can be used to assess the vulnerability of underground assets especially in combination with groundwater sc data 5 conclusion in this study shallow groundwater salinity was measured and mapped in a low lying coastal city in new zealand christchurch and the municipal assets located within the brackish groundwater areas were highlighted brackish shallow groundwater at greater than 9 seawater sc 5000 µs cm was found in the suburb of southshore located on a sand dune spit between the ihutai avon heathcote estuary and the ocean and bexley located inside of the meander of the ōtākaro avon river tidal reach pockets of marginal sc 500 1500 µs cm shallow groundwater were found inland potentially attributed to wastewater leakage shallow groundwater north and northeast of the christchurch cbd was mostly fresh sc 500 µs cm potentially due to the close proximity to the recharge source the waimakariri river the municipal assets located within the brackish groundwater areas were highlighted the majority of stormwater pipes 69 and 17 of wastewater pipes in these areas are made of steel reinforced concrete which if damaged is vulnerable to premature deterioration when exposed to chloride underwater especially under wetting drying conditions luo et al 2015 there were 41 parks totalling 236 ha that lie within the brackish groundwater areas where groundwater dependent salt intolerant species can be at risk the salinity and chloride concentration of wastewater coming into the wastewater treatment plant have not been regularly monitored and generally have not been of concern the lack of information could present a vulnerability in itself in addition the vertical hydraulic gradient between the surficial christchurch formation aquifer and the underlying semi confined riccarton gravel aquifer was upward at the two nested piezometer sites within or near brackish groundwater areas in january 2020 to january 2021 therefore the riccarton gravel was not vulnerable to downward contamination by saltwater during the analysed time period key attributes that can inform other low lying coastal cities include monitoring shallow groundwater salinity is crucial for water resources management in low lying coastal cities with implications for park management subsurface pipes wastewater assets and deeper aquifers groundwater salinity could be taken into account when deciding what subsurface infrastructure material to install if it will interact with groundwater whether constantly or periodically additionally brackish groundwater conditions could be factored in to the expected service life of existing subsurface infrastructure that are exposed to it and inform decisions on maintenance or infrastructure monitoring efforts the salinity of shallow groundwater at a planting site could be taken into account when deciding what species to plant and their salinity thresholds to support plant survival saline groundwater can infiltrate into wastewater pipes through cracks and faults and increase wastewater salinity and hydraulic load coming into treatment plants it is therefore important to monitor the salinity of wastewater to inform management decisions and future proof the optimality of wastewater assets useful areas to install piezometers include i areas near tidal surface water bodies ii transects of piezometers perpendicular to a tidal surface water body in particular can show how groundwater salinity changes with distance iii low elevation areas with the water table close to the ground surface higher likelihood of interaction between shallow groundwater and subsurface infrastructure as well as vegetation root systems iv areas where downward saltwater contamination is of concern e g installation of nested piezometers near water supply wells to monitor vertical hydraulic gradient and groundwater salinity this study expands on the current literature by linking areas of saline groundwater to the existing municipal assets that reside within those areas which will continue to become more vulnerable under climate change conditions in addition the compilation of the cascading impacts of shallow groundwater salinization while drawing on examples in christchurch new zealand can be useful to groundwater managers and decision makers in similar urban settings lastly the identified potentially vulnerable municipal assets from saline shallow groundwater exposure can then be prioritised for further monitoring and management credit authorship contribution statement irene setiawan conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis

variability a distributed hydrological approach was adopted over new caledonia the wrf hydro model was implemented using a one way wrf meteorological forcing with rainfall being spatially interpolated from rain gauge observations using the thiessen polygon and idew methods the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm was applied for calibration on three contrasted flash floods two year validation allowed the dynamics of the watersheds to be studied and compared new hydrological insights for the region good results in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency were reached on all watersheds nse 0 6 wrf hydro showed consistent water budget components for two flash floods with 90 correlation between simulated and observed runoff coefficients of all basins adjusted physical parameters matched known

up to 60 during flash floods spatial patterns of soil moisture and flood decomposition led to improved understanding of watershed behavior and to a revision of infiltration properties for one of them

tropical mountainous islands present pitfalls for hydrological modeling fares 2008 due to the reduced size of watersheds to the slope of upstream catchments and to occurrence of extreme events such as tropical depressions they are prone to flash floods strauch et al 2015 which can be harmful for cities generally located on coastal plains moreover floods transport sediments chemical and biological components that can impact aquatic life richmond et al 2007 david et al 2010 and human health e g bierque et al 2020 some success in modeling these flash floods were obtained by adjustment of lumped

et al 2016 moreover comparison of lumped model parameters to actual catchment properties can be confounding beven 2000 on the other hand with the flourishing of fine spatial resolution and high frequency satellite data moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 leading to a growing availability of distributed data on rainfall land cover soil properties and meteorological parameters physics based distributed hydrological models tend to be more and more used they allow to address the question of water resource and of distribution of water in soils smith et al 2012 moreover fully coupled hydro meteorological models such as the wrf wrf hydro framework weather research and forecasting senatore et al 2015 arnault et al 2018 provide insights on the coupling between vegetation soil and atmosphere within the hydrological cycle which is required to understand the consequences of climate change for example wrf hydro s structure relies on the noah mp land surface model niu et al 2011 for vertical routing of water i e computation of soil moisture and partition between surface runoff infiltration and water withdrawal by vegetation extreme events may be simulated in a consistent way and closely analyzed thanks to coupled and distributed models however at the scale of a small island these models need to work at a resolution close to 1 km which is presently hardly achievable due to computer power limitations a first step to circumvent such issue can be partial decoupling of models rummler et al 2019 the wrf wrf hydro noah mp framework allows such a decoupling indeed the hydrological component wrf hydro can be run offline with external rainfall data arnaud et al 2002 and references therein emphasized the need of reliable high resolution rainfall data to compute accurate peak flows and runoff volumes with a distributed model fares et al 2014 ran the hl rdhm in the hanalei watershed in hawaii using rainfall and soil data generated by an external software and concluded that best results were obtained with a 1 1 km2 resolution for rainfall and soil moisture degraded results were only achieved when a coarser resolution of 2 2 km2 or 4 4 km2 was adopted camera et al 2020 used wrf hydro in coupling with both observed precipitation and era interim precipitation reanalysis at a 1 1 km2 resolution in cyprus which is a mountainous island also affected by extreme precipitation events in mediterranean climate they found that fair nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse coefficients were obtained with observed precipitations but that some basins returned negative nse with modeled precipitation which emphasizes the need of reliable precipitation at a fine resolution the grande terre island of new caledonia is located in the sw pacific fig 1a at the edge of the south pacific convergence zone spcz in the cyclonic area of the south pacific and is subject to a mild tropical climate dutheil et al 2020a 2020b it is strongly influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso on interannual timescales dutheil et al 2019 it is characterized by a central mountain range and a strong asymmetry between its humid east coast directly affected by tropical depressions and the drier western one fig 1a terry and wotling 2011 dutheil et al 2020a 2020b it also presents strong contrasts in soil properties between ultramafic rocks allowing water storage in aquifers mainly located in the south and metamorphic volcano sedimentary rocks generally devoid of aquifers with strong impact on low flow regimes fig 2a frysou 2008 in the context of climate change dutheil et al 2020b found using fine scale atmospheric wrf simulations that the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events over new caledonia will likely be reduced by 20 on average by 2080 2100 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario regional contrasts could even reach up to 40 reduction in the south of the island in order to anticipate the effects of such drastic projected drying on water resources while accounting for new caledonia s large land cover variability in space and time a suitable distributed hydrological modeling framework needs to be implemented desclaux et al 2018 showed that lumped hydrological models such as gr4h were well suited for ultramafic watersheds in the south east of new caledonia and that adjustment of model on a 7 10 year period was required to account for the effects of wildfires and enso effects of fire can be introduced in a distributed model by changing soil and land surface properties while large scale climate variabilities can be introduced in regional atmospheric models as boundary conditions despite lumped hydrological models great scores at reproducing observed runoff one major drawback of such compartment models is their absence of physical comprehension of mechanisms at work in the observed river outflows the goal of this work is hence to derive physical parameters of studied watersheds and enhance hydrological knowledge of new caledonia basins using wrf hydro because of the number of model parameters as well as the significant interactions between some of them calibration of hydro meteorological distributed models represents a considerable challenge in this context automatic methods specifically designed for hydrological purposes like the dds algorithm dynamically dimensioned search tolson and shoemaker 2007 were shown to quickly converge towards optimal setting of model parameters for complex models arsenault et al 2014 including wrf hydro here we explore the sensitivity of the dds calibration process and the resulting performances of wrf hydro with regards to the rainfall forcing as well as to the ability of the modeling system to reflect consistent hydrological behaviors model performances were assessed with discharge data from six contrasted watersheds located on various geological basement rocks and mainly in the southern part of the grande terre island the outputs of the wrf hydro model were eventually used to illustrate and understand components of the hydrographs such as baseflow and quickflow giving indications on the functioning of the watersheds as mentioned by camera et al 2020 small watersheds haven t been much studied with wrf hydro and the model was seldom forced with observed rainfall our study thus also contributes to improving this field of expertize in the wrf hydro community the paper is organized as follows in sections 2 and 3 the studied area and the model are described including the forcing and calibration strategies section 4 presents the results which are discussed in section 5 conclusive statements are eventually delivered in section 6 2 study area approximately 400 km long and 50 km wide grande terre is the main island of new caledonia its topography is dominated by a central mountain range 800 m high on average fig 1a the two highest peaks are located on the steeper eastern side with mont panié 1628 m in the north and mont humboldt 1618 m in the south new caledonia hosts both temperate and tropical climate features its meteorological cycle is strongly impacted by the seasonal movement of the spcz with a warm rainy season in austral summer and a comparatively colder and drier season in winter ceccarelli et al 2013 payri et al 2019 with high average annual rainfall around 1850 mm water supply is globally abundant tropical cyclones also affect new caledonia with 1 cyclone year in the new caledonia exclusive economic zone large scale climate fluctuations influence new caledonia s climate with wetter than normal summer during la niña and drier than normal up to 20 30 during el niños el niño events strongly increase wildfire risk barbero et al 2011 lefèvre et al 2010 overall water is regarded as a vulnerable resource since around 70 of the total rainfall occurs within approximately 50 days moron 2016 mainly during the first quarter of the year new caledonia mainland s orography strongly sculpts the rainfall distribution fig 1b indeed higher precipitation rates are observed in the east due to the significant obstacle formed by the mountain chain to the trade wind flow terry and wotling 2011 dutheil et al 2020a 2020b as a result most watersheds of grande terre are characterized by a strong east west contrast they are steep and of limited extension a few hundred km2 at the maximum watersheds from the west coast end in an alluvial plain which is not the case for the east coast however this effect is alleviated by the distribution of gauging stations which are located upstream of the alluvial plain in the west coast rivers of grande terre present both flash floods resulting from extreme rainy events of the tropical climate and of the limited size of watersheds and severe low flows resulting from climate variability and from the lack of significant aquifers able to sustain river flow during dry periods new caledonia is surrounded by a shallow lagoon the second largest in the world and recognized as a unesco world heritage site due to its exceptional biodiversity one third of new caledonia s basement consists in ultramafic rocks formed by alteration of peridotite which are mostly concentrated in the southern part of grande terre fig 2a soils resulting from weathering of these parent rocks include high levels of iron and magnesium as well as several other metals such as nickel chromium and cobalt such ground composition combined to mining activities causes metal rich sediment transport downstream into rivers and eventually into the lagoon especially during flash floods directly impacting the reef barrier fig 7 from dupouy et al 2018 land cover on the upstream of the gauging stations consist of evergreen forests and shrub on peridotite basement or woody savanna on micaschists fig 2c both resulting from degradation of the initial forest due to wildfires new caledonia s great spatial variability in terms of land cover likely leads to complex hydro meteorological mechanisms and feedbacks between land and the troposphere although there is no specific study on that aspect in this study six watersheds of various size and composition were examined fig 2 the choices of the watersheds were dictated by the quality of long term homogeneous data names physical and hydrological features of these watersheds are shown in table 1 3 material and methods 3 1 the wrf hydro noah mp lsm modeling system the noah multiparameterization land surface model lsm is a spatially distributed 1 d model which solves the vertical routing of surface and subsurface water flow in response to an atmospheric forcing based on four soil layers down to a maximum 2 m depth with default spanning 0 0 1 m 0 1 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m and 0 6 1 m soil water content dynamics are based on richard s equation chen et al 1996 the surface energy flux components the gravitational drainage at the bottom soil layer and the partitioning of surface water sum of rainfall reduced by the evaporation into infiltration and surface runoff are also computed thanks to an ensemble of parameterization patterns fig 3 see niu et al 2011 for details since noah mp lsm neglects the horizontal exchanges of water it needs to be complemented with lateral flow algorithms in order to give accurate simulation of the hydrologic cycle wrf hydro is a fully distributed hydro meteorological model that can be used for flash flood prediction seasonal forecasting of water resources and land atmosphere coupling studies gochis and chen 2003 gochis et al 2013 it was originally conceived as a coupling framework to facilitate the combined use of the wrf model and pieces of terrestrial hydrological models it is now a stand alone hydrological modeling architecture that can complement noah mp by describing lateral routing of surface and subsurface water as well as groundwater storage it solves specifically for the saturated subsurface flow the 2 d overland water flow the aquifer recharge discharge and the 1 d channel flow fig 3 in wrf hydro surface flow occurs when the surface water level of a specific grid cell exceeds a maximum retention depth while subsurface flow is activated when maximum humidity capacity is exceeded in a given soil layer ponded water depths can be subject to future infiltration and evaporation vertical routing from noah mp the 2 d overland flow is routed across terrain elements according to the topography when reaching grid cells identified as channel surface water in excess of the local retention depth is passed to the channel model in this study the 2 d surface flow and the 1 d flow in the channels were computed with the diffusive wave equation which is an approximation for the saint venant equations that correspond to the shallow water models used in hydrology hingray et al 2015 subsurface flow is computed in soils as a function of hydraulic gradients resulting from the topography taking into account the saturated soil depth and hydraulic conductivity gochis et al 2013 with p the precipitation rate q the surface runoff rate and i the soil infiltration rate all three in mm s 1 the surface water budget equation at each time step t is q t p t i t in the wrf stand alone version this infiltration excess q is removed from the model in wrf hydro it is horizontally redistributed and may infiltrate

drainage from the base of the 2 m soil column baseflow flux is equally redistributed among all channel pixels parameters controlling the hydrograph volume are mostly the infiltration coefficient kdt and the maximum soil moisture content smcmax via the liquid soil moisture deficit of the soil column d t parameters controlling the hydrograph shape are mainly the 2d overland flow roughness factor ovroughrtfac and manning s coefficient for channel roughness mann indeed surface roughness plays an important role in transmitting infiltration excess water to channel networks plausible parameter ranges are displayed in table 2a of section 3 4 we note here that as with many physics based modeling approaches there can be modest interactions between some of these parameters 3 2 meteorological forcing and data sources the wrf hydro model needs to be provided with atmospheric forcing here we used the wrf model skamarock et al 2008 widely used in the atmospheric science community wrf was adjusted to the south pacific and new caledonia area in previous studies jourdain et al 2011 lefèvre et al 2010 dutheil et al 2020a 2020b jullien et al 2014 it allows providing surface atmospheric state variables air temperature surface pressure specific humidity horizontal wind components at 10 m downward incoming shortwave and longwave radiation and rainfall rate to force wrf hydro and noah mp in offline mode the method exposed in lefèvre et al 2010 and dutheil et al 2020a 2020b was used for downscaling wrf results to a spatial resolution of 4 4 km2 hourly simulation outputs were used to perform the calibration and validation of wrf hydro while atmospheric states from wrf were proven appropriate on climatological timescales and weather regime statistics compared to observation over new caledonia dutheil et al 2020a 2020b lefèvre et al 2010 the day to day rainfall variability was not as satisfactory and prone to large errors compared to other surface quantities like temperature humidity or wind it is known that precise simulation of rainfall events with such mesoscale weather models is still challenging xu et al 2019 cuo et al 2011 kobold and suselj 2005 as accurate precipitation data in terms of volume and timing are crucial to hydrological modeling hourly observations from the 24 tipping bucket rain gauges indicated on fig 2a were preferred over the model rainfall outputs model calibration and validation of simulated discharge were performed using data from the reference stream gauge of each watershed fig 2a stream and rain gauge data were provided by direction des affaires vétérinaires alimentaires et rurales davar which administrates and handles the hydrological network in new caledonia additional rain gauges from météo france were also used to force the selected watersheds 3 3 model implementation and evaluation 3 3 1 rainfall spatial interpolation because of the sparse spatial distribution of the rainfall stations and strong influence of orography on precipitation patterns fig 1 two rainfall spatial interpolation methods were tested in this study the well known thiessen polygon method was used on all six watersheds it consists in attributing a specific area of influence to each rain gauge depending on the overall gauge network over the related catchment fig 4 in specific terms each grid point of the lsm inside a given polygon voronoï polygons receives the same amount of precipitation as the associated rain gauge a second method for rainfall partitioning was evaluated based on the inverse distance and elevation weighting algorithm idew masih et al 2011 for sensitivity tests it was implemented on three watersheds for it had already proven to perform well compared to other standard methods of rainfall spatial interpolation however previous works found that it performed only marginally better than the thiessen polygon method with lumped models in new caledonia desclaux et al 2018 hence the simpler thiessen method was kept for gauge interpolation in most of this study the mathematical form of the equation used in idew to calculate the interpolated rainfall p ˆ i j t at grid point i j and time t from hourly time series data of kth rain gauge p k t over all n gauges is 5 p ˆ i j t k 1 n p k t 1 d i j w d k i j α 1 z i j 1 w δ z k i j β with d k i j the distance in m between kth rain gauge and grid

were used here i e w 0 8 α 2 and β 1 these values are fairly close to the optimal set desclaux et al 2018 determined using the lumped model gr4h over four new caledonia watersheds w 0 8 α 1 5 and β 0 5 3 3 2 validation metrics the normalized version of the root mean squared error i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient most commonly used for evaluation of hydrological models was used as a performance indicator along with its log transformed version the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 criterion was also used in particular for calibration purposes these efficiency criteria have different assets and drawbacks depending on their use such as calibration or performance analysis of simulations x s t faced with observations x o t t 1 n they are computed as follows 6 nse 1 t 1 n x o t x s t 2 t 1 n x o t x o 2 i e n s e 1 rmse 2 σ o 2 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 with r the linear correlation coefficient between x s and x o α σ s σ o β x s x o quantities x o x s σ o and σ s are the mean and standard deviation of the observed and simulated streamflow values respectively while the nse exhibits a strong sensitivity towards peak flows and provides little information on systematic model biases the log transformed nse provides more information on the quality of low water simulations kge was used in this study as an alternative criterion that can help reduce model calibration problems however it is important to have in mind that it was never intended by their authors as an improved measure of model performance see gupta et al 2009 3 4 wrf hydro setup and calibration procedure the approach adopted here involves forward coupling of the wrf hydro model by forcing it with a 2 year long atmospheric simulation computed with wrf except for rainfall wrf hydro was run using a 50 m digital elevation model dem generated from the bdalti nc database provided by the new caledonia government land cover generated from modis 500 m with classification of vegetation types based on local forestry expertize lafarge et al 2014 and soil type data at 2000 m resolution adapted from the atlas of new caledonia fritsch 2012 to fit usgs categories lafarge et al 2014 the hydrological routing grid was chosen at 100 m resolution while a cell spacing of 200 m for the noah mp lsm was implemented both were prepared under grass gis 7 6 0 the time step was set to 900 s for the land surface model vertical routing to maintain model stability and prevent numerical dispersion of overland flood waves a conservative time step of 10 s for channel and overland flow routing was chosen in this study this value met the courant condition criteria cfl for adaptive time integration schemes of the flow equations on a 100 m resolution grid however it needed to be decreased locally to 3 s for thio watershed for some flood events as instabilities were still recorded when observations exceeded 4500 m3 s 1 noah mp lsm and wrf hydro require a great deal of input parameters most of them directly dependent on either land use e g type and density of vegetation or soil type e g silt clay loam sand the calibration process allows determining the optimal tunable coefficients to apply to these spatial parameters proportionally to their default values based on suggestions by yucel et al 2015 verri et al 2017 rummler et al 2019 and camera et al 2020 seven parameters were calibrated i the surface infiltration coefficient or soil permeability ii the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity iii the pore size distribution index iv the percolation coefficient v the 2d overland flow roughness factor vi manning s factor for channel roughness and vii the maximum value for soil moisture storage typical range of these parameters is displayed in table 2a other wrf hydro tables specifying parameters regarding the channel geometry bucket model coefficients irrelevant here with the pass through option and lateral surface and subsurface water routing factors were left to their default values gochis et al 2013 the pore size distribution index bexp the maximum soil moisture content smcmax and the infiltration coefficient kdt correspond to an adjustment of soil dependent values through dksat for kdt already introduced in the noah mp land surface model the percolation slope and soil permeability refkdt parameters are spatially constant on each watershed both the overland flow roughness factor ovroughrtfac and the manning s factor for channel roughness mann are multiplicative factors that apply to reference values depending on land occupation for the former and on the stralher order of each river reach for the latter gochis et al 2013 these reference values are provided in table 2b the calibration procedure based on the dds global optimization algorithm for watershed modeling designed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used by running the ncar s national center for atmospheric research workflow written by karsten 2018 the dds algorithm has been shown to be suitable for a great number of parameters to optimize and to rapidly converge to best calibration solutions while easily avoiding poor local optima the scalar neighborhood size perturbation parameter r that defines at each iteration the amplitude of the random perturbation as a fraction of the range of the parameter to be modified was set at its default value of 0 2 kge was chosen as calibration criterion and the number of iterations was limited to 100 each watershed was independently calibrated on three characteristic week long storms similarly to what was performed in yucel et al 2015 the june 2012 march 2014 period was chosen for data cross availability purposes that range included both moderate el niño and la niña periods which allow to sample both dry and wet conditions in new caledonia in addition it covered the seasonal cycle as well as several extreme meteorological events such as tropical depressions e g edna in february 2014 each calibration procedure was initialized with restart files which is critical for soil moisture initial conditions from 9 months spin up runs made with default values for all parameters calibration was carried out on the three events labeled as black boxes on fig 5 using the thiessen polygon rainfall spatial interpolation method and the idew algorithm for three of the six watersheds event 1 was a very strong stormy event in an unusual dry period between 2013 06 30 and 2013 07 05 event 2 was a weaker and more usual rainy event between 2013 11 30 and 2013 12 05 that induced a more moderate hydrological response and event 3 corresponded to the edna tropical depression in the heart of the rainy season between 2014 02 02 and 2014 02 07 all in all the two year simulation period and the calibration events chosen in this study allowed accounting for a fair amount of variability in the new caledonia case for each watershed and method of rainfall interpolation the three distinct parameter sets obtained by calibration on each of the three events were then used to validate the model over the june 2012 march 2014 remaining period the best calibration set was chosen based on a multiobjective criterion consisting in the arithmetic mean of nse nse log10 and kge computed on the validation period the use of such criterion was justified by the variety of patterns over which each criterion exhibits specific sensitivity to in order to keep quality balanced simulations finally thio watershed could not be calibrated upon event 1 because of missing streamflow data in july 2013 probably due to system malfunction caused by the storm initial unsatisfactory calibration of thio over the second and third event led to a successful 24 day calibration on event 3 starting from 2014 01 15 instead of 2014 02 02 4 results 4 1 performance of wrf hydro and calibrated parameter values with thiessen rainfall forcing model performances table 3 concerning nse could be considered as good except perhaps for the pouembout watershed where they were only satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 criteria the multiobjective criterion being more sensitive to low flows allowed better discrimination of watersheds with unsatisfactory low flow simulations as was the case for couvelée and pouembout wrf hydro is very sensitive to the adjustment of six parameters table 3 with kdt resulting from calibration of refkdt and dksat final calibrated values of these parameters corresponded to those commonly found in the literature yucel et al 2015 verri et al 2017 camera et al 2020 including high manning values as it can be the case for woody rivers in small steep mountainous catchments yochum et al 2012 the maximum soil moisture content smcmax was found relatively stable with the one exception of the pouembout watershed and to a lesser extent couvelée with a very large water storage capacity affording larger soil moisture deficit d t see eqs 1 and 3 the pore size distribution index the percolation and the infiltration coefficients exhibited strong variations suggesting that some additional efforts in adjusting the spatial variability of hydraulic properties of soils roughness and vegetation should be made for example dumbéa est and coulée have similar environmental properties table 1 and share some common delineation fig 2 but a striking difference in the kdt factor was observed while usual values for kdt are in the range of 0 1 5 day 1 this optimal timescale factor for the partition between infiltration and runoff was found in the upper bound for coulée but in the lower bound for dumbéa est this peculiar point will be addressed in 5 1 both manning and overland roughness factors two important friction parameters acting on the flood temporal dynamics during storm events showed important differences among the six watersheds significant pearson correlations were found fig 6 between some of wrf hydro s model parameters the two validation criteria and the morphometric as well as the hydrological properties of the watersheds table 1 taken from alric 2009 despite the use of the statistical significance levels fisher and yates 1953 denoted by stars and colors in fig 6 these results should be taken with caution as the size of the studied sample six watersheds is small hence only correlations greater than 0 73 p value 0 1 0 81 p value 0 05 and 0 92 p value 0 01 are highlighted and discussed in fig 6 the pore size distribution index was found fairly correlated with the slope parameter the open shrubland land occupation and the recession time negative correlation the maximum soil moisture content was positively correlated with the woody savanna land occupation and negatively correlated with the runoff coefficient the slope coefficient was only correlated to the recession time negatively and the pore size the 2d overland roughness coefficient to woody savanna fair correlation while the manning river coefficient was strongly correlated with rainfall and the hydraulic length of the basin negative sign the infiltration coefficient was fairly correlated to soil types section 5 3 discusses these results the two validation criteria were not correlated with the same variables the nash criterion which is mainly sensitive to flood peaks was not strongly correlated to any other variable except maybe to the runoff coefficient by contrast the multiobjective criterion was correlated with several independent parameters it was strongly correlated 0 97 correlation coefficient with the runoff coefficient of the basin and with the maximum soil moisture content 0 92 it was also fairly correlated with the sandy clay loam soil occurrence the woody savanna land occupation and the pore size distribution index due to the correlations with the runoff coefficient and with soil parameters such as clay type that favors runoff one can conclude that the wrf hydro model works better when only surface water is involved in flood generation 4 2 wrf hydro water budget components and consistency in hydrological behaviors the detailed study of major storms 1 and 3 fig 5 throughout the different water components of wrf hydro s simulations showed many interesting features event 1 took place during the cold season when little rainfall is usually observed and did not occur after any other significant flood event 3 occurred in the heart of the hot rainy season and marked the end of a one month long continuous rainy period the water budget components computed by wrf hydro during events 1 and 3 are given in fig 7 as the model is conservative for the total amount of water accumulated rainfall during these events summing up to between 10 and 20 of the yearly amount could thus be decomposed into surface runoff change in soil moisture storage and groundwater outflow as expected during an extreme rainfall window of only a few days transpiration and evaporation were negligible however simulations did account for the fact that evapotranspiration was higher during event 3 which occurred in the austral summer period using wrf hydro outputs runoff coefficients could be computed from the sum of surface runoff and groundwater outflow as seen in fig 8 the resulting simulated runoff coefficients were in agreement with the mean runoff coefficients alric 2009 of their watersheds for the two events indeed there was high positive correlation between reference values of runoff coefficients x axis and event computed runoff coefficients y axis 0 90 for event 1 and 0 86 for event 3 p value 0 05 the pouembout river presented a low simulated runoff for event 1 25 close to its mean referenced value 27 interestingly it received a relatively small amount of rainfall 86 mm that soils were mostly able to absorb while the other watersheds received more than 350 mm conversely pouembout s runoff coefficient during event 3 was 57 which is much larger than the mean 27 referenced for this watershed that probably corresponded to a rainfall intensity exceeding the infiltration soil capacity compared to other basins and especially to its neighbor dumbéa est coulée presented a very large groundwater outflow as part of its high runoff coefficient additional discussion is provided in section 5 1 while focusing on baseflow behavior couvelée was found to be able to store large amounts of water in its soil layers during both extreme rainfall events especially during event 1 with 204 mm along with little groundwater outflow leading to slow return of rainwater to the stream channel such behavior was in agreement with its low referenced runoff coefficient 41 table 1 and rather high recession period 97 days table 1 this was supported by a high calibrated smcmax value 0 54 m3 m3 providing conditions for large moisture deficits eq 3 a large infiltration capacity during storms kdt value of 3 8 day 1 see table 3 and eq 1 and a low drainage strength through low values for slope and bexp table 3 promoting a slowdown of the groundwater outflow in interstorm periods tontouta and thio are the two largest drainage basins with area above 340 km2 they share similar runoff coefficients 55 but tontouta has a recession time twice that of thio 120 days the longest of our sample see table 1 fig 7 reveals that the simulated surface runoff on thio basin was high 55 in storm periods compared to tontouta 45 but the underground runoff was higher 20 for the latter compared to the former 10 just like couvelée this hydrological response from tontouta could be associated with large kdt value 2 8 day 1 small pore size distribution index 1 5 and low slope parameter 0 31 table 3 that participated in the slowdown of the subsurface and groundwater drainage and long recession time other differences in soil properties and spatial distribution of land cover could not be ruled out and are discussed in 5 1 4 3 hydrological response to the spatial distribution of rainfall the changes in model performance and values of calibrated parameters between the idew and the thiessen polygon rainfall interpolation methods are displayed in table 4 here the sensitivity to spatial distribution of rainfall was addressed using dumbéa est 60 km2 and coulée 40 km2 two watersheds sharing some common delineation and lithology ultramafic but displaying large variation in calibrated parameters table 3 and pouembout 180 km2 the unique river basin in this study with a metamorphic lithology the resulting changes in water budget components for events 1 and 3 are displayed in fig 9 contrary to thiessen idew considers the difference in altitude and distance to rain gauges to interpolate precipitation data this led to modifications in the spatial distribution of total rainfall at the basin scale in time with more rainfall on high areas see fig 4 where soils and vegetation are usually denser and in the presence of drier downhill areas that were thus less saturated at the beginning of major events in turn it resulted in modifications in the water budgets with simulated changes in soil moisture storage varying by up to 60 during flash floods compared to thiessen from 97 mm to 97 63 mm for event 1 on dumbéa even if total rainfall was rather unchanged 5 at maximum fig 9 performances were rather similar for all watersheds using both methods however a higher nse but lower multiobjective criterion was achieved on pouembout with idew the change in spatial distribution of rainfall due to idew drove a robust change in calibration in particular through kdt table 4 the timescale parameter controlling the partition of rainfall into surface runoff and infiltration eq 1 using idew rainfall interpolation kdt was systematically doubled indicating that more water was injected into the lower zone reducing the overall surface flow since values of bexp and slope two parameters controlling the strength of the drainage from the soil column were reduced by half in idew compared to thiessen a possible compensation effect could be at stake the larger the infiltration to the lower zones due to larger values of kdt the lower bexp and slope furthermore one may observe a similar compensation effect through lower surface and channel friction parameters with idew indeed the model responded accordingly to balance lower surface flow to the drainage network so as to respect the shape of flood hydrographs it is worth noting that smcmax the parameter describing how much water soils can store was the only parameter to show very little sensitivity to changes in rainfall interpolation since the two spatial distributions for rainfall resulted in two distinct sets of wrf hydro optimal parameters sensitivity of the water budgets to these interpolation changes was also closely analyzed from fig 9 increase of water storage in soils using idew was well captured in the watershed pair dumbéa est and coulée both responding by a large reduction in surface runoff however the pouembout basin presented an opposite behavior with slightly increased surface runoff with idew such contrasted reactions in the water budgets may stem from large differences in physiography lithology and or land cover between basins table 1 as upland areas correspond in dumbéa est and coulée terrestrial data to forest or close shrubland that both favor infiltration and to a clay soil that favors runoff these results suggested that the former effect could prevail for these watersheds in the pouembout watershed the presence of woody savanna uphill that is suspected to play an important role in the production and transfer of rainwater flow to downslope areas tramier et al 2021 could explain part of the opposite effect differences in spatial distribution of rainfall slightly altered the calibration quality as well table 4 for example small basins like coulée and dumbéa exhibited somewhat lower nash criterion when using idew compared with thiessen a small decrease 0 07 points on the nash scale while idew promoted a better flood prediction in the pouembout case nash value of 0 74 against 0 58 with thiessen pouembout observed and simulated flood hydrographs during the edna tropical depression are shown in fig 10 clearly the hydrological response with idew for that basin seemed to enhance the simulated timing and shape of the flood compared with observations during that event the slightly increased surface runoff partly induced by the idew parameter set especially the very low friction parameter 0 01 for ovroughrtfac table 4 is likely to have acted for quicker and clearly more fitting timely response for the second peak flow by contrast the same close inspection of the flood hydrographs for dumbéa est fig 11 and coulée not shown here indicated that a slower response with less surface runoff light green bars in the case of idew did not seem adequate for these watersheds especially in terms of flood recession behavior that is further discussed in section 5 2 5 discussion 5 1 lessons from wrf hydro s hydrograph separation using a physics based model allows computing the different components of a flood here a separation between quickflow and baseflow is proposed through one application focused on differences between dumbéa est and coulée as pointed out both river basins share some common delineation fig 2 and are thus close in terms of environmental properties and highly related however wrf hydro s calibration led to large differences in their simulated hydraulic properties and behaviors with opposite values for the kdt timescale factor for infiltration runoff table 3 and table 4 and contrasted details in the water partition see water budgets from fig 7 fig 12 details and compares their respective flood hydrograph during event 1 both watersheds reacted comparably in terms of streamflow to the extreme rainfall event with dumbéa est receiving somewhat higher cumulated precipitations as represented by the solid light blue line wrf hydro however suggested different baseflow behaviors for the two watersheds within our framework baseflow corresponds to the decrease of soil water content in post storm days the baseflow curve and the envelope curve for the changes in water storage depicted through orange bars fluctuate accordingly fig 12 for comparison the automatic separation method from pelletier and andréassian 2020 was applied with a quadratic reservoir using their baseflow r package and adapted to hourly streamflow observations using their method the resulting baseflow responses dashed light blue line fig 12 appeared much more similar for both watersheds in terms of amplitude and timing than suggested by wrf hydro which calls for further investigation land occupations of these two watersheds are completely different the upper dumbea includes forest dense shrubland and open shrubland it is devoid of mines the coulée watershed includes several abandoned mines and was subjected to repeated wildfires which both induced severe erosion and gullies reaching the host rock fig 13 hence even though it actually includes numerous bare fractured rocks leading to large infiltration of rainwater the pedology map on which wrf hydro s soil types are based inappropriately indicates clay soils for coulée resulting in low infiltration and percolation capacities the model thus compensated by adjusting the infiltration parameter kdt to 5 0 day 1 for coulée which is the largest for our six watersheds and up to 8 9 day 1 when tested with idew rainfall distribution in turn in accordance with its low recession time 43 days the lowest of all six and rather high runoff coefficient 61 percolation from highly infiltrating soil layers to the underground buckets was also boosted almost to its maximum value slope parameter to 0 98 eventually wrf hydro was then able to account for the large component of baseflow in coulée watershed fig 12b such a behavior was not suggested for dumbéa est by wrf hydro fig 12a the comparison with pelletier and andréassian s automatic method which does not show the same baseflow differences between the two watersheds emphasizes some of the strengths of distributed models allowing to better comprehend underground mechanisms in that case to further pursue on the advantages stemming from the use of such physics based model fig 14 shows a similar approach on thio and tontouta the two largest watersheds of our sample their hydrographs together with a representation of the time variation of spatial distribution of soil water content allows exploring hydrological spatial behaviors as mentioned before tontouta has a recession time almost twice as important as thio according to alric 2009 which resulted in a higher infiltration rate 4 5 times larger than thio and lower pore size distribution index and percolation coefficient indeed in tontouta the high infiltration coefficient induced a fast absorption of rainwater which long remained stored in elevated areas largely covered with dense forests over clay soils resulting in slow discharge into the streamflow concurrently water stored within sandy clay loam soils in valleys was rapidly discharged into the stream network bolstering an early baseflow response between t0 3 and t0 5 days fig 14a and fig 7 for groundwater outflow in contrast thio infiltrated less quickly and most of rainwater was thus converted to surface runoff green bars fig 14b its baseflow was consequently slower and much smaller than in tontouta see soil moisture maps between t0 3 and t0 5 days fig 14b comparison with baseflow from pelletier and andréassian s automatic separation method fig 12 and fig 14 revealed that wrf hydro relies much less on underground discharge for flood simulation except for coulée the approach discussed above could however contribute to providing consistent methods for flood decomposition which still constitutes an open topic see for example pelletier and andréassian 2020 for instance a distributed physical model such as wrf hydro could help to understand the fate of tracers of harmful minerals in the environment arnault et al 2021 5 2 sensitivity of wrf hydro to observed rainfall spatial interpolation method data scarcity for precise rainfall amount and its spatial distribution is generally considered a major source of uncertainties in hydrological modeling smith et al 2004a 2004b moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 the two methods of rainfall interpolation resulted in small differences in the nse on three watersheds a result already found by desclaux et al 2018 replication of flash floods especially recessions turned out to be slightly poorer with idew on the small and highly rainfed coulée and dumbéa watersheds with high runoff coefficient 60 still since idew produced more rainfall on elevated areas water budgets were changed with generally more water stored in soils during flash floods it results that the rainfall interpolation method is likely to control water available for the river when simulating low flow in dry season periods accurate rainfall products should thus be used to model the water resource and its evolution under climate change the larger flatter and less elevated pouembout watershed with lower rainfall 1500 mm year and runoff coefficient 27 displayed a contrasted more adequate reaction towards peak flow observations with idew forcing hence high resolution rainfall distribution is also crucial for correct flash flood simulation depending on watershed size and configuration generally speaking for a fixed small number of rain stations higher sensitivity to spatial distribution and quality of rainfall data is expected with increasing size of watersheds hohmann et al 2021 the validity of the different rainfall interpolation methods could further be explored if refined rainfall data were available thanks to a temporary denser rain gauge network finally the use of dds calibration with the two interpolation methods also indicated interesting features of wrf hydro when applying idew rainfall forcing compared to the thiessen polygon method rainfall increase on high areas which are far from the gauging station was relevantly balanced by a decrease in the adjusted manning and overland flow roughness factors it indeed allowed surface and channel flow to be accelerated so as to ensure similar and appropriate timing in the triggering of the flood overall large compensation effects were broadly observed between several optimal parameters like kdt compared to bexp and slope calibrated parameter sets are thus the result of model adaptation to multiple sources of errors such as i rainfall and streamflow measurements ii weaknesses in the calibration process iii quality of terrestrial data and iv flaws in the wrf hydro model structure 5 3 significance of optimal physical parameters benefits limitations and perspectives of the model in the general context of hydrological modeling following calibration on each of the three short rainfall events and optimal selection of the best 2 year resulting run wrf hydro s final adjusted parameters were found in adequacy with known hydrologic and morphometric properties of watersheds indeed basins with long recession periods were logically attributed low percolation rates slope and small pore size distribution bexp in order to simulate slow vertical routing within deep soil layers and thus long lasting baseflows high proportion of woody savanna land cover was logically associated with high overland roughness it was also related to large soil moisture storage which could indicate that maximum water content of soils covered by savanna needed to be adjusted upwards manning coefficient was maximum for small mountainous basins characterized by steep rivers with rough beds coulée dumbéa couvelée while larger watersheds presenting more smooth bed had a lower manning pouembout thio tontouta this parameter was highly correlated with rainfall since high altitude catchments not only receive more rainfall but also correspond to steep slopes and to rough riverbeds neither the 2d roughness multiplicative factor nor the 2d roughness average over the whole watershed not shown presented strong correlation with land occupation a possible explanation could be that surface runoff scarcely occurs and that flow is rather collected in series of gullies further evidence of this concentrated flow regime resulted from the fact that all calibrated multiplicative factors were lower than one implying faster transfer of water than in the default framework high infiltration coefficients were found for some watersheds with a high clay soil type proportion indicating a necessary adjustment of the model default behavior as seen in section 5 1 for coulée watersheds presenting a high level of runoff were better described by the model than those presenting both surface runoff and large infiltration this probably indicates that surface flow is more adequately described by the diffusive wave equation and that the coupling between the surface and subsurface vertical and horizontal routes involves more complex modeling the latter model parameterizations suffer from uncertainties in soil parameters and simplification of the supply from soil to the river performance analysis on longer time periods should be undertaken to investigate low flow regimes more closely this would require exploring the sensitivity of the model to the different underground options only the pass through option was tested here to the spatial variability of soil thickness and to the agreement of simulated evapotranspiration series for example to reliable in situ or satellite data lumped reservoir models such as the gr suite modèles du génie rural perrin et al 2009 e g gr4h are able to produce better results on longer time periods in terms of flood simulation nse of 0 72 for coulée 0 89 for dumbéa est and 0 93 for couvelée in desclaux et al 2018 and especially low flow regimes kge of the same magnitude they also require much less human and computational work however they need a significant number of years of observations to be properly calibrated the use of dds calibration was found efficient for producing good calibrated solutions with few rainfall and streamflow observations week long events while sparing computational work owing to this algorithm wrf hydro can be achieved at the scale of small watersheds few hundred km2 with reasonable spatial resolution 100 m routing grid and at an hourly time step onto standard computing systems in addition such a physics based distributed modeling system allows substantially deeper understanding of hydrological processes in the different catchments as well as the ability to easily account for modifications in soil properties and land use which cannot be achieved in simple reservoir models this study started to shed some light on the potential to transfer physical parameters from calibrated watersheds to other ungauged basins in grande terre on the one hand some watersheds with analogous properties shared comparable calibrated values in model parameters for instance couvelée and tontouta both featured high recession times and moderate runoff coefficients table 1 in connection with these characteristics both were modeled with high infiltration rate kdt combined to low bexp and slope table 3 so as to reproduce large water storage capacity during storms and lasting baseflows during post storm periods they also both had low ovroughrtfac so as to accelerate surface runoff and balance their large infiltration capacities therefore depending on recession times and runoff coefficients combinations of low high kdt opposed to high low bexp and slope could be suggested for ungauged basins on the other hand it was shown that two closely related watersheds like coulée and dumbéa although sharing some resembling hydrological and environmental features table 1 could not be modeled with similar parameters pointing to difficulties in achieving robust regionalization with wrf hydro finally a full spatial distribution of the core parameters selected kdt bexp slope ovroughrtfac mann and smcmax could allow for a better transition at watershed boundaries and improve regionalization perspectives although suitable simulation was performed and insightful developments were allowed limitations of this work remain present first of all even though the chosen period of calibration validation encompasses many of the climate features of the region results necessarily bear dependencies to the data even more so as the simulation and validation periods are rather short 3 weeks and 2 years parameter values may presumptively be contingent to the selection and length of calibration events moreover the validation period only partly accounts for the decennial climatic variability of new caledonia in addition to using short flash flood calibration periods the multi objective function used here gives more weight to high flows and thus influences the ultimate setup of the model low flows appear to be reproduced in a much less satisfactory way than high flows in our framework especially on couvelée and pouembout two exogenous additive factors that are not controlled by the calibration process could explain an upward bias in simulated low flows especially when working at an hourly time step i evapotranspiration is likely underestimated in wet tropical environments by wrf hydro lin et al 2018 and ii rain gauge spatial interpolation may introduce too much water in the system including in low rainfall periods schleiss et al 2020 all in all even though wrf hydro was found to be suitable to simulate flash flood patterns in various basins of new caledonia this study s interpretations remain conditional to the testing conditions and thus have to be taken with caution 6 summary and conclusion in this study the wrf hydro modeling framework was found able to fairly simulate runoff observations and faithfully reproduce flash flood behavior on six watersheds of the tropical island of new caledonia sw pacific this work focused on a two year period and made use of a wrf meteorological forcing complemented with spatially interpolated rain gauge data it achieved good results in terms of nse after automatic calibration on three short less than one week and contrasted events thanks to a workflow based on the dds algorithm with alternating moderate el niño and la niña periods affected by flash floods during both dry and wet seasons we believe the calibration validation time interval chosen in this study was relevant in terms of climatological representativeness of new caledonia following the analysis of adjusted parameters and simulated water budget components on two flash flood events the model successfully reproduced hydrological behavior of all watersheds it provided fairly matching physical constants with known hydrologic and morphometric properties confirmed by correlation statistics yet as these were obtained only on a six watershed sample extension of the analysis to other watersheds in new caledonia should be prioritized in future studies longer calibration and simulation periods should also be selected to confirm the conclusions in some instances such as the coulée watershed wrf hydro s adjusted parameters provided perspectives for a better understanding of the watershed properties that were inadequately described in the available soil database overall wrf hydro enabled to model some of the diversity of soils and land occupation of grande terre of new caledonia this study thus confirms that wrf hydro is relevant for flash flood analysis on small watersheds even with limited rainfall observations wrf hydro also provided information on distributed properties such as the water budgets and soil humidity we showed that thanks to a better constraint on the watershed water storage properties the model allowed discussing most components of the flood signal including its recession part thanks to its decomposition of runoff components wrf hydro constitutes a fine tool to help better compare subsurface and underground water components between allegedly similar catchments it is important to point out that realistic rainfall spatial distribution is needed in order to provide distributed water resources this was emphasized here by the difference in water budget components between the thiessen polygon and idew rainfall interpolation methods with the continuous improvements of meteorological models such as wrf allowing small scale representation of atmospheric variables there are hopes that flood events and their dynamics can be better understood along the same lines the framework that we have developed may be used to understand how climate variability and climate change can impact water resources in new caledonia especially in the context of a drastic projected drying of new caledonia by the end of the century we finally suggest that the findings of the present study could also be conclusive on other mountainous islands presenting watersheds similar in size and in altitude to those of grande terre and experiencing comparable weather conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

8009,study region six watersheds of the main island of new caledonia study focus in the context of a projected reduction of extreme precipitation events by 20 by 2100 combined to large land cover variability a distributed hydrological approach was adopted over new caledonia the wrf hydro model was implemented using a one way wrf meteorological forcing with rainfall being spatially interpolated from rain gauge observations using the thiessen polygon and idew methods the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm was applied for calibration on three contrasted flash floods two year validation allowed the dynamics of the watersheds to be studied and compared new hydrological insights for the region good results in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency were reached on all watersheds nse 0 6 wrf hydro showed consistent water budget components for two flash floods with 90 correlation between simulated and observed runoff coefficients of all basins adjusted physical parameters matched known watershed morphological and hydrological features both methods of rainfall interpolation produced similar nse but strongly different water distributions with simulated soil moisture changes varying by up to 60 during flash floods spatial patterns of soil moisture and flood decomposition led to improved understanding of watershed behavior and to a revision of infiltration properties for one of them overall wrf hydro proved to be a suitable framework to better understand hydrological processes and efficiently handle prospective modifications of new caledonia s land cover and climate regimes keywords new caledonia hydrological modeling wrf hydro dds parameter adjustment rainfall spatial interpolation hydrograph separation 1 introduction as a result of large spatial heterogeneities small tropical mountainous islands present pitfalls for hydrological modeling fares 2008 due to the reduced size of watersheds to the slope of upstream catchments and to occurrence of extreme events such as tropical depressions they are prone to flash floods strauch et al 2015 which can be harmful for cities generally located on coastal plains moreover floods transport sediments chemical and biological components that can impact aquatic life richmond et al 2007 david et al 2010 and human health e g bierque et al 2020 some success in modeling these flash floods were obtained by adjustment of lumped statistical models wotling 2000 charlier et al 2008 desclaux et al 2018 however extension of these models to other catchments especially to ungauged catchments is problematic hingray et al 2015 beck et al 2016 moreover comparison of lumped model parameters to actual catchment properties can be confounding beven 2000 on the other hand with the flourishing of fine spatial resolution and high frequency satellite data moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 leading to a growing availability of distributed data on rainfall land cover soil properties and meteorological parameters physics based distributed hydrological models tend to be more and more used they allow to address the question of water resource and of distribution of water in soils smith et al 2012 moreover fully coupled hydro meteorological models such as the wrf wrf hydro framework weather research and forecasting senatore et al 2015 arnault et al 2018 provide insights on the coupling between vegetation soil and atmosphere within the hydrological cycle which is required to understand the consequences of climate change for example wrf hydro s structure relies on the noah mp land surface model niu et al 2011 for vertical routing of water i e computation of soil moisture and partition between surface runoff infiltration and water withdrawal by vegetation extreme events may be simulated in a consistent way and closely analyzed thanks to coupled and distributed models however at the scale of a small island these models need to work at a resolution close to 1 km which is presently hardly achievable due to computer power limitations a first step to circumvent such issue can be partial decoupling of models rummler et al 2019 the wrf wrf hydro noah mp framework allows such a decoupling indeed the hydrological component wrf hydro can be run offline with external rainfall data arnaud et al 2002 and references therein emphasized the need of reliable high resolution rainfall data to compute accurate peak flows and runoff volumes with a distributed model fares et al 2014 ran the hl rdhm in the hanalei watershed in hawaii using rainfall and soil data generated by an external software and concluded that best results were obtained with a 1 1 km2 resolution for rainfall and soil moisture degraded results were only achieved when a coarser resolution of 2 2 km2 or 4 4 km2 was adopted camera et al 2020 used wrf hydro in coupling with both observed precipitation and era interim precipitation reanalysis at a 1 1 km2 resolution in cyprus which is a mountainous island also affected by extreme precipitation events in mediterranean climate they found that fair nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse coefficients were obtained with observed precipitations but that some basins returned negative nse with modeled precipitation which emphasizes the need of reliable precipitation at a fine resolution the grande terre island of new caledonia is located in the sw pacific fig 1a at the edge of the south pacific convergence zone spcz in the cyclonic area of the south pacific and is subject to a mild tropical climate dutheil et al 2020a 2020b it is strongly influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso on interannual timescales dutheil et al 2019 it is characterized by a central mountain range and a strong asymmetry between its humid east coast directly affected by tropical depressions and the drier western one fig 1a terry and wotling 2011 dutheil et al 2020a 2020b it also presents strong contrasts in soil properties between ultramafic rocks allowing water storage in aquifers mainly located in the south and metamorphic volcano sedimentary rocks generally devoid of aquifers with strong impact on low flow regimes fig 2a frysou 2008 in the context of climate change dutheil et al 2020b found using fine scale atmospheric wrf simulations that the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events over new caledonia will likely be reduced by 20 on average by 2080 2100 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario regional contrasts could even reach up to 40 reduction in the south of the island in order to anticipate the effects of such drastic projected drying on water resources while accounting for new caledonia s large land cover variability in space and time a suitable distributed hydrological modeling framework needs to be implemented desclaux et al 2018 showed that lumped hydrological models such as gr4h were well suited for ultramafic watersheds in the south east of new caledonia and that adjustment of model on a 7 10 year period was required to account for the effects of wildfires and enso effects of fire can be introduced in a distributed model by changing soil and land surface properties while large scale climate variabilities can be introduced in regional atmospheric models as boundary conditions despite lumped hydrological models great scores at reproducing observed runoff one major drawback of such compartment models is their absence of physical comprehension of mechanisms at work in the observed river outflows the goal of this work is hence to derive physical parameters of studied watersheds and enhance hydrological knowledge of new caledonia basins using wrf hydro because of the number of model parameters as well as the significant interactions between some of them calibration of hydro meteorological distributed models represents a considerable challenge in this context automatic methods specifically designed for hydrological purposes like the dds algorithm dynamically dimensioned search tolson and shoemaker 2007 were shown to quickly converge towards optimal setting of model parameters for complex models arsenault et al 2014 including wrf hydro here we explore the sensitivity of the dds calibration process and the resulting performances of wrf hydro with regards to the rainfall forcing as well as to the ability of the modeling system to reflect consistent hydrological behaviors model performances were assessed with discharge data from six contrasted watersheds located on various geological basement rocks and mainly in the southern part of the grande terre island the outputs of the wrf hydro model were eventually used to illustrate and understand components of the hydrographs such as baseflow and quickflow giving indications on the functioning of the watersheds as mentioned by camera et al 2020 small watersheds haven t been much studied with wrf hydro and the model was seldom forced with observed rainfall our study thus also contributes to improving this field of expertize in the wrf hydro community the paper is organized as follows in sections 2 and 3 the studied area and the model are described including the forcing and calibration strategies section 4 presents the results which are discussed in section 5 conclusive statements are eventually delivered in section 6 2 study area approximately 400 km long and 50 km wide grande terre is the main island of new caledonia its topography is dominated by a central mountain range 800 m high on average fig 1a the two highest peaks are located on the steeper eastern side with mont panié 1628 m in the north and mont humboldt 1618 m in the south new caledonia hosts both temperate and tropical climate features its meteorological cycle is strongly impacted by the seasonal movement of the spcz with a warm rainy season in austral summer and a comparatively colder and drier season in winter ceccarelli et al 2013 payri et al 2019 with high average annual rainfall around 1850 mm water supply is globally abundant tropical cyclones also affect new caledonia with 1 cyclone year in the new caledonia exclusive economic zone large scale climate fluctuations influence new caledonia s climate with wetter than normal summer during la niña and drier than normal up to 20 30 during el niños el niño events strongly increase wildfire risk barbero et al 2011 lefèvre et al 2010 overall water is regarded as a vulnerable resource since around 70 of the total rainfall occurs within approximately 50 days moron 2016 mainly during the first quarter of the year new caledonia mainland s orography strongly sculpts the rainfall distribution fig 1b indeed higher precipitation rates are observed in the east due to the significant obstacle formed by the mountain chain to the trade wind flow terry and wotling 2011 dutheil et al 2020a 2020b as a result most watersheds of grande terre are characterized by a strong east west contrast they are steep and of limited extension a few hundred km2 at the maximum watersheds from the west coast end in an alluvial plain which is not the case for the east coast however this effect is alleviated by the distribution of gauging stations which are located upstream of the alluvial plain in the west coast rivers of grande terre present both flash floods resulting from extreme rainy events of the tropical climate and of the limited size of watersheds and severe low flows resulting from climate variability and from the lack of significant aquifers able to sustain river flow during dry periods new caledonia is surrounded by a shallow lagoon the second largest in the world and recognized as a unesco world heritage site due to its exceptional biodiversity one third of new caledonia s basement consists in ultramafic rocks formed by alteration of peridotite which are mostly concentrated in the southern part of grande terre fig 2a soils resulting from weathering of these parent rocks include high levels of iron and magnesium as well as several other metals such as nickel chromium and cobalt such ground composition combined to mining activities causes metal rich sediment transport downstream into rivers and eventually into the lagoon especially during flash floods directly impacting the reef barrier fig 7 from dupouy et al 2018 land cover on the upstream of the gauging stations consist of evergreen forests and shrub on peridotite basement or woody savanna on micaschists fig 2c both resulting from degradation of the initial forest due to wildfires new caledonia s great spatial variability in terms of land cover likely leads to complex hydro meteorological mechanisms and feedbacks between land and the troposphere although there is no specific study on that aspect in this study six watersheds of various size and composition were examined fig 2 the choices of the watersheds were dictated by the quality of long term homogeneous data names physical and hydrological features of these watersheds are shown in table 1 3 material and methods 3 1 the wrf hydro noah mp lsm modeling system the noah multiparameterization land surface model lsm is a spatially distributed 1 d model which solves the vertical routing of surface and subsurface water flow in response to an atmospheric forcing based on four soil layers down to a maximum 2 m depth with default spanning 0 0 1 m 0 1 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m and 0 6 1 m soil water content dynamics are based on richard s equation chen et al 1996 the surface energy flux components the gravitational drainage at the bottom soil layer and the partitioning of surface water sum of rainfall reduced by the evaporation into infiltration and surface runoff are also computed thanks to an ensemble of parameterization patterns fig 3 see niu et al 2011 for details since noah mp lsm neglects the horizontal exchanges of water it needs to be complemented with lateral flow algorithms in order to give accurate simulation of the hydrologic cycle wrf hydro is a fully distributed hydro meteorological model that can be used for flash flood prediction seasonal forecasting of water resources and land atmosphere coupling studies gochis and chen 2003 gochis et al 2013 it was originally conceived as a coupling framework to facilitate the combined use of the wrf model and pieces of terrestrial hydrological models it is now a stand alone hydrological modeling architecture that can complement noah mp by describing lateral routing of surface and subsurface water as well as groundwater storage it solves specifically for the saturated subsurface flow the 2 d overland water flow the aquifer recharge discharge and the 1 d channel flow fig 3 in wrf hydro surface flow occurs when the surface water level of a specific grid cell exceeds a maximum retention depth while subsurface flow is activated when maximum humidity capacity is exceeded in a given soil layer ponded water depths can be subject to future infiltration and evaporation vertical routing from noah mp the 2 d overland flow is routed across terrain elements according to the topography when reaching grid cells identified as channel surface water in excess of the local retention depth is passed to the channel model in this study the 2 d surface flow and the 1 d flow in the channels were computed with the diffusive wave equation which is an approximation for the saint venant equations that correspond to the shallow water models used in hydrology hingray et al 2015 subsurface flow is computed in soils as a function of hydraulic gradients resulting from the topography taking into account the saturated soil depth and hydraulic conductivity gochis et al 2013 with p the precipitation rate q the surface runoff rate and i the soil infiltration rate all three in mm s 1 the surface water budget equation at each time step t is q t p t i t in the wrf stand alone version this infiltration excess q is removed from the model in wrf hydro it is horizontally redistributed and may infiltrate

and the maximum soil moisture content smcmax via the liquid soil moisture deficit of the soil column d t parameters controlling the hydrograph shape are mainly the 2d overland flow roughness factor ovroughrtfac and manning s coefficient for channel roughness mann indeed surface roughness plays an important role in transmitting infiltration excess water to channel networks plausible parameter ranges are displayed in table 2a of section 3 4 we note here that as with many physics based modeling approaches there can be modest interactions between some of these parameters 3 2 meteorological forcing and data sources the wrf hydro model needs to be provided with atmospheric forcing here we used the wrf model skamarock et al 2008 widely used in the atmospheric science community wrf was adjusted to the south pacific and new caledonia area in previous studies jourdain et al 2011 lefèvre et al 2010 dutheil et al 2020a 2020b jullien et al 2014 it allows providing surface atmospheric state variables air temperature surface pressure specific humidity horizontal wind components at 10 m downward incoming shortwave and longwave radiation and rainfall rate to force wrf hydro and noah mp in offline mode the method exposed in lefèvre et al 2010 and dutheil et al 2020a 2020b was used for downscaling wrf results to a spatial resolution of 4 4 km2 hourly simulation outputs were used to perform the calibration and validation of wrf hydro while atmospheric states from wrf were proven appropriate on climatological timescales and weather regime statistics compared to observation over new caledonia dutheil et al 2020a 2020b lefèvre et al 2010 the day to day rainfall variability was not as satisfactory and prone to large errors compared to other surface quantities like temperature humidity or wind it is known that precise simulation of rainfall events with such mesoscale weather models is still challenging xu et al 2019 cuo et al 2011 kobold and suselj 2005 as accurate precipitation data in terms of volume and timing are crucial to hydrological modeling hourly observations from the 24 tipping bucket rain gauges indicated on fig 2a were preferred over the model rainfall outputs model calibration and validation of simulated discharge were performed using data from the reference stream gauge of each watershed fig 2a stream and rain gauge data were provided by direction des affaires vétérinaires alimentaires et rurales davar which administrates and handles the hydrological network in new caledonia additional rain gauges from météo france were also used to force the selected watersheds 3 3 model implementation and evaluation 3 3 1 rainfall spatial interpolation because of the sparse spatial distribution of the rainfall stations and strong influence of orography on precipitation patterns fig 1 two rainfall spatial interpolation methods were tested in this study the well known thiessen polygon method was used on all six watersheds it consists in attributing a specific area of influence to each rain gauge depending on the overall gauge network over the related catchment fig 4 in specific terms each grid point of the lsm inside a given polygon voronoï polygons receives the same amount of precipitation as the associated rain gauge a second method for rainfall partitioning was evaluated based on the inverse distance and elevation weighting algorithm idew masih et al 2011 for sensitivity tests it was implemented on three watersheds for it had already proven to perform well compared to other standard methods of rainfall spatial interpolation however previous works found that it performed only marginally better than the thiessen polygon method with lumped models in new caledonia desclaux et al 2018 hence the simpler thiessen method was kept for gauge interpolation in most of this study the mathematical form of the equation used in idew to calculate the interpolated rainfall p ˆ i j t at grid point i j and time t from hourly time series data of kth rain gauge p k t over all n gauges is 5 p ˆ i j t k 1 n p k t 1 d i j w d k i j α 1 z i j 1 w δ z k i j β with d k i j the distance in m between kth rain gauge and grid

5 3 3 2 validation metrics the normalized version of the root mean squared error i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient most commonly used for evaluation of hydrological models was used as a performance indicator along with its log transformed version the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 criterion was also used in particular for calibration purposes these efficiency criteria have different assets and drawbacks depending on their use such as calibration or performance analysis of simulations x s t faced with observations x o t t 1 n they are computed as follows 6 nse 1 t 1 n x o t x s t 2 t 1 n x o t x o 2 i e n s e 1 rmse 2 σ o 2 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 with r the linear correlation coefficient between x s and x o α σ s σ o β x s x o quantities x o x s σ o and σ s are the mean and standard deviation of the observed and simulated streamflow values respectively while the nse exhibits a strong sensitivity towards peak flows and provides little information on systematic model biases the log transformed nse provides more information on the quality of low water simulations kge was used in this study as an alternative criterion that can help reduce model calibration problems however it is important to have in mind that it was never intended by their authors as an improved measure of model performance see gupta et al 2009 3 4 wrf hydro setup and calibration procedure the approach adopted here involves forward coupling of the wrf hydro model by forcing it with a 2 year long atmospheric simulation computed with wrf except for rainfall wrf hydro was run using a 50 m digital elevation model dem generated from the bdalti nc database provided by the new caledonia government land cover generated from modis 500 m with classification of vegetation types based on local forestry expertize lafarge et al 2014 and soil type data at 2000 m resolution adapted from the atlas of new caledonia fritsch 2012 to fit usgs categories lafarge et al 2014 the hydrological routing grid was chosen at 100 m resolution while a cell spacing of 200 m for the noah mp lsm was implemented both were prepared under grass gis 7 6 0 the time step was set to 900 s for the land surface model vertical routing to maintain model stability and prevent numerical dispersion of overland flood waves a conservative time step of 10 s for channel and overland flow routing was chosen in this study this value met the courant condition criteria cfl for adaptive time integration schemes of the flow equations on a 100 m resolution grid however it needed to be decreased locally to 3 s for thio watershed for some flood events as instabilities were still recorded when observations exceeded 4500 m3 s 1 noah mp lsm and wrf hydro require a great deal of input parameters most of them directly dependent on either land use e g type and density of vegetation or soil type e g silt clay loam sand the calibration process allows determining the optimal tunable coefficients to apply to these spatial parameters proportionally to their default values based on suggestions by yucel et al 2015 verri et al 2017 rummler et al 2019 and camera et al 2020 seven parameters were calibrated i the surface infiltration coefficient or soil permeability ii the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity iii the pore size distribution index iv the percolation coefficient v the 2d overland flow roughness factor vi manning s factor for channel roughness and vii the maximum value for soil moisture storage typical range of these parameters is displayed in table 2a other wrf hydro tables specifying parameters regarding the channel geometry bucket model coefficients irrelevant here with the pass through option and lateral surface and subsurface water routing factors were left to their default values gochis et al 2013 the pore size distribution index bexp the maximum soil moisture content smcmax and the infiltration coefficient kdt correspond to an adjustment of soil dependent values through dksat for kdt already introduced in the noah mp land surface model the percolation slope and soil permeability refkdt parameters are spatially constant on each watershed both the overland flow roughness factor ovroughrtfac and the manning s factor for channel roughness mann are multiplicative factors that apply to reference values depending on land occupation for the former and on the stralher order of each river reach for the latter gochis et al 2013 these reference values are provided in table 2b the calibration procedure based on the dds global optimization algorithm for watershed modeling designed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used by running the ncar s national center for atmospheric research workflow written by karsten 2018 the dds algorithm has been shown to be suitable for a great number of parameters to optimize and to rapidly converge to best calibration solutions while easily avoiding poor local optima the scalar neighborhood size perturbation parameter r that defines at each iteration the amplitude of the random perturbation as a fraction of the range of the parameter to be modified was set at its default value of 0 2 kge was chosen as calibration criterion and the number of iterations was limited to 100 each watershed was independently calibrated on three characteristic week long storms similarly to what was performed in yucel et al 2015 the june 2012 march 2014 period was chosen for data cross availability purposes that range included both moderate el niño and la niña periods which allow to sample both dry and wet conditions in new caledonia in addition it covered the seasonal cycle as well as several extreme meteorological events such as tropical depressions e g edna in february 2014 each calibration procedure was initialized with restart files which is critical for soil moisture initial conditions from 9 months spin up runs made with default values for all parameters calibration was carried out on the three events labeled as black boxes on fig 5 using the thiessen polygon rainfall spatial interpolation method and the idew algorithm for three of the six watersheds event 1 was a very strong stormy event in an unusual dry period between 2013 06 30 and 2013 07 05 event 2 was a weaker and more usual rainy event between 2013 11 30 and 2013 12 05 that induced a more moderate hydrological response and event 3 corresponded to the edna tropical depression in the heart of the rainy season between 2014 02 02 and 2014 02 07 all in all the two year simulation period and the calibration events chosen in this study allowed accounting for a fair amount of variability in the new caledonia case for each watershed and method of rainfall interpolation the three distinct parameter sets obtained by calibration on each of the three events were then used to validate the model over the june 2012 march 2014 remaining period the best calibration set was chosen based on a multiobjective criterion consisting in the arithmetic mean of nse nse log10 and kge computed on the validation period the use of such criterion was justified by the variety of patterns over which each criterion exhibits specific sensitivity to in order to keep quality balanced simulations finally thio watershed could not be calibrated upon event 1 because of missing streamflow data in july 2013 probably due to system malfunction caused by the storm initial unsatisfactory calibration of thio over the second and third event led to a successful 24 day calibration on event 3 starting from 2014 01 15 instead of 2014 02 02 4 results 4 1 performance of wrf hydro and calibrated parameter values with thiessen rainfall forcing model performances table 3 concerning nse could be considered as good except perhaps for the pouembout watershed where they were only satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 criteria the multiobjective criterion being more sensitive to low flows allowed better discrimination of watersheds with unsatisfactory low flow simulations as was the case for couvelée and pouembout wrf hydro is very sensitive to the adjustment of six parameters table 3 with kdt resulting from calibration of refkdt and dksat final calibrated values of these parameters corresponded to those commonly found in the literature yucel et al 2015 verri et al 2017 camera et al 2020 including high manning values as it can be the case for woody rivers in small steep mountainous catchments yochum et al 2012 the maximum soil moisture content smcmax was found relatively stable with the one exception of the pouembout watershed and to a lesser extent couvelée with a very large water storage capacity affording larger soil moisture deficit d t see eqs 1 and 3 the pore size distribution index the percolation and the infiltration coefficients exhibited strong variations suggesting that some additional efforts in adjusting the spatial variability of hydraulic properties of soils roughness and vegetation should be made for example dumbéa est and coulée have similar environmental properties table 1 and share some common delineation fig 2 but a striking difference in the kdt factor was observed while usual values for kdt are in the range of 0 1 5 day 1 this optimal timescale factor for the partition between infiltration and runoff was found in the upper bound for coulée but in the lower bound for dumbéa est this peculiar point will be addressed in 5 1 both manning and overland roughness factors two important friction parameters acting on the flood temporal dynamics during storm events showed important differences among the six watersheds significant pearson correlations were found fig 6 between some of wrf hydro s model parameters the two validation criteria and the morphometric as well as the hydrological properties of the watersheds table 1 taken from alric 2009 despite the use of the statistical significance levels fisher and yates 1953 denoted by stars and colors in fig 6 these results should be taken with caution as the size of the studied sample six watersheds is small hence only correlations greater than 0 73 p value 0 1 0 81 p value 0 05 and 0 92 p value 0 01 are highlighted and discussed in fig 6 the pore size distribution index was found fairly correlated with the slope parameter the open shrubland land occupation and the recession time negative correlation the maximum soil moisture content was positively correlated with the woody savanna land occupation and negatively correlated with the runoff coefficient the slope coefficient was only correlated to the recession time negatively and the pore size the 2d overland roughness coefficient to woody savanna fair correlation while the manning river coefficient was strongly correlated with rainfall and the hydraulic length of the basin negative sign the infiltration coefficient was fairly correlated to soil types section 5 3 discusses these results the two validation criteria were not correlated with the same variables the nash criterion which is mainly sensitive to flood peaks was not strongly correlated to any other variable except maybe to the runoff coefficient by contrast the multiobjective criterion was correlated with several independent parameters it was strongly correlated 0 97 correlation coefficient with the runoff coefficient of the basin and with the maximum soil moisture content 0 92 it was also fairly correlated with the sandy clay loam soil occurrence the woody savanna land occupation and the pore size distribution index due to the correlations with the runoff coefficient and with soil parameters such as clay type that favors runoff one can conclude that the wrf hydro model works better when only surface water is involved in flood generation 4 2 wrf hydro water budget components and consistency in hydrological behaviors the detailed study of major storms 1 and 3 fig 5 throughout the different water components of wrf hydro s simulations showed many interesting features event 1 took place during the cold season when little rainfall is usually observed and did not occur after any other significant flood event 3 occurred in the heart of the hot rainy season and marked the end of a one month long continuous rainy period the water budget components computed by wrf hydro during events 1 and 3 are given in fig 7 as the model is conservative for the total amount of water accumulated rainfall during these events summing up to between 10 and 20 of the yearly amount could thus be decomposed into surface runoff change in soil moisture storage and groundwater outflow as expected during an extreme rainfall window of only a few days transpiration and evaporation were negligible however simulations did account for the fact that evapotranspiration was higher during event 3 which occurred in the austral summer period using wrf hydro outputs runoff coefficients could be computed from the sum of surface runoff and groundwater outflow as seen in fig 8 the resulting simulated runoff coefficients were in agreement with the mean runoff coefficients alric 2009 of their watersheds for the two events indeed there was high positive correlation between reference values of runoff coefficients x axis and event computed runoff coefficients y axis 0 90 for event 1 and 0 86 for event 3 p value 0 05 the pouembout river presented a low simulated runoff for event 1 25 close to its mean referenced value 27 interestingly it received a relatively small amount of rainfall 86 mm that soils were mostly able to absorb while the other watersheds received more than 350 mm conversely pouembout s runoff coefficient during event 3 was 57 which is much larger than the mean 27 referenced for this watershed that probably corresponded to a rainfall intensity exceeding the infiltration soil capacity compared to other basins and especially to its neighbor dumbéa est coulée presented a very large groundwater outflow as part of its high runoff coefficient additional discussion is provided in section 5 1 while focusing on baseflow behavior couvelée was found to be able to store large amounts of water in its soil layers during both extreme rainfall events especially during event 1 with 204 mm along with little groundwater outflow leading to slow return of rainwater to the stream channel such behavior was in agreement with its low referenced runoff coefficient 41 table 1 and rather high recession period 97 days table 1 this was supported by a high calibrated smcmax value 0 54 m3 m3 providing conditions for large moisture deficits eq 3 a large infiltration capacity during storms kdt value of 3 8 day 1 see table 3 and eq 1 and a low drainage strength through low values for slope and bexp table 3 promoting a slowdown of the groundwater outflow in interstorm periods tontouta and thio are the two largest drainage basins with area above 340 km2 they share similar runoff coefficients 55 but tontouta has a recession time twice that of thio 120 days the longest of our sample see table 1 fig 7 reveals that the simulated surface runoff on thio basin was high 55 in storm periods compared to tontouta 45 but the underground runoff was higher 20 for the latter compared to the former 10 just like couvelée this hydrological response from tontouta could be associated with large kdt value 2 8 day 1 small pore size distribution index 1 5 and low slope parameter 0 31 table 3 that participated in the slowdown of the subsurface and groundwater drainage and long recession time other differences in soil properties and spatial distribution of land cover could not be ruled out and are discussed in 5 1 4 3 hydrological response to the spatial distribution of rainfall the changes in model performance and values of calibrated parameters between the idew and the thiessen polygon rainfall interpolation methods are displayed in table 4 here the sensitivity to spatial distribution of rainfall was addressed using dumbéa est 60 km2 and coulée 40 km2 two watersheds sharing some common delineation and lithology ultramafic but displaying large variation in calibrated parameters table 3 and pouembout 180 km2 the unique river basin in this study with a metamorphic lithology the resulting changes in water budget components for events 1 and 3 are displayed in fig 9 contrary to thiessen idew considers the difference in altitude and distance to rain gauges to interpolate precipitation data this led to modifications in the spatial distribution of total rainfall at the basin scale in time with more rainfall on high areas see fig 4 where soils and vegetation are usually denser and in the presence of drier downhill areas that were thus less saturated at the beginning of major events in turn it resulted in modifications in the water budgets with simulated changes in soil moisture storage varying by up to 60 during flash floods compared to thiessen from 97 mm to 97 63 mm for event 1 on dumbéa even if total rainfall was rather unchanged 5 at maximum fig 9 performances were rather similar for all watersheds using both methods however a higher nse but lower multiobjective criterion was achieved on pouembout with idew the change in spatial distribution of rainfall due to idew drove a robust change in calibration in particular through kdt table 4 the timescale parameter controlling the partition of rainfall into surface runoff and infiltration eq 1 using idew rainfall interpolation kdt was systematically doubled indicating that more water was injected into the lower zone reducing the overall surface flow since values of bexp and slope two parameters controlling the strength of the drainage from the soil column were reduced by half in idew compared to thiessen a possible compensation effect could be at stake the larger the infiltration to the lower zones due to larger values of kdt the lower bexp and slope furthermore one may observe a similar compensation effect through lower surface and channel friction parameters with idew indeed the model responded accordingly to balance lower surface flow to the drainage network so as to respect the shape of flood hydrographs it is worth noting that smcmax the parameter describing how much water soils can store was the only parameter to show very little sensitivity to changes in rainfall interpolation since the two spatial distributions for rainfall resulted in two distinct sets of wrf hydro optimal parameters sensitivity of the water budgets to these interpolation changes was also closely analyzed from fig 9 increase of water storage in soils using idew was well captured in the watershed pair dumbéa est and coulée both responding by a large reduction in surface runoff however the pouembout basin presented an opposite behavior with slightly increased surface runoff with idew such contrasted reactions in the water budgets may stem from large differences in physiography lithology and or land cover between basins table 1 as upland areas correspond in dumbéa est and coulée terrestrial data to forest or close shrubland that both favor infiltration and to a clay soil that favors runoff these results suggested that the former effect could prevail for these watersheds in the pouembout watershed the presence of woody savanna uphill that is suspected to play an important role in the production and transfer of rainwater flow to downslope areas tramier et al 2021 could explain part of the opposite effect differences in spatial distribution of rainfall slightly altered the calibration quality as well table 4 for example small basins like coulée and dumbéa exhibited somewhat lower nash criterion when using idew compared with thiessen a small decrease 0 07 points on the nash scale while idew promoted a better flood prediction in the pouembout case nash value of 0 74 against 0 58 with thiessen pouembout observed and simulated flood hydrographs during the edna tropical depression are shown in fig 10 clearly the hydrological response with idew for that basin seemed to enhance the simulated timing and shape of the flood compared with observations during that event the slightly increased surface runoff partly induced by the idew parameter set especially the very low friction parameter 0 01 for ovroughrtfac table 4 is likely to have acted for quicker and clearly more fitting timely response for the second peak flow by contrast the same close inspection of the flood hydrographs for dumbéa est fig 11 and coulée not shown here indicated that a slower response with less surface runoff light green bars in the case of idew did not seem adequate for these watersheds especially in terms of flood recession behavior that is further discussed in section 5 2 5 discussion 5 1 lessons from wrf hydro s hydrograph separation using a physics based model allows computing the different components of a flood here a separation between quickflow and baseflow is proposed through one application focused on differences between dumbéa est and coulée as pointed out both river basins share some common delineation fig 2 and are thus close in terms of environmental properties and highly related however wrf hydro s calibration led to large differences in their simulated hydraulic properties and behaviors with opposite values for the kdt timescale factor for infiltration runoff table 3 and table 4 and contrasted details in the water partition see water budgets from fig 7 fig 12 details and compares their respective flood hydrograph during event 1 both watersheds reacted comparably in terms of streamflow to the extreme rainfall event with dumbéa est receiving somewhat higher cumulated precipitations as represented by the solid light blue line wrf hydro however suggested different baseflow behaviors for the two watersheds within our framework baseflow corresponds to the decrease of soil water content in post storm days the baseflow curve and the envelope curve for the changes in water storage depicted through orange bars fluctuate accordingly fig 12 for comparison the automatic separation method from pelletier and andréassian 2020 was applied with a quadratic reservoir using their baseflow r package and adapted to hourly streamflow observations using their method the resulting baseflow responses dashed light blue line fig 12 appeared much more similar for both watersheds in terms of amplitude and timing than suggested by wrf hydro which calls for further investigation land occupations of these two watersheds are completely different the upper dumbea includes forest dense shrubland and open shrubland it is devoid of mines the coulée watershed includes several abandoned mines and was subjected to repeated wildfires which both induced severe erosion and gullies reaching the host rock fig 13 hence even though it actually includes numerous bare fractured rocks leading to large infiltration of rainwater the pedology map on which wrf hydro s soil types are based inappropriately indicates clay soils for coulée resulting in low infiltration and percolation capacities the model thus compensated by adjusting the infiltration parameter kdt to 5 0 day 1 for coulée which is the largest for our six watersheds and up to 8 9 day 1 when tested with idew rainfall distribution in turn in accordance with its low recession time 43 days the lowest of all six and rather high runoff coefficient 61 percolation from highly infiltrating soil layers to the underground buckets was also boosted almost to its maximum value slope parameter to 0 98 eventually wrf hydro was then able to account for the large component of baseflow in coulée watershed fig 12b such a behavior was not suggested for dumbéa est by wrf hydro fig 12a the comparison with pelletier and andréassian s automatic method which does not show the same baseflow differences between the two watersheds emphasizes some of the strengths of distributed models allowing to better comprehend underground mechanisms in that case to further pursue on the advantages stemming from the use of such physics based model fig 14 shows a similar approach on thio and tontouta the two largest watersheds of our sample their hydrographs together with a representation of the time variation of spatial distribution of soil water content allows exploring hydrological spatial behaviors as mentioned before tontouta has a recession time almost twice as important as thio according to alric 2009 which resulted in a higher infiltration rate 4 5 times larger than thio and lower pore size distribution index and percolation coefficient indeed in tontouta the high infiltration coefficient induced a fast absorption of rainwater which long remained stored in elevated areas largely covered with dense forests over clay soils resulting in slow discharge into the streamflow concurrently water stored within sandy clay loam soils in valleys was rapidly discharged into the stream network bolstering an early baseflow response between t0 3 and t0 5 days fig 14a and fig 7 for groundwater outflow in contrast thio infiltrated less quickly and most of rainwater was thus converted to surface runoff green bars fig 14b its baseflow was consequently slower and much smaller than in tontouta see soil moisture maps between t0 3 and t0 5 days fig 14b comparison with baseflow from pelletier and andréassian s automatic separation method fig 12 and fig 14 revealed that wrf hydro relies much less on underground discharge for flood simulation except for coulée the approach discussed above could however contribute to providing consistent methods for flood decomposition which still constitutes an open topic see for example pelletier and andréassian 2020 for instance a distributed physical model such as wrf hydro could help to understand the fate of tracers of harmful minerals in the environment arnault et al 2021 5 2 sensitivity of wrf hydro to observed rainfall spatial interpolation method data scarcity for precise rainfall amount and its spatial distribution is generally considered a major source of uncertainties in hydrological modeling smith et al 2004a 2004b moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 the two methods of rainfall interpolation resulted in small differences in the nse on three watersheds a result already found by desclaux et al 2018 replication of flash floods especially recessions turned out to be slightly poorer with idew on the small and highly rainfed coulée and dumbéa watersheds with high runoff coefficient 60 still since idew produced more rainfall on elevated areas water budgets were changed with generally more water stored in soils during flash floods it results that the rainfall interpolation method is likely to control water available for the river when simulating low flow in dry season periods accurate rainfall products should thus be used to model the water resource and its evolution under climate change the larger flatter and less elevated pouembout watershed with lower rainfall 1500 mm year and runoff coefficient 27 displayed a contrasted more adequate reaction towards peak flow observations with idew forcing hence high resolution rainfall distribution is also crucial for correct flash flood simulation depending on watershed size and configuration generally speaking for a fixed small number of rain stations higher sensitivity to spatial distribution and quality of rainfall data is expected with increasing size of watersheds hohmann et al 2021 the validity of the different rainfall interpolation methods could further be explored if refined rainfall data were available thanks to a temporary denser rain gauge network finally the use of dds calibration with the two interpolation methods also indicated interesting features of wrf hydro when applying idew rainfall forcing compared to the thiessen polygon method rainfall increase on high areas which are far from the gauging station was relevantly balanced by a decrease in the adjusted manning and overland flow roughness factors it indeed allowed surface and channel flow to be accelerated so as to ensure similar and appropriate timing in the triggering of the flood overall large compensation effects were broadly observed between several optimal parameters like kdt compared to bexp and slope calibrated parameter sets are thus the result of model adaptation to multiple sources of errors such as i rainfall and streamflow measurements ii weaknesses in the calibration process iii quality of terrestrial data and iv flaws in the wrf hydro model structure 5 3 significance of optimal physical parameters benefits limitations and perspectives of the model in the general context of hydrological modeling following calibration on each of the three short rainfall events and optimal selection of the best 2 year resulting run wrf hydro s final adjusted parameters were found in adequacy with known hydrologic and morphometric properties of watersheds indeed basins with long recession periods were logically attributed low percolation rates slope and small pore size distribution bexp in order to simulate slow vertical routing within deep soil layers and thus long lasting baseflows high proportion of woody savanna land cover was logically associated with high overland roughness it was also related to large soil moisture storage which could indicate that maximum water content of soils covered by savanna needed to be adjusted upwards manning coefficient was maximum for small mountainous basins characterized by steep rivers with rough beds coulée dumbéa couvelée while larger watersheds presenting more smooth bed had a lower manning pouembout thio tontouta this parameter was highly correlated with rainfall since high altitude catchments not only receive more rainfall but also correspond to steep slopes and to rough riverbeds neither the 2d roughness multiplicative factor nor the 2d roughness average over the whole watershed not shown presented strong correlation with land occupation a possible explanation could be that surface runoff scarcely occurs and that flow is rather collected in series of gullies further evidence of this concentrated flow regime resulted from the fact that all calibrated multiplicative factors were lower than one implying faster transfer of water than in the default framework high infiltration coefficients were found for some watersheds with a high clay soil type proportion indicating a necessary adjustment of the model default behavior as seen in section 5 1 for coulée watersheds presenting a high level of runoff were better described by the model than those presenting both surface runoff and large infiltration this probably indicates that surface flow is more adequately described by the diffusive wave equation and that the coupling between the surface and subsurface vertical and horizontal routes involves more complex modeling the latter model parameterizations suffer from uncertainties in soil parameters and simplification of the supply from soil to the river performance analysis on longer time periods should be undertaken to investigate low flow regimes more closely this would require exploring the sensitivity of the model to the different underground options only the pass through option was tested here to the spatial variability of soil thickness and to the agreement of simulated evapotranspiration series for example to reliable in situ or satellite data lumped reservoir models such as the gr suite modèles du génie rural perrin et al 2009 e g gr4h are able to produce better results on longer time periods in terms of flood simulation nse of 0 72 for coulée 0 89 for dumbéa est and 0 93 for couvelée in desclaux et al 2018 and especially low flow regimes kge of the same magnitude they also require much less human and computational work however they need a significant number of years of observations to be properly calibrated the use of dds calibration was found efficient for producing good calibrated solutions with few rainfall and streamflow observations week long events while sparing computational work owing to this algorithm wrf hydro can be achieved at the scale of small watersheds few hundred km2 with reasonable spatial resolution 100 m routing grid and at an hourly time step onto standard computing systems in addition such a physics based distributed modeling system allows substantially deeper understanding of hydrological processes in the different catchments as well as the ability to easily account for modifications in soil properties and land use which cannot be achieved in simple reservoir models this study started to shed some light on the potential to transfer physical parameters from calibrated watersheds to other ungauged basins in grande terre on the one hand some watersheds with analogous properties shared comparable calibrated values in model parameters for instance couvelée and tontouta both featured high recession times and moderate runoff coefficients table 1 in connection with these characteristics both were modeled with high infiltration rate kdt combined to low bexp and slope table 3 so as to reproduce large water storage capacity during storms and lasting baseflows during post storm periods they also both had low ovroughrtfac so as to accelerate surface runoff and balance their large infiltration capacities therefore depending on recession times and runoff coefficients combinations of low high kdt opposed to high low bexp and slope could be suggested for ungauged basins on the other hand it was shown that two closely related watersheds like coulée and dumbéa although sharing some resembling hydrological and environmental features table 1 could not be modeled with similar parameters pointing to difficulties in achieving robust regionalization with wrf hydro finally a full spatial distribution of the core parameters selected kdt bexp slope ovroughrtfac mann and smcmax could allow for a better transition at watershed boundaries and improve regionalization perspectives although suitable simulation was performed and insightful developments were allowed limitations of this work remain present first of all even though the chosen period of calibration validation encompasses many of the climate features of the region results necessarily bear dependencies to the data even more so as the simulation and validation periods are rather short 3 weeks and 2 years parameter values may presumptively be contingent to the selection and length of calibration events moreover the validation period only partly accounts for the decennial climatic variability of new caledonia in addition to using short flash flood calibration periods the multi objective function used here gives more weight to high flows and thus influences the ultimate setup of the model low flows appear to be reproduced in a much less satisfactory way than high flows in our framework especially on couvelée and pouembout two exogenous additive factors that are not controlled by the calibration process could explain an upward bias in simulated low flows especially when working at an hourly time step i evapotranspiration is likely underestimated in wet tropical environments by wrf hydro lin et al 2018 and ii rain gauge spatial interpolation may introduce too much water in the system including in low rainfall periods schleiss et al 2020 all in all even though wrf hydro was found to be suitable to simulate flash flood patterns in various basins of new caledonia this study s interpretations remain conditional to the testing conditions and thus have to be taken with caution 6 summary and conclusion in this study the wrf hydro modeling framework was found able to fairly simulate runoff observations and faithfully reproduce flash flood behavior on six watersheds of the tropical island of new caledonia sw pacific this work focused on a two year period and made use of a wrf meteorological forcing complemented with spatially interpolated rain gauge data it achieved good results in terms of nse after automatic calibration on three short less than one week and contrasted events thanks to a workflow based on the dds algorithm with alternating moderate el niño and la niña periods affected by flash floods during both dry and wet seasons we believe the calibration validation time interval chosen in this study was relevant in terms of climatological representativeness of new caledonia following the analysis of adjusted parameters and simulated water budget components on two flash flood events the model successfully reproduced hydrological behavior of all watersheds it provided fairly matching physical constants with known hydrologic and morphometric properties confirmed by correlation statistics yet as these were obtained only on a six watershed sample extension of the analysis to other watersheds in new caledonia should be prioritized in future studies longer calibration and simulation periods should also be selected to confirm the conclusions in some instances such as the coulée watershed wrf hydro s adjusted parameters provided perspectives for a better understanding of the watershed properties that were inadequately described in the available soil database overall wrf hydro enabled to model some of the diversity of soils and land occupation of grande terre of new caledonia this study thus confirms that wrf hydro is relevant for flash flood analysis on small watersheds even with limited rainfall observations wrf hydro also provided information on distributed properties such as the water budgets and soil humidity we showed that thanks to a better constraint on the watershed water storage properties the model allowed discussing most components of the flood signal including its recession part thanks to its decomposition of runoff components wrf hydro constitutes a fine tool to help better compare subsurface and underground water components between allegedly similar catchments it is important to point out that realistic rainfall spatial distribution is needed in order to provide distributed water resources this was emphasized here by the difference in water budget components between the thiessen polygon and idew rainfall interpolation methods with the continuous improvements of meteorological models such as wrf allowing small scale representation of atmospheric variables there are hopes that flood events and their dynamics can be better understood along the same lines the framework that we have developed may be used to understand how climate variability and climate change can impact water resources in new caledonia especially in the context of a drastic projected drying of new caledonia by the end of the century we finally suggest that the findings of the present study could also be conclusive on other mountainous islands presenting watersheds similar in size and in altitude to those of
