6660,karstic aquifers are very sensitive and fragile to environmental changes with more tunnels excavated in karst areas groundwater levels are increasingly lowered and resulted in changed natural hydrogeological flow system and groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology of surface water systems water especially groundwater is a limited and key factor and significant driving force for karst ecosystem processes however the effects of tunnels excavation on the ecosystems in karst areas remain largely unknown this study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water contents and shifts of plants water uptake patterns between rainy and dry seasons in a karst trough valley affected by tunnels excavation and comparing their differences with those in a tunnel free karst trough valley in southwest china monthly soil water contents at two soil layers of the upper 20 cm and lower 20 40 cm were measured and soil water at two soil layers subcutaneous water and plant arbor and shrub xylem water were sampled in february mid dry season and september late rainy season 2017 respectively and the δ2h and δ18o of those waters were analyzed the isosource model based on dual stable isotopes of δ2h and δ18o was used to estimate the contributions of different sources to the plant xylem water although the soil water contents at both valleys showed similar vertical and temporal variations resulted primarily from the evaporation and precipitation the soil water contents of two soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than that of the tunnel free valley at both seasons plants uptake water pattern changed from a dominant soil water source during the rainy season to a dominant subcutaneous water source during the dry season at both valleys however plants extracted more water from the subcutaneous zone in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that of the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons of which the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 33 in rainy season and 76 in dry season respectively in the tunneling affected karst trough valley while the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 24 in rainy season and 59 in dry season respectively in the tunnel free karst trough valley the above results indicated that tunnels excavation decreased the soil water contents and then changed plants water uptake patterns in karst areas keywords water uptake patterns dual stable isotopes tunnels excavation soil water subcutaneous water karst trough valley 1 introduction nowadays more and more tunnels are excavated due to more efficient transport critically dependent on highway and railway tunnel in the world up to the early 2010s nearly ten thousand kilometers of railway tunnels alone have been built under a variety of complex geological conditions in china zhao et al 2013 generally tunnels are excavated below groundwater table especially in karst areas and groundwater inflow into and then drainage out of the tunnels which result in a lowered groundwater table any groundwater drawdown could alter the natural hydrogeological flow system and consequently impact groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology of surface water systems springs wells streams lakes wetlands and the associated aquatic ecosystems the more heterogeneous the physical environment is the greater such risks karstic aquifers with double layer hydrogeological structures are among the most problematical due to its sensitive and fragile to environmental changes ford and williams 2007 therefore most studies have mainly focused on the effects of tunnel excavation on karst hydrogeology gisbert et al 2009 vincenzi et al 2009 raposo et al 2010 chiocchini and castaldi 2011 zarei et al 2012 alija et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 strozzi et al 2014 liu et al 2015 pujades et al 2015 water is a limited and key factor influencing plant growth in karst areas due to a very limited amount of water storage in the thin and rocky soils underlain by rock fractures such situation of water deficit for plant growth resulting from groundwater drawdown and the drying up of surface water caused by tunnel excavation could be more serious in karst areas although the effects of karst groundwater leakage and drawdown caused by tunnel excavation on vegetation are mentioned in previous studies e g vincenzi et al 2009 no study appears to have been conducted on the effects of tunnel excavation caused lowered groundwater on the karst ecosystems such as the change of water sources for plant uptake or growth stable isotopes of δ2h and δ18o in waters could provide an effective powerful and nondestructive approach for identifying and partitioning the different potential water sources used by plants white et al 1985 dawson and ehleringer 1991 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 rong et al 2011 ma and song 2016 geris et al 2017 rothfuss and javaux 2017 wang et al 2017 because of no isotopic fractionation during terrestrial plant uptake of water wershaw et al 1966 white et al 1985 dawson and ehleringer 1991 dawson et al 2002 although all the water sources ultimately come from precipitation values of δ2h and δ18o for various water sources are significantly different because of evapotranspiration thus the hydrogen isotope content of xylem sap that does not expose it to evaporative enrichment reflects the water sources consumed by plants and provides critical insights into adaptive responses of plants to the changing environments dawson et al 2002 in this study we investigated soil moisture change of two soil layers of the upper 20 and lower 20 40 cm at two karst trough valleys with similar hydrogeological conditions but different impaction by tunnels excavation affected unaffected valley in chongqing of southwest china and analyzed δ2h and δ18o values of the two dominant plant species fraxinus chinensis roxb arbor and viburnum chinshanense graebn shrub and three potential water sources available for plant uptake rainwater captured by two soil layers of the upper 20 cm and lower 20 40 cm and the shallow groundwater underlying subcutaneous water in rainy and dry seasons at two karst trough valleys we hypothesized that tunnels excavation lowered karst groundwater and then could dry soil moisture and change the water sources for plant uptake during different seasons in karst areas thus the new aspects addressed here are to quantify the proportional contribution of various water sources soil water and subcutaneous water to water sources of plant uptake in different seasons using the δ2h and δ18o of various waters impacted by tunnels excavation in karst trough valley areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the longfeng and longche karst trough valleys 106 23 15 106 28 05 e 29 40 30 29 48 10 n with an area of 11 7 km2 and 26 8 km2 respectively belong to the northern part of the zhongliang mountain located in the northwest of chongqing southwest china fig 1 the regional climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation of 1200 mm over 80 of precipitation occurring during the rainy season from april to october and the mean annual air temperature of 18 c the longfeng and longche karst trough valleys are located in the guanyinxia anticline extending towards north south and consist of three ridges and two valleys fig 1 the bedrock in the anticline core is the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1 f with an area of 9 2 km2 which the first and third sections of the t1 f consist of gray limestone with a thickness of 120 170 m and the second and fourth sections of the t1 f consist of purplish sandstone with a thickness of 310 380 m on either side of the anticline core there are middle and lower triassic light grey to dark grey dolomite and limestone t2 l and t1 j with an area of 26 8 km2 and a thickness of 500 700 m which comprises the main karst aquifer and upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj feldspar quartz sandstone shale and mudstone with an area of 2 5 km2 and a thickness of 170 1100 m because the limestone and dolomite compared to the sandstone and shale can be easily corroded and eroded karst trough valleys are developed in the t1 j and t2 l while the ridges are formed in the erosion resistant t1 f and t3 xj in the karst trough valleys the triassic carbonate rock developed many vertical open fissures providing basic conditions for forming karst depressions fissures and sinkholes rainwater and surface water quickly drain through sinkholes fissures or shaft into the karst aquifer and an underground river is developed in each karst trough valley the feng and long underground rivers are developed in the east and west of the longfeng karst trough valley fig 1 respectively which the elevation of the outlet for the feng and long underground river is 302 m and 270 m respectively the length of the feng and long underground river is about 4 5 km and 5 2 km respectively before 2000 the multi annual mean discharge of the feng and long underground river was approximately 35 l s and 25 l s respectively however from 2000 to 2017 the discharge of the feng and long underground river has gradually decreased to about 25 l s and 15 l s respectively the qingfeng and longche underground rivers are developed in the east and west of the longche karst trough valley fig 1 respectively where the elevation of the outlet for the qingfeng and longche underground river is 560 m and 570 m respectively the length of the qingfeng and longche underground river is about 11 6 km and 11 8 km respectively the multi annual mean discharge of the qingfeng and longche underground river is approximately 55 l s and 45 l s respectively before 2000 there once were 15 epikarst springs which were sources of drinking and irrigation water but only one epikarst spring with very low discharge can be found in the longfeng karst trough valley in 2017 there are more than thirty wells and epikarst springs in the longche karst trough valley overlying soils are mainly the zonal yellow soil of which the thickness is heterogeneous varying from 10 cm to 100 cm in the ridges of non karst areas the soil thickness is more than 50 cm while the soil thickness is less than 50 cm in the karst area the main land uses are forest land 21 6 km2 agricultural land 13 3 km2 and residential land 2 3 km2 fig 1 the evergreen wide leaf forests fraxinus chinensis roxb pagoda etc and shrubs viburnum chinshanense graebn etc are dominant vegetation most plants and shrubs are over 20 years due to the grain for green project which started in the middle of 1990s however the heights of arbors are usually low and most species fail to reach their biological heights due to limited available water stored in the karst thin soil 2 2 tunnels excavation in the longfeng karst trough valley the north south lying zhongliang mountain located in northwest of the chongqing metropolitan area is a big barrier to transportation the construction of both railway and highway tunnels through the zhongliang mountain is necessary to improve the transportation three about 4 km long tunnels without any ventilation shafts were built within an 8 km distance of the longfeng karst trough valley during the past 20 years table 1 which were excavated below the water level of the underground rivers the discharge of groundwater in three tunnels was high but the inflow volume varied considerably table 1 therefore the groundwater level gradually lowered and surface water gradually dried up resulting in the change of the paddy field to the dry land since the first tunnel excavation in the longfeng karst trough valley hereafter referred to as tunneling affected valley abbreviated as tav such situation was exacerbated after the second and third tunnel was constructed in the longfeng karst trough valley now 14 of 15 epikarst springs and most wells disappeared drinking water for human and livestock totally depends on the surface water pumped from the excavated tunnels and jialing river and most irrigation water is from rainwater and part is from the surface water pumped from the excavated tunnels and jialing river in the longfeng karst trough valley meanwhile the vegetation coverage becomes relatively poor and the rocky desertification worsens due to groundwater drawdown and the drying up of surface water caused by tunnel excavation in the longfeng karst trough valley as a control tunnel excavation is absent in the longche karst trough valley hereafter referred to as tunneling unaffected valley abbreviated as tuav and it is a natural karst hydrogeological system thus this provides a unique opportunity to study the impacts of tunnels excavation on the hydrogeology hydrology and eco environment in karst areas 2 3 sampling the air temperature and precipitation recorded at 15 min intervals with a resolution of 0 01 c and 0 1 mm respectively by the hobo field weather stations located in the longfeng karst trough valley fig 1 were collected from january to december 2017 soil samples at the depth of 0 20 and 20 40 cm for analysis of soil water contents were collected monthly in 2017 samples of plant xylem water soil water at the depth of 0 20 and 20 40 cm and spring water subcutaneous water for isotopic analysis δ2h and δ18o were collected in the dry season of february 2017 and in the rainy season of september 2017 sampling of soils and plant species was conducted from 5 cross sections of the karst trough valleys of which 3 cross sections were located at the top of three tunnels of the longfeng karst trough valley and 2 cross sections were located in the longche karst trough valley fig 1 there are 3 sampling points at each cross section of which 2 sampling points were located on both sides of the hillside and 1 was located in the bottom of valley at each sampling point soils and plant species were sampled if both arbors and shrubs could be found respectively fraxinus chinensis roxb and viburnum chinshanense graebn are typical aboriginal species of arbors and shrubs and were sampled at each sampling point for each plant species three to five individuals with similar diameter of breast height were selected all the plant samples were cut into 3 4 cm segments immediately placed into glass vials with screw caps sealed with polyethylene parafilm and kept frozen in a freezer 20 c for isotopic analysis the total samples during every measurement period were 7 and 3 for the species of arbor and shrub at the tunneling affected valley and 5 and 3 for the species of arbor and shrub at the tunnel free valley respectively at each sampling point two soil samples were collected using the hand probes at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm below ground a total of 360 soil samples collected monthly were used to obtain gravimetric soil moisture content smc as determined by drying at 105 c for 24 h the total soil samples for isotopic analysis during every measurement period were 10 and 8 in the tunneling affected and the tunnel free valley at rainy and dry season respectively meanwhile a total of 6 subcutaneous waters 1 epikarst spring and 2 outlets of underground river at the tunneling affected valley and 2 epikarst springs and 1 outlets of underground river at the tunnel free valley were collected at rainy and dry season to analyze isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o mineral oil was applied to each bottle to prevent evaporation 2 4 isotopic analyses water in plant and soil samples was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china the extraction efficiency was over 99 which was sufficient to obtain unfractionated water samples the extracted water sample is loaded into a 2 ml brown bottle and sealed with a sealing membrane and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until subsequent isotopic analysis the δ2h and δ18o values of subcutaneous water and water in plant tissues and soils were measured with an isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view usa at chongqing key laboratory of karst environment southwest university the isotopic ratios of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were expressed as a permil deviation from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical precision of the liquid water measured by iris was 1 2 for δ2h and 0 3 for δ18o 2 5 data analysis the isotopic compositions of all potential water sources and xylem water were entered into the isosource model phillips and gregg 2003 to calculate the contribution of each source to stem water isosource is a microsoft visual basic software package whichcalculates ranges of source proportional contributions to a mixture based on stable isotope analyses when the number of sources is too large to permit a unique solution and can provide the distribution of source proportions which are consistent with isotopic mass balance phillips and gregg 2003 the raw xylem isotope values of δ2h and δ18o in two plant species were used as mixture data inputs into isosource model and isotope values of δ2h and δ18o from various soils horizons 0 20 and 20 40 cm and subcutaneous water were used as source data and input into isosource model to guarantee that no legitimate feasible source combinations was missed the fractional increment employed in our calculations was 0 01 and uncertainty or mass balance tolerance was not smaller than half this amount 0 5 increment maximum difference between sources phillips and gregg 2003 uncertainty level was set at 0 01 in our calculations statistical analysis was conducted using the spss 20 0 program spss inc chicago il usa paired sample t test was used to detect significant differences in the soil moisture contents and isotopic compositions of soil and xylem water between the tunneling affected and tunnel free karst trough valleys during dry and rainy seasons 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of precipitation and soil moisture contents the total precipitation was 1314 mm in 2017 and 86 5 occurred during the vegetation growing season from april to october accompanying with a severe summer drought in august the highest monthly precipitation was 249 mm in september accounting for 19 of the year s total precipitation while the lowest monthly precipitation was only 10 mm in december fig 2 as shown in fig 2 marked vertical and seasonal variations in soil moisture contents were found at both valleys the soil moisture contents increased with the increase of soil depths at both seasons which the average of soil moisture contents in upper and lower soil layers was 24 and 27 respectively meanwhile the soil moisture contents of different soil depths at two valleys exhibited significant temporal changes with the precipitation variations the highest soil moisture contents occurred in june about 32 while lowest soil moisture contents about 20 occurred in august with highest temperature and summer drought meanwhile soil moisture contents showed significant difference in upper soil layers p 0 001 and lower soil layers p 0 001 between two karst valleys fig 2 although the soil moisture contents of two valleys showed similar vertical and temporal variations at both seasons the soil moisture contents for the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm varied from 17 to 28 with a mean of 22 3 and 19 to 32 with a mean of 25 3 in the tunneling affected valley and 20 to 32 with a mean of 25 9 and 24 to 38 with a mean of 29 4 in the tunnel free valley respectively such obvious difference in soil moisture contents between two valleys showing lower soil moisture contents of both soil layers in the tunneling affected valley indicated that tunnels excavation could dry soil moisture contents in karst areas 3 2 variations in isotopic compositions of soil water subcutaneous water and plant xylem water 3 2 1 variations in isotopic compositions of soil water in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley the isotopic compositions of the soil water changed with the seasons and soil depths at both valleys fig 3 and table 2 the δ2h and δ18o values of soil water were less negative in the dry season than those in the rainy season at both valleys meanwhile the isotopic compositions of the soil water showed significant difference between two valleys at both seasons p 0 001 in dry season and p 0 05 in rainy season respectively which the isotopic compositions of the soil water was less negative in the tunneling affected valley than those in the tunnel free valley at both seasons in the dry season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in soil water were 58 89 and 8 55 in the tunnel free valley and 54 77 and 7 46 in the tunneling affected valley respectively in the rainy season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in soil water were 96 61 and 16 40 in the tunnel free valley and 91 10 and 14 83 in the tunneling affected valley respectively 3 2 2 variations in isotopic compositions of subcutaneous water in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley similarly the δ2h and δ18o values of subcutaneous water showed slighter depleted in the rainy season than those in the dry season at both valleys however compared to the seasonal variations of the δ2h and δ18o from the soils water less variation of those values from the subcutaneous water were observed in both valleys at both seasons fig 3 and table 2 3 2 3 variations in isotopic compositions of plant xylem water in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley as shown in fig 3 and table 2 there were negligible differences in the δ2h and δ18o values between the stem xylem water of arbors and shrubs implying that the arbors and shrubs absorbed water from the similar water sources in the karst areas however marked seasonal differences in the δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water were observed at both valleys suggesting that plant water uptake had significant temporal variability furthermore the isotopic compositions of the stem xylem water showed significant difference between two valleys at both seasons p 0 001 at both seasons showing less negative values in the tunneling affected valley than those in the tunnel free valley in the dry season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in stem xylem water were 47 72 and 6 98 in the tunneling affected valley and 49 40 and 7 44 in the tunnel free valley repectively in the rainy season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in stem xylem water were 78 94 and 12 85 in the tunneling affected valley and 86 39 and 14 31 in the tunnel free valley respectively such differences in the δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water between two valleys at both seasons indicated that the water uptake patterns of plants in the tunneling affected valley could be changed by the tunnels excavation 3 2 4 isosource estimation of feasible contributions of potential water sources to plant water uptake at two valleys as indicated by isosource model there were marked seasonal variations in the proportions of the different water sources for plant uptake at both valleys table 3 during the rainy season plants mostly utilized water from the soil layers and then from the subcutaneous zone at both karst trough valleys contrasted during the dry season plants predominantly extracted water from the subcutaneous zone and then from the soil layers at both karst trough valleys furthermore the isosource model revealed that there were significant differences in plants water uptake patterns between the tunneling affected valley and tunnel free valley which plants extracted obviously more water from the subcutaneous zone at the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that at the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons table 3 and fig 5 during the rainy season the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 29 varying from 23 to 36 47 varying from 37 to 57 and 24 varying from 13 to 37 respectively in the tunnel free karst trough valley while the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 23 varying from 11 to 34 44 varying from 29 to 71 and 33 varying from 18 to 50 respectively in the tunneling affected karst trough valley during the dry season the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 17 varying from 13 to 20 24 varying from 17 to 31 and 59 varying from 53 to 68 respectively in the tunnel free karst trough valley while the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 10 varying from 8 to 12 14 varying from 10 to 20 and 76 varying from 70 to 82 respectively in the tunneling affected karst trough valley this indicated that the plants water uptake patterns have been changed by the tunnels excavation in the tunneling affected karst trough valley 4 discussion 4 1 differences in seasonal soil moisture contents between two karst trough valleys precipitation vs tunnels excavation the soil water contents at both valleys showed higher values during the rainy season due to plenty rainfall while soil water contents at both valleys showed lower values during the dry season because of less precipitation thus more than 10 of the seasonal variations in soil water contents at both valleys are caused by the seasonal changes of precipitation compared to the tunnel free karst trough valley the lowered soil moisture contents of different soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at both seasons might result from the tunnels excavation the modification of natural hydrogeological flow system caused by the tunnels excavation especially drilled below underground river could accelerate groundwater flow velocities vincenzi et al 2009 and consequently result in a rapid and great loss of soil and soil water along with the cracks and crevices developed in limestone especially in the rainy season as shown in fig 2 the mean values of soil water contents at the upper and lower soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at rainy and dry season were about 3 and 4 and 5 and 5 lower than those in the tunnel free karst trough valley respectively this supports our hypothesis that tunnels excavation could lower karst groundwater and then dry soil moisture contents 4 2 differences in seasonal water uptake patterns of plants between two karst trough valleys soil water vs subcutaneous water and impact from tunnels excavation marked seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of plants arbors and shrubs at the both valleys are attributed to the dimorphic root system of plants growing in subtropics karst areas a network of branched surface roots potentially takes up water from upper soil layers while deeper roots extract water stored in epikarst and even underground river that has been recharged from antecedent precipitation williams and ehleringer 2000 kulmatiski et al 2006 heilman et al 2009 hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 such dimorphic root system seems to be more important for species growing on karst shallow soils because these shallow soils are deficient of water to support plant growth hasselquist et al 2010 and plants have to extract water from the subcutaneous zone or even from underground river as indicated by some studies although shallow bedrock may hamper the downward growth of roots in karst thin soils weathered limestone bedrock often allows roots penetration through a network of cracks fissures and channels to extract waters from the soil layers and subcutaneous zone and even from deep underground river white et al 1985 canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2009 2014 jackson et al 1999 revealed that some plants in karst areas can grow their roots deeper than 65 m to use the deep groundwater the selected plants fraxinus chinensis roxb and viburnum chinshanense graebn have developed dimorphic root systems fig 5 thus plants in karst areas could derive their most water from soil layers through the surface roots during the rainy season due to lots of precipitation resulted in ample soil water at upper and lower soil layers while plants have to use the deep roots to extract primarily water from the subcutaneous zone during the dry season due to the decrease in the soil water at upper and lower soil layers with the decline of precipitation however it should be noted that the subcutaneous water contributed a lot to plant water sources at both valleys about 24 at the tunnel free karst trough valley and 33 at the tunneling affect karst trough valley respectively even in rainy season fig 4 although the soil layers especially the lower soil layer could provide much water for plants utilization this is resulted from the low rainwater holding capacity in karst discontinuous shallow soil layers hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 rong et al 2011 and the gradual increase in transpiration of plants during the continuous growing season similar results were identified in other karst areas nie et al 2010 rong et al 2011 in which both evergreen arbors and shrubs used a mixture water from the soil layers and subcutaneous zone during the rainy season furthermore plants extracted more water from the subcutaneous zone about 9 at rainy season and 17 at dry season respectively at the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that at the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons fig 5 because there are marked lower soil water contents at upper and lower soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that in the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons fig 2 evergreen species in karst areas can maintain their foliage and growth even in the drought season suggesting they have access to a more permanent water source such as groundwater white et al 1985 although soil water contents decreased and groundwater lowered caused by the tunnels excavation plants could extract water from the deep zone for growth through the deep roots in the tunneling affected karst trough valley more water of plants uptake extracted from the subcutaneous zone at both seasons should be attributed to the decrease of the soil water availability caused by tunnels excavation in the tunneling affected karst trough valley native plants in karst areas are much more flexible resulting from the dimorphic root system in allocating roots and adjusting water uptake in the soil layers and subcutaneous zone with high water resources availability such flexibility can help plants in karst areas to capture belowground water with fluctuated depth through time because the availability of water in soil layers and subcutaneous zone may vary with the seasonal pattern of precipitation in the monsoon climate areas and causing by tunnels excavation in the karst areas 5 conclusions soil water contents and the stable isotopes of δ2h and δ18o were used to detect whether there were seasonal variations in soil water contents and shifts of plants water uptake patterns between rainy and dry seasons in two karst trough valleys with similar hydrogeological conditions but different impaction by tunnels excavation affected unaffected valley of southwest china marked vertical and seasonal differences in the soil water contents were found between two valleys but the soil water contents of different soil layers at both seasons in the tunneling affected valley were always lower than those in the tunnel free valley also there were significant seasonal differences in the δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water in both valleys showing less negative isotopic values in the tunneling affected valley than those in the tunnel free valley at both seasons the isosource outcomes indicated that plants uptake water pattern changed from a dominant soil water source during the rainy season to a dominant subcutaneous water source during the dry season at both valleys showing a greater degree of ecological plasticity of plants in karst areas this is mainly attributed to the functionally dimorphic root system of native plants in karst areas however plants extracted obviously more water from the subcutaneous zone in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that in the tunneling unaffected karst trough valley at both seasons decreasing soil water availability resulted from tunnels excavation contributes to this variation the flexible water uptake patterns of plants might help plants to capture belowground water and nutritional sources and adapt to the fluctuating environment in karst areas this study provides a useful method to explore the effects of tunnels excavation on karst water resources and ecosystem and to inform better measures to protect karst region eco environments conflict of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgement this research was supported by

6660,karstic aquifers are very sensitive and fragile to environmental changes with more tunnels excavated in karst areas groundwater levels are increasingly lowered and resulted in changed natural hydrogeological flow system and groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology of surface water systems water especially groundwater is a limited and key factor and significant driving force for karst ecosystem processes however the effects of tunnels excavation on the ecosystems in karst areas remain largely unknown this study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water contents and shifts of plants water uptake patterns between rainy and dry seasons in a karst trough valley affected by tunnels excavation and comparing their differences with those in a tunnel free karst trough valley in southwest china monthly soil water contents at two soil layers of the upper 20 cm and lower 20 40 cm were measured and soil water at two soil layers subcutaneous water and plant arbor and shrub xylem water were sampled in february mid dry season and september late rainy season 2017 respectively and the δ2h and δ18o of those waters were analyzed the isosource model based on dual stable isotopes of δ2h and δ18o was used to estimate the contributions of different sources to the plant xylem water although the soil water contents at both valleys showed similar vertical and temporal variations resulted primarily from the evaporation and precipitation the soil water contents of two soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than that of the tunnel free valley at both seasons plants uptake water pattern changed from a dominant soil water source during the rainy season to a dominant subcutaneous water source during the dry season at both valleys however plants extracted more water from the subcutaneous zone in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that of the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons of which the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 33 in rainy season and 76 in dry season respectively in the tunneling affected karst trough valley while the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 24 in rainy season and 59 in dry season respectively in the tunnel free karst trough valley the above results indicated that tunnels excavation decreased the soil water contents and then changed plants water uptake patterns in karst areas keywords water uptake patterns dual stable isotopes tunnels excavation soil water subcutaneous water karst trough valley 1 introduction nowadays more and more tunnels are excavated due to more efficient transport critically dependent on highway and railway tunnel in the world up to the early 2010s nearly ten thousand kilometers of railway tunnels alone have been built under a variety of complex geological conditions in china zhao et al 2013 generally tunnels are excavated below groundwater table especially in karst areas and groundwater inflow into and then drainage out of the tunnels which result in a lowered groundwater table any groundwater drawdown could alter the natural hydrogeological flow system and consequently impact groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology of surface water systems springs wells streams lakes wetlands and the associated aquatic ecosystems the more heterogeneous the physical environment is the greater such risks karstic aquifers with double layer hydrogeological structures are among the most problematical due to its sensitive and fragile to environmental changes ford and williams 2007 therefore most studies have mainly focused on the effects of tunnel excavation on karst hydrogeology gisbert et al 2009 vincenzi et al 2009 raposo et al 2010 chiocchini and castaldi 2011 zarei et al 2012 alija et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 strozzi et al 2014 liu et al 2015 pujades et al 2015 water is a limited and key factor influencing plant growth in karst areas due to a very limited amount of water storage in the thin and rocky soils underlain by rock fractures such situation of water deficit for plant growth resulting from groundwater drawdown and the drying up of surface water caused by tunnel excavation could be more serious in karst areas although the effects of karst groundwater leakage and drawdown caused by tunnel excavation on vegetation are mentioned in previous studies e g vincenzi et al 2009 no study appears to have been conducted on the effects of tunnel excavation caused lowered groundwater on the karst ecosystems such as the change of water sources for plant uptake or growth stable isotopes of δ2h and δ18o in waters could provide an effective powerful and nondestructive approach for identifying and partitioning the different potential water sources used by plants white et al 1985 dawson and ehleringer 1991 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 rong et al 2011 ma and song 2016 geris et al 2017 rothfuss and javaux 2017 wang et al 2017 because of no isotopic fractionation during terrestrial plant uptake of water wershaw et al 1966 white et al 1985 dawson and ehleringer 1991 dawson et al 2002 although all the water sources ultimately come from precipitation values of δ2h and δ18o for various water sources are significantly different because of evapotranspiration thus the hydrogen isotope content of xylem sap that does not expose it to evaporative enrichment reflects the water sources consumed by plants and provides critical insights into adaptive responses of plants to the changing environments dawson et al 2002 in this study we investigated soil moisture change of two soil layers of the upper 20 and lower 20 40 cm at two karst trough valleys with similar hydrogeological conditions but different impaction by tunnels excavation affected unaffected valley in chongqing of southwest china and analyzed δ2h and δ18o values of the two dominant plant species fraxinus chinensis roxb arbor and viburnum chinshanense graebn shrub and three potential water sources available for plant uptake rainwater captured by two soil layers of the upper 20 cm and lower 20 40 cm and the shallow groundwater underlying subcutaneous water in rainy and dry seasons at two karst trough valleys we hypothesized that tunnels excavation lowered karst groundwater and then could dry soil moisture and change the water sources for plant uptake during different seasons in karst areas thus the new aspects addressed here are to quantify the proportional contribution of various water sources soil water and subcutaneous water to water sources of plant uptake in different seasons using the δ2h and δ18o of various waters impacted by tunnels excavation in karst trough valley areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the longfeng and longche karst trough valleys 106 23 15 106 28 05 e 29 40 30 29 48 10 n with an area of 11 7 km2 and 26 8 km2 respectively belong to the northern part of the zhongliang mountain located in the northwest of chongqing southwest china fig 1 the regional climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation of 1200 mm over 80 of precipitation occurring during the rainy season from april to october and the mean annual air temperature of 18 c the longfeng and longche karst trough valleys are located in the guanyinxia anticline extending towards north south and consist of three ridges and two valleys fig 1 the bedrock in the anticline core is the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1 f with an area of 9 2 km2 which the first and third sections of the t1 f consist of gray limestone with a thickness of 120 170 m and the second and fourth sections of the t1 f consist of purplish sandstone with a thickness of 310 380 m on either side of the anticline core there are middle and lower triassic light grey to dark grey dolomite and limestone t2 l and t1 j with an area of 26 8 km2 and a thickness of 500 700 m which comprises the main karst aquifer and upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj feldspar quartz sandstone shale and mudstone with an area of 2 5 km2 and a thickness of 170 1100 m because the limestone and dolomite compared to the sandstone and shale can be easily corroded and eroded karst trough valleys are developed in the t1 j and t2 l while the ridges are formed in the erosion resistant t1 f and t3 xj in the karst trough valleys the triassic carbonate rock developed many vertical open fissures providing basic conditions for forming karst depressions fissures and sinkholes rainwater and surface water quickly drain through sinkholes fissures or shaft into the karst aquifer and an underground river is developed in each karst trough valley the feng and long underground rivers are developed in the east and west of the longfeng karst trough valley fig 1 respectively which the elevation of the outlet for the feng and long underground river is 302 m and 270 m respectively the length of the feng and long underground river is about 4 5 km and 5 2 km respectively before 2000 the multi annual mean discharge of the feng and long underground river was approximately 35 l s and 25 l s respectively however from 2000 to 2017 the discharge of the feng and long underground river has gradually decreased to about 25 l s and 15 l s respectively the qingfeng and longche underground rivers are developed in the east and west of the longche karst trough valley fig 1 respectively where the elevation of the outlet for the qingfeng and longche underground river is 560 m and 570 m respectively the length of the qingfeng and longche underground river is about 11 6 km and 11 8 km respectively the multi annual mean discharge of the qingfeng and longche underground river is approximately 55 l s and 45 l s respectively before 2000 there once were 15 epikarst springs which were sources of drinking and irrigation water but only one epikarst spring with very low discharge can be found in the longfeng karst trough valley in 2017 there are more than thirty wells and epikarst springs in the longche karst trough valley overlying soils are mainly the zonal yellow soil of which the thickness is heterogeneous varying from 10 cm to 100 cm in the ridges of non karst areas the soil thickness is more than 50 cm while the soil thickness is less than 50 cm in the karst area the main land uses are forest land 21 6 km2 agricultural land 13 3 km2 and residential land 2 3 km2 fig 1 the evergreen wide leaf forests fraxinus chinensis roxb pagoda etc and shrubs viburnum chinshanense graebn etc are dominant vegetation most plants and shrubs are over 20 years due to the grain for green project which started in the middle of 1990s however the heights of arbors are usually low and most species fail to reach their biological heights due to limited available water stored in the karst thin soil 2 2 tunnels excavation in the longfeng karst trough valley the north south lying zhongliang mountain located in northwest of the chongqing metropolitan area is a big barrier to transportation the construction of both railway and highway tunnels through the zhongliang mountain is necessary to improve the transportation three about 4 km long tunnels without any ventilation shafts were built within an 8 km distance of the longfeng karst trough valley during the past 20 years table 1 which were excavated below the water level of the underground rivers the discharge of groundwater in three tunnels was high but the inflow volume varied considerably table 1 therefore the groundwater level gradually lowered and surface water gradually dried up resulting in the change of the paddy field to the dry land since the first tunnel excavation in the longfeng karst trough valley hereafter referred to as tunneling affected valley abbreviated as tav such situation was exacerbated after the second and third tunnel was constructed in the longfeng karst trough valley now 14 of 15 epikarst springs and most wells disappeared drinking water for human and livestock totally depends on the surface water pumped from the excavated tunnels and jialing river and most irrigation water is from rainwater and part is from the surface water pumped from the excavated tunnels and jialing river in the longfeng karst trough valley meanwhile the vegetation coverage becomes relatively poor and the rocky desertification worsens due to groundwater drawdown and the drying up of surface water caused by tunnel excavation in the longfeng karst trough valley as a control tunnel excavation is absent in the longche karst trough valley hereafter referred to as tunneling unaffected valley abbreviated as tuav and it is a natural karst hydrogeological system thus this provides a unique opportunity to study the impacts of tunnels excavation on the hydrogeology hydrology and eco environment in karst areas 2 3 sampling the air temperature and precipitation recorded at 15 min intervals with a resolution of 0 01 c and 0 1 mm respectively by the hobo field weather stations located in the longfeng karst trough valley fig 1 were collected from january to december 2017 soil samples at the depth of 0 20 and 20 40 cm for analysis of soil water contents were collected monthly in 2017 samples of plant xylem water soil water at the depth of 0 20 and 20 40 cm and spring water subcutaneous water for isotopic analysis δ2h and δ18o were collected in the dry season of february 2017 and in the rainy season of september 2017 sampling of soils and plant species was conducted from 5 cross sections of the karst trough valleys of which 3 cross sections were located at the top of three tunnels of the longfeng karst trough valley and 2 cross sections were located in the longche karst trough valley fig 1 there are 3 sampling points at each cross section of which 2 sampling points were located on both sides of the hillside and 1 was located in the bottom of valley at each sampling point soils and plant species were sampled if both arbors and shrubs could be found respectively fraxinus chinensis roxb and viburnum chinshanense graebn are typical aboriginal species of arbors and shrubs and were sampled at each sampling point for each plant species three to five individuals with similar diameter of breast height were selected all the plant samples were cut into 3 4 cm segments immediately placed into glass vials with screw caps sealed with polyethylene parafilm and kept frozen in a freezer 20 c for isotopic analysis the total samples during every measurement period were 7 and 3 for the species of arbor and shrub at the tunneling affected valley and 5 and 3 for the species of arbor and shrub at the tunnel free valley respectively at each sampling point two soil samples were collected using the hand probes at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm below ground a total of 360 soil samples collected monthly were used to obtain gravimetric soil moisture content smc as determined by drying at 105 c for 24 h the total soil samples for isotopic analysis during every measurement period were 10 and 8 in the tunneling affected and the tunnel free valley at rainy and dry season respectively meanwhile a total of 6 subcutaneous waters 1 epikarst spring and 2 outlets of underground river at the tunneling affected valley and 2 epikarst springs and 1 outlets of underground river at the tunnel free valley were collected at rainy and dry season to analyze isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o mineral oil was applied to each bottle to prevent evaporation 2 4 isotopic analyses water in plant and soil samples was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china the extraction efficiency was over 99 which was sufficient to obtain unfractionated water samples the extracted water sample is loaded into a 2 ml brown bottle and sealed with a sealing membrane and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until subsequent isotopic analysis the δ2h and δ18o values of subcutaneous water and water in plant tissues and soils were measured with an isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view usa at chongqing key laboratory of karst environment southwest university the isotopic ratios of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were expressed as a permil deviation from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical precision of the liquid water measured by iris was 1 2 for δ2h and 0 3 for δ18o 2 5 data analysis the isotopic compositions of all potential water sources and xylem water were entered into the isosource model phillips and gregg 2003 to calculate the contribution of each source to stem water isosource is a microsoft visual basic software package whichcalculates ranges of source proportional contributions to a mixture based on stable isotope analyses when the number of sources is too large to permit a unique solution and can provide the distribution of source proportions which are consistent with isotopic mass balance phillips and gregg 2003 the raw xylem isotope values of δ2h and δ18o in two plant species were used as mixture data inputs into isosource model and isotope values of δ2h and δ18o from various soils horizons 0 20 and 20 40 cm and subcutaneous water were used as source data and input into isosource model to guarantee that no legitimate feasible source combinations was missed the fractional increment employed in our calculations was 0 01 and uncertainty or mass balance tolerance was not smaller than half this amount 0 5 increment maximum difference between sources phillips and gregg 2003 uncertainty level was set at 0 01 in our calculations statistical analysis was conducted using the spss 20 0 program spss inc chicago il usa paired sample t test was used to detect significant differences in the soil moisture contents and isotopic compositions of soil and xylem water between the tunneling affected and tunnel free karst trough valleys during dry and rainy seasons 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of precipitation and soil moisture contents the total precipitation was 1314 mm in 2017 and 86 5 occurred during the vegetation growing season from april to october accompanying with a severe summer drought in august the highest monthly precipitation was 249 mm in september accounting for 19 of the year s total precipitation while the lowest monthly precipitation was only 10 mm in december fig 2 as shown in fig 2 marked vertical and seasonal variations in soil moisture contents were found at both valleys the soil moisture contents increased with the increase of soil depths at both seasons which the average of soil moisture contents in upper and lower soil layers was 24 and 27 respectively meanwhile the soil moisture contents of different soil depths at two valleys exhibited significant temporal changes with the precipitation variations the highest soil moisture contents occurred in june about 32 while lowest soil moisture contents about 20 occurred in august with highest temperature and summer drought meanwhile soil moisture contents showed significant difference in upper soil layers p 0 001 and lower soil layers p 0 001 between two karst valleys fig 2 although the soil moisture contents of two valleys showed similar vertical and temporal variations at both seasons the soil moisture contents for the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm varied from 17 to 28 with a mean of 22 3 and 19 to 32 with a mean of 25 3 in the tunneling affected valley and 20 to 32 with a mean of 25 9 and 24 to 38 with a mean of 29 4 in the tunnel free valley respectively such obvious difference in soil moisture contents between two valleys showing lower soil moisture contents of both soil layers in the tunneling affected valley indicated that tunnels excavation could dry soil moisture contents in karst areas 3 2 variations in isotopic compositions of soil water subcutaneous water and plant xylem water 3 2 1 variations in isotopic compositions of soil water in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley the isotopic compositions of the soil water changed with the seasons and soil depths at both valleys fig 3 and table 2 the δ2h and δ18o values of soil water were less negative in the dry season than those in the rainy season at both valleys meanwhile the isotopic compositions of the soil water showed significant difference between two valleys at both seasons p 0 001 in dry season and p 0 05 in rainy season respectively which the isotopic compositions of the soil water was less negative in the tunneling affected valley than those in the tunnel free valley at both seasons in the dry season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in soil water were 58 89 and 8 55 in the tunnel free valley and 54 77 and 7 46 in the tunneling affected valley respectively in the rainy season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in soil water were 96 61 and 16 40 in the tunnel free valley and 91 10 and 14 83 in the tunneling affected valley respectively 3 2 2 variations in isotopic compositions of subcutaneous water in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley similarly the δ2h and δ18o values of subcutaneous water showed slighter depleted in the rainy season than those in the dry season at both valleys however compared to the seasonal variations of the δ2h and δ18o from the soils water less variation of those values from the subcutaneous water were observed in both valleys at both seasons fig 3 and table 2 3 2 3 variations in isotopic compositions of plant xylem water in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley as shown in fig 3 and table 2 there were negligible differences in the δ2h and δ18o values between the stem xylem water of arbors and shrubs implying that the arbors and shrubs absorbed water from the similar water sources in the karst areas however marked seasonal differences in the δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water were observed at both valleys suggesting that plant water uptake had significant temporal variability furthermore the isotopic compositions of the stem xylem water showed significant difference between two valleys at both seasons p 0 001 at both seasons showing less negative values in the tunneling affected valley than those in the tunnel free valley in the dry season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in stem xylem water were 47 72 and 6 98 in the tunneling affected valley and 49 40 and 7 44 in the tunnel free valley repectively in the rainy season the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in stem xylem water were 78 94 and 12 85 in the tunneling affected valley and 86 39 and 14 31 in the tunnel free valley respectively such differences in the δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water between two valleys at both seasons indicated that the water uptake patterns of plants in the tunneling affected valley could be changed by the tunnels excavation 3 2 4 isosource estimation of feasible contributions of potential water sources to plant water uptake at two valleys as indicated by isosource model there were marked seasonal variations in the proportions of the different water sources for plant uptake at both valleys table 3 during the rainy season plants mostly utilized water from the soil layers and then from the subcutaneous zone at both karst trough valleys contrasted during the dry season plants predominantly extracted water from the subcutaneous zone and then from the soil layers at both karst trough valleys furthermore the isosource model revealed that there were significant differences in plants water uptake patterns between the tunneling affected valley and tunnel free valley which plants extracted obviously more water from the subcutaneous zone at the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that at the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons table 3 and fig 5 during the rainy season the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 29 varying from 23 to 36 47 varying from 37 to 57 and 24 varying from 13 to 37 respectively in the tunnel free karst trough valley while the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 23 varying from 11 to 34 44 varying from 29 to 71 and 33 varying from 18 to 50 respectively in the tunneling affected karst trough valley during the dry season the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 17 varying from 13 to 20 24 varying from 17 to 31 and 59 varying from 53 to 68 respectively in the tunnel free karst trough valley while the proportions of plants water uptake from the upper and lower soil layers and the subcutaneous zone were 10 varying from 8 to 12 14 varying from 10 to 20 and 76 varying from 70 to 82 respectively in the tunneling affected karst trough valley this indicated that the plants water uptake patterns have been changed by the tunnels excavation in the tunneling affected karst trough valley 4 discussion 4 1 differences in seasonal soil moisture contents between two karst trough valleys precipitation vs tunnels excavation the soil water contents at both valleys showed higher values during the rainy season due to plenty rainfall while soil water contents at both valleys showed lower values during the dry season because of less precipitation thus more than 10 of the seasonal variations in soil water contents at both valleys are caused by the seasonal changes of precipitation compared to the tunnel free karst trough valley the lowered soil moisture contents of different soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at both seasons might result from the tunnels excavation the modification of natural hydrogeological flow system caused by the tunnels excavation especially drilled below underground river could accelerate groundwater flow velocities vincenzi et al 2009 and consequently result in a rapid and great loss of soil and soil water along with the cracks and crevices developed in limestone especially in the rainy season as shown in fig 2 the mean values of soil water contents at the upper and lower soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at rainy and dry season were about 3 and 4 and 5 and 5 lower than those in the tunnel free karst trough valley respectively this supports our hypothesis that tunnels excavation could lower karst groundwater and then dry soil moisture contents 4 2 differences in seasonal water uptake patterns of plants between two karst trough valleys soil water vs subcutaneous water and impact from tunnels excavation marked seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of plants arbors and shrubs at the both valleys are attributed to the dimorphic root system of plants growing in subtropics karst areas a network of branched surface roots potentially takes up water from upper soil layers while deeper roots extract water stored in epikarst and even underground river that has been recharged from antecedent precipitation williams and ehleringer 2000 kulmatiski et al 2006 heilman et al 2009 hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 such dimorphic root system seems to be more important for species growing on karst shallow soils because these shallow soils are deficient of water to support plant growth hasselquist et al 2010 and plants have to extract water from the subcutaneous zone or even from underground river as indicated by some studies although shallow bedrock may hamper the downward growth of roots in karst thin soils weathered limestone bedrock often allows roots penetration through a network of cracks fissures and channels to extract waters from the soil layers and subcutaneous zone and even from deep underground river white et al 1985 canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2009 2014 jackson et al 1999 revealed that some plants in karst areas can grow their roots deeper than 65 m to use the deep groundwater the selected plants fraxinus chinensis roxb and viburnum chinshanense graebn have developed dimorphic root systems fig 5 thus plants in karst areas could derive their most water from soil layers through the surface roots during the rainy season due to lots of precipitation resulted in ample soil water at upper and lower soil layers while plants have to use the deep roots to extract primarily water from the subcutaneous zone during the dry season due to the decrease in the soil water at upper and lower soil layers with the decline of precipitation however it should be noted that the subcutaneous water contributed a lot to plant water sources at both valleys about 24 at the tunnel free karst trough valley and 33 at the tunneling affect karst trough valley respectively even in rainy season fig 4 although the soil layers especially the lower soil layer could provide much water for plants utilization this is resulted from the low rainwater holding capacity in karst discontinuous shallow soil layers hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 rong et al 2011 and the gradual increase in transpiration of plants during the continuous growing season similar results were identified in other karst areas nie et al 2010 rong et al 2011 in which both evergreen arbors and shrubs used a mixture water from the soil layers and subcutaneous zone during the rainy season furthermore plants extracted more water from the subcutaneous zone about 9 at rainy season and 17 at dry season respectively at the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that at the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons fig 5 because there are marked lower soil water contents at upper and lower soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that in the tunnel free karst trough valley at both seasons fig 2 evergreen species in karst areas can maintain their foliage and growth even in the drought season suggesting they have access to a more permanent water source such as groundwater white et al 1985 although soil water contents decreased and groundwater lowered caused by the tunnels excavation plants could extract water from the deep zone for growth through the deep roots in the tunneling affected karst trough valley more water of plants uptake extracted from the subcutaneous zone at both seasons should be attributed to the decrease of the soil water availability caused by tunnels excavation in the tunneling affected karst trough valley native plants in karst areas are much more flexible resulting from the dimorphic root system in allocating roots and adjusting water uptake in the soil layers and subcutaneous zone with high water resources availability such flexibility can help plants in karst areas to capture belowground water with fluctuated depth through time because the availability of water in soil layers and subcutaneous zone may vary with the seasonal pattern of precipitation in the monsoon climate areas and causing by tunnels excavation in the karst areas 5 conclusions soil water contents and the stable isotopes of δ2h and δ18o were used to detect whether there were seasonal variations in soil water contents and shifts of plants water uptake patterns between rainy and dry seasons in two karst trough valleys with similar hydrogeological conditions but different impaction by tunnels excavation affected unaffected valley of southwest china marked vertical and seasonal differences in the soil water contents were found between two valleys but the soil water contents of different soil layers at both seasons in the tunneling affected valley were always lower than those in the tunnel free valley also there were significant seasonal differences in the δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water in both valleys showing less negative isotopic values in the tunneling affected valley than those in the tunnel free valley at both seasons the isosource outcomes indicated that plants uptake water pattern changed from a dominant soil water source during the rainy season to a dominant subcutaneous water source during the dry season at both valleys showing a greater degree of ecological plasticity of plants in karst areas this is mainly attributed to the functionally dimorphic root system of native plants in karst areas however plants extracted obviously more water from the subcutaneous zone in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that in the tunneling unaffected karst trough valley at both seasons decreasing soil water availability resulted from tunnels excavation contributes to this variation the flexible water uptake patterns of plants might help plants to capture belowground water and nutritional sources and adapt to the fluctuating environment in karst areas this study provides a useful method to explore the effects of tunnels excavation on karst water resources and ecosystem and to inform better measures to protect karst region eco environments conflict of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgement this research was supported by

6661,presence of vegetation in urban landscape influences soil temperature and soil moisture some studies in literature have focused on development of correlations between the above two parameters for agricultural fields and forest regions these correlations could be dissimilar due to the differences in soil conditions density and type vegetation species and temperature between agricultural and urban landscape this paper investigates the effects of vegetation on soil temperature and soil moisture by an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling a simple hydrological model is developed to capture seasonal variations of surface soil temperature and its effect on root water uptake hypothesis of effects of soil temperature on root water uptake was investigated using field measurements of soil water content field site in urban landscape containing bare grass and tree species were selected for investigation there existed a contrasting trend in water content response between summer and autumn for both bare and vegetated soils due to higher evapotranspiration in summer water content in vegetated soils were lower by up to 50 however water content in vegetated soil was found to be up to 70 higher than in a bare soil during autumn it could be due to the lower soil temperature that inhibits root water uptake ability this was verified using a series of numerical simulations that consider effects of soil temperature on root water uptake without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake there was an overestimation of reduction of soil water content by up to 50 in autumn period keywords plant roots soil temperature soil water content vegetation type urban landscape 1 introduction soil bioengineering using vegetation has become popular in stabilizing soil infrastructures in urban landscape lee et al 2013 leung et al 2015 smethurst et al 2015 besides it is also important for improving the hydrological performance of urban green infrastructures such as sustainable drainage systems for management of surface water runoff gadi et al 2017 vegetation has become one of the most essential construction materials even in developing countries such as china and india where authorities have emphasized extensively on implementation of concept of sponge city rooijen et al 2005 che et al 2015 vegetation could regulate the hydrologic processes in the vadose zone by influencing infiltration rates runoff and evapotranspiration et cubera et al 2004 many studies on the effects of vegetation upon soil water dynamics have conducted connor 2004 chen et al 2007 fan et al 2015a b ng et al 2016a ni et al 2017 it was found that the relationship between vegetation and soil moisture varies with region season and plant type chen et al 2007 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 fan et al 2015a b for example the large difference in soil water distributions exists in adjacent tree forest and grassland biomes jayawickreme et al 2008 in tree covered soils et reduces soil water content via root water uptake and the influence zone can be more than three times root depth ng et al 2016a ni et al 2017 soil moisture is found to be higher at the inter canopy area than the canopy area due to the reinforced effects of rainfall interception and root water uptake fan et al 2015a recent studies found that et induced root water uptake is also a function of soil temperature brady and ray 2008 lv et al 2013 garcia tejera et al 2016 this may in turn affect soil water dynamic soil temperature is an important feature that affects the biological events taking place in soil and directs physical and chemical processes sen and ozturk 2017 the root development of most plants ceases at temperature below 5 c temperature of soil is affected by many factors such as meteorological conditions soil topography soil water content and the surface plant canopy covers paul et al 2004 variations of vegetation cover affect soil temperature responses sensibly oliver et al 1987 scull 2007 song et al 2013 song et al 2013 found that with the increase of vegetation height and density mean daily minimum soil temperature reduces significantly and mean diurnal soil temperature ranges become smaller with the presence of vegetation the solar radiation is partially intercepted or reflected by the canopy hence reducing the radiation absorption of soil and resulting in lower soil and air temperature nearby facelli and pickett 1991 scull 2007 increased soil temperature due to deforestation and excessive cutting can affect soil organism communities briones et al 2009 below ground biological processes including the dynamics of soil organisms plant growth rate and root water uptake jacobs et al 2011 it has been reported that lowering of soil temperature directly or indirectly increases the flow resistance through the soil plant atmosphere continuum schwarz et al 1997 it can increase root resistance ameglio et al 1990 water viscosity and decrease root membrane permeability this in turn reduces the root water uptake kramer and boyer 1995 when temperature increases from 14 to 26 c root water uptake ability is increased by 30 hurd and graves 1985 it has been found by ramos and kaufmann 1979 that root water uptake ability is mainly affected in between temperature range from 5 to 35 c any further increase in soil temperature would inhibit root water uptake due to root browning and lower oxygen availability falah et al 2010 the water uptake by plant roots can be calculated by adding a sink term i e water extraction intensity to richards equation feddes et al 1976 in order to simulate et induced root water uptake many micro and macro root water uptake models were developed gardner 1964 feddes et al 1978 among those models macro root water uptake model which is expressed as a sink term feddes et al 1976 hopmans and bristow 2002 is widely used in the engineering and agricultural fields in the majority of researches on modelling root water take overestimation or underestimation of root water uptake was probably caused by ignoring soil temperature effects there have been limited models that consider effects of soil temperature on soil water content using simplified root water uptake model mellander et al 2006 lv et al 2013 those models only consider soil temperature lower than 20 c therefore the hypothesis of soil temperature effects on root water uptake and hence soil moisture should be further explored by an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling the objective of this paper is to model soil temperature and its effect on root water uptake and soil moisture content during different seasons with readily measurable parameters the hypothesis of soil temperature effects on root water uptake and hence soil moisture was investigated in this study aiming this goal an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling was adopted the field monitoring programme was specifically designed and conducted on an area with a 10 year old tree and grass cover a bare ground was tested for reference numerical modelling of root water uptake with and without considering effects of soil temperature was performed based on field data computed soil moisture with and without consideration of soil temperature was compared with that of field measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 field monitoring of tree covered grass covered and bare soils 2 1 1 test site and climate condition the field monitoring was carried out in an urban landscape campus of shantou university guangdong china the test site consisted of tree covered flat ground fig 1 a grass covered ground fig 1 b and bare flat ground for reference fig 1 c each ground had an area of 8 m 8 m the distance among these three areas was around 10 m the groundwater table was identified at 3 m depth from the surface of the flat ground during the entire monitoring period which started from 16th july 2017 to 26th november 2017 around 130 days for the ease of comparison and interpretation the whole period was divided into two periods namely summer period from 16th july 2017 to 26th september 2017 and autumn period from 27th september 2017 to 26 november 2017 during the two monitoring periods the climate data air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and rainfall intensity was measured by an automatic weather station manufactured by davis instruments ltd model vantage pro 2 fig 2 shows the measured results relative humidity rh varied from 53 to 96 the air temperature near ground surface was generally high during the summer period while decreased gradually to 16 c during autumn on the other hand solar radiation fluctuated significantly from 1 5 to 26 5 mj m2 the low values corresponded to cloudy days when rainfall occurred the average wind speed was about 3 m s the maximum rainfall amount received during the monitoring period was 115 mm d on 27th august 2017 2 1 2 soil properties soil core samples 76 mm in diameter and 100 mm in height were collected at selected locations of the three testing sites i e tree grass and bare for determining their basic properties four core samples at different depths 35 70 100 and 150 cm of each location were collected to determine grain size distribution liquid limit and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks all soil cores were sampled using a cylindrical cutter which was penetrated vertically into the ground ni et al 2017 the particle data were obtained from a sieve analysis described in astm d422 standard astm 2007 liquid limit test was conducted in accordance with astm d4318 astm 2010a the ks was measured using a flexible wall permeameter according to astm d5084 astm 2010b following the principle of falling head method when measuring ks each soil specimen was saturated with de aired water in a permeameter with flexible wall a water head of 100 mm was applied at the upper hydraulic boundary of each sample resulting in a total head of 200 mm then ks of each specimen was determined by darcy s law ni et al 2017 in addition soil water retention curves were measured using a pressure plate apparatus with an air entry pressure of 500 kpa ng and pang 2000 the axis translation technique was applied in the measurement the average contents of gravel sand and fine particles silt and clay were 3 90 and 7 respectively for the tree covered soil 4 91 5 respectively for the grassed soil and 2 90 and 8 respectively for bare soil the liquid limit of tree covered soil grassed soil and bare soil were measured to be 27 6 4 26 9 3 2 and 28 8 4 5 respectively based on the particle size distribution and the liquid limit the field soils for both vegetated and bare were classified as well graded sand sw according to the unified soil classification system uscs astm 2010c the ks for tree covered grassed and bare soils were measured to be 4 8 0 72 10 4 m s 3 8 0 55 10 4 m s and 4 0 0 51 10 4 m s respectively in order to check the statistical differences of ks among three ground covers one way anova analysis was conducted it was found that there were no significant differences of ks among three ground covers p value 0 178 greater than 0 05 saturated and residual volumetric water content of the soils under three land covers were 30 and 10 respectively the measured soil water retention curve was fitted by van genuchten 1980 equation a related to air entry value and n related to the shape of each water retention curve were determined to be 2 80 and 1 38 respectively in addition differences of measured ionic concentration between vegetated and bare soils were measured to be 2 2 1 3 tested plant species in the field study a tree species ficus microcarpa also known as chinese banyan fig 1 and a grass species cynodon dactylon also known as bermuda grass were used for field testing the tree species is widely distributed as an ornamental plant and is one of the most common street trees in warm climates the tree age was around 10 year old suggesting that it is at mature stage the diameter of the tree canopy was measured to be 8 m the grass species is commonly found in many parts of asia and has high drought tolerance it is ecologically suitable for slope rehabilitation and urban landscape greening in warm climates of the worlds leaf area index lai is defined as the total projected area of leaves on the unit ground surface by taking images with high resolution camera using uav dj ltd the projected leaf area can be digitalized and calculated then lai was determined by dividing the area of leaves over the projected canopy area chen et al 1997 ng et al 2016b on the other hand root depth was determined via core sampling method at three different locations for each ground case ni et al 2017 after the soil cores at different depths were sampled by a cylindrical cutter each core was placed in a washing chamber and the soil was dispersed by a hydrovortex that was produced by pressurized jets of water ni et al 2017 hence the presence of roots can be checked finally the root depth was determined as the maximum soil depth beyond which no root can be observed from the collected soil core samples fig 3 shows the measured lai and root depth from 16th july 2017 to 26th november 2017 lais of tree and grass decreased by 10 and 28 respectively when it changed from summer to autumn period the observed change in tree lai is similar to that of mature trees such as quercus rotundifolia and quercus fagineain as observed in field study by mediavilla and escudero 2004 grass root increased by 25 whereas there was almost no change in tree root depth based on the measured results it can be reasonably assumed in the numerical model that plant lai and root depth changed linearly during the monitoring period 2 1 4 test setup instrumentation and test procedures fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of test setup and instrumentation plan of the field monitoring for each testing ground in the tree covered ground fig 1 a four pairs of soil temperature moisture sensors stmss sm300 from delta t device ltd were installed at depth of 100 mm in a straight line from the tree trunk the horizontal distance between stmss and tree stem were 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m consecutively in both the bare and grass covered grounds fig 1 b and c three pairs of stms were installed at depths of 100 mm at selected locations in order to avoid any interference between sensors spacing between each sensor was maintained at 4 m all the sensors were installed on 10th july 2017 before the field monitoring before installing the sensors holes with diameter larger than the sensor body was excavated until the desired depths the two stainless steel rods of each sensor were inserted into the soil at the bottom of each hole until they fully contacted with the surrounding soils after connecting the sensors to the data logger the holes were then repacked with soils the refilling and re compaction processes were conducted carefully to minimize excessive disturbance to the surrounding soils and any electronic components shao et al 2018 this could ensure the accuracy of the installed sensors during the two monitoring periods summer and autumn soil moisture and soil temperature were measured continuously 2 1 5 statistical analysis significant differences of measured results i e soil temperature and water content were assessed with one way anova analysis followed by post hoc fisher s least significant difference test there were 4 replicated measurements for tree covered ground and 3 replicated measurements for both bare and grass covered grounds results were considered statistically significant when p value 0 05 in order to indicate statistical significance of differences among groups different letters i e a b and c were used this means that when the two groups e g soil water content in bare and tree or grass covered soils have the same letter they have no statistical differences on the contrary the groups are significantly different statistically when they have different letters 2 2 numerical modelling in order to assess the effects of soil temperature on root water uptake and hence soil water content the root water uptake model developed by varado et al 2006 was further modified to incorporate the effects of soil temperature besides surface soil temperature was empirically fitted by using easily measured variables air temperature and plant lai plant lai and root depths changed linearly from 16th july 2017 to 26 november 2017 fig 3 computed soil water contents with i considering soil temperature effects and ii not considering soil temperature effects were compared with field data 2 2 1 plant et by using the measured meteorological parameters fig 2 the potential transpiration pt mm maximum amount of water that plants could extract water from the soil feddes et al 1978 of each plant species tree and grass was determined by the modified penman monteith equation ozier lafontaine et al 1998 1 λ p t i δ r i g ρ a c p e s e a r ai δ γ 1 r si r ai where i refers to grass and tree respectively λ is

of a vegetated cover could be estimated by the sum of pt i and pe 2 2 2 soil water balance considering effects of soil temperature on root water uptake considering one dimensional 1 d transient seepage in vegetated soil the conservation of water mass may be described by the following modified darcy richards equation 4 d θ h dt d dz k h dh dz 1 s i h z where θ is the volumetric water content vwc t is the elapsed time s z is the vertical co ordinate m h is the water pressure head m k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity function m s as a function of h or matric suction s h γ w where γ w is the unit weight of water kn m3 and s i h z is the sink term which represents the volume of water transpired by plant i over the entire root zone for a given time interval feddes et al 1976 in order to consider effects of soil temperature on root water uptake a temperature dependent reduction function f z was incorporated in the sink term mathematically sink term s i h that considers hydraulic redistribution proposed by varado et al 2006 can be modified into 5 s i h z f z α h z g i z d i α h z g i z d z p t i where d i is the root depth of plant i m g i is considered to be the distribution of root length density the potential transpiration rate p t i is distributed across the root zone based on a temperature dependent reduction function f z and a weighted stress index α h z g i z d i α h z g i z d z this weighted stress index which incorporates root compensation mechanism is a function of coupled root distribution and soil water availability at different depths li et al 2001 varado et al 2006 in the modelling an exponential function was defined for the investigated tree and grass species pt i was calculated from eq 1 and α h z is the so called transpiration reduction function feddes et al 2001 which can be expressed as 6 α h z 0 h h wp h h wp h fc h wp h wp h h fc 1 h h fc where h wp and h fc are the water pressure head m corresponding to the permanent wilting point and field capacity respectively physically eqs 5 and 6 mean that for any h higher than h fc the ability of root water uptake is maximum as the soil dries and h reaches between h fc and h wp the ability of root water uptake decreases linearly with a decrease in h plant wilts and stops extracting water when soil is too dry to have reached a h lower than h wp it is known that root water uptake is mainly affected when soil temperatures are between 5 and 35 c ramos and kaufmann 1979 in order to capture this effect temperature dependent reduction function mellander et al 2006 was introduced in the root water uptake model as follows 7 f z 1 e x p t 1 t s z t 3 t 2 t s z t 3 c 0 t s z t 3 c where t 1 and t 2 are 0 0032 and 2 4 respectively and t 3 equals to 3 c t s z is the soil temperature at the depth z soil surface temperature can be calculated using the observed air temperature lai and the canopy cover of weeds understorey paul et al 2004 in this study effects of vegetation cover on surface soil temperature was modelled based on the equation proposed by paul et al 2004 8 t s 0 t a e x p m l a i where t a is air temperature c t s 0 is soil temperature near ground surface c m is an empirical factor by back analyzing the correlations between air temperature soil temperature at depth 100 mm and lai m was calibrated to be 0 02 in this study it should be noted that this empirical equation was only applicable for the surface soil layers soil temperature decreased exponentially with depth lv et al 2013 as the measured temperature of underground water at 3 m depth remained almost constant between 15 and 17 c soil temperature distribution within the vadose zone above ground water table can be expressed as 9 t s z t s 0 t w e x p z t w where t w is the temperature of underground water which is set to be 16 c in this study 2 2 3 model implementation the mathematical models were numerically solved by an author developed script under python 2 7 programming environment the darcy richards equation was solved by an implicit finite difference method van dam and feddes 2000 simunek et al 2005 the picard iteration technique was used for each time step for ensuring numerical accuracy and computational efficiency during the computation the tolerable errors of water content were specified with 0 0001 and the time step was adapted in a range of 0 02 5 min ni et al 2018 a uniform computational grid of 0 01 m was used to discretize the soil of 3 m depth parameters used for calculating pet were listed in table 1 in all the cases actual evaporation ae from the bare soil surface is considered to be equal to pe obtained from eq 2 assumption is reasonable because the amount of suction investigated in this study was not higher than 3000 kpa which is the threshold value beyond which ae drops below pe wilson et al 1997 the threshold suction is the one measured in the soil surfaces where evaporation takes place wilson et al 1997 this threshold value is independent of soil texture and drying time wilson et al 1997 and has been widely used by researchers in different fields simms and yanful 2001 gaj et al 2016 song et al 2018 the initial water content distribution was obtained by the interpolation of the field measurement of soil water content right before 16th july 2017 when root depth was determined via core sampling method the water contents of soil cores at different depths were measured via oven drying method and the results are shown in table 2 a flux boundary that represents rainfall infiltration during the monitoring period was specified at the top boundary following the recorded rainfall data in fig 2 at each time step when the rainfall intensity was lower than the ks of soil the flux boundary would be equal to the rainfall intensity on the contrary when the rainfall intensity was higher the flux boundary applied would be switched to a pressure boundary with a pressure head of 1 mm ni et al 2018 a static water table i e 3 m depth was applied at the bottom of the model to mimic the field condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential evapotranspiration fig 4 shows the pe and pet for bare and vegetated grounds respectively pe and pet fluctuated consecutively with the lowest values during the cloudy days when rainfall events occurred during the monitored period pet of vegetated soils was consistently higher than pe of bare soil the differences were much more significant during summer period when air temperature and solar radiation were relatively higher fig 2 this is because high temperature and solar radiation would facilitate plant photosynthesis and increase water uptake from soil besides pet for tree covered soil was consistently higher than grass pet as shown in fig 3 tree lai i e 7 6 8 4 was higher than grass lai i e 3 0 4 2 by more than two times according to beer lambert law ritchie 1972 intercepted solar radiation by plant canopy depends on lai and incoming solar radiation higher tree lai would result in more solar radiation intercepted and hence higher pet the positive correlations were also observed by ng et al 2016b who investigated schefflera heptaphylla in silty sand for non crop species such as ficus microcarpa and cynodon dactylon the extinction coefficient in beer lambert law should be lower than crop species as the leaves of investigated species inclined more vertically than crop species ng et al 2016b 3 2 measured soil temperature in different vegetated soils fig 5 shows the variations of daily soil temperature at depth of 100 mm with time for both summer and autumn periods air temperature was superimposed in the figure for comparison with the fluctuation of air temperature soil temperature varied correspondingly throughout the monitoring period soil temperature was higher during dry periods compared with the wet periods this is because specific heat of dry soil is less than the wet soil hence there existed faster heat exchange between air and soil interface and rapid increase in soil temperature in the dry soil mann and schmidt 2003 soil temperature in the shallow bare soil seems to be consistent with the air temperature however soil temperature in the tree covered ground was consistently smaller than air temperature and that in the bare ground p vaue 0 02 table 3 the difference can be up to 25 besides due to the presence of tree canopy fluctuation of soil temperature in the tree covered soil 18 5 31 1 c was smaller than the bare soil 19 38 7 c compared with tree covered soil temperature in the grass covered soil was slightly higher especially during summer this is probably due to the larger tree lai i e 7 6 8 4 and hence less solar radiation reaching ground surface 3 3 measured soil water content in different vegetated soils fig 6 shows the variation of measured volumetric water content with time soil water content decreased during the dry down period and increased during rainfall for both vegetated and bare soils during summer water content in vegetated soils decreased much faster regardless of the vegetation types i e grass and tree p vaue 0 03 table 4 the lowest water content in the vegetated soil after drying was found to be 50 lower that the bare soil 11th august the observed greater reduction in soil water content in vegetated soil was attributed to the higher pet fig 4 there seems to be no major differences in water content between tree and grass covers see fig 6 and table 4 that means even though tree pet was higher than grass fig 4 measured water content could still be similar between two cases at shallow depth of 100 mm interestingly variations of soil water content during autumn period was significantly different from the summer fig 6 in autumn water content in vegetated soil was higher than in bare soil p vaue 0 05 table 4 the difference can be up to 70 this was contradictory to the results in summer and found in literature simon and collison 2002 smethurst et al 2015 ni et al 2017 in their studies it was found that water content in the vegetated ground was lower than that in the bare ground due to root water uptake there could be two possible mechanisms behind this observation firstly low soil temperature would increase the water flow resistance through the soil plant atmosphere continuum schwarz et al 1997 due to the increase in water viscosity and a decrease in membrane permeability at low temperature root resistance increases and hence root water uptake is reduced lv et al 2013 the second mechanism is called hydraulic redistribution which means passive transfer of water from moister to drier area of the soil profile via roots burgess and bleby 2006 domec et al 2010 plant roots would compensate the drier area within the shallow depth by transferring water from moister areas through increasing water uptake by roots in moister areas meinzer et al 2004 amenu and kumar 2007 however in the bare soil the above two mechanisms are not valid and water content in shallower depth was lowered significantly due to evaporation in addition to root water uptake rainfall interception loss by tree canopy could also affect soil water distribution it has been demonstrated that the the canopy interception loss can represent 9 36 of gross rainfall in forest stands roth et al 2007 fan et al 2014 b however the interception process in the isolated tree e g in this study may be different this is because rainfall incident angle and spatial variability of throughfall could affect rainfall amount that reaches ground surface underneath canopy of single tree case muzylo et al 2009 in addition wind from open land that blows on leaves and stems can cause water to drip from the leaf and stem surfaces which on the other hand decreases the the influence of rainfall interception from leaves xiao et al 2000 hence for simplicity the canopy interception loss by tree canopy was ignored in this study 3 4 comparison between measured and predicted soil water content fig 7 a and b show the measured and predicted soil water content for the tree covered and grass covered soils respectively in order to highlight soil temperature effects predicted water content without considering soil temperature was also superimposed in the same figure for comparison for both vegetated soils the prediction without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake captured the measurements during the summer period quite well but thereafter soil water content was underestimated by up to 50 the prediction was improved substantially from 27th september 2017 onwards when the soil temperature effects on root water uptake was considered as soil temperature during autumn was much lower than in summer the effects of soil temperature on root water uptake became more significant it was demonstrated that root water uptake can be reduced at low soil temperature as explained earlier this is likely due to increase in soil viscosity and reduction in permeability of the cytoplastic membranes due to lower production of lubricating lipids and new fine roots under low temperature kramer and boyer 1995 the close agreement between the field measurements and numerical simulation is further evidenced in fig 8 when all measured and simulated suction data are compared the discrepancy is no more than 25 when effects of soil temperature on root water uptake was considered on the contrary the discrepancy could be up to 50 when soil temperature effect was ignored the comparison suggests that the model which is derived based soil temperature effects is able to capture the effects of different vegetation type condition on soil water content reasonably well given the presence of in situ soil heterogeneity and natural variability of plants in urban landscape compared with the existing models varado et al 2006 lv et al 2013 the developed model in this study enhanced understanding of soil temperature effects on root water uptake and hence soil water distribution in addition to the mechanisms of root water compensation however it cannot scientifically consider the canopy interception loss of rainfall in single tree case in addition the calculation of et rate during wet canopy conditions should be re evaluated in the future study 4 conclusions this study investigated effects of vegetation on soil temperature and soil moisture an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling was adopted to achieve the objective field monitoring during summer and autumn was conducted in the natural field ground covered with a mature tree and grass respectively bare ground was also tested as reference a simple hydrological model was framed to capture the impact of soil temperature variation on root water uptake the model was verified through the field results with the presence of plant canopy soil temperature in vegetated soils was lower than in the bare soil besides fluctuation magnitude of soil temperature in vegetated soils was much smaller the larger tree lai intercepted more solar radiation and hence induced slightly smaller soil temperature in tree covered soil when compared with the grass covered soil with higher et rate in summer water content in vegetated soils were lower by up to 50 however water content in vegetated soil during autumn could be higher by up to 70 which was due to low soil temperature that induced lower root water uptake ability there was almost no difference of soil water content between tree covered and grass covered soils the simple hydrological model can capture soil water content near ground surface reasonably well without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake there was an overestimation of reduction of soil water content by up to 50 in autumn acknowledgements

6661,presence of vegetation in urban landscape influences soil temperature and soil moisture some studies in literature have focused on development of correlations between the above two parameters for agricultural fields and forest regions these correlations could be dissimilar due to the differences in soil conditions density and type vegetation species and temperature between agricultural and urban landscape this paper investigates the effects of vegetation on soil temperature and soil moisture by an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling a simple hydrological model is developed to capture seasonal variations of surface soil temperature and its effect on root water uptake hypothesis of effects of soil temperature on root water uptake was investigated using field measurements of soil water content field site in urban landscape containing bare grass and tree species were selected for investigation there existed a contrasting trend in water content response between summer and autumn for both bare and vegetated soils due to higher evapotranspiration in summer water content in vegetated soils were lower by up to 50 however water content in vegetated soil was found to be up to 70 higher than in a bare soil during autumn it could be due to the lower soil temperature that inhibits root water uptake ability this was verified using a series of numerical simulations that consider effects of soil temperature on root water uptake without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake there was an overestimation of reduction of soil water content by up to 50 in autumn period keywords plant roots soil temperature soil water content vegetation type urban landscape 1 introduction soil bioengineering using vegetation has become popular in stabilizing soil infrastructures in urban landscape lee et al 2013 leung et al 2015 smethurst et al 2015 besides it is also important for improving the hydrological performance of urban green infrastructures such as sustainable drainage systems for management of surface water runoff gadi et al 2017 vegetation has become one of the most essential construction materials even in developing countries such as china and india where authorities have emphasized extensively on implementation of concept of sponge city rooijen et al 2005 che et al 2015 vegetation could regulate the hydrologic processes in the vadose zone by influencing infiltration rates runoff and evapotranspiration et cubera et al 2004 many studies on the effects of vegetation upon soil water dynamics have conducted connor 2004 chen et al 2007 fan et al 2015a b ng et al 2016a ni et al 2017 it was found that the relationship between vegetation and soil moisture varies with region season and plant type chen et al 2007 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 fan et al 2015a b for example the large difference in soil water distributions exists in adjacent tree forest and grassland biomes jayawickreme et al 2008 in tree covered soils et reduces soil water content via root water uptake and the influence zone can be more than three times root depth ng et al 2016a ni et al 2017 soil moisture is found to be higher at the inter canopy area than the canopy area due to the reinforced effects of rainfall interception and root water uptake fan et al 2015a recent studies found that et induced root water uptake is also a function of soil temperature brady and ray 2008 lv et al 2013 garcia tejera et al 2016 this may in turn affect soil water dynamic soil temperature is an important feature that affects the biological events taking place in soil and directs physical and chemical processes sen and ozturk 2017 the root development of most plants ceases at temperature below 5 c temperature of soil is affected by many factors such as meteorological conditions soil topography soil water content and the surface plant canopy covers paul et al 2004 variations of vegetation cover affect soil temperature responses sensibly oliver et al 1987 scull 2007 song et al 2013 song et al 2013 found that with the increase of vegetation height and density mean daily minimum soil temperature reduces significantly and mean diurnal soil temperature ranges become smaller with the presence of vegetation the solar radiation is partially intercepted or reflected by the canopy hence reducing the radiation absorption of soil and resulting in lower soil and air temperature nearby facelli and pickett 1991 scull 2007 increased soil temperature due to deforestation and excessive cutting can affect soil organism communities briones et al 2009 below ground biological processes including the dynamics of soil organisms plant growth rate and root water uptake jacobs et al 2011 it has been reported that lowering of soil temperature directly or indirectly increases the flow resistance through the soil plant atmosphere continuum schwarz et al 1997 it can increase root resistance ameglio et al 1990 water viscosity and decrease root membrane permeability this in turn reduces the root water uptake kramer and boyer 1995 when temperature increases from 14 to 26 c root water uptake ability is increased by 30 hurd and graves 1985 it has been found by ramos and kaufmann 1979 that root water uptake ability is mainly affected in between temperature range from 5 to 35 c any further increase in soil temperature would inhibit root water uptake due to root browning and lower oxygen availability falah et al 2010 the water uptake by plant roots can be calculated by adding a sink term i e water extraction intensity to richards equation feddes et al 1976 in order to simulate et induced root water uptake many micro and macro root water uptake models were developed gardner 1964 feddes et al 1978 among those models macro root water uptake model which is expressed as a sink term feddes et al 1976 hopmans and bristow 2002 is widely used in the engineering and agricultural fields in the majority of researches on modelling root water take overestimation or underestimation of root water uptake was probably caused by ignoring soil temperature effects there have been limited models that consider effects of soil temperature on soil water content using simplified root water uptake model mellander et al 2006 lv et al 2013 those models only consider soil temperature lower than 20 c therefore the hypothesis of soil temperature effects on root water uptake and hence soil moisture should be further explored by an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling the objective of this paper is to model soil temperature and its effect on root water uptake and soil moisture content during different seasons with readily measurable parameters the hypothesis of soil temperature effects on root water uptake and hence soil moisture was investigated in this study aiming this goal an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling was adopted the field monitoring programme was specifically designed and conducted on an area with a 10 year old tree and grass cover a bare ground was tested for reference numerical modelling of root water uptake with and without considering effects of soil temperature was performed based on field data computed soil moisture with and without consideration of soil temperature was compared with that of field measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 field monitoring of tree covered grass covered and bare soils 2 1 1 test site and climate condition the field monitoring was carried out in an urban landscape campus of shantou university guangdong china the test site consisted of tree covered flat ground fig 1 a grass covered ground fig 1 b and bare flat ground for reference fig 1 c each ground had an area of 8 m 8 m the distance among these three areas was around 10 m the groundwater table was identified at 3 m depth from the surface of the flat ground during the entire monitoring period which started from 16th july 2017 to 26th november 2017 around 130 days for the ease of comparison and interpretation the whole period was divided into two periods namely summer period from 16th july 2017 to 26th september 2017 and autumn period from 27th september 2017 to 26 november 2017 during the two monitoring periods the climate data air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and rainfall intensity was measured by an automatic weather station manufactured by davis instruments ltd model vantage pro 2 fig 2 shows the measured results relative humidity rh varied from 53 to 96 the air temperature near ground surface was generally high during the summer period while decreased gradually to 16 c during autumn on the other hand solar radiation fluctuated significantly from 1 5 to 26 5 mj m2 the low values corresponded to cloudy days when rainfall occurred the average wind speed was about 3 m s the maximum rainfall amount received during the monitoring period was 115 mm d on 27th august 2017 2 1 2 soil properties soil core samples 76 mm in diameter and 100 mm in height were collected at selected locations of the three testing sites i e tree grass and bare for determining their basic properties four core samples at different depths 35 70 100 and 150 cm of each location were collected to determine grain size distribution liquid limit and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks all soil cores were sampled using a cylindrical cutter which was penetrated vertically into the ground ni et al 2017 the particle data were obtained from a sieve analysis described in astm d422 standard astm 2007 liquid limit test was conducted in accordance with astm d4318 astm 2010a the ks was measured using a flexible wall permeameter according to astm d5084 astm 2010b following the principle of falling head method when measuring ks each soil specimen was saturated with de aired water in a permeameter with flexible wall a water head of 100 mm was applied at the upper hydraulic boundary of each sample resulting in a total head of 200 mm then ks of each specimen was determined by darcy s law ni et al 2017 in addition soil water retention curves were measured using a pressure plate apparatus with an air entry pressure of 500 kpa ng and pang 2000 the axis translation technique was applied in the measurement the average contents of gravel sand and fine particles silt and clay were 3 90 and 7 respectively for the tree covered soil 4 91 5 respectively for the grassed soil and 2 90 and 8 respectively for bare soil the liquid limit of tree covered soil grassed soil and bare soil were measured to be 27 6 4 26 9 3 2 and 28 8 4 5 respectively based on the particle size distribution and the liquid limit the field soils for both vegetated and bare were classified as well graded sand sw according to the unified soil classification system uscs astm 2010c the ks for tree covered grassed and bare soils were measured to be 4 8 0 72 10 4 m s 3 8 0 55 10 4 m s and 4 0 0 51 10 4 m s respectively in order to check the statistical differences of ks among three ground covers one way anova analysis was conducted it was found that there were no significant differences of ks among three ground covers p value 0 178 greater than 0 05 saturated and residual volumetric water content of the soils under three land covers were 30 and 10 respectively the measured soil water retention curve was fitted by van genuchten 1980 equation a related to air entry value and n related to the shape of each water retention curve were determined to be 2 80 and 1 38 respectively in addition differences of measured ionic concentration between vegetated and bare soils were measured to be 2 2 1 3 tested plant species in the field study a tree species ficus microcarpa also known as chinese banyan fig 1 and a grass species cynodon dactylon also known as bermuda grass were used for field testing the tree species is widely distributed as an ornamental plant and is one of the most common street trees in warm climates the tree age was around 10 year old suggesting that it is at mature stage the diameter of the tree canopy was measured to be 8 m the grass species is commonly found in many parts of asia and has high drought tolerance it is ecologically suitable for slope rehabilitation and urban landscape greening in warm climates of the worlds leaf area index lai is defined as the total projected area of leaves on the unit ground surface by taking images with high resolution camera using uav dj ltd the projected leaf area can be digitalized and calculated then lai was determined by dividing the area of leaves over the projected canopy area chen et al 1997 ng et al 2016b on the other hand root depth was determined via core sampling method at three different locations for each ground case ni et al 2017 after the soil cores at different depths were sampled by a cylindrical cutter each core was placed in a washing chamber and the soil was dispersed by a hydrovortex that was produced by pressurized jets of water ni et al 2017 hence the presence of roots can be checked finally the root depth was determined as the maximum soil depth beyond which no root can be observed from the collected soil core samples fig 3 shows the measured lai and root depth from 16th july 2017 to 26th november 2017 lais of tree and grass decreased by 10 and 28 respectively when it changed from summer to autumn period the observed change in tree lai is similar to that of mature trees such as quercus rotundifolia and quercus fagineain as observed in field study by mediavilla and escudero 2004 grass root increased by 25 whereas there was almost no change in tree root depth based on the measured results it can be reasonably assumed in the numerical model that plant lai and root depth changed linearly during the monitoring period 2 1 4 test setup instrumentation and test procedures fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of test setup and instrumentation plan of the field monitoring for each testing ground in the tree covered ground fig 1 a four pairs of soil temperature moisture sensors stmss sm300 from delta t device ltd were installed at depth of 100 mm in a straight line from the tree trunk the horizontal distance between stmss and tree stem were 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m consecutively in both the bare and grass covered grounds fig 1 b and c three pairs of stms were installed at depths of 100 mm at selected locations in order to avoid any interference between sensors spacing between each sensor was maintained at 4 m all the sensors were installed on 10th july 2017 before the field monitoring before installing the sensors holes with diameter larger than the sensor body was excavated until the desired depths the two stainless steel rods of each sensor were inserted into the soil at the bottom of each hole until they fully contacted with the surrounding soils after connecting the sensors to the data logger the holes were then repacked with soils the refilling and re compaction processes were conducted carefully to minimize excessive disturbance to the surrounding soils and any electronic components shao et al 2018 this could ensure the accuracy of the installed sensors during the two monitoring periods summer and autumn soil moisture and soil temperature were measured continuously 2 1 5 statistical analysis significant differences of measured results i e soil temperature and water content were assessed with one way anova analysis followed by post hoc fisher s least significant difference test there were 4 replicated measurements for tree covered ground and 3 replicated measurements for both bare and grass covered grounds results were considered statistically significant when p value 0 05 in order to indicate statistical significance of differences among groups different letters i e a b and c were used this means that when the two groups e g soil water content in bare and tree or grass covered soils have the same letter they have no statistical differences on the contrary the groups are significantly different statistically when they have different letters 2 2 numerical modelling in order to assess the effects of soil temperature on root water uptake and hence soil water content the root water uptake model developed by varado et al 2006 was further modified to incorporate the effects of soil temperature besides surface soil temperature was empirically fitted by using easily measured variables air temperature and plant lai plant lai and root depths changed linearly from 16th july 2017 to 26 november 2017 fig 3 computed soil water contents with i considering soil temperature effects and ii not considering soil temperature effects were compared with field data 2 2 1 plant et by using the measured meteorological parameters fig 2 the potential transpiration pt mm maximum amount of water that plants could extract water from the soil feddes et al 1978 of each plant species tree

of a vegetated cover could be estimated by the sum of pt i and pe 2 2 2 soil water balance considering effects of soil temperature on root water uptake considering one dimensional 1 d transient seepage in vegetated soil the conservation of water mass may be described by the following modified darcy richards equation 4 d θ h dt d dz k h dh dz 1 s i h z where θ is the volumetric water content vwc t is the elapsed time s z is the vertical co ordinate m h is the water pressure head m k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity function m s as a function of h or matric suction s h γ w where γ w is the unit weight of water kn m3 and s i h z is the sink term which represents the volume of water transpired by plant i over the entire root zone for a given time interval feddes et al 1976 in order to consider effects of soil temperature on root water uptake a temperature dependent reduction function f z was incorporated in the sink term mathematically sink term s i h that considers hydraulic redistribution proposed by varado et al 2006 can be modified into 5 s i h z f z α h z g i z d i α h z g i z d z p t i where d i is the root depth of plant i m g i is considered to be the distribution of root length density the potential transpiration rate p t i is distributed across the root zone based on a temperature dependent reduction function f z and a weighted stress index α h z g i z d i α h z g i z d z this weighted stress index which incorporates root compensation mechanism is a function of coupled root distribution and soil water availability at different depths li et al 2001 varado et al 2006 in the modelling an exponential function was defined for the investigated tree and grass species pt i was calculated from eq 1 and α h z is the so called transpiration reduction function feddes et al 2001 which can be expressed as 6 α h z 0 h h wp h h wp h fc h wp h wp h h fc 1 h h fc where h wp and h fc are the water pressure head m corresponding to the permanent wilting point and field capacity respectively physically eqs 5 and 6 mean that for any h higher than h fc the ability of root water uptake is maximum as the soil dries and h reaches between h fc and h wp the ability of root water uptake decreases linearly with a decrease in h plant wilts and stops extracting water when soil is too dry to have reached a h lower than h wp it is known that root water uptake is mainly affected when soil temperatures are between 5 and 35 c ramos and kaufmann 1979 in order to capture this effect temperature dependent reduction function mellander et al 2006 was introduced in the root water uptake model as follows 7 f z 1 e x p t 1 t s z t 3 t 2 t s z t 3 c 0 t s z t 3 c where t 1 and t 2 are 0 0032 and 2 4 respectively and t 3 equals to 3 c t s z is the soil temperature at the depth z soil surface temperature can be calculated using the observed air temperature lai and the canopy cover of weeds understorey paul et al 2004 in this study effects of vegetation cover on surface soil temperature was modelled based on the equation proposed by paul et al 2004 8 t s 0 t a e x p m l a i where t a is air temperature c t s 0 is soil temperature near ground surface c m is an empirical factor by back analyzing the correlations between air temperature soil temperature at depth 100 mm and lai m was calibrated to be 0 02 in this study it should be noted that this empirical equation was only applicable for the surface soil layers soil temperature decreased exponentially with depth lv et al 2013 as the measured temperature of underground water at 3 m depth remained almost constant between 15 and 17 c soil temperature distribution within the vadose zone above ground water table can be expressed as 9 t s z t s 0 t w e x p z t w where t w is the temperature of underground water which is set to be 16 c in this study 2 2 3 model implementation the mathematical models were numerically solved by an author developed script under python 2 7 programming environment the darcy richards equation was solved by an implicit finite difference method van dam and feddes 2000 simunek et al 2005 the picard iteration technique was used for each time step for ensuring numerical accuracy and computational efficiency during the computation the tolerable errors of water content were specified with 0 0001 and the time step was adapted in a range of 0 02 5 min ni et al 2018 a uniform computational grid of 0 01 m was used to discretize the soil of 3 m depth parameters used for calculating pet were listed in table 1 in all the cases actual evaporation ae from the bare soil surface is considered to be equal to pe obtained from eq 2 assumption is reasonable because the amount of suction investigated in this study was not higher than 3000 kpa which is the threshold value beyond which ae drops below pe wilson et al 1997 the threshold suction is the one measured in the soil surfaces where evaporation takes place wilson et al 1997 this threshold value is independent of soil texture and drying time wilson et al 1997 and has been widely used by researchers in different fields simms and yanful 2001 gaj et al 2016 song et al 2018 the initial water content distribution was obtained by the interpolation of the field measurement of soil water content right before 16th july 2017 when root depth was determined via core sampling method the water contents of soil cores at different depths were measured via oven drying method and the results are shown in table 2 a flux boundary that represents rainfall infiltration during the monitoring period was specified at the top boundary following the recorded rainfall data in fig 2 at each time step when the rainfall intensity was lower than the ks of soil the flux boundary would be equal to the rainfall intensity on the contrary when the rainfall intensity was higher the flux boundary applied would be switched to a pressure boundary with a pressure head of 1 mm ni et al 2018 a static water table i e 3 m depth was applied at the bottom of the model to mimic the field condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential evapotranspiration fig 4 shows the pe and pet for bare and vegetated grounds respectively pe and pet fluctuated consecutively with the lowest values during the cloudy days when rainfall events occurred during the monitored period pet of vegetated soils was consistently higher than pe of bare soil the differences were much more significant during summer period when air temperature and solar radiation were relatively higher fig 2 this is because high temperature and solar radiation would facilitate plant photosynthesis and increase water uptake from soil besides pet for tree covered soil was consistently higher than grass pet as shown in fig 3 tree lai i e 7 6 8 4 was higher than grass lai i e 3 0 4 2 by more than two times according to beer lambert law ritchie 1972 intercepted solar radiation by plant canopy depends on lai and incoming solar radiation higher tree lai would result in more solar radiation intercepted and hence higher pet the positive correlations were also observed by ng et al 2016b who investigated schefflera heptaphylla in silty sand for non crop species such as ficus microcarpa and cynodon dactylon the extinction coefficient in beer lambert law should be lower than crop species as the leaves of investigated species inclined more vertically than crop species ng et al 2016b 3 2 measured soil temperature in different vegetated soils fig 5 shows the variations of daily soil temperature at depth of 100 mm with time for both summer and autumn periods air temperature was superimposed in the figure for comparison with the fluctuation of air temperature soil temperature varied correspondingly throughout the monitoring period soil temperature was higher during dry periods compared with the wet periods this is because specific heat of dry soil is less than the wet soil hence there existed faster heat exchange between air and soil interface and rapid increase in soil temperature in the dry soil mann and schmidt 2003 soil temperature in the shallow bare soil seems to be consistent with the air temperature however soil temperature in the tree covered ground was consistently smaller than air temperature and that in the bare ground p vaue 0 02 table 3 the difference can be up to 25 besides due to the presence of tree canopy fluctuation of soil temperature in the tree covered soil 18 5 31 1 c was smaller than the bare soil 19 38 7 c compared with tree covered soil temperature in the grass covered soil was slightly higher especially during summer this is probably due to the larger tree lai i e 7 6 8 4 and hence less solar radiation reaching ground surface 3 3 measured soil water content in different vegetated soils fig 6 shows the variation of measured volumetric water content with time soil water content decreased during the dry down period and increased during rainfall for both vegetated and bare soils during summer water content in vegetated soils decreased much faster regardless of the vegetation types i e grass and tree p vaue 0 03 table 4 the lowest water content in the vegetated soil after drying was found to be 50 lower that the bare soil 11th august the observed greater reduction in soil water content in vegetated soil was attributed to the higher pet fig 4 there seems to be no major differences in water content between tree and grass covers see fig 6 and table 4 that means even though tree pet was higher than grass fig 4 measured water content could still be similar between two cases at shallow depth of 100 mm interestingly variations of soil water content during autumn period was significantly different from the summer fig 6 in autumn water content in vegetated soil was higher than in bare soil p vaue 0 05 table 4 the difference can be up to 70 this was contradictory to the results in summer and found in literature simon and collison 2002 smethurst et al 2015 ni et al 2017 in their studies it was found that water content in the vegetated ground was lower than that in the bare ground due to root water uptake there could be two possible mechanisms behind this observation firstly low soil temperature would increase the water flow resistance through the soil plant atmosphere continuum schwarz et al 1997 due to the increase in water viscosity and a decrease in membrane permeability at low temperature root resistance increases and hence root water uptake is reduced lv et al 2013 the second mechanism is called hydraulic redistribution which means passive transfer of water from moister to drier area of the soil profile via roots burgess and bleby 2006 domec et al 2010 plant roots would compensate the drier area within the shallow depth by transferring water from moister areas through increasing water uptake by roots in moister areas meinzer et al 2004 amenu and kumar 2007 however in the bare soil the above two mechanisms are not valid and water content in shallower depth was lowered significantly due to evaporation in addition to root water uptake rainfall interception loss by tree canopy could also affect soil water distribution it has been demonstrated that the the canopy interception loss can represent 9 36 of gross rainfall in forest stands roth et al 2007 fan et al 2014 b however the interception process in the isolated tree e g in this study may be different this is because rainfall incident angle and spatial variability of throughfall could affect rainfall amount that reaches ground surface underneath canopy of single tree case muzylo et al 2009 in addition wind from open land that blows on leaves and stems can cause water to drip from the leaf and stem surfaces which on the other hand decreases the the influence of rainfall interception from leaves xiao et al 2000 hence for simplicity the canopy interception loss by tree canopy was ignored in this study 3 4 comparison between measured and predicted soil water content fig 7 a and b show the measured and predicted soil water content for the tree covered and grass covered soils respectively in order to highlight soil temperature effects predicted water content without considering soil temperature was also superimposed in the same figure for comparison for both vegetated soils the prediction without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake captured the measurements during the summer period quite well but thereafter soil water content was underestimated by up to 50 the prediction was improved substantially from 27th september 2017 onwards when the soil temperature effects on root water uptake was considered as soil temperature during autumn was much lower than in summer the effects of soil temperature on root water uptake became more significant it was demonstrated that root water uptake can be reduced at low soil temperature as explained earlier this is likely due to increase in soil viscosity and reduction in permeability of the cytoplastic membranes due to lower production of lubricating lipids and new fine roots under low temperature kramer and boyer 1995 the close agreement between the field measurements and numerical simulation is further evidenced in fig 8 when all measured and simulated suction data are compared the discrepancy is no more than 25 when effects of soil temperature on root water uptake was considered on the contrary the discrepancy could be up to 50 when soil temperature effect was ignored the comparison suggests that the model which is derived based soil temperature effects is able to capture the effects of different vegetation type condition on soil water content reasonably well given the presence of in situ soil heterogeneity and natural variability of plants in urban landscape compared with the existing models varado et al 2006 lv et al 2013 the developed model in this study enhanced understanding of soil temperature effects on root water uptake and hence soil water distribution in addition to the mechanisms of root water compensation however it cannot scientifically consider the canopy interception loss of rainfall in single tree case in addition the calculation of et rate during wet canopy conditions should be re evaluated in the future study 4 conclusions this study investigated effects of vegetation on soil temperature and soil moisture an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling was adopted to achieve the objective field monitoring during summer and autumn was conducted in the natural field ground covered with a mature tree and grass respectively bare ground was also tested as reference a simple hydrological model was framed to capture the impact of soil temperature variation on root water uptake the model was verified through the field results with the presence of plant canopy soil temperature in vegetated soils was lower than in the bare soil besides fluctuation magnitude of soil temperature in vegetated soils was much smaller the larger tree lai intercepted more solar radiation and hence induced slightly smaller soil temperature in tree covered soil when compared with the grass covered soil with higher et rate in summer water content in vegetated soils were lower by up to 50 however water content in vegetated soil during autumn could be higher by up to 70 which was due to low soil temperature that induced lower root water uptake ability there was almost no difference of soil water content between tree covered and grass covered soils the simple hydrological model can capture soil water content near ground surface reasonably well without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake there was an overestimation of reduction of soil water content by up to 50 in autumn acknowledgements

6662,this study unravels the controlling factors of concentration discharge c q relations and solute export regimes of spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters radium and 222rn a simplified analytical solution is derived to quantify radium based mean transient time mtt based on radium disequilibrium key hydrogeological and lithological parameters such as retardation factor r f ra and mtt of radium nuclides and effective surface areas se of subsurface are therefore quantified based on the long term monitoring records and discussed with the c q relation and solute export regimes the study leads to the findings 1 the spring water is characterized by very short mtt days to weeks lower mtt higher effective surface areas and r f ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons 2 the slow mass transfer between immobile and mobile phases controls the solute exports of cl na k ca2 and mg2 export regimes of theses solutes are negligibly influenced by dynamics of se and retardation processes 3 lower mtt higher se and activation of no3 and so4 2 lead to higher concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in wet seasons and vice versa in dry seasons 4 so4 2 export is additionally influenced by co precipitation of sulphate precipitates hco3 is controlled by dynamics of co2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table this study demonstrates that the disequilibrium of radium transport in the fractured aquifer can be deployed to investigate the metrics of the critical zone and the solute export regimes of a springshed keywords radionuclide reactive transport model c q relation critical zone mean transit time effective surface areas solute export regime 1 introduction in the past 10 years the critical zone cz which is the thin and living skin of earth ranging vertically from the top of canopies down to the saturated bedrocks has gained considerable attention due to its vital role in environmental ecological and human services such as water storage and discharge nutrient cycling ecosystem maintenance and climate regulations brooks et al 2015 fan 2015 fan et al 2013 field et al 2015 grant and dietrich 2017 mcintosh et al 2017 concentration discharge c q relation and mean transit time mtt have become a major research topic in hydrological and biogeochemical studies of the cz mcdonnell and beven 2014 pfister and kirchner 2017 mtt is defined as the time that water parcels spend between the time they enter the unsaturated zone and the time they flow out of the aquifer system mcdonnell et al 2010 mcguire et al 2005 the lateral and vertical heterogeneity of cz structure controls the key hydrological and hydrological features such as water storage mtt and flow path of groundwater and solutes and thereafter leads to variability of fluxes of water constituents and energy through the cz ameli et al 2017 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 the ease of high frequency sampling in surface water bodies and the readily and cheap measurements of geochemical parameters allow researchers to unravel the relation between hydrological and geochemical processes in the cz over different time scales anderson et al 1997 godsey et al 2009 kim et al 2014 2017 kirchner and neal 2013 liu et al 2017a maher and chamberlain 2014 the c q relation integrating water and reaction processes dictated by land cover topography and subsurface structure is a fundamental description of spatiotemporal feedbacks between hydrological geochemical hydrogeological and biological processes in the cz from hillslope to landscape scales brooks et al 2015 evans and davies 1998 li et al 2017a b lots of previous studies have illustrated that c q relation follows a power law distribution of c a q b anderson et al 1997 evans and davies 1998 godsey et al 2009 rue et al 2017 when concentrations are almost constant over discharge rates the solute export regime is called chemostasis with b value in a narrow range of 0 2 the phenomenon is observed for a large number of studies on geogenic solutes a chemodynamic regime is present when concentration variance is high compared to discharge variance this can be the cases for both dilution and enrichment this can be also the case that flow and concentration are decoupled and hardly correlated in the latter case the c q slope b does not give information if an export regime is chemodynamic thompson et al 2011 when concentrations are in inversely correlated with discharge rates the export regime is termed as dilution with b value less than 0 2 the dilution regime is also common for some solutes such as cl and nitrate particularly in urban environments when concentrations are positively correlated with discharge rates the export regime is named enrichment or accretion with b value larger than 0 2 chorover et al 2017 godsey et al 2009 li et al 2017a shanley et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 the mechanisms for chemostatic c q relations can be ascribed to the mixing effects from newly rainfall water soil water shallow groundwater and deep older groundwater evans and davies 1998 long residence time derived from dispersion in catchment kirchner et al 2000 vertical heterogeneity of cz structures godsey et al 2009 weathering processes and rock fluid interaction maher 2010 2011 cation exchanges in the hyporheic zones or in the aquifer during the precipitation events herndon et al 2015 in addition to most event based c q studies researchers also make effects to examine c q relations over the monthly seasonal inter annual scales revealing that the c q relation and solute export regimes can be shaped by land use climate and soil dupas et al 2015 2016 2017 solutes export regime of a catchment is also highly influential to mtt which can be further used to implement first order chemical kinetics such as the weathering process in the cz of a catchment high mtt in groundwater normally results in relatively higher concentration of weathering elements due to accumulative dissolution of weathering benettin et al 2015a maher 2010 2011 mcintosh et al 2017 moreover solute compositions in stream waters can be dependent on travel time distribution ttds and storage selection functions sas which are the probability density function of the ages of the water parcels discharged from a catchment hillslope at a given time botter 2012 and the way that catchment storage supplies the outflows with water of different ages rinaldo et al 2015 respectively high frequency observed data of hydrological and climatological parameters such as discharge rates groundwater level and evapotranspiration and conservative tracers such as cl and stable δ2h and δ18o isotopes can be used to quantify mtt ttds and sas over different watershed scales benettin et al 2015a b 2017 botter 2012 mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 2010 yang et al 2018 over a global scale stream water contains substantial portion of young water less than 3 months and has hydrologic connectivity to the very thin veneer of global groundwater storage it is concluded that the young water with shorter mtt time scales will convey pollutants into the surface water bodies rapidly berghuijs and kirchner 2017 gleeson et al 2015 jasechko et al 2016 kirchner 2016a b however recent studies have highlighted the limitation of these conservative tracer based methods the main limitation is that these approaches do not account for the temporal dynamics of water flow path and temporal variation of mtt and ttds botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2015 thus a non stationary scenario should be considered to better understand hydrological and biogeochemical processes within the cz and their impact on c q relation benettin et al 2017 botter et al 2011 klaus et al 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 also these statistic or mathematical models can be used to obtain the mtt ttds and identify the sas based on high frequency climatological data and conservative tracers but offer little information of inherent processes or critical zone structures and their impacts on the solute export regimes moreover despite numerous pioneering studies to investigate the controlling factors of c q relation in the stream and river systems there have been limited studies to explore the mechanisms on how mtt and hillslope subsurface physical structures control c q relations and rather rare studies make the connections between mtt a major hydrology metric and the c q relation a major biogeochemical metric kim et al 2014 2017 mcintosh et al 2017 differed from c q relation in stream water which has the concentration highly influenced by river riparian zones and or stream bed hyporheic zones c q relation from spring discharge in first order headwater catchment can provide direct information of how the cz regulates the c q export regime under the hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics headwater catchments are the basic units forming up drainage basins and hotpots for series of biogeochemical processes such as nutrient export retention and carbon loss alexander et al 2000 kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 rosemond et al 2015 therefore there is a call for further studies to fully mount mtt intrinsic processes of cz such as adsorption desorption dissolution weathering and cz structure parameters such as effective surface area on c q relation and solute export regimes in recently recharged spring water in headwater catchments kim et al 2017 maher and chamberlain 2014 rempe and dietrich 2014 west 2012 winnick et al 2017 in this study radium and 222rn activities of spring water discharged from a headwater catchment are continuously monitored to quantify the cz structure parameters and therefore to decipher the controlling factors of c q relations and solute export regimes this study aims to answer the following questions 1 how the c q relation depends on radium based mtt 2 how the effective surface area influences the solute export regimes 3 which is the dominant factor controlling the export regimes of conservative geogenic and biogenic solutes 2 theory of radium and 222rn reactive transport in groundwater system nuclides of uranium thorium u th series can provide constraints of sediment weathering rates water mtt and preferential flow and solute adsorption and desorption dynamics within the subsurface and be used to quantify the transport of suspended particular matter in rivers and streams ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 ma et al 2010 2013 porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2000 among u th series radium nuclides 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra and 222rn have much high activities in the groundwater systems compared to thorium and uranium nuclides and can be detected inexpensively and sophisticatedly with advanced detection approaches burnett et al 2001 kim et al 2001 lee and kim 2006 moore and arnold 1996 porcelli 2008 therefore lots of mathematical and field studies have been conducted to investigate radium and 222rn transport and their behaviors in different aquatic environments in the past decades charette et al 2008 frei and gilfedder 2015 krishnaswami et al 1991 ku and luo 1992 luo et al 2000 2018a tricca et al 2001 in the fresh groundwater system radium isotopes have high affinity to the aquifer grains and predominately controlled by the adsorption or retardation and have relatively short mtt krishnaswami et al 1982 ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 in the saline and brine groundwater system radium nuclides have much less affinity to the solid phase kadko and moore 1988 krishnaswami et al 1991 luo et al 2000 rama and moore 1984 high activities and mobility and relatively conservative behavior during transport in saline groundwater system make radium isotopes good tracers to study chemical reaction and transport in saline environments charette et al 2003 moore 1999 and to quantify submarine groundwater discharge in coastal areas burnett et al 2006 charette et al 2008 moore 1996 222rn is highly concentrated 102 105 dpm l 1 in groundwater due to continuous supply of α recoil by 226ra in the solid phase dimova et al 2012 luo et al 2000 rama and moore 1984 wood et al 2004 zhuo et al 2001 therefore 222rn also provides signatures of groundwater input and is employed to investigate groundwater surface water interactions and to quantify groundwater discharge in estuaries watershed and lakes cable et al 1996a b dimova and burnett 2011 gleeson et al 2009 luo et al 2016 2018b tse and jiao 2008 radium nuclides and 222rn are endogenous and subject to the parameters such as mtt effective surface areas and processes of adsorption desorption and dissolution weathering low 1996 martin and akber 1999 przylibski 2000 roba et al 2012 sturchio et al 2001 therefore these nuclides are ideal tracers to investigate the inherent controlling factors of the c q relation and solute export regimes of cz in headwater catchments radionuclide transport in slowly refreshed groundwater system such as watershed deep aquifers and coastal saline groundwater environments have been rather intensively investigated gleeson et al 2013 kiro et al 2012 luo et al 2000 swarzenski et al 2001 there are limited studies mounting radium isotopes and 222rn transport on the studies of c q relations and solute export regimes in rapidly refreshed groundwater system such as aquifers consisting of well decomposed rock or fractured rock with spring emergences of headwater catchment radium radon disequilibrium in the recently recharged groundwater system can be deployed to obtain the radium based mtt τ w which is considered to be a metric for the groundwater rock interactions especially for the weathering processes the radium based mtt is proposed in this study which represents the time when radium is generated in the grains inside the system goes through reactions such as adsorption desorption and decay and finally reaches the spring outlet the combination of radium radon disequilibrium can be also used to derive the parameters such as effective surface areas se as described in details in the supplementary information the analytical solutions of radium isotopes 228th and 222rn transport in groundwater can be expressed as 1 a 226 ra p r 226 ra r f 230 th a 230 th r f ra f p λ 226 ra 1 e r f ra f p λ 226 ra τ w λ 226 2 a 228 ra p r 228 ra r f 232 tha 232 th r f ra 1 e λ 228

the retardation factors of radium isotopes 228th λ 226 ra λ 228 ra λ 224 ra λ 228 th and λ 222 rn d 1 are the decay constants of 226ra 228ra 224ra 228th and 222rn respectively τ w d 1 is the radium based mtt and p r 226 ra p r 228 ra p r 224 ra and p r 222 rn atoms l 1 min 1 are the recoil rates of 26ra 228ra 224ra and 222rn respectively under secular equilibrium in the aquifer grains or bedrocks p r 226 ra equals p r 222 rn and p r 228 ra equals p r 224 ra as fully described in the supplementary information eqs 15 characterize the radium nuclides 228th and 222rn distributions along the flow path within a fresh groundwater system r f τ w p r can be potentially quantified by solving these equations based on some approximations according to the lithologic and regolith settings of specific study sites tricca et al 2000 indicated that the length scales for these nuclide to reach the steady state are within meters for 222rn 224ra and 228th due to their short half lives and extremely high affinity to the aquifer grains or planar surface of fractured bedrocks thus 222rn 224ra and 228th have reached steady state in mostly groundwater systems therefore eqs 15 can be reduced to 6 a 224 ra p r ra r f 228 th a 228 th r f ra 7 a 228 th a f 228 ra r f ra r f ra 8 a 222 rn p r 222 rn a f 226 ra r f ra as aforementioned the ratio of α recoil rate for u series to that of th series equals the activities ratio of 238u 232th in secular equilibrium within the solid pool gill et al 1992 therefore there is p r 222 rn p r ra a 238 u a 232 th thus α recoil ratio of 222rn to 224 228ra are subject to the ars of 238u and 232th in the rocks which is considered to a constant hereafter referred to as cr over geologic time scale for the aquifer skeleton rock of a specific study area substituting cr into eqs 68 and solving these equations yield the solutions of rf and pr in terms of radium and 222rn activities in groundwater 9 r f ra a 222 rn a 224 ra a 226 ra c r a 228 ra 10

228th and 222rn the parameters of retardation factor and α recoil rate can be estimated based on the activities of 222rn 224ra 226ra and 228ra in groundwater in most cases 226ra and 228ra are considered to be under steady state in fresh groundwater environment due to their high affinity to the aquifer grain or large retardation rates however there are also the situations that 226ra and 228ra have not reached the steady state along the flow path these scenarios are especially existential in the newly recharge groundwater within very small first order headwater catchments or sprinsheds davidson and dickson 1986 luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 thus there is disequilibrium between long lived radium isotopes and short lived radium isotopes under this situation the unsteady states of 226ra and 228ra can provide the constraint to quantify mtt as shown in eqs 1 2 the unsteady states of 226ra and 228ra can serve as an ideal metric in the studies of mtt in newly recharge and rapid discharge system such the headwater streams seeps and springs being the function of the compositions of parent isotopes in the aquifer grains and effective surface areas p r 222 rn is usually employed to deduce some physical parameters of subsurface structures such as effective surface areas and pore sizes of aquifer materials andrews et al 1989 hammond et al 1988 kigoshi 1971 ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 effective surface area se in this study is defined as mineral surface area bathed in far from equilibrium and is therefore effective dissolving as fully described in previous studies li et al 2014 salehikhoo and li 2015 in this study p r 222 rn is used to quantify effective surface area of aquifer grains with the following equation andrews et al 1989 ku et al 2009 luo et al 2000 12 2 s e 2 a s 238 u r ρ s ε r p r 222 rn where a s 238 u is the activity of 238u in the bedrock r is the recoil radius ε r is the recoil efficiency of 222rn s e cm2 l 1 is the effective surface areas of the bedrock 3 methods 3 1 hydrogeological and topographic setting a spring emerged in a small sub basin of dragon mountain hong kong was continuous monitored to study the solute export regimes and c q relations based on radium isotopes and 222rn fig 2 the spring was entirely natural but for the convenience of water collection local residents pasted the slope surface with cement and then installed two steel pipes into the spring vent which led to two spring outlets about 10 cm apart the small catchment of the spring is shown in fig 2b the bedrock of springshed is volcanic rocks with a soil and weathering layers in shallow zone gco 1997 the lithology is dominated by coarse ash crystal tuff with significant volume of fine ash vitric tuff mineral compositions generally change from dominantly rhyolite through dacite rhyolite to trachydacite rhyolite with decreasing age the volcanic rocks have predominant sio2 contents of 68 06 in weight the other major components of al2o2 fe2o3 k2o na2o mgo and cao have weight ratios of 15 63 3 13 6 20 3 45 0 48 and 1 74 respectively the uranium and thorium concentrations in the volcanic rocks have ranges of 2 9 ppm and 6 43 ppm respectively ruxton 1957 sewell and campbell 1997 the weathering process is dominated by silicate weathering with negligible carbonate weathering the soil profile of the springshed is dominated by three zones of a to c as shown in fig 2c a colluviums and regolith layer with a depth of less than 1 m at the low relief areas and up to 10 m at the upland hydrological processes influencing this zone include infiltration evapotranspiration vertical flow and lateral subsurface flow water component in this zone is mainly newly event waters including shallow groundwater and soil water gco 1997 b completely to moderately decomposed zone this zone is saturated with young groundwater recharged by event water groundwater in this zone maintains the base flow and spring discharge during the wet seasons jiao et al 2005 leung et al 2005 c slightly decomposed to fresh bedrock zone which serves as the reservoir of old groundwater that maintains baseflow and spring discharge during the dry seasons jiao et al 2006 groundwater flow and storage within this zone are considered to be limited jiao et al 2005 2006 leung and jiao 2008 the steep slopes of the catchment provide high hydraulic gradients that could lead to the development of soil pipes from naturally occurring voids and preferred flow path nash and dale 1984 thus the spring may have been developed as a result of the combining effect of the topographic depression fracture network and soil pipes the terrain analysis of the catchment around the spring fig 2b was conducted with high resolution lidar data the catchment has an area of 11471 m2 a median slope of 65 9 c and a mean elevation of 224 m 173 282 m the longest flow path from the divide to the lowest catchment boundary is 253 m 3 2 field work and analysis sampling activities were conducted biweekly monthly from mar 2011 to oct 2012 parameters of spring discharge water and air temperatures and electricity conductivities were measured in situ fig 2d precipitation record was obtained from the weather station installed at the victoria peak by hong kong observatory which is 1 5 km away from the spring site 50 ml water was taken into nalgene bottles for major ions analysis a silicon tube was inserted into the spring outlets to collect un aerial spring water into the bottom of a 250 ml glass vials until overflowed for 222rn analysis major ion samples were filtered with 0 2 μm filters and analyzed by dionex ics 1100 thermo co 222rn samples were measured with rad h2o durridge co immediately after sampling to avoid significant decay loss 5 l of water samples were filtered with 0 47 mm filters waterman driven by vacuum pump and passed through mno2 fibers to extract dissolved radium isotopes in the laboratory 224ra measurement was conducted immediately after the extraction with radium delayed coincidence counting radecc to avoid significant decay loss 223ra was measured about 1 2 weeks after the sampling to avoid the interference of 224ra by radecc radium samples was stored for over a month and a third measurement was conducted to detect 228th and correct for 224ra 226ra was measured based on its secular equilibrium with 222rn after over 3 week storage of the samples in sealed columns 228ra was measured based on the ingrowth of 224ra after storing the radium fibers over 1 year the measurement processes of radium isotopes are fully described in previous studies by the authors lee et al 2012 luo and jiao 2016 luo et al 2014 2016 2017 the uncertainties for the measurement of 223ra 224ra 228ra and 228th are estimated to be 12 7 7 and 7 and the uncertainties of 226ra measurements to be 10 15 based on calculation approaches in previous studies garcia solsona et al 2008 moore 2008 moore and cai 2013 since water of the two outlets is originated from one spring and the sampling frequency mostly 1 3 times per month the physicochemical parameters major ions and radioactive isotopes of water samples from the two outlets are discharge weighted as an entirety based on the discharge rates of the two outlets and further monthly averaged for better paired analysis of these parameters discharge weighted average monthly spring water concentrations were calculated based on the formulas in previous studies hunsaker and johnson 2017 williams and melack 1997 4 results the discharge weighted and monthly averaged distributions of monitored parameters are shown in data s1 and fig 3 overall spring discharge shows typical seasonal cycles over a hydrological year lowering to 25 9 ml s 1 during the dry seasons and raising to 132 7 ml s 1 during the wet seasons spring discharge is well in phase with rainfall and no obvious hysteresis was observed between rainfall and spring discharge rate cation concentrations of na k mg2 and ca2 range from 7 5 to 9 7 2 7 to 3 8 0 40 to 0 63 and 0 56 to 0 76 mg l 1 with an average of 8 6 3 4 0 51 and 0 63 mg l 1 respectively anion concentrations of cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 range from 8 3 to 9 3 0 73 to 3 8 0 10 to 0 76 and 13 8 to 19 5 mg l 1 with an average of 8 7 2 2 0 35 and 16 4 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 the most abundant cation and anion are na and hco3 the charge imbalance is within the range of 6 6 7 4 data s1 suggesting the tenability of the chemical analysis leung et al 2005 however the concentrations of no3 and so4 2 are very low in spring water compared to precipitation water suggesting that the groundwater system of this study site is a sink for wet deposit of no3 and so4 2 no3 and so4 are relatively higher during the wet seasons than during the dry season hco3 however is higher during the dry seasons than the wet season the temporal distribution of hco3 is in opposite phase with those of rainfall rates and water temperature while no3 and so4 2 are in same phase with these parameters fig 3 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities in spring water are in the ranges of 130 0 to 407 8 46 6 to 136 5 and 24 7 to 80 4 dpm 100 l 1 with a mean value of 233 1 84 2 and 57 1 dpm 100 l 1 222rn ranges from 237 1 to 811 2 dpm l 1 with an average of 361 6 dpm l 1 radium isotopes have relatively higher concentrations during dry seasons than wet seasons 222rn shows no identifiable correlation with the hydrological conditions fig 3 the concentration of cl na k mg2 and ca2 in the rainwater over the study area is 1 5 0 78 0 23 0 10 and 0 64 mg l 1 liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 5 discussion 5 1 c q relations of spring water fig 4 shows the regression of the physicochemical parameters radium and 222rn data with discharge rate based on c a qb generally cl and the weathering sourced solutes such as na k mg2 and ca2 exhibits weakly or not identifiable relations with discharge rate all of these constituents are much lower than those in rainwater suggesting spring water compositions are mainly influenced by the geochemical processes in the groundwater system of the springshed no3 and so4 2 increase with discharge rate and follow the power law c q relations with b values of 0 73 r2 0 39 and 0 62 r2 0 35 respectively b values for no3 and so4 2 are significantly larger than 0 2 indicating the enrichment export regimes this might be ascribed to two reasons firstly the no3 and so4 2 concentrations in rainwater are significantly higher compared to compared to the spring water liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 another reason is that no3 and so4 2 in the soil layer can be activated during the high flow regimes dupas et al 2016 2017 hco3 however is inversely correlated with spring discharge rate and follows the power law c q relation with a b value to be 0 16 r2 0 53 which is within the range of chemostatic export regime hco3 concentration of rainwater is one order of magnitude smaller than the spring water indicating that hco3 is mainly sourced from the reaction processes occurring within the groundwater system of the springshed the springshed consists of volcanic rock the weathering of which usually does not lead to high hco3 in the spring water the average molar ratios of mg2 na and ca2 ma are 0 056 and 0 042 data s1 and fig 5 a respectively both of which are close to 0 24 and 0 32 for silicate weathering groundwater system and much smaller than 10 and 50 for typical carbonate weathering groundwater system gaillardet et al 1999 winnick et al 2017 the processes of soil respiration will also mount additional effects on hco3 export regimes usually the shallow soil zone has enriched co2 if it is the case here hco3 should be positively correlated to temperature and microbial activities seibert et al 2009 however hco3 is in good inversely correlated with temperature and discharge in this study fig 5b therefore it is speculated that hco3 is mainly derived from the dissolution of co2 in the vadose zone rather than from the weathering processes and soil respiration as rising temperature lowers the solubility of co2 radium isotopes exhibit no identifiable correlations with discharge rate and don t follow the power law c q relations the highly dynamic export regimes of radium isotopes can be ascribed to their multiple reactive processes occurring within the groundwater system as fully described in section 2 however good positive power law correlation is observed between 222rn and spring discharge rate with exponent constant b value of 0 45 r2 0 46 as the precipitation has negligible 222rn concentration the condition of b 0 2 indicates that 222rn in spring water is dominated by sources from the bedrock aquifers as indicated in section 2 222rn in groundwater is mainly determined by the process of α recoil from the 226ra in the rock minerals 5 2 estimates of hydrogeological and lithological parameters radium activities of groundwater depend on the mineral compositions of both solid pool and sorbed pool according to chen and chan 2002 and chan et al 2007 the ars of 238u 232th has a value of 0 62 n 14 in the bedrock of the study area u th series is considered to be in secular equilibrium within the bedrock aquifers of the headwater catchment ku and luo 1992 porcelli 2008 thereafter the ratio of p r 222 rn p r ra or cr has a value of 0 62 p r 222 rn p r ra and r f ra can be calculated by substituting measured radium and 222rn activities and obtained cr into equations s23 s25 supplementary information their results are detailed in data s1 generally r f ra ranges from 69 0 to 276 5 with an average of 137 1 fig 8 a the mean r f ra is in line with the results of 60 200 in granite and basalts groundwater system by the laboratory determinations of serene and relyea 1982 but somehow low compared to the results of other fresh groundwater system and significantly high compared to other saline groundwater system krishnaswami et al 1982 lee et al 2012 luo et al 2000 2014 moore et al 2008 vinson et al 2009 2012 relatively low retardation compared to radium retardation factors obtained in other fresh groundwater systems might be due to relative small adsorption rates of the fracture system compared to those in well weathered soil grains serene and relyea 1982 this condition is also evidenced by ars of 224ra 222rn normally this ratio has a range of 10 5 10 3 in high adsorption fresh groundwater system and is ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 in low adsorption saline brine groundwater system ars of 224ra 222rn in this study ranges from 0 0032 to 0 012 with an average of 0 0071 suggesting a moderate adsorption rate krishnaswami et al 1982 porcelli 2008 p r 222 rn ranges from 165 to 575 atoms l 1 min 1 with an average of 249 atoms l 1 min 1 and p r 228 ra ranges from 216 to 753 atoms l 1 min 1 with an average of 326 atoms l 1 min 1 p r 222 rn and p r 228 ra are well in line with previous studies elsewhere luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 suggesting tenable results in this study p r 222 rn is further used to quantify se of aquifer grains with eq 12 a s 238 u has a value of 5430 dpm kg 1 chen and chan 2002 r has a value of 0 5 μm ε r is set to 1 in most cases krishnaswami et al 1982 ku and luo 1992 luo et al 2000 substituting these constants and obtained 222rn recoil rate into eq 12 s e is calculated to be from 2247 5 to 7837 5 cm2 l 1 with an average of 3395 3 cm2 l 1 fig 8b the values are rather consistent with the results of other studies in moderately decomposed to slightly decomposed aquifer systems kigoshi 1971 ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 the variations of s e can be due to the vertical heterogeneity of pore size and dynamics of water table and will be fully discussion in section 5 5 the flow path lengths for 228ra and 226ra to reach equilibrium are relatively large compared to the median flow path length of the springshed which provides the possibility to calculate the value of mtt or τ w with eqs 1 and 2 since the precipitation rate of 226ra is not negligible in its transport model the calculation of τ w can be only obtained by solving 228ra transport model as shown in eq 2 in the equation there is an unknown term a 232 th r f 232 th which is 228ra input from the sorbed pool this value of a ad 232 th r f 232 th is dependent on the weathering degree of aquifer grains and bedrock with high value in well weathered and highly developed surface coating of aquifer grains since r f 232 th equals k 232 th 1 and has a value of 106 in fresh groundwater system luo et al 2000 thus there is the relation a 232 th r f 232 th a 232 th a ad 232 th a ad 232 th indicating that the retardation effect of 232th in groundwater can be approximately evaluated by the composition of 232th in the sorbed pool the composition of 232th in the solid pool is estimated to be 8680 dpm kg 1 chen and chan 2002 the conversion of radionuclide activity from solid pool to sorbed pool has been documented in previous studies davidson and dickson 1986 kadko and moore 1988 and can be expressed as 13 a s 232 th a ad 232 th ρ s 1 ϕ ϕ ρ w where a s 232 th is activity of 232th in solid pool ϕ is the porosity of the rock ρ s is the rock density ρ w is the water density the porosity ϕ ranges from 0 5 to 1 4 with an average of 1 for granites volcanic rock density ranges from 2 65 to 2 75 g cm 1 with an average of 2 7 g cm 1 given these constants and 232th value in the solid pool a 232 th r f 232 th is calculated to be 32 5 dpm l 1 activity ratios ars between different radium nuclides provide constraints to investigate hydrological hydrogeological and lithologic processes in different groundwater systems gonneea et al 2013 moore et al 2006 porcelli 2008 smith et al 2008 swarzenski 2007 228ra and 224ra are closely related since they both belong to 232th series and are connected by one α and one β recoil generally ars of 224ra 228ra range from 0 5 to 2 in most groundwater systems porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2001 however this study observed much higher 224ra 228ra values fig 6 ranging from 2 2 to 7 3 with an average of 4 3 the ars of 224ra 228ra in spring water are much larger than its upper limit ar under steady state ar 2 fig 6 suggesting spring water is newly recharged and the activities of 228ra are mostly under unsteady condition along the flow line the newly recharged condition is also supported by terrain analysis of the springshed which has a mean flow path length 100 m and steep topography gradient the large topography gradient favors the rapid discharge of groundwater through the springshed thus the unsteady state of 228ra along the flow path provides the possibility of quantifying the mtt of the spring water to further exam this hypothesis 228ra activity ingrowths with mtt are discussed under different scenarios or specifically different values of r f ra and p r 222 rn the time for 228ra to reach steady state is determined by its retardation factor therefore the scenarios of brine saline subsaline and fresh groundwater system are discussed with representative retardation factors of 1 10 100 and 1000 respectively as evidenced by many previous studies krishnaswami et al 1991 1982 luo et al 2000 2017 michael et al 2011 porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2000 2001 in each scenario α recoil rate is regulated from 10 100 1000 and 10 000 atoms l 1 min 1 which are within the ranges of that in natural aquifer systems with the obtained a 232 th r f 232 th and based on eq 2 distributions of 228ra activity versus elapsed time under different scenarios are shown in fig 7 generally r f ra is the determining parameter for the equilibrium time while both α recoil rate and retardation factor control the equilibrium activities in the spring site the elapsed time for 228ra to reach 95 equilibrium activities under r f ra of 1 10 100 and 1000 is approximately 30 25 15 and 5 days respectively thus the unsteady state of 228ra over the study site can provide the constraints to quantity mtt within the time scale of days to weeks by solving eq 2 with the obtained a 232 th r f 232 th mtt can be expressed as 14 τ w ln p r ra 32 5 p r ra 32 5 a 228 ra r f ra λ 228 ra r f ra eq 14 is the semi analytical solution to calculate mtt of spring water discharged from the springshed substituting the obtained r f ra and p r ra into equation 14 τ w is calculated to be from 2 1 to 11 6 days with an average of 6 1 days fig 8c suggesting that the spring water is mostly derived from newly recharge water and is consistent with in situ observations of the sensitive response of spring rate to rainfall mtt in this study is about one order of magnitude smaller than results of most previous studies that were based on the hydrological modeling long term monitoring of conservative tracers such as cl and stable 2h and 18o in stream water and virtual hydrologic experiments mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 the lower mtt in this study might be ascribed to three reasons firstly mtt in most previous studies were obtained based on hydrological modeling and high frequency monitoring of relatively conservative tracers of cl 2h and 18o however mtt varies with different solutes depending on their generation and chemical processes during migration for example the mtt of water isotopes represents the time spent when they enter the unsaturated zone mix with older water in different reservoirs as they travel and finally exit the system the mtt of ra obtained here represents the time spent when it is generated from the grains or rock undergoes reactions such as adsorption desorption and decay and finally reaches spring outlets therefore mtt of water isotopes should be much greater than ra based approaches in this study because of the extra travel time of water isotopes through the unsaturated zone or through the riparian along the streams and hyporheic zones at streambed in previous studies secondly the terrain analysis in this study indicates that the median flow path of the springshed is within 50 m and the slope of this springshed is up to 60 c fig 2b and c high hydrologic gradient and short flow path lead to short mtt of the spring water finally the spring water is considered to be mainly from the well decomposed soil and highly fractured aquifers of the springshed which are dominated by newly recharged water and shallow young groundwater 5 3 discharge versus hydrogeological and lithological parameters the spring discharge rate is further discussed with the obtained r f ra mtt and effective surface area to reveal the controlling factors of the generations of spring water and dynamics of spring discharges spring discharge shows negative correlation r 0 53 p 0 01 with mtt fig 9 a increased hydrologic gradient of during the wet seasons leads to higher spring water discharge rate and shorter mtt the spring water therefore is dominated by newly recharge water during the dry seasons spring discharge is mainly maintained by the tail of old water driven by low hydraulic gradient mcdonnell 1990 positive correlation r 0 63 p 0 01 between spring discharge rate and r f ra is also observed fig 9b lower r f ra is found during wet seasons and higher during the dry seasons the value of r f ra is speculated to be controlled by the surface chemistry and mostly related to salinity or ion exchange rates and the structure of aquifer medium or regolith ku et al 1992 porcelli 2008 as described by van genuchten and wierenga 1986 the retardation can be also expressed as r 1 ρ s k i θ where θ is volumetric water content the aquifer matrix ki is the aforementioned dimensionless adsorption desorption coefficient of radionuclide i and is considered to be stable in time and space during the wet seasons the water content increases and the effective density of saturated zone ρ s decreases due to the rise of water table both condition leads to lower r f ra during wet seasons it also indicates that the wet environment favors the transport and export of solutes in the headwater catchments this conclusion is similar to the results in previous studies feng et al 2004 hoehn and cirpka 2006 matos et al 1999 se exhibits highly positive correlation r 0 76 p 0 01 with the discharge rate fig 9c during the wet seasons rising water table leads to an expansion of the saturated zone into larger pore sizes and thus an increase of mean pore size and therefore high se this conclusion is similar to previous studies godsey et al 2009 torres et al 2015 wen and li 2017 for example li et al 2017a and wen and li 2017 also concluded that the wet effective surface areas were positively correlated with the discharge rates based on numerical modeling and sedimentary column experimental data 5 4 mtt as a possible control on c q relation there have been a number of studies that reveal the chemostasis of c q relations in stream water however limited studies have looked into observed correlation between mtt and solute export in water directly discharged from subsurface system benettin et al 2015a maher 2010 2011 yang et al 2018 major ion concentrations of spring water are plotted versus mtt as shown in fig 10 there are two types of relations between solute concentrations and mtt solutes of cl na mg2 ca2 and hco3 are positively correlated with mtt with correlation coefficients of 0 65 p 0 01 0 36 p 0 01 0 60 p 0 01 0 26 p 0 01 and 0 68 p 0 01 respectively thus mtt is the first order kinetic controlling factor of solute export in the springshed as suggested by torres et al 2015 the concentrations of solutes in groundwater and stream water should be calibrated with solute loadings of rainwater the concentrations of cl na k mg2 and ca2 in the rainwater over the study area are 1 5 0 78 0 23 0 10 and 0 64 mg l 1 liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 all of which are much lower than those in the spring water therefore the solutes in the spring water are considered to be primarily sourced from chemical reaction processes within the springshed such as weathering dissolutions rather than from rainwater benettin et al 2015a proposed a first order chemical kinetics model to characterize how mtt influences concentrations of weathering solutes in stream water generally minerals and immobile water are concentrated in weathering constituents when event water is loaded in the aquifer system the bounded weathering products are transferred into the mobile water due to concentration gradients benettin et al 2015a kim et al 2014 maher 2010 2011 mtt in this springshed would be the time available for weathering products to transfer from immobile to the mobile phases as shown in figs 10 13 the ions from weathering products all linearly increase with mtt suggesting that the mass transferring process has not reached equilibrium within the time scale of estimated mtt this time scale is equivalent to the equilibrium time of 13 and 10 days for mass transfer of si and na in previous study benettin et al 2015a the unsteady state of the transferring processes well explains chemodynamic export regime for the spring water during the wet seasons the increased rainwater loading and higher hydraulic conductivity lead to much shorter mtt the time available for transferring the immobile weathering products to the mobile phases is limited and the weathering solute concentrations in spring water decline the long mtt during dry seasons favors the mass transfer of weathering solutes to mobile water and therefore causes high concentrations of these solutes in spring water in contrast so4 2 and no3 are negatively correlated with mtt with a correlation coefficient of 0 45 p 0 01 and 0 79 p 0 01 respectively so4 2 and no3 concentrations in local rainwater are measured to be 3 5 mg l 1 and 1 7 mg l 1 liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 both of which are close to their largest concentrations in spring water suggesting that so4 and no3 in the spring are mainly sourced from precipitation the negative linear correlation indicates that the subsurface of the springshed serve as the buffering and retention system for the high so4 2 and no3 loading from rainwater previous studies indicated that mtt regulates nutrient and so4 2 concentrations in groundwater the no3 and so4 2 are considered to be removed by denitrification and sulfate reduction by the residing denitrifiers and sulfate reduction bacteria maamar et al 2015 winnick et al 2017 during the wet seasons the rising water table favors oxygen dissolution in groundwater the process of denitrification and sulfate reduction are inhibited and the shorter mtt can further reduce time available for these reaction processes therefore higher no3 and so4 2 concentrations are observed in spring water during wet seasons on the contrary the less aerial contact due to the water table decline and the longer mtt during dry seasons cause high denitrification and sulfate reduction rates and result in lower no3 and so4 2 concentrations the good linear relation between mtt and no3 and so4 2 concentrations also indicates that their removing processes of denitrification and sulfate reduction occur within the time scale of less than 10 days in the subsurface of the springshed it is also possible that nitrate and sulfate sources in the upper soils with high porosity and se may be activated during high flow and decoupled during low flow regimes this does not contradict with the fact that reaction at the longer time scale reduces loads concentrations but might be an additional element shaping the c q relations markewitz et al 2001 seibert et al 2009 5 5 se as a possible control on c q relation the effective surface area is a parameter reflecting the integrated effect of porosity and average pore size of the subsurface and can be a metric to evaluate the subsurface structures godsey et al 2009 torres et al 2015 figs 11 12 show the correlations between concentrations of major ions and se generally the weathering solutes of na k mg2 and ca2 show weak or no identifiable correlation with se the effective surface area however is positively correlated with concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in spring water with a correlation coefficient of 0 45 p 0 01 and 0 64 p 0 01 respectively high water table with increased se during the wet seasons is a causative factor leading to higher no3 and so4 2 in the spring water winnick et al 2017 this phenomenon could be ascribed to two reasons 1 high se enhances the aerial contacting areas and inhibit the removal of no3 and so4 2 via denitrification and sulfate reduction in the subsurface of the springshed 2 no3 and so4 2 are sourced from the upper soil layer with high se hco3 concentration has weak inverse correlations with se as described above hco3 is dominantly sourced from co2 dissolution in vadose zone higher se during the wet season is corresponding to higher water temperature and smaller vadose zone thickness which reduces the time for water parcels to penetrate the vadose zone and therefore reduces the dissolution of co2 generally the increase of se negligibly influences export regimes of weather products such as na k mg2 and ca2 and conservative tracer of cl but enhances the export of no3 so4 2 and reduces the hco3 export in the spring water for most previous studies a consistent dilution regime or dilution phenomenon with a much clearer negative relation was observed for supply limitation solutes however the phenomenon is not obvious in this study this derivation from dilution might be ascribed to the variance of mtt which is the determinant factor for mass transferring from mobile to immobile phase the widely used ppa model proposed by godsey et al 2009 gives explanations of the chemostasis of c q relations for major ions in stream water from 59 catchments in the usa the exponent constant b in the ppa model depends on the rate at which permeability porosity and pore size decrease exponentially with depth in the cz se in this study can be also an integrated metric of permeability porosity and pore size thus this study suggests that ppa model is not applicable to explain the c q relations of the newly recharged and rapid discharged system and the solute export of the spring water in this study may be more dependent on mtt as described above 5 6 solute export regimes and r f ra the retardation of solutes in saturated and unsaturated zones is widely observed in previous studies feng et al 2004 hoehn and cirpka 2006 van genuchten and wierenga 1986 previous studies mostly investigated the retardation factors of major ions such as cl and na both of which have very weak affinity to the aquifer grains and planar surface of fractures in bedrock the retardation factors of na and cl are in the range of 1 to 10 considerably smaller than that of radium nuclides retardation factors of the solute transport in the springshed aquifer are subject to spatiotemporal variability due to the spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface structures and dynamics of hydrological and biogeochemical processes the values of r f ra although much higher than those of major ions can be still used as a metric to evaluate the retardation effects of the aquifer system of the springshed fig 12 and figure s1 show the correlations of r f ra versus major ion concentrations generally concentrations of most major ions have weak or no identifiable correlations with r f ra suggesting that retardation processes negligibly affects to solute concentrations in the spring water however so4 2 shows identifiably positive correlation with r f ra fig 12 this indicates that higher so4 2 concentrations in groundwater will bring additional effects on r f ra during the wet seasons previous studies have suggested that radium isotopes are preferentially removed by the co precipitation with baso4 and srso4 luo et al 2017 rosenberg et al 2011a b the positive correlation of so4 2 versus r f ra may still be indirectly ascribed to the effects of co precipitation although there is no direct evidence for the precipitation of baso4 and srso4 in the spring water 5 7 conceptual model of solute export in spring water this study proposes a conceptual model to recapitulate the integrated influence of mtt r f ra and effective surface area on the c q relation and solute export of spring water of a newly recharge and rapid discharge springshed as shown in fig 13 conservative tracer of cl and weathering solutes such as na k mg2 and ca2 of the spring water exhibit a dynamic export regime of rather than dilution regimes for these supply limitation solutes mtt is considered to be the primary controlling factor for these solutes due to the first order kinetics of mass transferring from immobile to mobile phases the mass transferring is still under disequilibrium within the springshed aquifer therefore solute export linearly increases with the mtt during the wet seasons increased water table and higher hydraulic gradient lead to shorter mtt and lower concentrations of these solutes due to a decrease of the time available for the mass transfer fig 13a during the dry seasons lowering water table leads to an increase of mtt and finally results in high weathering products as the time available for the mass transfer increases fig 13b the dynamics of se which is also a metric for ppa model will negligibly influence the c q relations and solute export regimes suggesting that the c q relations and solute export regimes in this study cannot be explained by previous ppa model moreover the conservative tracer of cl and weathering products of na k mg2 and ca2 will not be influenced by the retardation processes biogenic solutes such as no3 and so4 2 follow the power law c q relations with a large positive exponential constant as these solutes are dominantly loaded from rainwater and continuously removed by biogeochemical processes in the springshed aquifer these solute concentrations are inversely correlated with mtt and positively correlated with se indicating that both mtt and se are influential factors of c q relation and export regimes of these solutes shorter mtt and higher se during wet seasons will inhibit the removal rate of denitrification and sulfate reduction and therefore increase concentration and export of these solutes in spring water while higher mtt and lower se during dry seasons favor the removal of denitrification and sulfate reduction and decrease these solute concentrations and exports no3 is unlikely to be influenced by retardation processes however so4 2 export is influenced by retardation processes during the transport due to its co precipitation with the sulphate precipitates hco3 shows chemostatic c q relations and is considered to be primarily derived from co2 dissolution in the vadose zone and or precipitation during the wet seasons rising water table reduces the dissolution time within the vadose zone and increase of water temperature reduces the co2 solubility both conditions lead to lower hco3 concentration in spring water during wet seasons higher hco3 concentration in dry seasons is ascribed to higher co2 dissolution due to the increase of vadose zone thickness and lower water temperature 5 8 limitations the current study is limited by three aspects 1 the uncertainty propagations of mtt quantification in the radium reactive transport model the uncertainties mainly stem from the detecting uncertainties of radium and 222rn activities and the approximation of radium input derived from the sorbed pools in the transport model the measurement uncertainties of radium and 222rn activities in groundwater will lead to the uncertainty up to 20 for r f ra p r 222 rn and p r 228 ra which will finally result in about uncertainties of 30 40 in mtt estimates and 20 in effective surface area estimates this uncertainty through inevitable will not influence the temporal distribution of r f ra effective surface areas and mtt the approximations of radium input derived from sorbed phases are based on empirical equations which involve some constants such as bedrock porosity and density and bedrock compositions of 232u and 232th that are estimated based on previous studies these values are considered to be temporally stable over the study area therefore the uncertainties derived from approximations of radium input of sorbed phase are considered to be minimal 2 the biweekly monthly concentration measurements of the spring water are relatively coarse although such measurements have been also used by many previous studies baronas et al 2017 hoagland et al 2017 torres et al 2015 2017 higher sampling frequency will capture more representative concentration and discharge information benettin et al 2015a kim et al 2014 2017 kirchner and neal 2013 however radium analysis requires at least 5 l spring water per sample which makes the higher sampling frequency of small discharge rate spring water challenging 3 the influences of unsaturated zone on the radium reactive transport are not considered there have been very few observational studies to look into the radium transport in the unsaturated zones due to the difficulties in taking representative soil water radium samples however previous studies have suggested that mtt retardation factors and dissolution of radium can be constrained by u th series reactive transport models within the unsaturated zones ku et al 2009 reynolds et al 2003 which will be considered in the authors future study 6 conclusions this study unravels the controlling factors of concentration discharge c q relations and solute export of the spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters radium and 222rn a one dimensional advective reactive transport model of radium and 222rn is proposed to quantify some key parameters that influence c q relations and solute exports such as r f ra and mtt of radium nuclides and se of the springshed aquifer the spring water is characterized by very short mtt days to weeks lower mtt higher se and r f ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons solute exports of cl na k ca2 and mg2 are primarily controlled by mtt due to disequilibrium of mass transfer from immobile phase to mobile phase export regimes of theses solutes will be negligibly influenced by dynamics of se and retardation processes biogenic solutes of no3 and so4 2 are mainly sourced from the precipitation and exhibits retention during their transport within the springshed the integrated effect of mtt and se determines concentrations and exports of no3 and so4 2 in spring water so4 2 export is additionally influenced by co precipitation with sulphate precipitates hco3 shows chemostatic c q relation and its export regime is controlled by dynamics of co2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table this study makes the first attempt to look into some basic hydrogeological and lithologic parameters in the newly recharge and rapid discharge groundwater system based on disequilibrium of radium and 222rn transport and mount these parameters to the dynamics of c q relations and solute export regimes of spring water discharge from springshed the approach is promising and can be deployed into c q studies of rapidly refreshed groundwater system elsewhere

6662,this study unravels the controlling factors of concentration discharge c q relations and solute export regimes of spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters radium and 222rn a simplified analytical solution is derived to quantify radium based mean transient time mtt based on radium disequilibrium key hydrogeological and lithological parameters such as retardation factor r f ra and mtt of radium nuclides and effective surface areas se of subsurface are therefore quantified based on the long term monitoring records and discussed with the c q relation and solute export regimes the study leads to the findings 1 the spring water is characterized by very short mtt days to weeks lower mtt higher effective surface areas and r f ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons 2 the slow mass transfer between immobile and mobile phases controls the solute exports of cl na k ca2 and mg2 export regimes of theses solutes are negligibly influenced by dynamics of se and retardation processes 3 lower mtt higher se and activation of no3 and so4 2 lead to higher concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in wet seasons and vice versa in dry seasons 4 so4 2 export is additionally influenced by co precipitation of sulphate precipitates hco3 is controlled by dynamics of co2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table this study demonstrates that the disequilibrium of radium transport in the fractured aquifer can be deployed to investigate the metrics of the critical zone and the solute export regimes of a springshed keywords radionuclide reactive transport model c q relation critical zone mean transit time effective surface areas solute export regime 1 introduction in the past 10 years the critical zone cz which is the thin and living skin of earth ranging vertically from the top of canopies down to the saturated bedrocks has gained considerable attention due to its vital role in environmental ecological and human services such as water storage and discharge nutrient cycling ecosystem maintenance and climate regulations brooks et al 2015 fan 2015 fan et al 2013 field et al 2015 grant and dietrich 2017 mcintosh et al 2017 concentration discharge c q relation and mean transit time mtt have become a major research topic in hydrological and biogeochemical studies of the cz mcdonnell and beven 2014 pfister and kirchner 2017 mtt is defined as the time that water parcels spend between the time they enter the unsaturated zone and the time they flow out of the aquifer system mcdonnell et al 2010 mcguire et al 2005 the lateral and vertical heterogeneity of cz structure controls the key hydrological and hydrological features such as water storage mtt and flow path of groundwater and solutes and thereafter leads to variability of fluxes of water constituents and energy through the cz ameli et al 2017 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 the ease of high frequency sampling in surface water bodies and the readily and cheap measurements of geochemical parameters allow researchers to unravel the relation between hydrological and geochemical processes in the cz over different time scales anderson et al 1997 godsey et al 2009 kim et al 2014 2017 kirchner and neal 2013 liu et al 2017a maher and chamberlain 2014 the c q relation integrating water and reaction processes dictated by land cover topography and subsurface structure is a fundamental description of spatiotemporal feedbacks between hydrological geochemical hydrogeological and biological processes in the cz from hillslope to landscape scales brooks et al 2015 evans and davies 1998 li et al 2017a b lots of previous studies have illustrated that c q relation follows a power law distribution of c a q b anderson et al 1997 evans and davies 1998 godsey et al 2009 rue et al 2017 when concentrations are almost constant over discharge rates the solute export regime is called chemostasis with b value in a narrow range of 0 2 the phenomenon is observed for a large number of studies on geogenic solutes a chemodynamic regime is present when concentration variance is high compared to discharge variance this can be the cases for both dilution and enrichment this can be also the case that flow and concentration are decoupled and hardly correlated in the latter case the c q slope b does not give information if an export regime is chemodynamic thompson et al 2011 when concentrations are in inversely correlated with discharge rates the export regime is termed as dilution with b value less than 0 2 the dilution regime is also common for some solutes such as cl and nitrate particularly in urban environments when concentrations are positively correlated with discharge rates the export regime is named enrichment or accretion with b value larger than 0 2 chorover et al 2017 godsey et al 2009 li et al 2017a shanley et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 the mechanisms for chemostatic c q relations can be ascribed to the mixing effects from newly rainfall water soil water shallow groundwater and deep older groundwater evans and davies 1998 long residence time derived from dispersion in catchment kirchner et al 2000 vertical heterogeneity of cz structures godsey et al 2009 weathering processes and rock fluid interaction maher 2010 2011 cation exchanges in the hyporheic zones or in the aquifer during the precipitation events herndon et al 2015 in addition to most event based c q studies researchers also make effects to examine c q relations over the monthly seasonal inter annual scales revealing that the c q relation and solute export regimes can be shaped by land use climate and soil dupas et al 2015 2016 2017 solutes export regime of a catchment is also highly influential to mtt which can be further used to implement first order chemical kinetics such as the weathering process in the cz of a catchment high mtt in groundwater normally results in relatively higher concentration of weathering elements due to accumulative dissolution of weathering benettin et al 2015a maher 2010 2011 mcintosh et al 2017 moreover solute compositions in stream waters can be dependent on travel time distribution ttds and storage selection functions sas which are the probability density function of the ages of the water parcels discharged from a catchment hillslope at a given time botter 2012 and the way that catchment storage supplies the outflows with water of different ages rinaldo et al 2015 respectively high frequency observed data of hydrological and climatological parameters such as discharge rates groundwater level and evapotranspiration and conservative tracers such as cl and stable δ2h and δ18o isotopes can be used to quantify mtt ttds and sas over different watershed scales benettin et al 2015a b 2017 botter 2012 mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 2010 yang et al 2018 over a global scale stream water contains substantial portion of young water less than 3 months and has hydrologic connectivity to the very thin veneer of global groundwater storage it is concluded that the young water with shorter mtt time scales will convey pollutants into the surface water bodies rapidly berghuijs and kirchner 2017 gleeson et al 2015 jasechko et al 2016 kirchner 2016a b however recent studies have highlighted the limitation of these conservative tracer based methods the main limitation is that these approaches do not account for the temporal dynamics of water flow path and temporal variation of mtt and ttds botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2015 thus a non stationary scenario should be considered to better understand hydrological and biogeochemical processes within the cz and their impact on c q relation benettin et al 2017 botter et al 2011 klaus et al 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 also these statistic or mathematical models can be used to obtain the mtt ttds and identify the sas based on high frequency climatological data and conservative tracers but offer little information of inherent processes or critical zone structures and their impacts on the solute export regimes moreover despite numerous pioneering studies to investigate the controlling factors of c q relation in the stream and river systems there have been limited studies to explore the mechanisms on how mtt and hillslope subsurface physical structures control c q relations and rather rare studies make the connections between mtt a major hydrology metric and the c q relation a major biogeochemical metric kim et al 2014 2017 mcintosh et al 2017 differed from c q relation in stream water which has the concentration highly influenced by river riparian zones and or stream bed hyporheic zones c q relation from spring discharge in first order headwater catchment can provide direct information of how the cz regulates the c q export regime under the hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics headwater catchments are the basic units forming up drainage basins and hotpots for series of biogeochemical processes such as nutrient export retention and carbon loss alexander et al 2000 kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 rosemond et al 2015 therefore there is a call for further studies to fully mount mtt intrinsic processes of cz such as adsorption desorption dissolution weathering and cz structure parameters such as effective surface area on c q relation and solute export regimes in recently recharged spring water in headwater catchments kim et al 2017 maher and chamberlain 2014 rempe and dietrich 2014 west 2012 winnick et al 2017 in this study radium and 222rn activities of spring water discharged from a headwater catchment are continuously monitored to quantify the cz structure parameters and therefore to decipher the controlling factors of c q relations and solute export regimes this study aims to answer the following questions 1 how the c q relation depends on radium based mtt 2 how the effective surface area influences the solute export regimes 3 which is the dominant factor controlling the export regimes of conservative geogenic and biogenic solutes 2 theory of radium and 222rn reactive transport in groundwater system nuclides of uranium thorium u th series can provide constraints of sediment weathering rates water mtt and preferential flow and solute adsorption and desorption dynamics within the subsurface and be used to quantify the transport of suspended particular matter in rivers and streams ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 ma et al 2010 2013 porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2000 among u th series radium nuclides 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra and 222rn have much high activities in the groundwater systems compared to thorium and uranium nuclides and can be detected inexpensively and sophisticatedly with advanced detection approaches burnett et al 2001 kim et al 2001 lee and kim 2006 moore and arnold 1996 porcelli 2008 therefore lots of mathematical and field studies have been conducted to investigate radium and 222rn transport and their behaviors in different aquatic environments in the past decades charette et al 2008 frei and gilfedder 2015 krishnaswami et al 1991 ku and luo 1992 luo et al 2000 2018a tricca et al 2001 in the fresh groundwater system radium isotopes have high affinity to the aquifer grains and predominately controlled by the adsorption or retardation and have relatively short mtt krishnaswami et al 1982 ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 in the saline and brine groundwater system radium nuclides have much less affinity to the solid phase kadko and moore 1988 krishnaswami et al 1991 luo et al 2000 rama and moore 1984 high activities and mobility and relatively conservative behavior during transport in saline groundwater system make radium isotopes good tracers to study chemical reaction and transport in saline environments charette et al 2003 moore 1999 and to quantify submarine groundwater discharge in coastal areas burnett et al 2006 charette et al 2008 moore 1996 222rn is highly concentrated 102 105 dpm l 1 in groundwater due to continuous supply of α recoil by 226ra in the solid phase dimova et al 2012 luo et al 2000 rama and moore 1984 wood et al 2004 zhuo et al 2001 therefore 222rn also provides signatures of groundwater input and is employed to investigate groundwater surface water interactions and to quantify groundwater discharge in estuaries watershed and lakes cable et al 1996a b dimova and burnett 2011 gleeson et al 2009 luo et al 2016 2018b tse and jiao 2008 radium nuclides and 222rn are endogenous and subject to the parameters such as mtt effective surface areas and processes of adsorption desorption and dissolution weathering low 1996 martin and akber 1999 przylibski 2000 roba et al 2012 sturchio et al 2001 therefore these nuclides are ideal tracers to investigate the inherent controlling factors of the c q relation and solute export regimes of cz in headwater catchments radionuclide transport in slowly refreshed groundwater system such as watershed deep aquifers and coastal saline groundwater environments have been rather intensively investigated gleeson et al 2013 kiro et al 2012 luo et al 2000 swarzenski et al 2001 there are limited studies mounting radium isotopes and 222rn transport on the studies of c q relations and solute export regimes in rapidly refreshed groundwater system such as aquifers consisting of well decomposed rock or fractured rock with spring emergences of headwater catchment radium radon disequilibrium in the recently recharged groundwater system can be deployed to obtain the radium based mtt τ w which is considered to be a metric for the groundwater rock interactions especially for the weathering processes the radium based mtt is proposed in this study which represents the time when radium is generated in the grains inside the system goes through reactions such as adsorption desorption and decay and finally reaches the spring outlet the combination of radium radon disequilibrium can be also used to derive the parameters such as effective surface areas se as described in details in the supplementary information the analytical solutions of radium isotopes 228th and 222rn

the flow path within a fresh groundwater system r f τ w p r can be potentially quantified by solving these equations based on some approximations according to the lithologic and regolith settings of specific study sites tricca et al 2000 indicated that the length scales for these nuclide to reach the steady state are within meters for 222rn 224ra and 228th due to their short half lives and extremely high affinity to the aquifer grains or planar surface of fractured bedrocks thus 222rn 224ra and 228th have reached steady state in mostly groundwater systems therefore eqs 15 can be reduced

series equals the activities ratio of 238u 232th in secular equilibrium within the solid pool gill et al 1992 therefore there is p r 222 rn p r ra a 238 u a 232 th thus α recoil ratio of 222rn to 224 228ra are subject to the ars of 238u and 232th in the rocks which is considered to a constant hereafter referred to as cr over geologic time scale for the aquifer skeleton rock of a specific study area substituting cr into eqs 68 and solving these equations yield the solutions of rf and pr in terms of radium and 222rn activities in groundwater 9 r f ra a 222 rn a 224 ra a 226 ra c r a 228 ra 10

228th and 222rn the parameters of retardation factor and α recoil rate can be estimated based on the activities of 222rn 224ra 226ra and 228ra in groundwater in most cases 226ra and 228ra are considered to be under steady state in fresh groundwater environment due to their high affinity to the aquifer grain or large retardation rates however there are also the situations that 226ra and 228ra have not reached the steady state along the flow path these scenarios are especially existential in the newly recharge groundwater within very small first order headwater catchments or sprinsheds davidson and dickson 1986 luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 thus there is disequilibrium between long lived radium isotopes and short lived radium isotopes under this situation the unsteady states of 226ra and 228ra can provide the constraint to quantify mtt as shown in eqs 1 2 the unsteady states of 226ra and 228ra can serve as an ideal metric in the studies of mtt in newly recharge and rapid discharge system such the headwater streams seeps and springs being the function of the compositions of parent isotopes in the aquifer grains and effective surface areas p r 222 rn is usually employed to deduce some physical parameters of subsurface structures such as effective surface areas and pore sizes of aquifer materials andrews et al 1989 hammond et al 1988 kigoshi 1971 ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 effective surface area se in this study is defined as mineral surface area bathed in far from equilibrium and is therefore effective dissolving as fully described in previous studies li et al 2014 salehikhoo and li 2015 in this study p r 222 rn is used to quantify effective surface area of aquifer grains with the following equation andrews et al 1989 ku et al 2009 luo et al 2000 12 2 s e 2 a s 238 u r ρ s ε r p r 222 rn where a s 238 u is the activity of 238u in the bedrock r is the recoil radius ε r is the recoil efficiency of 222rn s e cm2 l 1 is the effective surface areas of the bedrock 3 methods 3 1 hydrogeological and topographic setting a spring emerged in a small sub basin of dragon mountain hong kong was continuous monitored to study the solute export regimes and c q relations based on radium isotopes and 222rn fig 2 the spring was entirely natural but for the convenience of water collection local residents pasted the slope surface with cement and then installed two steel pipes into the spring vent which led to two spring outlets about 10 cm apart the small catchment of the spring is shown in fig 2b the bedrock of springshed is volcanic rocks with a soil and weathering layers in shallow zone gco 1997 the lithology is dominated by coarse ash crystal tuff with significant volume of fine ash vitric tuff mineral compositions generally change from dominantly rhyolite through dacite rhyolite to trachydacite rhyolite with decreasing age the volcanic rocks have predominant sio2 contents of 68 06 in weight the other major components of al2o2 fe2o3 k2o na2o mgo and cao have weight ratios of 15 63 3 13 6 20 3 45 0 48 and 1 74 respectively the uranium and thorium concentrations in the volcanic rocks have ranges of 2 9 ppm and 6 43 ppm respectively ruxton 1957 sewell and campbell 1997 the weathering process is dominated by silicate weathering with negligible carbonate weathering the soil profile of the springshed is dominated by three zones of a to c as shown in fig 2c a colluviums and regolith layer with a depth of less than 1 m at the low relief areas and up to 10 m at the upland hydrological processes influencing this zone include infiltration evapotranspiration vertical flow and lateral subsurface flow water component in this zone is mainly newly event waters including shallow groundwater and soil water gco 1997 b completely to moderately decomposed zone this zone is saturated with young groundwater recharged by event water groundwater in this zone maintains the base flow and spring discharge during the wet seasons jiao et al 2005 leung et al 2005 c slightly decomposed to fresh bedrock zone which serves as the reservoir of old groundwater that maintains baseflow and spring discharge during the dry seasons jiao et al 2006 groundwater flow and storage within this zone are considered to be limited jiao et al 2005 2006 leung and jiao 2008 the steep slopes of the catchment provide high hydraulic gradients that could lead to the development of soil pipes from naturally occurring voids and preferred flow path nash and dale 1984 thus the spring may have been developed as a result of the combining effect of the topographic depression fracture network and soil pipes the terrain analysis of the catchment around the spring fig 2b was conducted with high resolution lidar data the catchment has an area of 11471 m2 a median slope of 65 9 c and a mean elevation of 224 m 173 282 m the longest flow path from the divide to the lowest catchment boundary is 253 m 3 2 field work and analysis sampling activities were conducted biweekly monthly from mar 2011 to oct 2012 parameters of spring discharge water and air temperatures and electricity conductivities were measured in situ fig 2d precipitation record was obtained from the weather station installed at the victoria peak by hong kong observatory which is 1 5 km away from the spring site 50 ml water was taken into nalgene bottles for major ions analysis a silicon tube was inserted into the spring outlets to collect un aerial spring water into the bottom of a 250 ml glass vials until overflowed for 222rn analysis major ion samples were filtered with 0 2 μm filters and analyzed by dionex ics 1100 thermo co 222rn samples were measured with rad h2o durridge co immediately after sampling to avoid significant decay loss 5 l of water samples were filtered with 0 47 mm filters waterman driven by vacuum pump and passed through mno2 fibers to extract dissolved radium isotopes in the laboratory 224ra measurement was conducted immediately after the extraction with radium delayed coincidence counting radecc to avoid significant decay loss 223ra was measured about 1 2 weeks after the sampling to avoid the interference of 224ra by radecc radium samples was stored for over a month and a third measurement was conducted to detect 228th and correct for 224ra 226ra was measured based on its secular equilibrium with 222rn after over 3 week storage of the samples in sealed columns 228ra was measured based on the ingrowth of 224ra after storing the radium fibers over 1 year the measurement processes of radium isotopes are fully described in previous studies by the authors lee et al 2012 luo and jiao 2016 luo et al 2014 2016 2017 the uncertainties for the measurement of 223ra 224ra 228ra and 228th are estimated to be 12 7 7 and 7 and the uncertainties of 226ra measurements to be 10 15 based on calculation approaches in previous studies garcia solsona et al 2008 moore 2008 moore and cai 2013 since water of the two outlets is originated from one spring and the sampling frequency mostly 1 3 times per month the physicochemical parameters major ions and radioactive isotopes of water samples from the two outlets are discharge weighted as an entirety based on the discharge rates of the two outlets and further monthly averaged for better paired analysis of these parameters discharge weighted average monthly spring water concentrations were calculated based on the formulas in previous studies hunsaker and johnson 2017 williams and melack 1997 4 results the discharge weighted and monthly averaged distributions of monitored parameters are shown in data s1 and fig 3 overall spring discharge shows typical seasonal cycles over a hydrological year lowering to 25 9 ml s 1 during the dry seasons and raising to 132 7 ml s 1 during the wet seasons spring discharge is well in phase with rainfall and no obvious hysteresis was observed between rainfall and spring discharge rate cation concentrations of na k mg2 and ca2 range from 7 5 to 9 7 2 7 to 3 8 0 40 to 0 63 and 0 56 to 0 76 mg l 1 with an average of 8 6 3 4 0 51 and 0 63 mg l 1 respectively anion concentrations of cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 range from 8 3 to 9 3 0 73 to 3 8 0 10 to 0 76 and 13 8 to 19 5 mg l 1 with an average of 8 7 2 2 0 35 and 16 4 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 the most abundant cation and anion are na and hco3 the charge imbalance is within the range of 6 6 7 4 data s1 suggesting the tenability of the chemical analysis leung et al 2005 however the concentrations of no3 and so4 2 are very low in spring water compared to precipitation water suggesting that the groundwater system of this study site is a sink for wet deposit of no3 and so4 2 no3 and so4 are relatively higher during the wet seasons than during the dry season hco3 however is higher during the dry seasons than the wet season the temporal distribution of hco3 is in opposite phase with those of rainfall rates and water temperature while no3 and so4 2 are in same phase with these parameters fig 3 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities in spring water are in the ranges of 130 0 to 407 8 46 6 to 136 5 and 24 7 to 80 4 dpm 100 l 1 with a mean value of 233 1 84 2 and 57 1 dpm 100 l 1 222rn ranges from 237 1 to 811 2 dpm l 1 with an average of 361 6 dpm l 1 radium isotopes have relatively higher concentrations during dry seasons than wet seasons 222rn shows no identifiable correlation with the hydrological conditions fig 3 the concentration of cl na k mg2 and ca2 in the rainwater over the study area is 1 5 0 78 0 23 0 10 and 0 64 mg l 1 liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 5 discussion 5 1 c q relations of spring water fig 4 shows the regression of the physicochemical parameters radium and 222rn data with discharge rate based on c a qb generally cl and the weathering sourced solutes such as na k mg2 and ca2 exhibits weakly or not identifiable relations with discharge rate all of these constituents are much lower than those in rainwater suggesting spring water compositions are mainly influenced by the geochemical processes in the groundwater system of the springshed no3 and so4 2 increase with discharge rate and follow the power law c q relations with b values of 0 73 r2 0 39 and 0 62 r2 0 35 respectively b values for no3 and so4 2 are significantly larger than 0 2 indicating the enrichment export regimes this might be ascribed to two reasons firstly the no3 and so4 2 concentrations in rainwater are significantly higher compared to compared to the spring water liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 another reason is that no3 and so4 2 in the soil layer can be activated during the high flow regimes dupas et al 2016 2017 hco3 however is inversely correlated with spring discharge rate and follows the power law c q relation with a b value to be 0 16 r2 0 53 which is within the range of chemostatic export regime hco3 concentration of rainwater is one order of magnitude smaller than the spring water indicating that hco3 is mainly sourced from the reaction processes occurring within the groundwater system of the springshed the springshed consists of volcanic rock the weathering of which usually does not lead to high hco3 in the spring water the average molar ratios of mg2 na and ca2 ma are 0 056 and 0 042 data s1 and fig 5 a respectively both of which are close to 0 24 and 0 32 for silicate weathering groundwater system and much smaller than 10 and 50 for typical carbonate weathering groundwater system gaillardet et al 1999 winnick et al 2017 the processes of soil respiration will also mount additional effects on hco3 export regimes usually the shallow soil zone has enriched co2 if it is the case here hco3 should be positively correlated to temperature and microbial activities seibert et al 2009 however hco3 is in good inversely correlated with temperature and discharge in this study fig 5b therefore it is speculated that hco3 is mainly derived from the dissolution of co2 in the vadose zone rather than from the weathering processes and soil respiration as rising temperature lowers the solubility of co2 radium isotopes exhibit no identifiable correlations with discharge rate and don t follow the power law c q relations the highly dynamic export regimes of radium isotopes can be ascribed to their multiple reactive processes occurring within the groundwater system as fully described in section 2 however good positive power law correlation is observed between 222rn and spring discharge rate with exponent constant b value of 0 45 r2 0 46 as the precipitation has negligible 222rn concentration the condition of b 0 2 indicates that 222rn in spring water is dominated by sources from the bedrock aquifers as indicated in section 2 222rn in groundwater is mainly determined by the process of α recoil from the 226ra in the rock minerals 5 2 estimates of hydrogeological and lithological parameters radium activities of groundwater depend on the mineral compositions of both solid pool and sorbed pool according to chen and chan 2002 and chan et al 2007 the ars of 238u 232th has a value of 0 62 n 14 in the bedrock of the study area u th series is considered to be in secular equilibrium within the bedrock aquifers of the headwater catchment ku and luo 1992 porcelli 2008 thereafter the ratio of p r 222 rn p r ra or cr has a value of 0 62 p r 222 rn p r ra and r f ra can be calculated by substituting measured radium and 222rn activities and obtained cr into equations s23 s25 supplementary information their results are detailed in data s1 generally r f ra ranges from 69 0 to 276 5 with an average of 137 1 fig 8 a the mean r f ra is in line with the results of 60 200 in granite and basalts groundwater system by the laboratory determinations of serene and relyea 1982 but somehow low compared to the results of other fresh groundwater system and significantly high compared to other saline groundwater system krishnaswami et al 1982 lee et al 2012 luo et al 2000 2014 moore et al 2008 vinson et al 2009 2012 relatively low retardation compared to radium retardation factors obtained in other fresh groundwater systems might be due to relative small adsorption rates of the fracture system compared to those in well weathered soil grains serene and relyea 1982 this condition is also evidenced by ars of 224ra 222rn normally this ratio has a range of 10 5 10 3 in high adsorption fresh groundwater system and is ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 in low adsorption saline brine groundwater system ars of 224ra 222rn in this study ranges from 0 0032 to 0 012 with an average of 0 0071 suggesting a moderate adsorption rate krishnaswami et al 1982 porcelli 2008 p r 222 rn ranges from 165 to 575 atoms l 1 min 1 with an average of 249 atoms l 1 min 1 and p r 228 ra ranges from 216 to 753 atoms l 1 min 1 with an average of 326 atoms l 1 min 1 p r 222 rn and p r 228 ra are well in line with previous studies elsewhere luo et al 2000 porcelli 2008 suggesting tenable results in this study p r 222 rn is further used to quantify se of aquifer grains with eq 12 a s 238 u has a value of 5430 dpm kg 1 chen and chan 2002 r has a value of 0 5 μm ε r is set to 1 in most cases krishnaswami et al 1982 ku and luo 1992 luo et al 2000 substituting these constants and obtained 222rn recoil rate into eq 12 s e is calculated to be from 2247 5 to 7837 5 cm2 l 1 with an average of 3395 3 cm2 l 1 fig 8b the values are rather consistent with the results of other studies in moderately decomposed to slightly decomposed aquifer systems kigoshi 1971 ku et al 1992 luo et al 2000 the variations of s e can be due to the vertical heterogeneity of pore size and dynamics of water table and will be fully discussion in section 5 5 the flow path lengths for 228ra and 226ra to reach equilibrium are relatively large compared to the median flow path length of the springshed which provides the possibility to calculate the value of mtt or τ w with eqs 1 and 2 since the precipitation rate of 226ra is not negligible in its transport model the calculation of τ w can be only obtained by solving 228ra transport model as shown in eq 2 in the equation there is an unknown term a 232 th r f 232 th which is 228ra input from the sorbed pool this value of a ad 232 th r f 232 th is dependent on the weathering degree of aquifer grains and bedrock with high value in well weathered and highly developed surface coating of aquifer grains since r f 232 th equals k 232 th 1 and has a value of 106 in fresh groundwater system luo et al 2000 thus there is the relation a 232 th r f 232 th a 232 th a ad 232 th a ad 232 th indicating that the retardation effect of 232th in groundwater can be approximately evaluated by the composition of 232th in the sorbed pool the composition of 232th in the solid pool is estimated to be 8680 dpm kg 1 chen and chan 2002 the conversion of radionuclide activity from solid pool to sorbed pool has been documented in previous studies davidson and dickson 1986 kadko and moore 1988 and can be expressed as 13 a s 232 th a ad 232 th ρ s 1 ϕ ϕ ρ w where a s 232 th is activity of 232th in solid pool ϕ is the porosity of the rock ρ s is the rock density ρ w is the water density the porosity ϕ ranges from 0 5 to 1 4 with an average of 1 for granites volcanic rock density ranges from 2 65 to 2 75 g cm 1 with an average of 2 7 g cm 1 given these constants and 232th value in the solid pool a 232 th r f 232 th is calculated to be 32 5 dpm l 1 activity ratios ars between different radium nuclides provide constraints to investigate hydrological hydrogeological and lithologic processes in different groundwater systems gonneea et al 2013 moore et al 2006 porcelli 2008 smith et al 2008 swarzenski 2007 228ra and 224ra are closely related since they both belong to 232th series and are connected by one α and one β recoil generally ars of 224ra 228ra range from 0 5 to 2 in most groundwater systems porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2001 however this study observed much higher 224ra 228ra values fig 6 ranging from 2 2 to 7 3 with an average of 4 3 the ars of 224ra 228ra in spring water are much larger than its upper limit ar under steady state ar 2 fig 6 suggesting spring water is newly recharged and the activities of 228ra are mostly under unsteady condition along the flow line the newly recharged condition is also supported by terrain analysis of the springshed which has a mean flow path length 100 m and steep topography gradient the large topography gradient favors the rapid discharge of groundwater through the springshed thus the unsteady state of 228ra along the flow path provides the possibility of quantifying the mtt of the spring water to further exam this hypothesis 228ra activity ingrowths with mtt are discussed under different scenarios or specifically different values of r f ra and p r 222 rn the time for 228ra to reach steady state is determined by its retardation factor therefore the scenarios of brine saline subsaline and fresh groundwater system are discussed with representative retardation factors of 1 10 100 and 1000 respectively as evidenced by many previous studies krishnaswami et al 1991 1982 luo et al 2000 2017 michael et al 2011 porcelli 2008 tricca et al 2000 2001 in each scenario α recoil rate is regulated from 10 100 1000 and 10 000 atoms l 1 min 1 which are within the ranges of that in natural aquifer systems with the obtained a 232 th r f 232 th and based on eq 2 distributions of 228ra activity versus elapsed time under different scenarios are shown in fig 7 generally r f ra is the determining parameter for the equilibrium time while both α recoil rate and retardation factor control the equilibrium activities in the spring site the elapsed time for 228ra to reach 95 equilibrium activities under r f ra of 1 10 100 and 1000 is approximately 30 25 15 and 5 days respectively thus the unsteady state of 228ra over the study site can provide the constraints to quantity mtt within the time scale of days to weeks by solving eq 2 with the obtained a 232 th r f 232 th mtt can be expressed as 14 τ w ln p r ra 32 5 p r ra 32 5 a 228 ra r f ra λ 228 ra r f ra eq 14 is the semi analytical solution to calculate mtt of spring water discharged from the springshed substituting the obtained r f ra and p r ra into equation 14 τ w is calculated to be from 2 1 to 11 6 days with an average of 6 1 days fig 8c suggesting that the spring water is mostly derived from newly recharge water and is consistent with in situ observations of the sensitive response of spring rate to rainfall mtt in this study is about one order of magnitude smaller than results of most previous studies that were based on the hydrological modeling long term monitoring of conservative tracers such as cl and stable 2h and 18o in stream water and virtual hydrologic experiments mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 the lower mtt in this study might be ascribed to three reasons firstly mtt in most previous studies were obtained based on hydrological modeling and high frequency monitoring of relatively conservative tracers of cl 2h and 18o however mtt varies with different solutes depending on their generation and chemical processes during migration for example the mtt of water isotopes represents the time spent when they enter the unsaturated zone mix with older water in different reservoirs as they travel and finally exit the system the mtt of ra obtained here represents the time spent when it is generated from the grains or rock undergoes reactions such as adsorption desorption and decay and finally reaches spring outlets therefore mtt of water isotopes should be much greater than ra based approaches in this study because of the extra travel time of water isotopes through the unsaturated zone or through the riparian along the streams and hyporheic zones at streambed in previous studies secondly the terrain analysis in this study indicates that the median flow path of the springshed is within 50 m and the slope of this springshed is up to 60 c fig 2b and c high hydrologic gradient and short flow path lead to short mtt of the spring water finally the spring water is considered to be mainly from the well decomposed soil and highly fractured aquifers of the springshed which are dominated by newly recharged water and shallow young groundwater 5 3 discharge versus hydrogeological and lithological parameters the spring discharge rate is further discussed with the obtained r f ra mtt and effective surface area to reveal the controlling factors of the generations of spring water and dynamics of spring discharges spring discharge shows negative correlation r 0 53 p 0 01 with mtt fig 9 a increased hydrologic gradient of during the wet seasons leads to higher spring water discharge rate and shorter mtt the spring water therefore is dominated by newly recharge water during the dry seasons spring discharge is mainly maintained by the tail of old water driven by low hydraulic gradient mcdonnell 1990 positive correlation r 0 63 p 0 01 between spring discharge rate and r f ra is also observed fig 9b lower r f ra is found during wet seasons and higher during the dry seasons the value of r f ra is speculated to be controlled by the surface chemistry and mostly related to salinity or ion exchange rates and the structure of aquifer medium or regolith ku et al 1992 porcelli 2008 as described by van genuchten and wierenga 1986 the retardation can be also expressed as r 1 ρ s k i θ where θ is volumetric water content the aquifer matrix ki is the aforementioned dimensionless adsorption desorption coefficient of radionuclide i and is considered to be stable in time and space during the wet seasons the water content increases and the effective density of saturated zone ρ s decreases due to the rise of water table both condition leads to lower r f ra during wet seasons it also indicates that the wet environment favors the transport and export of solutes in the headwater catchments this conclusion is similar to the results in previous studies feng et al 2004 hoehn and cirpka 2006 matos et al 1999 se exhibits highly positive correlation r 0 76 p 0 01 with the discharge rate fig 9c during the wet seasons rising water table leads to an expansion of the saturated zone into larger pore sizes and thus an increase of mean pore size and therefore high se this conclusion is similar to previous studies godsey et al 2009 torres et al 2015 wen and li 2017 for example li et al 2017a and wen and li 2017 also concluded that the wet effective surface areas were positively correlated with the discharge rates based on numerical modeling and sedimentary column experimental data 5 4 mtt as a possible control on c q relation there have been a number of studies that reveal the chemostasis of c q relations in stream water however limited studies have looked into observed correlation between mtt and solute export in water directly discharged from subsurface system benettin et al 2015a maher 2010 2011 yang et al 2018 major ion concentrations of spring water are plotted versus mtt as shown in fig 10 there are two types of relations between solute concentrations and mtt solutes of cl na mg2 ca2 and hco3 are positively correlated with mtt with correlation coefficients of 0 65 p 0 01 0 36 p 0 01 0 60 p 0 01 0 26 p 0 01 and 0 68 p 0 01 respectively thus mtt is the first order kinetic controlling factor of solute export in the springshed as suggested by torres et al 2015 the concentrations of solutes in groundwater and stream water should be calibrated with solute loadings of rainwater the concentrations of cl na k mg2 and ca2 in the rainwater over the study area are 1 5 0 78 0 23 0 10 and 0 64 mg l 1 liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 all of which are much lower than those in the spring water therefore the solutes in the spring water are considered to be primarily sourced from chemical reaction processes within the springshed such as weathering dissolutions rather than from rainwater benettin et al 2015a proposed a first order chemical kinetics model to characterize how mtt influences concentrations of weathering solutes in stream water generally minerals and immobile water are concentrated in weathering constituents when event water is loaded in the aquifer system the bounded weathering products are transferred into the mobile water due to concentration gradients benettin et al 2015a kim et al 2014 maher 2010 2011 mtt in this springshed would be the time available for weathering products to transfer from immobile to the mobile phases as shown in figs 10 13 the ions from weathering products all linearly increase with mtt suggesting that the mass transferring process has not reached equilibrium within the time scale of estimated mtt this time scale is equivalent to the equilibrium time of 13 and 10 days for mass transfer of si and na in previous study benettin et al 2015a the unsteady state of the transferring processes well explains chemodynamic export regime for the spring water during the wet seasons the increased rainwater loading and higher hydraulic conductivity lead to much shorter mtt the time available for transferring the immobile weathering products to the mobile phases is limited and the weathering solute concentrations in spring water decline the long mtt during dry seasons favors the mass transfer of weathering solutes to mobile water and therefore causes high concentrations of these solutes in spring water in contrast so4 2 and no3 are negatively correlated with mtt with a correlation coefficient of 0 45 p 0 01 and 0 79 p 0 01 respectively so4 2 and no3 concentrations in local rainwater are measured to be 3 5 mg l 1 and 1 7 mg l 1 liu et al 2017b wai et al 2005 both of which are close to their largest concentrations in spring water suggesting that so4 and no3 in the spring are mainly sourced from precipitation the negative linear correlation indicates that the subsurface of the springshed serve as the buffering and retention system for the high so4 2 and no3 loading from rainwater previous studies indicated that mtt regulates nutrient and so4 2 concentrations in groundwater the no3 and so4 2 are considered to be removed by denitrification and sulfate reduction by the residing denitrifiers and sulfate reduction bacteria maamar et al 2015 winnick et al 2017 during the wet seasons the rising water table favors oxygen dissolution in groundwater the process of denitrification and sulfate reduction are inhibited and the shorter mtt can further reduce time available for these reaction processes therefore higher no3 and so4 2 concentrations are observed in spring water during wet seasons on the contrary the less aerial contact due to the water table decline and the longer mtt during dry seasons cause high denitrification and sulfate reduction rates and result in lower no3 and so4 2 concentrations the good linear relation between mtt and no3 and so4 2 concentrations also indicates that their removing processes of denitrification and sulfate reduction occur within the time scale of less than 10 days in the subsurface of the springshed it is also possible that nitrate and sulfate sources in the upper soils with high porosity and se may be activated during high flow and decoupled during low flow regimes this does not contradict with the fact that reaction at the longer time scale reduces loads concentrations but might be an additional element shaping the c q relations markewitz et al 2001 seibert et al 2009 5 5 se as a possible control on c q relation the effective surface area is a parameter reflecting the integrated effect of porosity and average pore size of the subsurface and can be a metric to evaluate the subsurface structures godsey et al 2009 torres et al 2015 figs 11 12 show the correlations between concentrations of major ions and se generally the weathering solutes of na k mg2 and ca2 show weak or no identifiable correlation with se the effective surface area however is positively correlated with concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in spring water with a correlation coefficient of 0 45 p 0 01 and 0 64 p 0 01 respectively high water table with increased se during the wet seasons is a causative factor leading to higher no3 and so4 2 in the spring water winnick et al 2017 this phenomenon could be ascribed to two reasons 1 high se enhances the aerial contacting areas and inhibit the removal of no3 and so4 2 via denitrification and sulfate reduction in the subsurface of the springshed 2 no3 and so4 2 are sourced from the upper soil layer with high se hco3 concentration has weak inverse correlations with se as described above hco3 is dominantly sourced from co2 dissolution in vadose zone higher se during the wet season is corresponding to higher water temperature and smaller vadose zone thickness which reduces the time for water parcels to penetrate the vadose zone and therefore reduces the dissolution of co2 generally the increase of se negligibly influences export regimes of weather products such as na k mg2 and ca2 and conservative tracer of cl but enhances the export of no3 so4 2 and reduces the hco3 export in the spring water for most previous studies a consistent dilution regime or dilution phenomenon with a much clearer negative relation was observed for supply limitation solutes however the phenomenon is not obvious in this study this derivation from dilution might be ascribed to the variance of mtt which is the determinant factor for mass transferring from mobile to immobile phase the widely used ppa model proposed by godsey et al 2009 gives explanations of the chemostasis of c q relations for major ions in stream water from 59 catchments in the usa the exponent constant b in the ppa model depends on the rate at which permeability porosity and pore size decrease exponentially with depth in the cz se in this study can be also an integrated metric of permeability porosity and pore size thus this study suggests that ppa model is not applicable to explain the c q relations of the newly recharged and rapid discharged system and the solute export of the spring water in this study may be more dependent on mtt as described above 5 6 solute export regimes and r f ra the retardation of solutes in saturated and unsaturated zones is widely observed in previous studies feng et al 2004 hoehn and cirpka 2006 van genuchten and wierenga 1986 previous studies mostly investigated the retardation factors of major ions such as cl and na both of which have very weak affinity to the aquifer grains and planar surface of fractures in bedrock the retardation factors of na and cl are in the range of 1 to 10 considerably smaller than that of radium nuclides retardation factors of the solute transport in the springshed aquifer are subject to spatiotemporal variability due to the spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface structures and dynamics of hydrological and biogeochemical processes the values of r f ra although much higher than those of major ions can be still used as a metric to evaluate the retardation effects of the aquifer system of the springshed fig 12 and figure s1 show the correlations of r f ra versus major ion concentrations generally concentrations of most major ions have weak or no identifiable correlations with r f ra suggesting that retardation processes negligibly affects to solute concentrations in the spring water however so4 2 shows identifiably positive correlation with r f ra fig 12 this indicates that higher so4 2 concentrations in groundwater will bring additional effects on r f ra during the wet seasons previous studies have suggested that radium isotopes are preferentially removed by the co precipitation with baso4 and srso4 luo et al 2017 rosenberg et al 2011a b the positive correlation of so4 2 versus r f ra may still be indirectly ascribed to the effects of co precipitation although there is no direct evidence for the precipitation of baso4 and srso4 in the spring water 5 7 conceptual model of solute export in spring water this study proposes a conceptual model to recapitulate the integrated influence of mtt r f ra and effective surface area on the c q relation and solute export of spring water of a newly recharge and rapid discharge springshed as shown in fig 13 conservative tracer of cl and weathering solutes such as na k mg2 and ca2 of the spring water exhibit a dynamic export regime of rather than dilution regimes for these supply limitation solutes mtt is considered to be the primary controlling factor for these solutes due to the first order kinetics of mass transferring from immobile to mobile phases the mass transferring is still under disequilibrium within the springshed aquifer therefore solute export linearly increases with the mtt during the wet seasons increased water table and higher hydraulic gradient lead to shorter mtt and lower concentrations of these solutes due to a decrease of the time available for the mass transfer fig 13a during the dry seasons lowering water table leads to an increase of mtt and finally results in high weathering products as the time available for the mass transfer increases fig 13b the dynamics of se which is also a metric for ppa model will negligibly influence the c q relations and solute export regimes suggesting that the c q relations and solute export regimes in this study cannot be explained by previous ppa model moreover the conservative tracer of cl and weathering products of na k mg2 and ca2 will not be influenced by the retardation processes biogenic solutes such as no3 and so4 2 follow the power law c q relations with a large positive exponential constant as these solutes are dominantly loaded from rainwater and continuously removed by biogeochemical processes in the springshed aquifer these solute concentrations are inversely correlated with mtt and positively correlated with se indicating that both mtt and se are influential factors of c q relation and export regimes of these solutes shorter mtt and higher se during wet seasons will inhibit the removal rate of denitrification and sulfate reduction and therefore increase concentration and export of these solutes in spring water while higher mtt and lower se during dry seasons favor the removal of denitrification and sulfate reduction and decrease these solute concentrations and exports no3 is unlikely to be influenced by retardation processes however so4 2 export is influenced by retardation processes during the transport due to its co precipitation with the sulphate precipitates hco3 shows chemostatic c q relations and is considered to be primarily derived from co2 dissolution in the vadose zone and or precipitation during the wet seasons rising water table reduces the dissolution time within the vadose zone and increase of water temperature reduces the co2 solubility both conditions lead to lower hco3 concentration in spring water during wet seasons higher hco3 concentration in dry seasons is ascribed to higher co2 dissolution due to the increase of vadose zone thickness and lower water temperature 5 8 limitations the current study is limited by three aspects 1 the uncertainty propagations of mtt quantification in the radium reactive transport model the uncertainties mainly stem from the detecting uncertainties of radium and 222rn activities and the approximation of radium input derived from the sorbed pools in the transport model the measurement uncertainties of radium and 222rn activities in groundwater will lead to the uncertainty up to 20 for r f ra p r 222 rn and p r 228 ra which will finally result in about uncertainties of 30 40 in mtt estimates and 20 in effective surface area estimates this uncertainty through inevitable will not influence the temporal distribution of r f ra effective surface areas and mtt the approximations of radium input derived from sorbed phases are based on empirical equations which involve some constants such as bedrock porosity and density and bedrock compositions of 232u and 232th that are estimated based on previous studies these values are considered to be temporally stable over the study area therefore the uncertainties derived from approximations of radium input of sorbed phase are considered to be minimal 2 the biweekly monthly concentration measurements of the spring water are relatively coarse although such measurements have been also used by many previous studies baronas et al 2017 hoagland et al 2017 torres et al 2015 2017 higher sampling frequency will capture more representative concentration and discharge information benettin et al 2015a kim et al 2014 2017 kirchner and neal 2013 however radium analysis requires at least 5 l spring water per sample which makes the higher sampling frequency of small discharge rate spring water challenging 3 the influences of unsaturated zone on the radium reactive transport are not considered there have been very few observational studies to look into the radium transport in the unsaturated zones due to the difficulties in taking representative soil water radium samples however previous studies have suggested that mtt retardation factors and dissolution of radium can be constrained by u th series reactive transport models within the unsaturated zones ku et al 2009 reynolds et al 2003 which will be considered in the authors future study 6 conclusions this study unravels the controlling factors of concentration discharge c q relations and solute export of the spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters radium and 222rn a one dimensional advective reactive transport model of radium and 222rn is proposed to quantify some key parameters that influence c q relations and solute exports such as r f ra and mtt of radium nuclides and se of the springshed aquifer the spring water is characterized by very short mtt days to weeks lower mtt higher se and r f ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons solute exports of cl na k ca2 and mg2 are primarily controlled by mtt due to disequilibrium of mass transfer from immobile phase to mobile phase export regimes of theses solutes will be negligibly influenced by dynamics of se and retardation processes biogenic solutes of no3 and so4 2 are mainly sourced from the precipitation and exhibits retention during their transport within the springshed the integrated effect of mtt and se determines concentrations and exports of no3 and so4 2 in spring water so4 2 export is additionally influenced by co precipitation with sulphate precipitates hco3 shows chemostatic c q relation and its export regime is controlled by dynamics of co2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table this study makes the first attempt to look into some basic hydrogeological and lithologic parameters in the newly recharge and rapid discharge groundwater system based on disequilibrium of radium and 222rn transport and mount these parameters to the dynamics of c q relations and solute export regimes of spring water discharge from springshed the approach is promising and can be deployed into c q studies of rapidly refreshed groundwater system elsewhere

6663,the process of interrill erosion is complex by interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow their relative contribution to interrill erosion is difficult to be evaluated even on bare soil this study presents the new erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslope with the more relevant understanding of the physical processes the effective energy the erosivity factor is defined as the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance the effective kinetic energy of rainfall is determined by the horizontal component for slope of kinetic energy deducting energies dissipated by structure of vegetation canopies and a litter layer the effective potential energy of surface runoff is equal to potential energy of the available surface water following rain mass allocations of interception and infiltration the data from experimental field plots with various vegetation coverage after wildfire were used to verify the effective energy equation on densely vegetated slopes sediment yield depended greatly on effective kinetic energy of rainfall while they from hillslopes having sparse coverage were dominated by effective potential energy of surface runoff the dissipated energy due to interrill erosion showed the highest correlation coefficient with the effective energy under various cover conditions the kinetic energy of raindrops was greatly reduced by the litter layer and the potential energy of rainwater decreased predominantly due to infiltration the ratio of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy was the highest at 71 2 in the plots with low vegetation coverage the energy efficiency for interrill erosion increased with decreasing vegetation coverage and reached maximum 1 35 in extreme rainfall event under low vegetation coverage the constant and exponent of power law functions between the effective energy and the soil erosion work were strongly correlated with gravel ratio and litter coverage respectively the results indicate that the effective energy is useful erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion occurred by the complicated interaction of rain splash and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes keywords effective kinetic energy effective potential energy interrill erosion steep vegetated hillslope energy efficiency 1 introduction erosional features such as rills and gullies on croplands are rarely observed on forestlands despite steep slope having the primarily potential capacity for soil erosion on steep forested hillslopes interception and infiltration enhanced by ample vegetation coverage limit water availability for surface runoff and thereby inhibit formation of rill or concentrated flow processes cerdà and doerr 2005 shakesby and doerr 2006 smith and dragovich 2008 the interrill process combining rain splash with sheet flow is the dominant erosion mechanism on most hillslopes of forestland rangeland and lightly disturbed agricultural land miura et al 2003 ghahramani et al 2011 cerdà and doerr 2008 nearing et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2016 keesstra et al 2016 soils of forestland and rangeland are markedly different from those of typical cropland with steep slope the hillslopes are composed of young shallow and coarse grains including an extensive macropore berglund et al 1981 luce 1995 jean et al 2000 weiler and naef 2003 subsurface runoff rather than surface runoff is dominant by increasing infiltration rate with abundant plants in hillslopes quinn et al 1980 therefore surface runoff and soil erosion in even post fire land as well as forested land are generally less than those in agricultural land and other disturbed lands observed frequently rill and gully erosion vega and díaz fierros 1987 scott and van wyk 1990 soto et al 1994 walsh et al 1994 cerdà et al 2009 rodrigo comino et al 2015 seutloali and beckedahl 2015 interrill erosion on gentle bared slope less than 30 has been extensively studied as considering physically based hydraulic characteristic rose et al 1983 gilley et al 1985 guy et al 1987 proffitt and rose 1991 kinnell 1993 zhang et al 1998 while the study on steep vegetated hillslope has been limited due to the ground surface complexly structured by vegetation layers residual and litter layer and root system and the sheet flow interacted with continuous impact of throughfall raindrops the quantitative variations of sediment yield with hydrological response have been frequently surveyed with the effect of vegetation coverage miura et al 2003 miyata et al 2009 ghahramani et al 2011 shin et al 2013 the importance of splash erosion by raindrop impact in forestlands have been recognized since shallow overland flow of interrill erosion does not have enough power to break down the cohesive force between soil particles and transport the detached particles gabet and dunne 2003 miura et al 2003 miyata et al 2009 ghahramani et al 2011 ghahramani et al 2011 indicated that the contribution rates of erosion by raindrop splash and overland flow are varied with different ground coverage on a steep forested hillslope in even laboratory studies for bare soil bryan 1974 luk 1979 bryan and luk 1981 sutherland et al 1996 the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport to interrill erosion had shown significantly contrasting results therefore the reasonable erosivity factor is required to assess physically the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport in total sediment yield from steep vegetated hillslope in interrill erosion studies most historical approaches had parameterized rainfall intensity as erosivity factor meyer 1981 elliot et al 1989 liebenow et al 1990 more recently the splash sheet erosion equations considering rainfall intensity and runoff discharge as erosivity factor have been proposed to combine the effects of raindrop induced soil detachment and sediment transport by sheet flow kinnell 1993 zhang et al 1998 and wei et al 2009 shin and park 2018 the watershed erosion prediction project wepp flanagan and nearing 1995 which is one of the famous process based models adopted interrill erosion equation with regard to the effective rainfall intensity and runoff rate foster et al 1995 the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem nearing et al 2011 designed to improve the wepp limited in application to rangeland used rainfall intensity and surface runoff rate to evaluate the splash and sheet erosion from rangeland data wei et al 2009 the importance of linking kinetic energies of rainfall and runoff is further evident in erosion modeling studied by pearce 1976 and morgan 1978 pearce 1976 investigated the relationship of the kinetic energies with soil loss from runoff plots subjected to natural rainfall events and found that sediment yield and surface lowering are strongly correlated with total kinetic energies of rainfall and runoff morgan 1978 adopted the potential energy of runoff instead of the kinetic energy of runoff to parameterize with kinetic energy of rainfall in a regression equation to simulate sediment yield on gentle bare slopes morgan 1980 the interrill erosion processes of detachment and transport by raindrop and surface runoff are not separated definitely from natural or experimental data especially filed data measured from vegetated hillslopes are difficult to be interpreted by the separated physical approaches the new erosivity factor for interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslopes should be considered methodologically to analyze the complicated interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow in this study the effective energy as physical erosivity factor is suggested to evaluate splash and sheet erosion on steep vegetated hillslopes the specific objectives are 1 to present energy equations for partitioning input energy into energy losses associated with rainfall infiltration and runoff processes including energy dissipated by soil erosion 2 to analyze relationships of effective energies and dissipated energies for interrill erosion using field data on steep hillslopes with different vegetation coverage after wildfire 3 to assess the relative contribution of effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff and 4 to show the utilization of effective energy as erosivity factor to evaluate interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslopes 2 theory establishment 2 1 energy balance in the physical sense surface soil erosion is a process that work requires the expenditure of energy brooks et al 2013 the total input energy of rain worked on a sloping bare soil e in consists of the kinetic energy of rainfall e k and the potential energy of surface rainwater e p based on energy balance morgan 2005 1 e in e k e p the kinetic energy is expended to splash soil particles and the potential energy is used partially to transport soil particles by overland flow as shown in fig 1 in vegetated hillslope the total input energy is remarkably reduced by energies eloss lost due to 1 disturbance of rainfall through vegetation layer and litter layer 2 mass disappearance of raindrops such as interception by vegetation evapotranspiration and infiltration 3 collision and friction on raindrop impact with soil 4 friction of overland flow along the surface land turbulent mixing effects of surface irregularities and obstructions and flow meandering and 5 work to move soil particles to downslope ws therefore the total output energy eout of running surface water obtained by deducting the energy loss from the total input energy reduces significantly at the outlet point from hillslopes fig 1 at the outlet the potential energy of surface runoff is equal to 0 and the kinetic energy of running water is disregarded because velocity of surface runoff is much less than the terminal velocity of raindrops shin 2008 as a result the work to move soil particles from upslope to downslope is decided from the relationship of the total input energy and energy losses vegetation provides not only the canopy to reduce fall velocity of raindrops but also the litter layer and organic material to obstruct raindrops impacting directly the surface soil in vegetated hillslopes the kinetic energy of raindrops striking the soil surface is reduced by disturbance with vegetation cover and the litter layer from total energy of free falling raindrops the kinetic energy of rainfall on a non erodible slope i e rock rarely contributes to kinetic energy of running water because most rainfall kinetic energy is dissipated in impact with the surface soil pearce 1976 alternatively the raindrop impact consolidates and disperses the surface soil though raindrops splash soil particles on plane surface net transport rate approximates zero moss et al 1979 wright 1986 found that the raindrop velocity parallel to the slope surface determines the dispersion of splash droplets on a sloping surface more particles are thrown downslope than upslope morgan et al 1998 although the distance of several drop particles splashed from the point of raindrop impact depends on the local slope moss et al 1979 even on a slope soil covered with various crop as well as bare soil the soil particles splashed downslope are more than those splashed upslope mati 1994 the result is because slope angle mainly brings the addition of gravity to the drop detaching force torri and poesen 1992 thus rainfall kinetic energy lost by horizontal friction with the slope should be distinguished from energy lost by vertical collision with the surface soil under the ideal assumption that raindrops fall vertically without wind the horizontal component for slope direction of kinetic energy of raindrops works to splash and transport more particles downslope within boundary slope the rainfall kinetic energy of horizontal component increasing with slope angle is expressed as follows 2 e kh e k sin 2 θ where e kh is the horizontal kinetic energy of rainfall and θ is an angle of slope therefore the work of soil particles splashed by raindrop impact w sr is the function of the rainfall kinetic energy of horizontal component in eq 3 3 w sr f e kh the motion equation known as the second de saint venant equation is suitable for shallow flow the equation of kinematic wave which applies to steeply inclined water courses supposes that the local and convective acceleration terms and the pressure term can be disregarded without any great loss of accuracy woolhiser and liggett 1967 it explains that slope energy of shallow water is almost equal to frictional energy loss with slope surface yang 1972 presented unit stream power the expenditure rate of potential energy per specific weight to evaluate sediment transport in uniform flow on vegetated hillslope potential energy of surface runoff e pq is calculated as using the amount of water lost by interception surface depression storage and infiltration from free rainfall and expended mostly by friction with surface soil including work to transport soil particles w sq therefore the energy dissipated by sheet flow to transport soil particles is expressed as eq 4 4 w sq f e pq the total work to move soil particles done by splash sheet processes is equal to the sum of eqs 3 and 4 in the physical sense of expenditure of kinetic energy of rainfall and potential energy of surface water however if the slope is gentle or terraced frictional roughness is high or the resistance of the soil particles is large soil particles splashed by raindrop impact and transported by sheet flow may be deposited adjacent to roughness elements within hillslope of splash sheet erosion processes the raindrop impact is difficult to move materials from areas covered by flow kinnell 2005 but that into shallow water plays the role enhancing sediment transport by turbulence effects palmer 1964 zhang and wang 2017 therefore the real work for soil particles transported to downslope outlet may be smaller than the sum of work done by rainfall impact and sheet flow raindrop impact on steep hillslopes is generally splashing soil particles downslope from impact point as shown in fig 1 when splashed soil particles are loaded alternatively in sheet flow they may travel long distances with surface runoff sediment transported by overland flow includes constantly particles splashed downslope by raindrop impact the relative contribution of raindrop splash and sheet flow transport in total sediment yield is not easy to be separately evaluated due to the synchronous interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow in other words work of interrill erosion by raindrop induced flow on steep slopes can be expressed by the function of the sum of the horizontal kinetic energy of raindrop impact and the potential energy of surface water 5 w s f e kh e pq 2 2 effective kinetic energy the effective kinetic energy of rainfall is derived through partitioning or deducting energy losses from total kinetic energy of free falling raindrops preferentially the total kinetic energy for rainfall event is calculated by the summation of rainfall kinetic energy per unit time throughout rainfall duration as follows 6 e k t 1 t e kt where the time specific kinetic energy of rainfall e kt is the kinetic energy of rainfall per unit area and per unit time j m2 h t is the duration h of a rainfall event and e k is the total kinetic energy of rainfall per unit area j m2 for free falling raindrops the time specific rainfall kinetic energy of raindrops is commonly expressed as the rainfall power or kinetic energy flux density kinnell 1991 smith and de veaux 1992 madden et al 1998 steiner and smith 2000 and derived from 7 e kt 3 6 10 3 ρ w π 12 i n x d i d i 3 v 2 d i where ρ w is the density of raindrop kg m3 d i is the diameter in raindrop cm and v is the terminal velocity of raindrop m s the calculation of kinetic energy requires an analysis of the raindrop distribution as well as raindrop size and drop velocity measurements in spite of the difficulties posed by temporal and spatial variability of raindrops it is possible to derive general relations between kinetic energy e kt and rainfall intensity i the kinetic energy of rainfall have been simply estimated by exponential logarithmic and power law functions of relationship with rainfall intensity wischmeier and smith 1958 zanchi and torri 1980 rosewell 1986 brown and foster 1987 brandt 1990 mcisaac 1990 smith and de veaux 1992 coutinho and tomás 1995 uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 steiner and smith 2000 salles et al 2002 van dijk et al 2002 fornis et al 2005 lee and won 2013 shin et al 2016 the main components of the interception process by vegetation are the throughfall stemflow and interception loss the kinetic energy of raindrops falling through vegetation is affected by fall velocity and diameter of throughfall raindrops depending on vegetation structure the kinetic energy on vegetated terrain is split into the atmospheric raindrops falling onto open ground and the raindrops that pass through plant canopy the total kinetic energy of water droplets on vegetated hillslope is calculated as follows 8 e kv 1 α e k e t 9 e t 1 2 m t v t 2 where e kv j m2 is the kinetic energy of raindrop through vegetation α is the ratio of ground covered by the vegetation e t is the kinetic energy of the throughfall raindrops j m2 and v t is the fall velocity of raindrops m s with different fall heights the mass of throughfall m t kg m2 is estimated by empirical equations for interception loss and stemflow zhou et al 2002 kim 1994 where the hillslope is covered with homogeneous plants m t is expressed as follows 10 m t α r i l p s ρ w where r is the gross rainfall mm i l is the interception of rainfall by plant canopy mm p s is the stemflow mm the fall velocity of throughfall raindrops is dependent on several factors zhou et al 2002 average fall height m average water droplet diameter mm and the velocities of water droplets of various sizes falling from different heights raindrop diameters of throughfall are influenced by plant species and canopy structures including such factors as leaf direction and canopy shape instead of the intensity of atmospheric rainfall zhou 1997 1999 the fall velocity of through falling droplets that diameter ranges from 3 5 mm to 4 1 mm increases with fall distance zhou et al 2002 therefore the kinetic energy of the leaf drainage is dependent greatly upon the height of the plant canopy brandt 1990 morgan 2001 however most mixed forest are overlap by canopy cover having a high fall height and ground cover including shrubs and herbs the complexity of mixed vegetation layers should be quantified to evaluate the kinetic energy shin 2008 calculated effective canopy and ground covers for the kinetic energy of rainfall operating directly on the ground and used the average height by a function of the weighted coverage of vegetation layers as a result the kinetic energy of raindrops through various vegetation layers e t is calculated by the mass m tc and fall velocity v tc for raindrops falling through the effective canopy cover and the mass m tg and fall velocity v tg for raindrops falling through the effective ground cover in eq 11 11 e t 1 2 m tc v tc 2 m tg v tg 2 the litter layer including residuals provides the main protection for the mineral soil and prevents raindrops splash and particle detachment ross and dykes 1996 the kinetic energy of raindrops falling thorough the litter layer is reduced to zero at the soil surface binkley and brown 1993 because the fall height is very low the kinetic energy of rainfall through vegetation layers including the litter layer e kl on surface soil is recalculated by coverage ratio of the litter layer l c 12 e kl 1 l c e kv the kinetic energy of raindrop impacting on surface soil covered by the vegetation and litter layers is expressed by combination of eq 2 eq 8 and eq 12 13 e ek 1 l c 1 α e k e t sin 2 θ where e ek is the effective kinetic energy of rainfall to evaluate the work of soil particles splashed by raindrop impact on steep vegetated hillslopes 2 3 effective potential energy the potential energy of total rainwater is retained by steep slopes whereas kinetic energy of raindrops reaching on the soil surface is predominantly dissipated the potential energy for accumulated mass of raindrops reached on the hillslope is expressed as in eq 14 14 e p γ w r h where γ w is specific weight of raindrop kg m3 and h is the mean height of hillslope from runoff outlet m and calculated by the slope length l m and the gradient θ of slope such as l sin θ 2 the potential energy depends on the geometric shape of the hillslope ruhe 1975 devised a useful classification scheme for landforms defined for four configurations linear convex concave and sine curve the convex shape shows the highest potential energy of surface water rather than other shapes due to the highest mean height if non uniform slope within watershed is divided into segments of plot scale the geometric shape of one segment is assumed as linear slope foster and wischmeier 1974 interception of vegetation leads to the mass loss of 8 12 of the total rainfall as the results shown by zhou et al 2002 and kim 1994 thus the potential energy of rainwater reached on the surface soil as stemflow and throughfall after interception loss of the vegetation layers is 15 e pv γ w r i l h where e pv is the total potential energy of rainwater through vegetation j m2 and i l is the rainfall depth lost by interception mm additional loss of the potential energy is caused by rainwater infiltrated and stored into the soil layer the potential energy of rainwater contributed to infiltration and storage also is expressed by the function of the mean height of the hillslope as in eq 16 16 e pf γ w f h where e pf is the potential energy for infiltrated and stored rainwater j m2 and f is the accumulated infiltration mm the remaining energy reduced by interception infiltration and storage from potential energy of total rainwater is equal to potential energy of surface water contributed to overland flow e pq as in eq 17 17 e pq γ w r i l f h the potential energy of surface runoff is simply calculated by the runoff depth mm and the gradient of slope and becomes the effective potential energy e ep for sediment transported by sheet flow 2 4 work of soil erosion the work to transport and detach soil particles is expressed by multiplication of the displacement and the component of shear stress to move soil particles 18 w s τ s s where τ s is the shear stress of soil particle kg m2 and s is the mean displacement m of eroded soil particles in eq 18 it should be assumed that soil erosion occurs homogeneously along the unit slope and the slope is linear the shear stress of eroded soil particles is calculated by sin component for the weight of sediment yield per unit area kg m2 and the mean displacement is simply calculated by l 2 although the motion of eroded soil particles actually complicates due to the interaction between rainfall impact and sheet flow the work of soil erosion is equal to the energy dissipated by soil particles eroded from straight slope e d as presented by morgan 1978 for the first time 19 e d m s g h where m s is the mass of sediment kg m2 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 it means that the potential energy of soil particles positioned on steep hillslopes is dissipated by work frictional loss of soil particles transported and splashed from upslope to downslope in soil erosion processes the total effective energy for interrill erosion e e is the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and the effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance 20 e e e ek e ep therefore the work of soil erosion has the proportional function with the effective energy and the relationship is commonly power law equation as follows 21 w s a e e b where a and b are respectively constant and exponent of relationship between the work of soil erosion and the effective energy they are influenced by soil texture ground cover terrain and etc the flow chart in fig 2 shows the general process to calculate the effective energy of soil erosion when vegetation and litter layers exist on hillslope surface the effective kinetic energy of rainfall reflects the complex structure of cover factors and the effective potential energy of surface runoff considers the effect of interception the infiltration is the important factor to evaluate the effective potential energy of surface runoff whether soil is bare or not 3 methods 3 1 site description the physical erosivity factor for interrill erosion in steep vegetated hillslopes was evaluated as using field date the data for runoff and soil erosion had been collected to develop soil erosion model semma in the mountainous field experiment park et al 2012 nine plots with different vegetation recovery after wildfire were selected among fifty two plots two study sites samcheok and gangneung including the plots had been surveyed for five years after wildfire in 2000 the samcheok site was located at latitude 37 13 48 n and longitude 129 18 34 e and the gangneung site was located at latitude 37 48 50 n and longitude 128 48 25 e in south korea the dominant plant prior to burning was pinus densiflora but burning induced conversion of vegetation type to quercus at both sites the parent rocks of samcheok and gangneung are respectively the archaeozoic proterozoic era yulri group and the jurassic daebo granite kim et al 2001 in usda soil taxonomy a soil order of them is inceptisols that have altered horizons that have lost bases or iron and aluminum but retain some weatherable minerals and the suborder is udepts shown in humid climates nias 2016 3 2 observed data the topography soil and vegetation characteristics for the experimental plots installed within the two sites are represented in table 1 in samcheok plots sc1 sc5 the soil was composed of gravel of 32 sand of 64 and silt and clay of 4 and the very fine gravel which the mean diameter dm was 1 75 0 53 mm from sieve analysis the soil of gangneung plots gn1 gn4 was the coarse sand that the mean diameter was 0 87 0 16 mm and the ratios of gravel sand and silt and clay accounted for 19 76 and 5 respectively vegetation of nine plots showed various recovery conditions after wildfire fig 3 the sc1 and sc4 plots in the samcheok site had a low vegetation coverage as shown in fig 3 b plot sc5 with vegetation coverage of 90 100 is control plot located within an unburned pine forest plots gn1 gn4 installed in the gangneung site fig 3 c and d were treated in post fire 2001 although gn2 and gn4 plots showed the fast regeneration of native plants gn1 maintained the low vegetation coverage less than 40 plants of gn3 plots were recovered rapidly by treatment of terrace sodding the dry weight of fine roots diameter 2 mm was calculated from the relation functions of vegetation index based on the vegetation structure lee and park 2005 the percentage of fine root rc is the rate of the real dry weight to maximum dry weight of the fine roots propagated on surface soil park et al 2012 the plots with dense vegetation coverage tend to show the deep soil depth and high content of organic matter rainfall data were obtained from the automatic tipping bucket rain gauges established within each site and the korea meteorological administration kma data from kma for 1980 2010 years indicated that the annual average temperature and rainfall at gangneung were 13 1 c and 1464 5 mm respectively and those at uljin nearby samcheok were 12 6 c and 1278 9 mm respectively the rainfall events associated with convective and orographic storms and typhoons were concentrated in the summer season shin et al 2013 the ranges of rainfall depth r and maximum rainfall intensity i for each rainfall event were respectively 20 0 959 0 mm and 3 0 113 5 mm h from rain gauges in the study sites sediment and runoff generated by rainfall events were collected in a trap connected with a tank park et al 2012 runoff discharge was measured directly in the field as using sample buckets sediment deposited in the trap were sampled and dried in 105 c oven to obtain the dry weight in this study the rainfall kinetic energy was calculated from the exponential equation of rainfall kinetic energy intensity relationship using rain drop distribution data measured at the daegwanryeong weather station located within 20 km from gangneung lee and won 2013 3 3 data analysis systat version 10 spss inc chicago il statistical package was used for all statistical analyses correlation and regression analyses between soil erosion and variables such as rainfall cover and energy factors were performed to evaluate the energy equation for work of soil erosion log transformation was used to normalize data in correlation analysis of the relationship between interrill erosion and variables multiple regression analysis between coefficient a and exponent b of the effective energy equations and main parameters conducted to evaluate the power law equation for interrill erosion the significance levels of p 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 were used for all correlation analyses 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface runoff and sediment yield total 221 data of surface runoff and soil loss measured in nine plots were used to calculate the effective energies for interrill erosion table 2 total rainfall depth in each plot during the monitoring time from may to october 2001 2005 was the range of 2198 5 4155 5 mm the total surface runoff and the total sediment yield according to the total rainfall depth were 22 4 1375 4 mm and 32 0 12545 7 g m2 respectively in this study the sediment yield from the experimental plots was dependent on the rainfall depth and the rainfall intensity as the existing studies on post fire bare land showed the strong relation between soil erosion and rainfall intensity moody and martin 2001 shin et al 2013 the maximum runoff discharge and the maximum sediment yield during extreme rainfall event with a rainfall depth of 959 0 mm and a maximum rainfall intensity of 113 5 mm h were 336 mm and 8605 g m2 respectively from the gn1 plot of the sparse vegetation the plot sc4 and gn1 with sparse vegetation coverage showed larger runoff coefficients of about 30 than other plots the sc2 sc5 and gn4 plots with high vegetation coverage showed the small runoff coefficients 5 within the range of those on unburned slopes vega and díaz fierros 1987 scott and van wyk 1990 cerdà and lasanta 2005 in plot gn1 and gn3 sediment response rates shin et al 2013 the ratio of sediment yield to rainfall erosivity index wischmeier and smith 1958 were more than 4 0 g h j m sediment response rates from gn plots of sand soil were generally larger than these from sc plots of gravel soil in this study sediment yield from the experimental plots showed the strong relationship with water discharge as well as rainfall intensity the relationship between the surface runoff and the sediment yield from sc plots and gn plots was a power law function as in the table 2 the exponents of power law equations in sc4 gn1 and gn3 plots were higher than those in other plots and similar to exponents from 1 018 to 1 310 in harvest plots and skid rail plots presented by hartanto et al 2003 4 2 effective energy for interrill erosion the energy equations presented in 2 theory establishment were computed to analyze work of soil erosion from vegetated hillslopes table 3 shows the average values for the kinetic energies of freefalling and throughfall raindrops the effective kinetic energies of raindrops to detach soil particles the potential energies of rainwater on surface soil the potential energies of infiltration water the effective potential energies of surface runoff to transport soil particles the total input and effective energies and work of soil erosion in accordance with rainfall size and vegetation coverage the classification of the rainfall size and the vegetation coverage fallows the criterions presented by park et al 2012 the kinetic energy of freefalling rainfall ek was reduced greatly by vegetation cover and the litter layer under high plant coverage litter layers approximating fall velocity of raindrops to zero on soil surface caused larger kinetic energy loss than canopy covers it is consistent with results by wiersum 1984 ross and dykes 1996 and cerdà and doerr 2008 that litter layers significantly reduce soil erosion potential energy of rainwater reached on surface soil ep was reduced greatly by infiltration rather than interception of vegetation on densely vegetated plots energy lost by infiltration epf accounted for the highest percent of energy losses effective energy ee and work of soil erosion ws decreased with increase of vegetation and litter coverage total input energy of 4721 5408 j m2 was decreased greatly by factors of energy loss and only 466 798 7 j m2 of them was used as the effective energy for interrill erosion the works of soil erosion generated by natural rainfall events were fitted with the effective energies as in fig 4 a and b and relatively greater in plots with low versus high vegetation coverage the relationships between work of soil erosion and effective energy showed the power law function with high determination coefficients the correlation relationship for gravel soil plots samcheok site were better than those for the sandy soil plots gangneung site subjected to post fire treatments and continuous management in correlation analysis for variables such as topography soil rainfall energy and work of soil erosion the kinetic energy of rainfall was strongly correlated with rainfall depth than rainfall intensity the potential energy of rainwater ep had the strongest relationship with kinetic energy of rainfall the kinetic energy of rainfall impacting surface soil ekl showed a negative correlation with total vegetation effective ground and litter coverage whereas cumulative infiltration f depended greatly on rainfall depth r it was poorly correlated with antecedent rainfall depth and rainfall days it is the reason that deep and macropore soil in forested hillslopes has high infiltration capacities exceeding expected rainfall intensity and predominant subsurface flow brooks et al 2013 weiler and naef 2003 shin et al 2013 the potential energy of infiltration water epf had the highest correlation coefficient with potential energy of rainwater the potential energy of rainwater depends greatly on kinetic energy of rainfall this result corresponds to the study in which gomer 1994 suggested the infiltration rate was related to the cumulative kinetic energy and the rainfall intensity instead of a function of infiltration rate and time as in horton 1939 the effective potential energy of surface runoff eep determined by runoff discharge was strongly correlated with the kinetic energy of rainfall impacting surface soil ekl therefore it is certain that the kinetic energy of original rainfall is an important factor influencing infiltration and surface runoff in the correlation analysis between work of soil erosion and variables for each plot the factors for vegetation and litter layer exhibited a negative correlation whereas the factors for rainfall and energy exhibited a positive correlation table 4 in plots with vegetation coverage less than 70 as in sc1 sc4 and gn3 the correlation coefficients of the effective potential energy of surface runoff eep were greater than those of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall eek however the work of soil erosion in plots with high vegetation coverage sc2 sc5 and gn2 was significantly correlated with effective kinetic energy rather than effective potential energy the results indicate that soil erosion under high vegetation coverage is dictated by the effective kinetic energy of raindrops impacting surface soil whereas sediment yield from bare or sparsely vegetated plots is subject to the erosive energy of overland flow if discharge of overland flow is limited by increasing of depression storage roughness and infiltration rate in the high vegetation coverage interrill erosion depends dominantly on detachment of rainfall impact near downslope outlet however if transport capacity of overland flow is sufficient and enhanced by raindrop impact sediment concentration of interrill erosion increases guy et al 1987 proffitt and rose 1991 pierson et al 2008 and 2010 showed that runoff and erosion increase exponentially where bare soil and rock cover exceeded 50 60 on degraded rangelands and bare surfaces tend to concentrate overland flow on hillslope it indicates that main energy to produce sediment on rangeland hillslopes is converted from the kinetic energy of rainfall to the potential energy of surface runoff with the increase of bare land and rainfall amount the effective energy showed the highest correlation coefficient and small standard deviation in correlation analysis with the work of soil erosion as in table 4 the result demonstrates that the effective energy is the physical erosivity factor to explain interrill erosion on steep hillslopes having various vegetation cover 4 3 relative contribution of energies relative ratios of energy were evaluated to confirm the ratio of energies lost from the kinetic energy and the potential energy of original rain fig 5 the ratio of energy lost by vegetation canopy and litter layer to kinetic energy of gross rainfall increased mostly with vegetation coverage and storm size as in fig 5 a the relative ratio of potential energy lost by infiltration from potential energy of original rainwater also increased generally with vegetation cover and storm size and showed the largest rate among other energy losses fig 5 b the rate of potential energy lost by interception of plants decreased with storm size the kinetic energies lost by disturbance with vegetation and the litter accounted respectively for 29 8 19 9 and 33 5 25 9 to those of original rainfall the effective kinetic energy only was 6 57 4 63 of kinetic energy of original rainfall while the potential energy lost by interception accounted for only 10 7 4 9 the potential energy lost by infiltration was 75 8 13 1 as compared with the potential energy of original rainwater for plots with low middle and high vegetation coverage the relative proportions of effective kinetic energy of rainfall to total effective energy were respectively 28 8 42 8 and 35 3 fig 6 the rates of kinetic energy tended to increase with vegetation coverage but decreased in high vegetation coverage 70 accompanying to high litter coverage the result which the ratio of effective kinetic energy of rainfall to total effective energy was the greatest in vegetation coverage of 40 70 coincides with the experimental study of ghahramani et al 2011 that the contribution of splash erosion to total erosion was the greatest in moderate coverage the relative proportions of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy were respectively 71 2 57 2 and 64 7 according to low middle and high vegetation coverage and showed the greatest rate in low coverage plots generating dominant sheet erosion by overland flow fig 6 the relative ratios of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and the effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy were 35 6 and 64 4 respectively morgan et al 1986 presented that the energy available to transport soil particles by raindrop splash is generally less than that available from overland flow morgan et al 1986 however bryan 1974 luk 1979 bryan and luk 1981 sutherland et al 1996 and ghahramani et al 2011 showed significantly different results for the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport to interrill erosion it is the reason that they reflect differences in rainfall energy infiltration rates runoff energy soil texture aggregate stability configuration of the ground surface water development ground cover and experimental condition therefore relative ratio of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and the effective potential energy of surface runoff provides the physical information to assess the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport for field interrill erosion pearce 1976 suggested that only 0 2 of kinetic energy of falling raindrops and 3 to 4 of the energy of running water contribute to soil erosion and morgan 1978 assumed that 0 2 of the kinetic energy of raindrops and 3 of the kinetic energy of runoff is utilized in erosion in this study the rate of rainfall kinetic energy for erosion from steep vegetated hillslopes was 0 045 0 116 less than that studied by pearce 1976 in bare land of gentle slope the relative rate for the work of soil erosion to the effective energy changed from 0 013 to 1 352 with a mean of 0 292 0 841 the energy efficiency for soil erosion decreased with increasing vegetation cover was small mostly under high vegetation coverage because transport capacity of overland flow was limited by cover factors fig 6 however the energy efficiency under low vegetation coverage 40 was the greatest in heavy storm 380 mm the result explains that sediment yield from bare soil is influenced dominantly by transport capacity of overland flow concentrated under heavy rain raindrop impact also has a clear positive effect on sediment delivery beuselinck et al 2002 asadi et al 2007 however in medium rainfall size the effect was small especially it is the reason that transport capacity of sheet flow may be not enough to move the coarse soil particles and the energy loss is great by the vigorous interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes 4 4 relationship of effective energy and work of soil erosion the effective energy and the work of soil erosion had a power law relationship the constants exponents correlation coefficients and significance levels for the relationships were presented in table 5 with litter coverage fine root rate and gravel rate plot gn3 and gn4 were divided into two groups by the sparse and dense vegetation coverage due to rapid recovery of vegetation pearson s correlation analysis among the constant a exponent b and variables including litter layer rate lc fine root rate rc organic matter content om gravel rate gc mean diameter of soil particle dm and slope steepness s was conducted to trace the main parameters influencing on the constant and the exponent table 6 the constants in gn1 and gn2 of sandy soil were greatly higher than those in sc1 and sc3 of gravel soil although gn1versus sc1 and gn2 versus sc3 have similar vegetation coverage and slope gradient this implies that the constant of the power law is determined by the soil texture influencing on the shear stress to detach and transport soil particles everaert 1991 the critical shear velocity increases with particle size larger than 0 2 mm in diameter savat 1982 in this study physical characteristics for soil particles less than 0 1 mm were not considered because the sand and gravel accounted for more 90 of the soil texture therefore the critical shear stress may be proportional to the diameter of the soil particles in correlation analysis as in table 6 the gravel rate and diameter of soil particles showed the significantly negative coefficients with constant the constant corresponds to erodibility index of soil for interrill and rill erosion as presented from linear equation of wepp laflen et al 1991 flanagan and nearing 1995 in cropland and rangeland the adjustment factors for the erodibilty of interrill and rill erosion include canopy effects groundcover live and dead root interrill slope sealing and crusting and freeze thaw processes flanagan and nearing 1995 nearing et al 2011 al hamdan et al 2012 steep slope angle increases the potential energy of soil particles and decreases the critical shear stress required for the initial motion of soil particles moody et al 2005 however the influence of slope gradient on soil particle detachment has been often omitted because the distance equivalent to only a few drop diameters from the point of raindrop impact depends on the local slope and is difficult to be characterized by the effective slope morgan et al 1998 in this study the constant was not dependent greatly on slope gradient the litter and fine roots contribute to form the depression detention and retention storages and decrease the velocity of overland flow nearing et al 1999 miura et al 2003 miyata et al 2009 ghahramani et al 2011 shin et al 2013 while the exponents for sc2 sc5 gn2 gn3 2 and gn4 2 plots with high cover of litter layer and fine root were less than 1 those for sc1 sc4 and gn1 plots with low ground cover were lager than 1 table 5 the result indicates that ground covers contacted with surface soil decrease the efficiency of the effective energy to displace soil particles in other words an exponent of effective energy equation is dominated by the transport capacity of overland flow to entrain detached soil particles the exponent was strongly correlated with litter layer rate in correlation analysis of the relation between effective energy and work of soil erosion table 6 the exponent b in multi regression equation with the litter and the fine root showed especially the strong correlation coefficient r 0 930 and was expressed by logarithmic function as eq 22 22 b 0 274 ln 1 l c r c 0 882 where l c is the coverage ratio of litter layer r c is the weight ratio of fine root basically the rock cover not only protects the soil surface from erosion by intercepting rainfall impact and promoting infiltration but also is caused the surface to be hydraulically rough poesen et al 1990 nearing et al 1999 cerdà 2001 zavala and jordán 2008 zavala et al 2010 in field study the gravel particles on unstable position were frequently rolled down from steep upslope by normal rainfall events we shouldn t judge that rock fragment protect absolutely surface soil in the interrill erosion of steep hillslopes jean et al 2000 presented that the influence of rock cover varies with the gradient of the slope the rock fragments in steep slope induce the detour flow concentrated among grain particles or increase erosion risk due to gravity of themselves de figueiredo and poesen 1998 nearing et al 1999 as a result if the gravel or rock fragments are not embedded they act as the mulch increasing the infiltration rate meanwhile if they are inside the soil matrix they act as an impermeable surface and increase the surface runoff the physical process for interrill erosion by the complex interaction of raindrop and sheet flow is not explained solely by effective energy because velocity and depth of overland flow should be considered to evaluate transport capacity of sheet flow torri et al 1987 everaert et al 1991 in forested soils with extensive macropores and thick litter layer infiltration rate is relatively higher than in agricultural soils with similar texture berglund et al 1981 brooks et al 2013 the runoff coefficients were difficult to exceed 5 in vigorous oak or mixed forest land but wildfire areas used to show high surface runoff until regeneration of vegetation vega and díaz fierros 1987 scott and van wyk 1990 soto et al 1994 walsh et al 1994 cerdà 1998 cerdà and doerr 2005 shin et al 2013 cerdà et al 2017 therefore sheet flow on widely vegetated hillslopes was not easy to be characterized by velocity and depth of overland flow the constant of the power law corresponded on erodibility index of soil and the exponent was influenced by ground cover which determines transport capacity of overland flow in this study constants and exponents ranged respectively from 0 029 to 2 234 and from 0 696 to 1 483 plots with low ground coverage showed the exponent more than 1 0 while those with high ground coverage showed the exponent more than 1 0 the efficiency of effective energy for work of soil erosion changed on the basis of the exponent 1 0 if constant when exponent was 1 0 was calculated as average 0 8 from power law functions the relationship between effective energy and work of soil erosion is drawn by straight line as in fig 7 with data measured from plot sc1 and gn4 2 the figure implies that in b 1 0 detachment capacity is greater than transport capacity and that in b 1 0 transport capacity is greater than detachment capacity to improve of availability of effective energy equation the exponent depending on transport capacity of overland flow should be additionally studied with discharge and velocity variations of sheet flow according to a type and rate of ground cover 5 conclusions the work of soil particles detached and transported by rainfall impact and surface runoff was explained by energy expenditure of kinetic energy of rainfall and potential energy of surface runoff the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of rainwater was called the effective energy for interrill erosion the effective energy compared to other erosivity factors showed the highest correlation coefficient with the work of soil erosion as using field data with various vegetation conditions soil textures and slope angles soil erosion depended dominantly on the effect of potential energy of surface runoff on low covered plots and kinetic energy of rainfall impacting surface soil under high vegetation cover the results implied that the effective energy is useful as erosivity factor to evaluate interrill erosion from vegetated steep hillslopes the kinetic energy of rainfall and the potential energy of rainwater were greatly reduced by the litter layer and infiltration respectively the energy efficiency to transport the detached soil particles decreased generally with increase of vegetation coverage a discussion for the relation of the energy efficiency and the soil erosion demonstrated that the key factor to prevent excessive erosion is ground cover including the litter and root in power law function for effective energy the constants were subject to critical shear stress of soil particles and the exponents were determined by the capacity of overland flow to transport soil particles for future studies the physical model may be consistently improved by studying soil erodibility and hydraulic processes of interrill erosion conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work was supported from national

6663,the process of interrill erosion is complex by interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow their relative contribution to interrill erosion is difficult to be evaluated even on bare soil this study presents the new erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslope with the more relevant understanding of the physical processes the effective energy the erosivity factor is defined as the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance the effective kinetic energy of rainfall is determined by the horizontal component for slope of kinetic energy deducting energies dissipated by structure of vegetation canopies and a litter layer the effective potential energy of surface runoff is equal to potential energy of the available surface water following rain mass allocations of interception and infiltration the data from experimental field plots with various vegetation coverage after wildfire were used to verify the effective energy equation on densely vegetated slopes sediment yield depended greatly on effective kinetic energy of rainfall while they from hillslopes having sparse coverage were dominated by effective potential energy of surface runoff the dissipated energy due to interrill erosion showed the highest correlation coefficient with the effective energy under various cover conditions the kinetic energy of raindrops was greatly reduced by the litter layer and the potential energy of rainwater decreased predominantly due to infiltration the ratio of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy was the highest at 71 2 in the plots with low vegetation coverage the energy efficiency for interrill erosion increased with decreasing vegetation coverage and reached maximum 1 35 in extreme rainfall event under low vegetation coverage the constant and exponent of power law functions between the effective energy and the soil erosion work were strongly correlated with gravel ratio and litter coverage respectively the results indicate that the effective energy is useful erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion occurred by the complicated interaction of rain splash and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes keywords effective kinetic energy effective potential energy interrill erosion steep vegetated hillslope energy efficiency 1 introduction erosional features such as rills and gullies on croplands are rarely observed on forestlands despite steep slope having the primarily potential capacity for soil erosion on steep forested hillslopes interception and infiltration enhanced by ample vegetation coverage limit water availability for surface runoff and thereby inhibit formation of rill or concentrated flow processes cerdà and doerr 2005 shakesby and doerr 2006 smith and dragovich 2008 the interrill process combining rain splash with sheet flow is the dominant erosion mechanism on most hillslopes of forestland rangeland and lightly disturbed agricultural land miura et al 2003 ghahramani et al 2011 cerdà and doerr 2008 nearing et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2016 keesstra et al 2016 soils of forestland and rangeland are markedly different from those of typical cropland with steep slope the hillslopes are composed of young shallow and coarse grains including an extensive macropore berglund et al 1981 luce 1995 jean et al 2000 weiler and naef 2003 subsurface runoff rather than surface runoff is dominant by increasing infiltration rate with abundant plants in hillslopes quinn et al 1980 therefore surface runoff and soil erosion in even post fire land as well as forested land are generally less than those in agricultural land and other disturbed lands observed frequently rill and gully erosion vega and díaz fierros 1987 scott and van wyk 1990 soto et al 1994 walsh et al 1994 cerdà et al 2009 rodrigo comino et al 2015 seutloali and beckedahl 2015 interrill erosion on gentle bared slope less than 30 has been extensively studied as considering physically based hydraulic characteristic rose et al 1983 gilley et al 1985 guy et al 1987 proffitt and rose 1991 kinnell 1993 zhang et al 1998 while the study on steep vegetated hillslope has been limited due to the ground surface complexly structured by vegetation layers residual and litter layer and root system and the sheet flow interacted with continuous impact of throughfall raindrops the quantitative variations of sediment yield with hydrological response have been frequently surveyed with the effect of vegetation coverage miura et al 2003 miyata et al 2009 ghahramani et al 2011 shin et al 2013 the importance of splash erosion by raindrop impact in forestlands have been recognized since shallow overland flow of interrill erosion does not have enough power to break down the cohesive force between soil particles and transport the detached particles gabet and dunne 2003 miura et al 2003 miyata et al 2009 ghahramani et al 2011 ghahramani et al 2011 indicated that the contribution rates of erosion by raindrop splash and overland flow are varied with different ground coverage on a steep forested hillslope in even laboratory studies for bare soil bryan 1974 luk 1979 bryan and luk 1981 sutherland et al 1996 the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport to interrill erosion had shown significantly contrasting results therefore the reasonable erosivity factor is required to assess physically the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport in total sediment yield from steep vegetated hillslope in interrill erosion studies most historical approaches had parameterized rainfall intensity as erosivity factor meyer 1981 elliot et al 1989 liebenow et al 1990 more recently the splash sheet erosion equations considering rainfall intensity and runoff discharge as erosivity factor have been proposed to combine the effects of raindrop induced soil detachment and sediment transport by sheet flow kinnell 1993 zhang et al 1998 and wei et al 2009 shin and park 2018 the watershed erosion prediction project wepp flanagan and nearing 1995 which is one of the famous process based models adopted interrill erosion equation with regard to the effective rainfall intensity and runoff rate foster et al 1995 the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem nearing et al 2011 designed to improve the wepp limited in application to rangeland used rainfall intensity and surface runoff rate to evaluate the splash and sheet erosion from rangeland data wei et al 2009 the importance of linking kinetic energies of rainfall and runoff is further evident in erosion modeling studied by pearce 1976 and morgan 1978 pearce 1976 investigated the relationship of the kinetic energies with soil loss from runoff plots subjected to natural rainfall events and found that sediment yield and surface lowering are strongly correlated with total kinetic energies of rainfall and runoff morgan 1978 adopted the potential energy of runoff instead of the kinetic energy of runoff to parameterize with kinetic energy of rainfall in a regression equation to simulate sediment yield on gentle bare slopes morgan 1980 the interrill erosion processes of detachment and transport by raindrop and surface runoff are not separated definitely from natural or experimental data especially filed data measured from vegetated hillslopes are difficult to be interpreted by the separated physical approaches the new erosivity factor for interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslopes should be considered methodologically to analyze the complicated interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow in this study the effective energy as physical erosivity factor is suggested to evaluate splash and sheet erosion on steep vegetated hillslopes the specific objectives are 1 to present energy equations for partitioning input energy into energy losses associated with rainfall infiltration and runoff processes including energy dissipated by soil erosion 2 to analyze relationships of effective energies and dissipated energies for interrill erosion using field data on steep hillslopes with different vegetation coverage after wildfire 3 to assess the relative contribution of effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff and 4 to show the utilization of effective energy as erosivity factor to evaluate interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslopes 2 theory establishment 2 1 energy balance in the physical sense surface soil erosion is a process that work requires the expenditure of energy brooks et al 2013 the total input energy of rain worked on a sloping bare soil e in consists of the kinetic energy of rainfall e k and the potential energy of surface rainwater e p based on energy balance morgan 2005 1 e in e k e p the kinetic energy is expended to splash soil particles and the potential energy is used partially to transport soil particles by overland flow as shown in fig 1 in vegetated hillslope the total input energy is remarkably reduced by energies eloss lost due to 1 disturbance of rainfall through vegetation layer and litter layer 2 mass disappearance of raindrops such as interception by vegetation evapotranspiration and infiltration 3 collision and friction on raindrop impact with soil 4 friction of overland flow along the surface land turbulent mixing effects of surface irregularities and obstructions and flow meandering and 5 work to move soil particles to downslope ws therefore the total output energy eout of running surface water obtained by deducting the energy loss from the total input energy reduces significantly at the outlet point from hillslopes fig 1 at the outlet the potential energy of surface runoff is equal to 0 and the kinetic energy of running water is disregarded because velocity of surface runoff is much less than the terminal velocity of raindrops shin 2008 as a result the work to move soil particles from upslope to downslope is decided from the relationship of the total input energy and energy losses vegetation provides not only the canopy to reduce fall velocity of raindrops but also the litter layer and organic material to obstruct raindrops impacting directly the surface soil in vegetated hillslopes the kinetic energy of raindrops striking the soil surface is reduced by disturbance with vegetation cover and the litter layer from total energy of free falling raindrops the kinetic energy of rainfall on a non erodible slope i e rock rarely contributes to kinetic energy of running water because most rainfall kinetic energy is dissipated in impact with the surface soil pearce 1976 alternatively the raindrop impact consolidates and disperses the surface soil though raindrops splash soil particles on plane surface net transport rate approximates zero moss et al 1979 wright 1986 found that the raindrop velocity parallel to the slope surface determines the dispersion of splash droplets on a sloping surface more particles are thrown downslope than upslope morgan et al 1998 although the distance of several drop particles splashed from the point of raindrop impact depends on the local slope moss et al 1979 even on a slope soil covered with various crop as well as bare soil the soil particles splashed downslope are more than those splashed upslope mati 1994 the result is because slope angle mainly brings the addition of gravity to the drop detaching force torri and poesen 1992 thus rainfall kinetic energy lost by horizontal friction with the slope should be distinguished from energy lost by vertical collision with the surface soil under the ideal assumption that raindrops fall vertically without wind the horizontal component for slope direction of kinetic energy of raindrops works to splash and transport more particles downslope within boundary slope the rainfall kinetic energy of horizontal component increasing with slope angle is expressed as follows 2 e kh e k sin 2 θ where e kh is the horizontal kinetic energy of rainfall and θ is an angle of slope therefore the work of soil particles splashed by raindrop impact w sr is the function of the rainfall kinetic energy of horizontal component in eq 3 3 w sr f e kh the motion equation known as the second de saint venant equation is suitable for shallow flow the equation of kinematic wave which applies to steeply inclined water courses supposes that the local and convective acceleration terms and the pressure term can be disregarded without any great loss of accuracy woolhiser and liggett 1967 it explains that slope energy of shallow water is almost equal to frictional energy loss with slope surface yang 1972 presented unit stream power the expenditure rate of potential energy per specific weight to evaluate sediment transport in uniform flow on vegetated hillslope potential energy of surface runoff e pq is calculated as using the amount of water lost by interception surface depression storage and infiltration from free rainfall and expended mostly by friction with surface soil including work to transport soil particles w sq therefore the energy dissipated by sheet flow to transport soil particles is expressed as eq 4 4 w sq f e pq the total work to move soil particles done by splash sheet processes is equal to the sum of eqs 3 and 4 in the physical sense of expenditure of kinetic energy of rainfall and potential energy of surface water however if the slope is gentle or terraced frictional roughness is high or the resistance of the soil particles is large soil particles splashed by raindrop impact and transported by sheet flow may be deposited adjacent to roughness elements within hillslope of splash sheet erosion processes the raindrop impact is difficult to move materials from areas covered by flow kinnell 2005 but that into shallow water plays the role enhancing sediment transport by turbulence effects palmer 1964 zhang and wang 2017 therefore the real work for soil particles transported to downslope outlet may be smaller than the sum of work done by rainfall impact and sheet flow raindrop impact on steep hillslopes is generally splashing soil particles downslope from impact point as shown in fig 1 when splashed soil particles are loaded alternatively in sheet flow they may travel long distances with surface runoff sediment transported by overland flow includes constantly particles splashed downslope by raindrop impact the relative contribution of raindrop splash and sheet flow transport in total sediment yield is not easy to be separately evaluated due to the synchronous interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow in other words work of interrill erosion by raindrop induced flow on steep slopes can be expressed by the function of the sum of the horizontal kinetic energy of raindrop impact and the potential energy of surface water 5 w s f e kh e pq 2 2 effective kinetic energy the effective kinetic energy of rainfall is derived through partitioning or deducting energy losses from total kinetic energy of free falling raindrops preferentially the total kinetic energy for rainfall event is calculated by the summation of rainfall kinetic energy per unit time throughout rainfall duration as follows 6 e k t 1 t e kt where the time specific kinetic energy of rainfall e kt is the kinetic energy of rainfall per unit area and per unit time j m2 h t is the duration h of a rainfall event and e k is the total kinetic energy of rainfall per unit area j m2 for free falling raindrops the time specific rainfall kinetic energy of raindrops is commonly expressed as the rainfall power or kinetic energy flux density kinnell 1991 smith and de veaux 1992 madden et al 1998 steiner and smith 2000 and derived from 7 e kt 3 6 10 3 ρ w π 12 i n x d i d i 3 v 2 d i where ρ w is the density of raindrop kg m3 d i is the diameter in raindrop cm and v is the terminal velocity of raindrop m s the calculation of kinetic energy requires an analysis of the raindrop distribution as well as raindrop size and drop velocity measurements in spite of the difficulties posed by temporal and spatial variability of raindrops it is possible to derive general relations between kinetic energy e kt and rainfall intensity i the kinetic energy of rainfall have been simply estimated by exponential logarithmic and power law functions of relationship with rainfall intensity wischmeier and smith 1958 zanchi and torri 1980 rosewell 1986 brown and foster 1987 brandt 1990 mcisaac 1990 smith and de veaux 1992 coutinho and tomás 1995 uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 steiner and smith 2000 salles et al 2002 van dijk et al 2002 fornis et al 2005 lee and won 2013 shin et al 2016 the main components of the interception process by vegetation are the throughfall stemflow and interception loss the kinetic energy of raindrops falling through vegetation is affected by fall velocity and diameter of throughfall raindrops depending on vegetation structure the kinetic energy on vegetated terrain is split into the atmospheric raindrops falling onto open ground and the raindrops that pass through plant canopy the total kinetic energy of water droplets on vegetated hillslope is calculated as follows 8 e kv 1 α e k e t 9 e t 1 2 m t v t 2 where e kv j m2 is the kinetic energy of raindrop through vegetation α is the ratio of ground covered by the vegetation e t is the kinetic energy of the throughfall raindrops j m2 and v t is the fall velocity of raindrops m s with different fall heights the mass of throughfall m t kg m2 is estimated by empirical equations for interception loss and stemflow zhou et al 2002 kim 1994 where the hillslope is covered with homogeneous plants m t is expressed as follows 10 m t α r i l p s ρ w where r is the gross rainfall mm i l is the interception of rainfall by plant canopy mm p s is the stemflow mm the fall velocity of throughfall raindrops is dependent on several factors zhou et al 2002 average fall height m average water droplet diameter mm and the velocities of water droplets of various sizes falling from different heights raindrop diameters of throughfall are influenced by plant species and canopy structures including such factors as leaf direction and canopy shape instead of the intensity of atmospheric rainfall zhou 1997 1999 the fall velocity of through falling droplets that diameter ranges from 3 5 mm to 4 1 mm increases with fall distance zhou et al 2002 therefore the kinetic energy of the leaf drainage is dependent greatly upon the height of the plant canopy brandt 1990 morgan 2001 however most mixed forest are overlap by canopy cover having a high fall height and ground cover including shrubs and herbs the complexity of mixed vegetation layers should be quantified to evaluate the kinetic energy shin 2008 calculated effective canopy and ground covers for the kinetic energy of rainfall operating directly on the ground and used the average height by a function of the weighted coverage of vegetation layers as a result the kinetic energy of raindrops through various vegetation layers e t is calculated by the mass m tc and fall velocity v tc for raindrops falling through the effective canopy cover and the mass m tg and fall velocity v tg for raindrops falling through the effective ground cover in eq 11 11 e t 1 2 m tc v tc 2 m tg v tg 2 the litter layer including residuals provides the main protection for the mineral soil and prevents raindrops splash and particle detachment ross and dykes 1996 the kinetic energy of raindrops falling thorough the litter layer is reduced to zero at the soil surface binkley and brown 1993 because the fall height is very low the kinetic energy of rainfall through vegetation layers including the litter layer e kl on surface soil is recalculated by coverage ratio of the litter layer l c 12 e kl 1 l c e kv the kinetic energy of raindrop impacting on surface soil covered by the vegetation and litter layers is expressed by combination of eq 2 eq 8 and eq 12 13 e ek 1 l c 1 α e k e t sin 2 θ where e ek is the effective kinetic energy of rainfall to evaluate the work of soil particles splashed by raindrop impact on steep vegetated hillslopes 2 3 effective potential energy the potential energy of total rainwater is retained by steep slopes whereas kinetic energy of raindrops reaching on the soil surface is predominantly dissipated the potential energy for accumulated mass of raindrops reached on the hillslope is expressed as in eq 14 14 e p γ w r h where γ w is specific weight of raindrop kg m3 and h is the mean height of hillslope from runoff outlet m and calculated by the slope length l m and the gradient θ of slope such as l sin θ 2 the potential energy depends on the geometric shape of the hillslope ruhe 1975 devised a useful classification scheme for landforms defined for four configurations linear convex concave and sine curve the convex shape shows the highest potential energy of surface water rather than other shapes due to the highest mean height if non uniform slope within watershed is divided into segments of plot scale the geometric shape of one segment is assumed as linear slope foster and wischmeier 1974 interception of vegetation leads to the mass loss of 8 12 of the total rainfall as the results shown by zhou et al 2002 and kim 1994 thus the potential energy of rainwater reached on the surface soil as stemflow and throughfall after interception loss of the vegetation layers is 15 e pv γ w r i l h where e pv is the total potential energy of rainwater through vegetation j m2 and i l is the rainfall depth lost by interception mm additional loss of the potential energy is caused by rainwater infiltrated and stored into the soil layer the potential energy of rainwater contributed to infiltration and storage also is expressed by the function of the mean height of the hillslope as in eq 16 16 e pf γ w f h where e pf is the potential energy for infiltrated and stored rainwater j m2 and f is the accumulated infiltration mm the remaining energy reduced by interception infiltration and storage from potential energy of total rainwater is equal to potential energy of surface water contributed to overland flow e pq as in eq 17 17 e pq γ w r i l f h the potential energy of surface runoff is simply calculated by the runoff depth mm and the gradient of slope and becomes the effective potential energy e ep for sediment transported by sheet flow 2 4 work of soil erosion the work to transport and detach soil particles is expressed by multiplication of the displacement and the component of shear stress to move soil particles 18 w s τ s s where τ s is the shear stress of soil particle kg m2 and s is the mean displacement m of eroded soil particles in eq 18 it should be assumed that soil erosion occurs homogeneously along the unit slope and the slope is linear the shear stress of eroded soil particles is calculated by sin component for the weight of sediment yield per unit area kg m2 and the mean displacement is simply calculated by l 2 although the motion of eroded soil particles actually complicates due to the interaction between rainfall impact and sheet flow the work of soil erosion is equal to the energy dissipated by soil particles eroded from straight slope e d as presented by morgan 1978 for the first time 19 e d m s g h where m s is the mass of sediment kg m2 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 it means that the potential energy of soil particles positioned on steep hillslopes is dissipated by work frictional loss of soil particles transported and splashed from upslope to downslope in soil erosion processes the total effective energy for interrill erosion e e is the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and the effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance 20 e e e ek e ep therefore the work of soil erosion has the proportional function with the effective energy and the relationship is commonly power law equation as follows 21 w s a e e b where a and b are respectively constant and exponent of relationship between the work of soil erosion and the effective energy they are influenced by soil texture ground cover terrain and etc the flow chart in fig 2 shows the general process to calculate the effective energy of soil erosion when vegetation and litter layers exist on hillslope surface the effective kinetic energy of rainfall reflects the complex structure of cover factors and the effective potential energy of surface runoff considers the effect of interception the infiltration is the important factor to evaluate the effective potential energy of surface runoff whether soil is bare or not 3 methods 3 1 site description the physical erosivity factor for interrill erosion in steep vegetated hillslopes was evaluated as using field date the data for runoff and soil erosion had been collected to develop soil erosion model semma in the mountainous field experiment park et al 2012 nine plots with different vegetation recovery after wildfire were selected among fifty two plots two study sites samcheok and gangneung including the plots had been surveyed for five years after wildfire in 2000 the samcheok site was located at latitude 37 13 48 n and longitude 129 18 34 e and the gangneung site was located at latitude 37 48 50 n and longitude 128 48 25 e in south korea the dominant plant prior to burning was pinus densiflora but burning induced conversion of vegetation type to quercus at both sites the parent rocks of samcheok and gangneung are respectively the archaeozoic proterozoic era yulri group and the jurassic daebo granite kim et al 2001 in usda soil taxonomy a soil order of them is inceptisols that have altered horizons that have lost bases or iron and aluminum but retain some weatherable minerals and the suborder is udepts shown in humid climates nias 2016 3 2 observed data the topography soil and vegetation characteristics for the experimental plots installed within the two sites are represented in table 1 in samcheok plots sc1 sc5 the soil was composed of gravel of 32 sand of 64 and silt and clay of 4 and the very fine gravel which the mean diameter dm was 1 75 0 53 mm from sieve analysis the soil of gangneung plots gn1 gn4 was the coarse sand that the mean diameter was 0 87 0 16 mm and the ratios of gravel sand and silt and clay accounted for 19 76 and 5 respectively vegetation of nine plots showed various recovery conditions after wildfire fig 3 the sc1 and sc4 plots in the samcheok site had a low vegetation coverage as shown in fig 3 b plot sc5 with vegetation coverage of 90 100 is control plot located within an unburned pine forest plots gn1 gn4 installed in the gangneung site fig 3 c and d were treated in post fire 2001 although gn2 and gn4 plots showed the fast regeneration of native plants gn1 maintained the low vegetation coverage less than 40 plants of gn3 plots were recovered rapidly by treatment of terrace sodding the dry weight of fine roots diameter 2 mm was calculated from the relation functions of vegetation index based on the vegetation structure lee and park 2005 the percentage of fine root rc is the rate of the real dry weight to maximum dry weight of the fine roots propagated on surface soil park et al 2012 the plots with dense vegetation coverage tend to show the deep soil depth and high content of organic matter rainfall data were obtained from the automatic tipping bucket rain gauges established within each site and the korea meteorological administration kma data from kma for 1980 2010 years indicated that the annual average temperature and rainfall at gangneung were 13 1 c and 1464 5 mm respectively and those at uljin nearby samcheok were 12 6 c and 1278 9 mm respectively the rainfall events associated with convective and orographic storms and typhoons were concentrated in the summer season shin et al 2013 the ranges of rainfall depth r and maximum rainfall intensity i for each rainfall event were respectively 20 0 959 0 mm and 3 0 113 5 mm h from rain gauges in the study sites sediment and runoff generated by rainfall events were collected in a trap connected with a tank park et al 2012 runoff discharge was measured directly in the field as using sample buckets sediment deposited in the trap were sampled and dried in 105 c oven to obtain the dry weight in this study the rainfall kinetic energy was calculated from the exponential equation of rainfall kinetic energy intensity relationship using rain drop distribution data measured at the daegwanryeong weather station located within 20 km from gangneung lee and won 2013 3 3 data analysis systat version 10 spss inc chicago il statistical package was used for all statistical analyses correlation and regression analyses between soil erosion and variables such as rainfall cover and energy factors were performed to evaluate the energy equation for work of soil erosion log transformation was used to normalize data in correlation analysis of the relationship between interrill erosion and variables multiple regression analysis between coefficient a and exponent b of the effective energy equations and main parameters conducted to evaluate the power law equation for interrill erosion the significance levels of p 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 were used for all correlation analyses 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface runoff and sediment yield total 221 data of surface runoff and soil loss measured in nine plots were used to calculate the effective energies for interrill erosion table 2 total rainfall depth in each plot during the monitoring time from may to october 2001 2005 was the range of 2198 5 4155 5 mm the total surface runoff and the total sediment yield according to the total rainfall depth were 22 4 1375 4 mm and 32 0 12545 7 g m2 respectively in this study the sediment yield from the experimental plots was dependent on the rainfall depth and the rainfall intensity as the existing studies on post fire bare land showed the strong relation between soil erosion and rainfall intensity moody and martin 2001 shin et al 2013 the maximum runoff discharge and the maximum sediment yield during extreme rainfall event with a rainfall depth of 959 0 mm and a maximum rainfall intensity of 113 5 mm h were 336 mm and 8605 g m2 respectively from the gn1 plot of the sparse vegetation the plot sc4 and gn1 with sparse vegetation coverage showed larger runoff coefficients of about 30 than other plots the sc2 sc5 and gn4 plots with high vegetation coverage showed the small runoff coefficients 5 within the range of those on unburned slopes vega and díaz fierros 1987 scott and van wyk 1990 cerdà and lasanta 2005 in plot gn1 and gn3 sediment response rates shin et al 2013 the ratio of sediment yield to rainfall erosivity index wischmeier and smith 1958 were more than 4 0 g h j m sediment response rates from gn plots of sand soil were generally larger than these from sc plots of gravel soil in this study sediment yield from the experimental plots showed the strong relationship with water discharge as well as rainfall intensity the relationship between the surface runoff and the sediment yield from sc plots and gn plots was a power law function as in the table 2 the exponents of power law equations in sc4 gn1 and gn3 plots were higher than those in other plots and similar to exponents from 1 018 to 1 310 in harvest plots and skid rail plots presented by hartanto et al 2003 4 2 effective energy for interrill erosion the energy equations presented in 2 theory establishment were computed to analyze work of soil erosion from vegetated hillslopes table 3 shows the average values for the kinetic energies of freefalling and throughfall raindrops the effective kinetic energies of raindrops to detach soil particles the potential energies of rainwater on surface soil the potential energies of infiltration water the effective potential energies of surface runoff to transport soil particles the total input and effective energies and work of soil erosion in accordance with rainfall size and vegetation coverage the classification of the rainfall size and the vegetation coverage fallows the criterions presented by park et al 2012 the kinetic energy of freefalling rainfall ek was reduced greatly by vegetation cover and the litter layer under high plant coverage litter layers approximating fall velocity of raindrops to zero on soil surface caused larger kinetic energy loss than canopy covers it is consistent with results by wiersum 1984 ross and dykes 1996 and cerdà and doerr 2008 that litter layers significantly reduce soil erosion potential energy of rainwater reached on surface soil ep was reduced greatly by infiltration rather than interception of vegetation on densely vegetated plots energy lost by infiltration epf accounted for the highest percent of energy losses effective energy ee and work of soil erosion ws decreased with increase of vegetation and litter coverage total input energy of 4721 5408 j m2 was decreased greatly by factors of energy loss and only 466 798 7 j m2 of them was used as the effective energy for interrill erosion the works of soil erosion generated by natural rainfall events were fitted with the effective energies as in fig 4 a and b and relatively greater in plots with low versus high vegetation coverage the relationships between work of soil erosion and effective energy showed the power law function with high determination coefficients the correlation relationship for gravel soil plots samcheok site were better than those for the sandy soil plots gangneung site subjected to post fire treatments and continuous management in correlation analysis for variables such as topography soil rainfall energy and work of soil erosion the kinetic energy of rainfall was strongly correlated with rainfall depth than rainfall intensity the potential energy of rainwater ep had the strongest relationship with kinetic energy of rainfall the kinetic energy of rainfall impacting surface soil ekl showed a negative correlation with total vegetation effective ground and litter coverage whereas cumulative infiltration f depended greatly on rainfall depth r it was poorly correlated with antecedent rainfall depth and rainfall days it is the reason that deep and macropore soil in forested hillslopes has high infiltration capacities exceeding expected rainfall intensity and predominant subsurface flow brooks et al 2013 weiler and naef 2003 shin et al 2013 the potential energy of infiltration water epf had the highest correlation coefficient with potential energy of rainwater the potential energy of rainwater depends greatly on kinetic energy of rainfall this result corresponds to the study in which gomer 1994 suggested the infiltration rate was related to the cumulative kinetic energy and the rainfall intensity instead of a function of infiltration rate and time as in horton 1939 the effective potential energy of surface runoff eep determined by runoff discharge was strongly correlated with the kinetic energy of rainfall impacting surface soil ekl therefore it is certain that the kinetic energy of original rainfall is an important factor influencing infiltration and surface runoff in the correlation analysis between work of soil erosion and variables for each plot the factors for vegetation and litter layer exhibited a negative correlation whereas the factors for rainfall and energy exhibited a positive correlation table 4 in plots with vegetation coverage less than 70 as in sc1 sc4 and gn3 the correlation coefficients of the effective potential energy of surface runoff eep were greater than those of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall eek however the work of soil erosion in plots with high vegetation coverage sc2 sc5 and gn2 was significantly correlated with effective kinetic energy rather than effective potential energy the results indicate that soil erosion under high vegetation coverage is dictated by the effective kinetic energy of raindrops impacting surface soil whereas sediment yield from bare or sparsely vegetated plots is subject to the erosive energy of overland flow if discharge of overland flow is limited by increasing of depression storage roughness and infiltration rate in the high vegetation coverage interrill erosion depends dominantly on detachment of rainfall impact near downslope outlet however if transport capacity of overland flow is sufficient and enhanced by raindrop impact sediment concentration of interrill erosion increases guy et al 1987 proffitt and rose 1991 pierson et al 2008 and 2010 showed that runoff and erosion increase exponentially where bare soil and rock cover exceeded 50 60 on degraded rangelands and bare surfaces tend to concentrate overland flow on hillslope it indicates that main energy to produce sediment on rangeland hillslopes is converted from the kinetic energy of rainfall to the potential energy of surface runoff with the increase of bare land and rainfall amount the effective energy showed the highest correlation coefficient and small standard deviation in correlation analysis with the work of soil erosion as in table 4 the result demonstrates that the effective energy is the physical erosivity factor to explain interrill erosion on steep hillslopes having various vegetation cover 4 3 relative contribution of energies relative ratios of energy were evaluated to confirm the ratio of energies lost from the kinetic energy and the potential energy of original rain fig 5 the ratio of energy lost by vegetation canopy and litter layer to kinetic energy of gross rainfall increased mostly with vegetation coverage and storm size as in fig 5 a the relative ratio of potential energy lost by infiltration from potential energy of original rainwater also increased generally with vegetation cover and storm size and showed the largest rate among other energy losses fig 5 b the rate of potential energy lost by interception of plants decreased with storm size the kinetic energies lost by disturbance with vegetation and the litter accounted respectively for 29 8 19 9 and 33 5 25 9 to those of original rainfall the effective kinetic energy only was 6 57 4 63 of kinetic energy of original rainfall while the potential energy lost by interception accounted for only 10 7 4 9 the potential energy lost by infiltration was 75 8 13 1 as compared with the potential energy of original rainwater for plots with low middle and high vegetation coverage the relative proportions of effective kinetic energy of rainfall to total effective energy were respectively 28 8 42 8 and 35 3 fig 6 the rates of kinetic energy tended to increase with vegetation coverage but decreased in high vegetation coverage 70 accompanying to high litter coverage the result which the ratio of effective kinetic energy of rainfall to total effective energy was the greatest in vegetation coverage of 40 70 coincides with the experimental study of ghahramani et al 2011 that the contribution of splash erosion to total erosion was the greatest in moderate coverage the relative proportions of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy were respectively 71 2 57 2 and 64 7 according to low middle and high vegetation coverage and showed the greatest rate in low coverage plots generating dominant sheet erosion by overland flow fig 6 the relative ratios of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and the effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy were 35 6 and 64 4 respectively morgan et al 1986 presented that the energy available to transport soil particles by raindrop splash is generally less than that available from overland flow morgan et al 1986 however bryan 1974 luk 1979 bryan and luk 1981 sutherland et al 1996 and ghahramani et al 2011 showed significantly different results for the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport to interrill erosion it is the reason that they reflect differences in rainfall energy infiltration rates runoff energy soil texture aggregate stability configuration of the ground surface water development ground cover and experimental condition therefore relative ratio of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and the effective potential energy of surface runoff provides the physical information to assess the relative contribution of raindrop splash and runoff transport for field interrill erosion pearce 1976 suggested that only 0 2 of kinetic energy of falling raindrops and 3 to 4 of the energy of running water contribute to soil erosion and morgan 1978 assumed that 0 2 of the kinetic energy of raindrops and 3 of the kinetic energy of runoff is utilized in erosion in this study the rate of rainfall kinetic energy for erosion from steep vegetated hillslopes was 0 045 0 116 less than that studied by pearce 1976 in bare land of gentle slope the relative rate for the work of soil erosion to the effective energy changed from 0 013 to 1 352 with a mean of 0 292 0 841 the energy efficiency for soil erosion decreased with increasing vegetation cover was small mostly under high vegetation coverage because transport capacity of overland flow was limited by cover factors fig 6 however the energy efficiency under low vegetation coverage 40 was the greatest in heavy storm 380 mm the result explains that sediment yield from bare soil is influenced dominantly by transport capacity of overland flow concentrated under heavy rain raindrop impact also has a clear positive effect on sediment delivery beuselinck et al 2002 asadi et al 2007 however in medium rainfall size the effect was small especially it is the reason that transport capacity of sheet flow may be not enough to move the coarse soil particles and the energy loss is great by the vigorous interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes 4 4 relationship of effective energy and work of soil erosion the effective energy and the work of soil erosion had a power law relationship the constants exponents correlation coefficients and significance levels for the relationships were presented in table 5 with litter coverage fine root rate and gravel rate plot gn3 and gn4 were divided into two groups by the sparse and dense vegetation coverage due to rapid recovery of vegetation pearson s correlation analysis among the constant a exponent b and variables including litter layer rate lc fine root rate rc organic matter content om gravel rate gc mean diameter of soil particle dm and slope steepness s was conducted to trace the main parameters influencing on the constant and the exponent table 6 the constants in gn1 and gn2 of sandy soil were greatly higher than those in sc1 and sc3 of gravel soil although gn1versus sc1 and gn2 versus sc3 have similar vegetation coverage and slope gradient this implies that the constant of the power law is determined by the soil texture influencing on the shear stress to detach and transport soil particles everaert 1991 the critical shear velocity increases with particle size larger than 0 2 mm in diameter savat 1982 in this study physical characteristics for soil particles less than 0 1 mm were not considered because the sand and gravel accounted for more 90 of the soil texture therefore the critical shear stress may be proportional to the diameter of the soil particles in correlation analysis as in table 6 the gravel rate and diameter of soil particles showed the significantly negative coefficients with constant the constant corresponds to erodibility index of soil for interrill and rill erosion as presented from linear equation of wepp laflen et al 1991 flanagan and nearing 1995 in cropland and rangeland the adjustment factors for the erodibilty of interrill and rill erosion include canopy effects groundcover live and dead root interrill slope sealing and crusting and freeze thaw processes flanagan and nearing 1995 nearing et al 2011 al hamdan et al 2012 steep slope angle increases the potential energy of soil particles and decreases the critical shear stress required for the initial motion of soil particles moody et al 2005 however the influence of slope gradient on soil particle detachment has been often omitted because the distance equivalent to only a few drop diameters from the point of raindrop impact depends on the local slope and is difficult to be characterized by the effective slope morgan et al 1998 in this study the constant was not dependent greatly on slope gradient the litter and fine roots contribute to form the depression detention and retention storages and decrease the velocity of overland flow nearing et al 1999 miura et al 2003 miyata et al 2009 ghahramani et al 2011 shin et al 2013 while the exponents for sc2 sc5 gn2 gn3 2 and gn4 2 plots with high cover of litter layer and fine root were less than 1 those for sc1 sc4 and gn1 plots with low ground cover were lager than 1 table 5 the result indicates that ground covers contacted with surface soil decrease the efficiency of the effective energy to displace soil particles in other words an exponent of effective energy equation is dominated by the transport capacity of overland flow to entrain detached soil particles the exponent was strongly correlated with litter layer rate in correlation analysis of the relation between effective energy and work of soil erosion table 6 the exponent b in multi regression equation with the litter and the fine root showed especially the strong correlation coefficient r 0 930 and was expressed by logarithmic function as eq 22 22 b 0 274 ln 1 l c r c 0 882 where l c is the coverage ratio of litter layer r c is the weight ratio of fine root basically the rock cover not only protects the soil surface from erosion by intercepting rainfall impact and promoting infiltration but also is caused the surface to be hydraulically rough poesen et al 1990 nearing et al 1999 cerdà 2001 zavala and jordán 2008 zavala et al 2010 in field study the gravel particles on unstable position were frequently rolled down from steep upslope by normal rainfall events we shouldn t judge that rock fragment protect absolutely surface soil in the interrill erosion of steep hillslopes jean et al 2000 presented that the influence of rock cover varies with the gradient of the slope the rock fragments in steep slope induce the detour flow concentrated among grain particles or increase erosion risk due to gravity of themselves de figueiredo and poesen 1998 nearing et al 1999 as a result if the gravel or rock fragments are not embedded they act as the mulch increasing the infiltration rate meanwhile if they are inside the soil matrix they act as an impermeable surface and increase the surface runoff the physical process for interrill erosion by the complex interaction of raindrop and sheet flow is not explained solely by effective energy because velocity and depth of overland flow should be considered to evaluate transport capacity of sheet flow torri et al 1987 everaert et al 1991 in forested soils with extensive macropores and thick litter layer infiltration rate is relatively higher than in agricultural soils with similar texture berglund et al 1981 brooks et al 2013 the runoff coefficients were difficult to exceed 5 in vigorous oak or mixed forest land but wildfire areas used to show high surface runoff until regeneration of vegetation vega and díaz fierros 1987 scott and van wyk 1990 soto et al 1994 walsh et al 1994 cerdà 1998 cerdà and doerr 2005 shin et al 2013 cerdà et al 2017 therefore sheet flow on widely vegetated hillslopes was not easy to be characterized by velocity and depth of overland flow the constant of the power law corresponded on erodibility index of soil and the exponent was influenced by ground cover which determines transport capacity of overland flow in this study constants and exponents ranged respectively from 0 029 to 2 234 and from 0 696 to 1 483 plots with low ground coverage showed the exponent more than 1 0 while those with high ground coverage showed the exponent more than 1 0 the efficiency of effective energy for work of soil erosion changed on the basis of the exponent 1 0 if constant when exponent was 1 0 was calculated as average 0 8 from power law functions the relationship between effective energy and work of soil erosion is drawn by straight line as in fig 7 with data measured from plot sc1 and gn4 2 the figure implies that in b 1 0 detachment capacity is greater than transport capacity and that in b 1 0 transport capacity is greater than detachment capacity to improve of availability of effective energy equation the exponent depending on transport capacity of overland flow should be additionally studied with discharge and velocity variations of sheet flow according to a type and rate of ground cover 5 conclusions the work of soil particles detached and transported by rainfall impact and surface runoff was explained by energy expenditure of kinetic energy of rainfall and potential energy of surface runoff the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of rainwater was called the effective energy for interrill erosion the effective energy compared to other erosivity factors showed the highest correlation coefficient with the work of soil erosion as using field data with various vegetation conditions soil textures and slope angles soil erosion depended dominantly on the effect of potential energy of surface runoff on low covered plots and kinetic energy of rainfall impacting surface soil under high vegetation cover the results implied that the effective energy is useful as erosivity factor to evaluate interrill erosion from vegetated steep hillslopes the kinetic energy of rainfall and the potential energy of rainwater were greatly reduced by the litter layer and infiltration respectively the energy efficiency to transport the detached soil particles decreased generally with increase of vegetation coverage a discussion for the relation of the energy efficiency and the soil erosion demonstrated that the key factor to prevent excessive erosion is ground cover including the litter and root in power law function for effective energy the constants were subject to critical shear stress of soil particles and the exponents were determined by the capacity of overland flow to transport soil particles for future studies the physical model may be consistently improved by studying soil erodibility and hydraulic processes of interrill erosion conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work was supported from national

pollutants found from nonpoint sources may include suspended solids heavy metals chlorides oil and grease bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms tsihrintzis and hamid 1997 barbosa et al 2012 these pollutants are generated over urban catchments and are carried by runoff to receiving waters fletcher et al 2013 as an effective storm water management practice detention ponds can be utilized for both flood and water quality control behera and teegavarapu 2015 proper control of outflow from a detention pond is required to ensure sufficient residence time needed for the settling and decay of pollutants guo and adams 1999 outflow control is commonly achieved through the use of an orifice with a properly selected diameter runoff draining to the pond from the majority of rainfall events will go through the orifice and then flow downstream under extremely large rainfall events part of the generated runoff may by pass or overflow from the detention pond because the pond is totally filled before the end of the runoff event the runoff that by passes or overflows from the pond is considered as not receiving any treatment the long term average fraction of removal of total suspended solids is commonly used as the main design criteria for water quality control purposes since it is difficult to directly quantify this fraction it is often estimated as a positive linear function of the runoff capture efficiency provided by a detention pond guo and adams 1999 chen and adams 2006 the runoff capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total volume of runoff captured by a detention pond instead of overflowing from or by passing the detention pond in this study the runoff capture efficiency is selected as a representative performance measure for the evaluation of the water quality control performance of detention ponds models used for evaluating the long term average performance of detention facilities can be classified into two types continuous simulation models and analytical probabilistic models guo and adams 1999 wang and guo 2018 continuous simulation models are appealing because they can simulate the natural sequences of the occurrence of runoff events however continuous simulation is data intensive and time consuming adams and papa 2000 chen and adams 2007 analytical probabilistic models were developed by researchers employing probability distributions to represent rainfall characteristics of different locations and these models estimate pond performance statistics using analytical equations the analytical equations used in the analytical probabilistic models were derived based on simplified representations of the event by event operation of detention ponds assumptions about how full the pond is at the beginning of an operation cycle are required in those simplified representations howard 1976 loganathan and delleur 1984 guo and baetz 2007 zhang and guo 2013 ursino 2015 bacchi et al 2008 balistrocchi et al 2009 2013 zhang and guo 2014 which may cause an underestimation or overestimation of the performance statistics for some unusual or extreme cases besides in the previously developed analytical probabilistic models of detention ponds the pond s outflow is often assumed to be constant li and adams 2000 chen and adams 2005 or the discharge storage relationship of the pond is approximated by linear functions guo and adams 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 2017 actually a power function is a more realistic representation of the discharge storage relationship when orifice is used as the outflow control device to overcome the shortcomings of the previously developed analytical probabilistic models in this study an alternative analytical stochastic approach is developed for evaluating the performance of orifice type detention ponds for water quality control purposes as an appealing alternative the analytical stochastic approach describes rainfall characteristics of a location using the theories of stochastic processes this approach was first proposed by rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 and has been widely applied in the study of soil moisture dynamics rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 proporato et al 2004 recent studies have extended the application of the stochastic approach to urban storm water management with models developed for green roofs guo 2016 rainwater harvesting systems guo and guo 2018 pelak and porporato 2016 permeable pavements guo et al 2018 and combined sewer overflow tanks wang and guo 2018 in the above cited stochastic studies for urban storm water management purposes however the rates of outflow from the storage components are all treated as constant in this study an analytical stochastic model is developed to evaluate the runoff capture efficiency of detention ponds with non linear storage discharge relationships the analytical results are compared with continuous simulation results and the developed stochastic model is tested and validated with rainfall data from jackson mississippi usa 2 methods 2 1 stochastic description of point rainfall series an observed historical rainfall series can be separated into individual rainfall events linked by inter event dry times of different lengths for many locations the frequency distributions of the rainfall event depth v i e the distribution of the frequency of occurrence of rainfall events with different depths event duration u and inter event time b can all be fitted well by exponential probability density functions pdfs exponential pdfs were therefore recommended for use in the design of storm water management facilities at many locations in the u s u s epa 1986 wanielista and yousef 1993 hassini and guo 2016 exponential pdfs have also been adopted for describing rainfall event characteristics at many other locations around the world including canada adams and papa 2000 south korea lee and kim 2018 malaysia shamsudin et al 2014 and italy ursino 2015 the exponential pdfs of rainfall event characteristics can be described as 1 f v v ζ epx ζ v v 0 2 f u u λ exp λ u u 0 3 f b b ψ exp ψ b b 0 where ζ λ and ψ are distribution parameters which can be estimated as ζ 1 v λ 1 u ψ 1 b where is the ensemble average operator suitable techniques for parameter estimation and procedures of goodness of fit tests can be found in hassini and guo 2016 the validity of the assumed exponential distributions of rainfall event characteristics will be examined by comparing the analytical results obtained based on the assumed distributions with those from long term continuous simulations where no such assumptions are required in using the stochastic approach for describing the rainfall series of a location the sequential occurrence of rainfall events with different depths is represented as a marked poisson process restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 wang and guo 2018 the individual rainfall event is treated as occurring instantaneously rather than with a duration u rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 therefore the constitution of the point rainfall series is simplified as instantaneous rainfall event jumps occurring with inter arrival times m which equals the sum of the corresponding u and b the arrival rate of the rainfall events in this marked poisson process is denoted as μ and is equal to 1 m where m u b eagleson 1978 guo 2016 the pdf of the inter arrival time m is 4 f m m μ exp μ m m 0 as pointed out by yue et al 1999 as well as yue and hashino 1999 2001 the point rainfall process may not always be poissonian it might instead be represented by the binomial or negative binomial distributions in this study only the poisson distribution type is investigated as it is found to be applicable for many locations 2 2 dynamic water balance of detention ponds for a detention pond the water balance equation at an instant of time can be simply written in terms of the inflow rate the outflow rate and the change of the amount of water stored in the pond at that instant of time inflow is a result of runoff from the contributing catchment outflow is just the discharge from the hydraulic outlet structures such as orifices and weirs overflow or by pass flow may also occur when the pond is full evaporation and other water losses from the pond are usually negligible the dynamic water balance of a detention pond can thus be expressed as 5 d s s t dt r s s t t q s s t where ss t is the amount of water stored in the pond at time t expressed as depth mm of water over the catchment area r ss t t is the inflow rate collected by the detention pond from the contributing catchment at time t which is a function of the amount of water stored in the pond at time t and time t q ss t is the outflow rate of the detention pond at time t as a function of the amount of water stored in the pond at time t r ss t t and q ss t are both expressed in units of mm of water over the catchment per unit time the inflow rate is a function of the amount of water stored in the pond i e pond fullness because inflow here equals incoming runoff minus overflow or by pass flow from the pond whereas the amount of overflow or by pass flow depends on both the pond fullness and the incoming runoff volume for brevity of notation the indication of time dependence is made implicit hereafter i e ss t r ss t t and q ss t are simply represented as ss r ss t and q ss respectively 2 2 1 inflow rate after satisfying the initial hydrologic losses including interception and depression storage losses a large fraction of the remaining volume of a rainfall event occurring over the contributing catchment area may be transformed to runoff and discharged into the downstream detention pond the rainfall runoff transformation model li and adams 2000 behera et al 2006 u s army corps of engineers 1977 wang and guo 2018 can therefore be expressed as 6 v r 0 v s d ϕ v s d v s d where vr is the runoff measured in depth of water over the contributing catchment area flowing towards the detention pond mm ϕ is the dimensionless composite runoff coefficient which is largely a function of the catchment land use conditions sd is the lumped initial losses including interception and depression storage losses mm the derived pdf of the runoff event depth vr wang and guo 2018 is 7 f v r v r ζ ϕ exp ζ ϕ v r v r 0 the series of runoff event occurrences follows a new censored poisson process with an arrival rate of μ where μ μ s d f v v d v μ e s d ζ for brevity dimensionless normalization is applied for some variables of interest the normalized runoff event depth that may flow into the pond is r which is equal to vr sm where sm is the effective storage capacity of the detention pond expressed as depth of water over the catchment area the pdf of the dimensionless individual runoff event depth r can be expressed as 8 f r r γ exp γ r r 0 where γ ζ s m ϕ the average inter arrival time of the normalized runoff events is m r which is equal to the reciprocal of the arrival rate of the runoff events i e m r m exp s d ζ given an initial pond fullness level pond fullness is defined as the fraction of the maximum storage space of the pond occupied by water s calculated as ss sm at the beginning of a runoff event the normalized inflow event depth y that is actually collected and treated by the pond is not greater than the available normalized storage depth 1 s because overflow or by pass flow will occur if the normalized inflow event depth exceeds 1 s if overflow by pass occurs y is equal to 1 s the pdf of y conditioned on the pond having an initial relative storage or fullness level s which is denoted as p y s can therefore be expressed as 9 p y s y s γ exp γ y exp γ 1 s δ y s 1 0 y 1 s where y is the normalized inflow event volume treated by the pond which is the treated volume divided by sm and δ is the dirac delta function the probability mass of exp γ 1 s at y 1 s as expressed in eq 9 using the dirac delta function represents the probability that an inflow event will fill up the pond to its maximum capacity given that the initial pond fullness level is s at the beginning of the storm represented as a marked poisson process the time series of inflows into the detention pond can be denoted as yi with the sequential number of inflow events i 1 2 3 n t where n t is the number of inflow events from the start to the current time t guo 2016 the sequence of the normalized inflow series up to time t can be expressed as 10 φ t μ γ r s s t s m i 1 n t y i δ t t i where φ t μ γ is the normalized inflow series which is expressed in terms of the arrival rate of the poisson process μ and the inverse of the mean inflow event depth γ ti s are the occurrence times of the sequential inflow events from time zero to time t 2 2 2 outflow rate the outflow rate q ss of a detention pond is mainly controlled by hydraulic devices such as orifices and weirs in this paper the orifice type detention pond which is most widely used in practice for storm water quality control is selected as the representative type for this type of detention ponds or for cases where outflows are controlled by pumps q ss was treated as constants for simplicity loganathan et al 1994 chen and adams 2005 balistrocchi et al 2009 a more accurate way to represent the outflow rate is to approximate it as a linear function of the amount of water stored in the pond guo and adams 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 2017 in this study to be more accurate q ss is treated as functionally related to the volume of water stored in the pond ss at time t the dependence of the outflow rate on the amount of water stored in the pond is expressed as q d where d is the depth of water in the pond at time t q d in the unit of m3 s can be calculated as 11 q d c o a o 2 g d 0 5 where co is the orifice discharge coefficient dimensionless which is usually equal to 0 67 ao is the cross sectional area of the orifice m2 for a circular orifice a o π d 2 4 where d is the orifice diameter m g is the gravitational acceleration constant 9 81 m s2 and d is measured in meters the orifice is located at the bottom of the active storage portion of the pond in this study the horizontal area of the pond is assumed to remain constant within the active storage portion for simplicity this assumption was adopted in many previous studies as well guo and adams 1999 akan 2010 behera and teegavarapu 2015 d can also be expressed as depth of water over the catchment area i e d a c s s a p where ac is the contributing catchment area and ap is the bottom area of the pond the outflow rate q d can thus be equivalently represented as q ss measuring q ss in mm of water over the catchment area per unit time it can be calculated as 12 q s s k s s 0 5 where k c 0 a o 2 g a c a p 0 5 k is a parameter with a dimension of mm0 5 time which is dependent on co ao ac and ap dividing eq 12 by sm and replacing ss sm with s the normalized outflow rate of the detention pond q s with a dimension of time 1 can therefore be expressed as 13 q s q s s s m η s 0 5 where η c o a o 2 g a c a p s m 0 5 and η is a parameter with a dimension of time 1 if the horizontal area of the pond does not remain constant within the active storage portion of the pond but changes as the depth of water d changes then usually given the relatively uniform slope of the bottom of the pond a power function relationship similar to eq 13 may be obtained to describe the relationship between q and s except that s will be raised to a power different from 0 5 2 2 3 normalized water balance equation normalizing all the terms in eq 5 by dividing them by sm and substituting the corresponding terms as expressed in eqs 10 and 13 respectively the normalized stochastic water balance equation of an orifice type detention pond can be expressed as 14 d s d t φ t μ γ η s 0 5 2 2 4 effective storage capacity outflows actually occur during both rainy and dry periods the assumption of instantaneous rainfall event used in the stochastic approach would result in overestimation of overflows because outflow during a rainfall event creates some additional storage volume and this additional storage volume would accommodate more inflow which may otherwise overflow from or by pass the pond in order to alleviate this problem of overestimation it is necessary to define and quantify the effective storage capacity of a pond and this has proven to be an effective technique for improving the accuracy of previously developed analytical stochastic models guo and guo 2018 wang and guo 2018 the effective storage capacity of a detention pond the actual storage capacity of the pond is previously denoted as sm but hereinafter sm is used to represent the effective storage capacity can be defined as the summation of the actual size of the pond sc i e the maximum depth of the active storage portion of the pond expressed as mm of water over the catchment area determined as s c a p d m a c where dm is the maximum depth of the pond measured in meters and the additional storage capacity that is created by outflow q ss during an average representative rainfall event the additional storage capacity can be estimated as the average outflow rate from the detention pond multiplied by the duration of an average rainfall event i e u the ensemble average duration of rainfall events the effective storage capacity is therefore expressed as 15 s m s c q s s u the outflow rate q ss varies with depth of water in the pond therefore the mean outflow rate q s s rather than the maximum outflow rate q sc should be used in the estimation of the additional storage capacity to obtain a simple estimate of the average outflow rate q s s the outflow during the average representative rainfall event is assumed to start when the pond is full this is a reasonable assumption because portions of the runoff event volume will indeed fill up the pond and in the stochastic water balance equation the filling of the pond as a result of a runoff event is treated as occurring instantaneously in addition detention ponds are usually sized to be large enough to contain runoff from an average representative rainfall event as a result of this assumption the initial discharge rate from the pond at the start of the average representative rainfall event is q 0 q s c k s c 0 5 after the instantaneous filling of the pond by the runoff event the differential water balance equation governing the change of the pond storage can be expressed as 16 d s s q s s d t substituting s s q s s k 2 as expressed in eq 12 into eq 16 and carrying out the integration from t 0 which is the start of the average representative rainfall event to t u which is the end of the average representative rainfall event the outflow rate at the end of the event q u is 17 q u 0 s c k 2 4 λ 2 k s c 0 5 k 2 u 2 s c k 2 4 λ 2 eq 17 shows that the outflow rate linearly decreases with the duration of the event therefore the mean outflow rate during this event can be calculated as the average of q 0 and q u with u 1 λ i e 18 q s s q 0 q 1 λ 2 k s c 0 5 2 s c k 2 4 λ 2 k s c 0 5 k 2 4 λ s c k 2 4 λ 2 combining eqs 15 and 18 the explicit expression of the effective storage capacity sm is 19 s m s c k s c 0 5 2 λ s c k 2 4 λ 2 s c k s c 0 5 λ k 2 4 λ 2 s c k 2 4 λ 2 eq 19 can be applied to detention pond systems with orifice outflow structures this piecewise function describes how sm is affected by related parameters including the actual pond size sc the distribution parameter of rainfall event duration λ and the parameter k about the orifice outflow rate 2 3 solution of the stochastic water balance equation the normalized water balance equation of detention ponds as shown in eq 14 is a stochastic differential equation driven by the inflow process φ t μ γ which is a marked poisson process starting from a specific initial condition the pdf of s denoted as f s t changes with time before the system reaches a steady state the evolution of f s t in time can be described by the chapman kolmogorov forward equation cox and miller 1965 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 it was shown that the probability distribution of s at time t may consist of a discrete atom of probability f 0 t for s 0 and a continuous pdf f s t for s 0 adapting from the solutions in previous studies involving similar stochastic water balance equations rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the temporal evolution of f s t and f 0 t can be shown to be 20 f s t t s f s t q s μ f s t μ 0 s f z t p y s s z z d z μ f 0 t p y s s 0 21 d f 0 t d t μ f 0 t q 0 f 0 t where p y s s z z and p y s s 0 are both the conditional pdfs of inflows to a pond as expressed in eq 9 z is the dummy variable of integration 0 is a value infinitesimally greater than zero and f 0 t lim s 0 f s t as demonstrated in appendix a although q s shown in eq 13 approaches zero in a continuous manner the probability distribution of s still includes an atom of probability at s 0 since the stochastic process φ t μ γ which drives the pond s water balance is a stationary stochastic process the system will eventually reach a steady state where the pdf of s will remain the same and does not change with time although theoretically it would take an infinitely long time to reach this steady state in the planning and design of detention ponds we are only interested in this steady state this is because an approximate steady state condition of the probability distribution of water storage in the pond would usually be reached after several months of operation we denote the atom of probability for s 0 and the continuous pdf for s 0 at the steady state as f 0 and f s respectively f 0 and f s are governed by the two equations which are otherwise the same as eqs 20 and 21 but with their left hand sides both replaced with zero by replacing p y s with the expressions shown in eq 9 the two equations governing f s and f 0 are then shown to be 22 d d s f s q s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z δ s 1 e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s δ s 1 e γ 0 for 0 s 1 23 μ f 0 q 0 f 0 0 for s 0 as detailed in appendix b the general solution of eq 22 while considering what is required by eq 23 was derived to be 24 f s c 1 s 0 5 η exp γ s 2 μ η s 0 5 for 0 s 1 where c 1 is a normalization constant ensuring that the total probability mass for all possible values of s is equal to one note that q s as shown in eq 22 was replaced with the expression shown in eq 13 let s 0 and carrying out the integration with z from 0 to 0 eq b14 yields f 0 c 1 q 0 substituting this expression of f 0 into eq 23 we obtain f 0 c 1 μ therefore the overall steady state probability distribution of s denoted as h s which comprises a discrete probability mass f 0 for s 0 and a continuous part f s for 0 s 1 is 25 h s c 1 η s 0 5 exp γ s 2 μ η s 0 5 0 s 1 c 1 μ δ 0 s 0 where the normalization constant c 1 would ensure that 26 0 h s d s 1 for 0 s 1 the solution of eq 26 leads to 27 c 1 μ 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 where c 2 μ η γ c 3 π γ erf γ 1 c 2 erf γ c 2 c 4 exp γ c 2 2 and erf represents the gauss error function which is defined as erf x 2 π 0 x e z 2 d z the expression of f 0 can thus be determined as f 0 c 1 μ 1 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 substituting c 1 as expressed in eq 27 into eq 25 the explicit expression of h s is 28 h s μ s 0 5 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 η exp γ s 2 μ η s 0 5 0 s 1 1 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 δ 0 s 0 the cumulative probability distribution cdf of s h s can be derived as 29 h s 0 s h s d s c 1 μ 1 c 2 c 4 π γ erf γ s 0 5 γ c 2 erf γ c 2 for 0 s 1 2 4 estimation of average runoff capture efficiency the ensemble average of s denoted as s can be derived as 30 s 0 1 s h s d s c 1 c 2 μ c 4 c 2 c 4 c 5 c 5 c 3 c 2 2 1 2 γ where c 5 exp γ 1 c 2 2 s can be interpreted as the long term average value of s the long term average amount of water stored in the pond s s expressed in mm of water over its contributing catchment can thus be determined as s s s s c define r as the normalized mean runoff rate from the contributing catchment q as the normalized mean outflow rate from the pond and ω as the normalized mean overflow rate the long term average water balance equation for the detention pond can be expressed as 31 r q ω where r can be calculated as the normalized runoff event depth averaged

ponds using this collection of closed form analytical equations the probability distribution of s which can be used to determine the fractions of time that water in the pond is at different levels the long term average amount of water stored in the pond the runoff capture efficiency the required orifice diameter and the maximum water level that would be reached during the operation of the pond can all be determined in an analytical way without numerical simulations 3 model validation 3 1 study area and data a hypothetical test catchment located in jackson mississippi usa with an area of 16 8 ha was created for the purpose of validating the accuracy of the asm hypothetical detention ponds serving this test catchment are all assumed to be designed only for water quality control purposes overflows or bypass flows would occur when the incoming runoff volume exceeds the available storage capacity of the pond these overflows or bypass flows would be routed through separate hydraulic structures e g overflow weirs or spillways rather than the water quality control orifice detailed routing of the overflows or bypass flows is not considered in this study but needs to be considered if the pond is also used for flood control purposes the u s epa swmm model was used to provide continuous simulation results as a surrogate of observed data due to the lack of actual long term continuous measurements the main physical characteristics of the test catchment used as swmm input parameters are displayed in table 1 the evaporation rate at jackson mississippi is obtained from noaa 1982 the level of imperviousness of the test catchment is assumed to be 80 details of the other swmm input parameters of the catchment can be found in chen and adams 2005 and wang and guo 2018 techniques used to estimate ϕ and sd for the catchment can be found in wang and guo 2018 historical hourly rainfall records from jackson medgar wiley evers international airport coop 224472 32 317 n 90 083 w in jackson is used for analysis of rainfall event characteristics the 50 year rainfall record obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc of the united states covers the years of 1964 2013 and the data for each year is from january through december a minimum inter event time miet is used to separate the continuous rainfall record into individual events and inter event times a rainfall event volume threshold is selected so that extremely small rainfall events with volumes less than or equal to the selected threshold are censored out from the original data it was found that an miet of 12 h and a rainfall event volume threshold of 1 mm are appropriate for the statistical analysis of rainfall event characteristics at jackson the statistical test results of rainfall event characteristics are presented in table 2 to satisfy the assumptions of the poissonian process of rainfall inter arrival times and the exponential distributions of rainfall event characteristics statistical tests such as poisson test and kolmogorov smirnov test can be conducted detailed testing procedures can be found in guo and baetz 2007 hassini and guo 2016 and wang and guo 2018 the histograms and fitted exponential pdf curves of the rainfall event characteristics including v u b and m are displayed in fig 1 it can be observed that the exponential pdfs fit well with the histograms the means of rainfall event characteristics for jackson are v 19 20 mm u 10 11 h b 111 58 h m 121 69 h and θ 71 7 these rainfall event characteristics are required in the application of the asm the same historical hourly rainfall data are used as input of the u s epa swmm model version 5 1 for the catchment rossman 2015 the results obtained by a set of swmm continuous simulations are used to examine the accuracy of the asm the total runoff volume rv and total overflow volume ov provided by swmm simulation results are used to calculate the swmm determined long term average runoff capture efficiency as 38 e rswmm rv o v rv the other performance statistics such as the average pond fullness level s and the detailed s distributions are all directly calculated using the time step by time step output data from swmm models 3 2 validation of er and s the accuracy of the proposed asm can be verified by comparing the analytical results and swmm continuous simulation results two main hydrologic performance indicators for pond systems i e the runoff capture efficiency er and the average pond fullness level s are evaluated and their results from asm and swmm are compared for the test catchment with an area of 16 8 ha located at jackson and the pond with a maximum water depth of 1 m a total of 78 cases incorporating 6 different values of pond sizes i e sc 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 mm and 13 different values of orifice diameters i e d 1 2 5 5 7 5 30 cm are selected for the purpose of model validation the combinations of selected sc and d values are physically reasonable and representative for various pond systems for these selected cases eqs 36 and 37 are used to determine s and er respectively using the asm the analytical results are then compared with the swmm simulation results the comparison of asm and swmm determined er and s results for the 78 cases are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively if the swmm results are treated as the observed data the mean values of er and s obtained from asm are 0 663 and 0 185 compared to the observed mean values of 0 653 and 0 194 respectively between asm results and the observed data i e swmm results the root mean square error rmse is 0 021 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is 0 994 and the correlation coefficient is 0 9983 for runoff capture efficiency while the rmse of 0 012 nse of 0 998 and correlation coefficient of 0 9997 are obtained for the average pond fullness level this demonstrates good agreements between the asm and swmm results of er and s for all the 78 cases for further demonstration the comparison results for the 78 cases are shown in fig 3 detailed comparison between er and erswmm for 6 different pond sizes is shown in fig 3a and b while the comparison of s results are shown in fig 3c and d as shown in fig 3 asm determined curves agree well with the dotted plots of swmm results for a specific pond size er increases and s decreases with the increase of the orifice diameter d for orifices with a fixed diameter when sc increases both er and s increase because less overflows would occur when pond size increases it is noted in fig 3a and b that the runoff capture efficiency curves determined from asm results are not very smooth at certain intervals of d i e around d 15 cm in fig 3a and d 20 cm in fig 3b this can be explained by the fact that er as determined by eq 37 depends on sm and sm as expressed in eq 19 is a piecewise function of k while k is dependent on d therefore sm and er are both piecewise functions of d the middle end points of d values in the piecewise function corresponding to the middle end points of k values as demonstrated in eq 19 create the relatively sharp turning points of the runoff capture efficiency curves in fig 3a and b as shown in fig 3c and d a sharp decrease of s results from the increase of the orifice diameter d at first and then s decreases much slowly when d is larger than about 10 cm 3 3 validation for the pdf and cdf of s the variation of pond fullness level as represented by the pdf and cdf of s is another useful performance characteristic for pond design and operation the pdf and cdf of s can be analytically determined using eqs 28 and 29 respectively the long term average pond fullness level s can be directly determined by eq 30 the comparison between the analytically determined pdf and cdf and those determined using swmm results is shown in fig 4 for demonstration purposes the case with a pond storage capacity of 40 mm is selected the comparisons of pdfs for orifice diameters of 4 cm and 10 cm are shown in fig 4a and b respectively the relative frequency histogram for 0 s 1 and the relative frequency of occurrence for s 0 were obtained from the output of swmm results the analytical results including the atom of probability at s 0 agree well with the swmm results the comparisons of cdf of s as presented in fig 4c and d also show good agreements 3 4 effects of dm and ra for a specific catchment the area ratio between the catchment and the pond bottom area ra and the maximum water depth dm of the pond are the critical design parameters in addition to the orifice diameter d the effects of the maximum water depth and area ratio on runoff capture efficiency and average pond fullness level are investigated to further verify the accuracy of asm for cases with extremely large or small design parameter values for a catchment with an area of 1 ha four types of cases with two different dm values 0 5 or 1 5 m combined with two d values 2 or 5 cm are examined in each type of cases i e each combination of dm and d a total of 101 continuous simulations for different area ratios i e ra 1 5 10 500 were conducted the comparison of er and s results for all cases are shown in fig 5 a d for all cases with various values of dm d and ra considered in fig 5a c and d satisfactory agreement between asm and swmm results is observed for a specific orifice diameter taking d 5 cm as an example the effects of dm 0 5 or 2 m and ra 1 5 10 500 on er and s are explored for two catchment areas i e ac 5 or 20 ha in fig 5b e and f the comparison between asm and swmm results still demonstrates close agreement for the total of 101 cases with different dm ac and ra values fig 5 therefore further verifies the accuracy of the proposed asm including the way of estimating the effective storage capacity for almost all possible design conditions the effective storage capacity of a pond was estimated using eq 19 which was derived by considering an average representative rainfall event and the size of detention ponds the verifications for the accuracy of asm shown in fig 5 in addition to what was shown in figs 2 4 demonstrate that the asm is accurate enough for almost all cases including those with extremely small and extremely large ponds or orifices the relationship between pond size orifice diameter catchment area and the runoff capture efficiency is nonlinear and complex using eq 37 this relationship which cannot be directly obtained from continuous simulations can be obtained directly fig 6 a presents an example for a test catchment with an area of 16 8 ha and a maximum water depth of 1 m the corresponding contour plots can be found in fig 6c another example is illustrated for a small catchment with an area of 1 ha and a maximum water depth of 0 5 m shown in fig 6b associated with its contour results in fig 6d the cause of break points in fig 6 is explained in section 3 2 the relationships between orifice diameter runoff capture efficiency pond size and area ratio are demonstrated well in fig 6 in addition to many other uses of the graphs as shown in fig 6 they can also be used as an efficient tool to quickly determine the required orifice diameter given a specific target of runoff capture efficiency 4 concluding remarks in this paper an analytical stochastic approach was developed to describe the hydrologic operation of storm water quality control detention ponds with outflows controlled by orifices in order to reduce the overestimation of overflow caused by the assumption of instantaneous rainfall inputs the concept of effective storage capacity was proposed an easy way of its estimation was developed considering the varying outflow rates of detention ponds the accuracy of the resulting analytical stochastic model asm was verified for many different hypothetical design cases it was shown that the asm for detention pond systems can provide accurate estimates of the relationships between runoff capture efficiency pond fullness level orifice diameter pond size catchment area and local climatic characteristics implemented easily into a spreadsheet the asm provides an easy to use and computationally efficient tool for analyzing the hydrologic performance of detention pond systems the asm can be used separately as a planning or design tool or together with continuous simulation models to help verify simulation results or reduce the number of simulation runs compared to the previously developed analytical probabilistic models the asm developed in this paper has the advantage of not requiring an independence assumption between rainfall event depth and duration further research may be extended to the verification of asm for detention ponds located at more climatically different locations acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc rgpin 5112 2016 and the china scholarship council 201406220156 the data used in this study are listed in the tables or obtained from the citied references appendix a demonstration of the existence of f 0 t during a dry period without inflow the normalized differential water balance equation governing the rate of change of pond storage can be expressed as a1 d s q s d t substituting q s as expressed in eq 13 into eq a1 and carrying out the integration from time t 0 to time t t with the corresponding s values from s 0 to s t we can obtain a2 s t s 0 0 5 0 5 η t 2 where s 0 is the initial pond fullness level at t 0 st is the pond fullness level at t t it can be seen in eq a2 that the case of s t 0 exists when t 2 s 0 0 5 η this means that the storage of the pond would reach zero if the dry period is long enough although the outflow q s approaches zero in a continuous manner since s may reach zero and may stay at zero for some dry periods that are long enough the probability distribution of s consists of a discrete atom of probability f 0 t for s 0 in addition to a continuous pdf f s t for 0 s 1 this is true for the steady state solution of the probability distribution of s as well therefore for our case of study it is worth noting that the steady state solution of the probability distribution of s includes a discrete atom of probability at s 0 the above demonstration is necessary because previous studies rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 concluded that the probability distribution of s would have no atom of probability at s 0 if the outflow rate q s approaches zero in a continuous manner that conclusion was reached because it was believed that s would approach zero asymptotically if q s is a continuous function and the process would only be at s 0 if it starts at s 0 we here actually demonstrated that this general conclusion is incorrect appendix b derivation of f s as shown in eq 24 the dirac delta function used in eq 22 is used for the special case of s 1 equivalently eq 22 can be written separately for cases with 0 s 1 and s 1 as b1 d f s q s d s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s 0 for 0 s 1 b2 f 1 d q s d s s 1 δ 0 f 1 q 1 μ f 1 μ 0 1 f z γ e γ 1 z δ 0 e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 γ e γ δ 0 e γ 0 for s 1 where f 1 is the probability density at s 1 dividing by δ 0 and neglecting the infinitesimally small terms eq b2 turns to be b3 f 1 q 1 μ 0 1 f z e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 e γ 0 for s 1 thus eqs 23 b1 and b3 are the general form of the steady state chapman kolmogorov forward equations for 0 s 1 multiplying both sides of eq b1 by e ys yields b4 e γ s d f s q s d s e γ s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ z d z μ f 0 γ 0 for 0 s 1 differentiating both sides of eq b4 with respect to s and dividing the resulting equation by e γ s eq b4 becomes b5 γ d f s q s d s d 2 f s q s d s 2 μ d f s d s 0 for 0 s 1 carrying out an indefinite integration of the left hand side of eq b5 a first order linear differential equation was obtained to be b6 d f s q s d s γ f s q s μ f s constant for 0 s 1 combining equations b1 and b6 yields b7 γ f s q s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s constant for 0 s 1 let s 0 eq b7 becomes b8 γ f 0 q 0 μ f 0 γ constant eq 23 can be converted to b9 γ q 0 f 0 μ γ f 0 for s 0 combining eqs b8 and b9 the value of the constant in eqs b6 b8 is determined to be zero therefore eq b6 is simplified as b10 d f s q s d s γ f s q s μ f s 0 for 0 s 1 let s 1 and replacing the value of the constant with zero eq b7 leads to b11 f 1 μ e γ 0 1 f z e γ z d z μ f 0 e γ q 1 μ e γ 0 1 f z e γ z d z μ f 0 e γ q 1 according to eq b3 the expression of f 1 can be derived as b12 f 1 μ e γ 0 1 f z e γ z d z μ f 0 e γ q 1 for s 1 the above procedure shows that f 1 f 1 therefore eq b10 is applicable to not only the cases of 0 s 1 but also the case of s 1 i e b13 d f s q s d s γ f s q s μ f s 0 for 0 s 1 eq b13 is a first order linear homogeneous differential equation its general solution is b14 f s c 1 q s e γ s μ 1 q z d z for 0 s 1 where z is a dummy variable of integration and c 1 is a normalization constant used to ensure that the total probability mass is equal to one eq 24 was obtained by simply substituting the expression of q s as shown in eq 13 into eq b14 and carrying out the integration with z values from z s to z 1 although the solution procedures presented above are very similar to what was presented in rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the difference is that the solutions obtained here are for the more general case with an atom of probability at s 0 whereas the solutions presented in rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 as well as in rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 are for the special case with no such atom of probability for ponds with their storage outflow relationships not accurately approximated by eq 13 a different functional form may be used to describe their q s functions and similarly the approximate q s functions may be substituted into eq b14 to obtain the solutions for those ponds

pollutants found from nonpoint sources may include suspended solids heavy metals chlorides oil and grease bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms tsihrintzis and hamid 1997 barbosa et al 2012 these pollutants are generated over urban catchments and are carried by runoff to receiving waters fletcher et al 2013 as an effective storm water management practice detention ponds can be utilized for both flood and water quality control behera and teegavarapu 2015 proper control of outflow from a detention pond is required to ensure sufficient residence time needed for the settling and decay of pollutants guo and adams 1999 outflow control is commonly achieved through the use of an orifice with a properly selected diameter runoff draining to the pond from the majority of rainfall events will go through the orifice and then flow downstream under extremely large rainfall events part of the generated runoff may by pass or overflow from the detention pond because the pond is totally filled before the end of the runoff event the runoff that by passes or overflows from the pond is considered as not receiving any treatment the long term average fraction of removal of total suspended solids is commonly used as the main design criteria for water quality control purposes since it is difficult to directly quantify this fraction it is often estimated as a positive linear function of the runoff capture efficiency provided by a detention pond guo and adams 1999 chen and adams 2006 the runoff capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total volume of runoff captured by a detention pond instead of overflowing from or by passing the detention pond in this study the runoff capture efficiency is selected as a representative performance measure for the evaluation of the water quality control performance of detention ponds models used for evaluating the long term average performance of detention facilities can be classified into two types continuous simulation models and analytical probabilistic models guo and adams 1999 wang and guo 2018 continuous simulation models are appealing because they can simulate the natural sequences of the occurrence of runoff events however continuous simulation is data intensive and time consuming adams and papa 2000 chen and adams 2007 analytical probabilistic models were developed by researchers employing probability distributions to represent rainfall characteristics of different locations and these models estimate pond performance statistics using analytical equations the analytical equations used in the analytical probabilistic models were derived based on simplified representations of the event by event operation of detention ponds assumptions about how full the pond is at the beginning of an operation cycle are required in those simplified representations howard 1976 loganathan and delleur 1984 guo and baetz 2007 zhang and guo 2013 ursino 2015 bacchi et al 2008 balistrocchi et al 2009 2013 zhang and guo 2014 which may cause an underestimation or overestimation of the performance statistics for some unusual or extreme cases besides in the previously developed analytical probabilistic models of detention ponds the pond s outflow is often assumed to be constant li and adams 2000 chen and adams 2005 or the discharge storage relationship of the pond is approximated by linear functions guo and adams 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 2017 actually a power function is a more realistic representation of the discharge storage relationship when orifice is used as the outflow control device to overcome the shortcomings of the previously developed analytical probabilistic models in this study an alternative analytical stochastic approach is developed for evaluating the performance of orifice type detention ponds for water quality control purposes as an appealing alternative the analytical stochastic approach describes rainfall characteristics of a location using the theories of stochastic processes this approach was first proposed by rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 and has been widely applied in the study of soil moisture dynamics rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 proporato et al 2004 recent studies have extended the application of the stochastic approach to urban storm water management with models developed for green roofs guo 2016 rainwater harvesting systems guo and guo 2018 pelak and porporato 2016 permeable pavements guo et al 2018 and combined sewer overflow tanks wang and guo 2018 in the above cited stochastic studies for urban storm water management purposes however the rates of outflow from the storage components are all treated as constant in this study an analytical stochastic model is developed to evaluate the runoff capture efficiency of detention ponds with non linear storage discharge relationships the analytical results are compared with continuous simulation results and the developed stochastic model is tested and validated with rainfall data from jackson mississippi usa 2 methods 2 1 stochastic description of point rainfall series an observed historical rainfall series can be separated into individual rainfall events linked by inter event dry times of different lengths for many locations the frequency distributions of the rainfall event depth v i e the distribution of the frequency of occurrence of rainfall events with different depths event duration u and inter event time b can all be fitted well by exponential probability density functions pdfs exponential pdfs were therefore recommended for use in the design of storm water management facilities at many locations in the u s u s epa 1986 wanielista and yousef 1993 hassini and guo 2016 exponential pdfs have also been adopted for describing rainfall event characteristics at many other locations around the world including canada adams and papa 2000 south korea lee and kim 2018 malaysia shamsudin et al 2014 and italy ursino 2015 the exponential pdfs of rainfall event characteristics can be described as 1 f v v ζ epx ζ v v 0 2 f u u λ exp λ u u 0 3 f b b ψ exp ψ b b 0 where ζ λ and ψ are distribution parameters which can be estimated as ζ 1 v λ 1 u ψ 1 b where is the ensemble average operator suitable techniques for parameter estimation and procedures of goodness of fit tests can be found in hassini and guo 2016 the validity of the assumed exponential distributions of rainfall event characteristics will be examined by comparing the analytical results obtained based on the assumed distributions with those from long term continuous simulations where no such assumptions are required in using the stochastic approach for describing the rainfall series of a location the sequential occurrence of rainfall events with different depths is represented as a marked poisson process restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 wang and guo 2018 the individual rainfall event is treated as occurring instantaneously rather than with a duration u rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 therefore the constitution of the point rainfall series is simplified as instantaneous rainfall event jumps occurring with inter arrival times m which equals the sum of the corresponding u and b the arrival rate of the rainfall events in this marked poisson process is denoted as μ and is equal to 1 m where m u b eagleson 1978 guo 2016 the pdf of the inter arrival time m is 4 f m m μ exp μ m m 0 as pointed out by yue et al 1999 as well as yue and hashino 1999 2001 the point rainfall process may not always be poissonian it might instead be represented by the binomial or negative binomial distributions in this study only the poisson distribution type is investigated as it is found to be applicable for many locations 2 2 dynamic water balance of detention ponds for a detention pond the water balance equation at an instant of time can be simply written in terms of the inflow rate the outflow rate and the change of the amount of water stored in the pond at that instant of time inflow is a result of runoff from the contributing catchment outflow is just the discharge from the hydraulic outlet structures such as orifices and weirs overflow or by pass flow may also occur when the pond is full evaporation and other water losses from the pond are usually negligible the dynamic water balance of a detention pond can thus be expressed as 5 d s s t dt r s s t t q s s t where ss t is the amount of water stored in the pond at time t expressed as depth mm of water over the catchment area r ss t t is the inflow rate collected by the detention pond from the contributing catchment at time t which is a function of the amount of water stored in the pond at time t and time t q ss t is the outflow rate of the detention pond at time t as a function of the amount of water stored in the pond at time t r ss t t and q ss t are both expressed in units of mm of water over the catchment per unit time the inflow rate is a function of the amount of water stored in the pond i e pond fullness because inflow here equals incoming runoff minus overflow or by pass flow from the pond whereas the amount of overflow or by pass flow depends on both the pond fullness and the incoming runoff volume for brevity of notation the indication of time dependence is made implicit hereafter i e ss t r ss t t and q ss t are simply represented as ss r ss t and q ss respectively 2 2 1 inflow rate after satisfying the initial hydrologic losses including interception and depression storage losses a large fraction of the remaining volume of a rainfall event occurring over the contributing catchment area may be transformed to runoff and discharged into the downstream detention pond the rainfall runoff transformation model li and adams 2000 behera et al 2006 u s army corps of engineers 1977 wang and guo 2018 can therefore be expressed as 6 v r 0 v s d ϕ v s d v s d where vr is the runoff measured in depth of water over the contributing catchment area flowing towards the detention pond mm ϕ is the dimensionless composite runoff coefficient which is largely a function of the catchment land use conditions sd is the lumped initial losses including interception and depression storage losses mm the derived pdf of the runoff event depth vr wang and guo 2018 is 7 f v r v r ζ ϕ exp ζ ϕ v r v r 0 the series of runoff event occurrences follows a new censored poisson process with an arrival rate of μ where μ μ s d f v v d v μ e s d ζ for brevity dimensionless normalization is applied for some variables of interest the normalized runoff event depth that may flow into the pond is r which is equal to vr sm where sm is the effective storage capacity of the detention pond expressed as depth of water over the catchment area the pdf of the dimensionless individual runoff event depth r can be expressed as 8 f r r γ exp γ r r 0 where γ ζ s m ϕ the average inter arrival time of the normalized runoff events is m r which is equal to the reciprocal of the arrival rate of the runoff events i e m r m exp s d ζ given an initial pond fullness level pond fullness is defined as the fraction of the maximum storage space of the pond occupied by water s calculated as ss sm at the beginning of a runoff event the normalized inflow event depth y that is actually collected and treated by the pond is not greater than the available normalized storage depth 1 s because overflow or by pass flow will occur if the normalized inflow event depth exceeds 1 s if overflow by pass occurs y is equal to 1 s the pdf of y conditioned on the pond having an initial relative storage or fullness level s which is denoted as p y s can therefore be expressed as 9 p y s y s γ exp γ y exp γ 1 s δ y s 1 0 y 1 s where y is the normalized inflow event volume treated by the pond which is the treated volume divided by sm and δ is the dirac delta function the probability mass of exp γ 1 s at y 1 s as expressed in eq 9 using the dirac delta function represents the probability that an inflow event will fill up the pond to its maximum capacity given that the initial pond fullness level is s at the beginning of the storm represented as a marked poisson process the time series of inflows into the detention pond can be denoted as yi with the sequential number of inflow events i 1 2 3 n t where n t is the number of inflow events from the start to the current time t guo 2016 the sequence of the normalized inflow series up to time t can be expressed as 10 φ t μ γ r s s t s m i 1 n t y i δ t t i where φ t μ γ is the normalized inflow series which is expressed in terms of the arrival rate of the poisson process μ and the inverse of the mean inflow event depth γ ti s are the occurrence times of the sequential inflow events from time zero to time t 2 2 2 outflow rate the outflow rate q ss of a detention pond is mainly controlled by hydraulic devices such as orifices and weirs in this paper the orifice type detention pond which is most widely used in practice for storm water quality control is selected as the representative type for this type of detention ponds or for cases where outflows are controlled by pumps q ss was treated as constants for simplicity loganathan et al 1994 chen and adams 2005 balistrocchi et al 2009 a more accurate way to represent the outflow rate is to approximate it as a linear function of the amount of water stored in the pond guo and adams 1999 balistrocchi et al 2013 2017 in this study to be more accurate q ss is treated as functionally related to the volume of water stored in the pond ss at time t the dependence of the outflow rate on the amount of water stored in the pond is expressed as q d where d is the depth of water in the pond at time t q d in the unit of m3 s can be calculated as 11 q d c o a o 2 g d 0 5 where co is the orifice discharge coefficient dimensionless which is usually equal to 0 67 ao is the cross sectional area of the orifice m2 for a circular orifice a o π d 2 4 where d is the orifice diameter m g is the gravitational acceleration constant 9 81 m s2 and d is measured in meters the orifice is located at the bottom of the active storage portion of the pond in this study the horizontal area of the pond is assumed to remain constant within the active storage portion for simplicity this assumption was adopted in many previous studies as well guo and adams 1999 akan 2010 behera and teegavarapu 2015 d can also be expressed as depth of water over the catchment area i e d a c s s a p where ac is the contributing catchment area and ap is the bottom area of the pond the outflow rate q d can thus be equivalently represented as q ss measuring q ss in mm of water over the catchment area per unit time it can be calculated as 12 q s s k s s 0 5 where k c 0 a o 2 g a c a p 0 5 k is a parameter with a dimension of mm0 5 time which is dependent on co ao ac and ap dividing eq 12 by sm and replacing ss sm with s the normalized outflow rate of the detention pond q s with a dimension of time 1 can therefore be expressed as 13 q s q s s s m η s 0 5 where η c o a o 2 g a c a p s m 0 5 and η is a parameter with a dimension of time 1 if the horizontal area of the pond does not remain constant within the active storage portion of the pond but changes as the depth of water d changes then usually given the relatively uniform slope of the bottom of the pond a power function relationship similar to eq 13 may be obtained to describe the relationship between q and s except that s will be raised to a power different from 0 5 2 2 3 normalized water balance equation normalizing all the terms in eq 5 by dividing them by sm and substituting the corresponding terms as expressed in eqs 10 and 13 respectively the normalized stochastic water balance equation of an orifice type detention pond can be expressed as 14 d s d t φ t μ γ η s 0 5 2 2 4 effective storage capacity outflows actually occur during both rainy and dry periods the assumption of instantaneous rainfall event used in the stochastic approach would result in overestimation of overflows because outflow during a rainfall event creates some additional storage volume and this additional storage volume would accommodate more inflow which may otherwise overflow from or by pass the pond in order to alleviate this problem of overestimation it is necessary to define and quantify the effective storage capacity of a pond and this has proven to be an effective technique for improving the accuracy of previously developed analytical stochastic models guo and guo 2018 wang and guo 2018 the effective storage capacity of a detention pond the actual storage capacity of the pond is previously denoted as sm but hereinafter sm is used to represent the effective storage capacity can be defined as the summation of the actual size of the pond sc i e the maximum depth of the active storage portion of the pond expressed as mm of water over the catchment area determined as s c a p d m a c where dm is the maximum depth of the pond measured in meters and the additional storage capacity that is created by outflow q ss during an average representative rainfall event the additional storage capacity can be estimated as the average outflow rate from the detention pond multiplied by the duration of an average rainfall event i e u the ensemble average duration of rainfall events the effective storage capacity is therefore expressed as 15 s m s c q s s u the outflow rate q ss varies with depth of water in the pond therefore the mean outflow rate q s s rather than the maximum outflow rate q sc should be used in the estimation of the additional storage capacity to obtain a simple estimate of the average outflow rate q s s the outflow during the average representative rainfall event is assumed to start when the pond is full this is a reasonable assumption because portions of the runoff event volume will indeed fill up the pond and in the stochastic water balance equation the filling of the pond as a result of a runoff event is treated as occurring instantaneously in addition detention ponds are usually sized to be large enough to contain runoff from an average representative rainfall event as a result of this assumption the initial discharge rate from the pond at the start of the average representative rainfall event is q 0 q s c k s c 0 5 after the instantaneous filling of the pond by the runoff event the differential water balance equation governing the change of the pond storage can be expressed as 16 d s s q s s d t substituting s s q s s k 2 as expressed in eq 12 into eq 16 and carrying out the integration from t 0 which is the start of the average representative rainfall event to t u which is the end of the average representative rainfall event the outflow rate at the end of the event q u is 17 q u 0 s c k 2 4 λ 2 k s c 0 5 k 2 u 2 s c k 2 4 λ 2 eq 17 shows that the outflow rate linearly decreases with the duration of the event therefore the mean outflow rate during this event can be calculated as the average of q 0 and q u with u 1 λ i e 18 q s s q 0 q 1 λ 2 k s c 0 5 2 s c k 2 4 λ 2 k s c 0 5 k 2 4 λ s c k 2 4 λ 2 combining eqs 15 and 18 the explicit expression of the effective storage capacity sm is 19 s m s c k s c 0 5 2 λ s c k 2 4 λ 2 s c k s c 0 5 λ k 2 4 λ 2 s c k 2 4 λ 2 eq 19 can be applied to detention pond systems with orifice outflow structures this piecewise function describes how sm is affected by related parameters including the actual pond size sc the distribution parameter of rainfall event duration λ and the parameter k about the orifice outflow rate 2 3 solution of the stochastic water balance equation the normalized water balance equation of detention ponds as shown in eq 14 is a stochastic differential equation driven by the inflow process φ t μ γ which is a marked poisson process starting from a specific initial condition the pdf of s denoted as f s t changes with time before the system reaches a steady state the evolution of f s t in time can be described by the chapman kolmogorov forward equation cox and miller 1965 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 it was shown that the probability distribution of s at time t may consist of a discrete atom of probability f 0 t for s 0 and a continuous pdf f s t for s 0 adapting from the solutions in previous studies involving similar stochastic water balance equations rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the temporal evolution of f s t and f 0 t can be shown to be 20 f s t t s f s t q s μ f s t μ 0 s f z t p y s s z z d z μ f 0 t p y s s 0 21 d f 0 t d t μ f 0 t q 0 f 0 t where p y s s z z and p y s s 0 are both the conditional pdfs of inflows to a pond as expressed in eq 9 z is the dummy variable of integration 0 is a value infinitesimally greater than zero and f 0 t lim s 0 f s t as demonstrated in appendix a although q s shown in eq 13 approaches zero in a continuous manner the probability distribution of s still includes an atom of probability at s 0 since the stochastic process φ t μ γ which drives the pond s water balance is a stationary stochastic process the system will eventually reach a steady state where the pdf of s will remain the same and does not change with time although theoretically it would take an infinitely long time to reach this steady state in the planning and design of detention ponds we are only interested in this steady state this is because an approximate steady state condition of the probability distribution of water storage in the pond would usually be reached after several months of operation we denote the atom of probability for s 0 and the continuous pdf for s 0 at the steady state as f 0 and f s respectively f 0 and f s are governed by the two equations which are otherwise the same as eqs 20 and 21 but with their left hand sides both replaced with zero by replacing p y s with the expressions shown in eq 9 the two equations governing f s and f 0 are then shown to be 22 d d s f s q s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z δ s 1 e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s δ s 1 e γ 0 for 0 s 1 23 μ f 0 q 0 f 0 0 for s 0 as detailed in appendix b the general solution of eq 22 while considering what is required by eq 23 was derived to be 24 f s c 1 s 0 5 η exp γ s 2 μ η s 0 5 for 0 s 1 where c 1 is a normalization constant ensuring that the total probability mass for all possible values of s is equal to one note that q s as shown in eq 22 was replaced with the expression shown in eq 13 let s 0 and carrying out the integration with z from 0 to 0 eq b14 yields f 0 c 1 q 0 substituting this expression of f 0 into eq 23 we obtain f 0 c 1 μ therefore the overall steady state probability distribution of s denoted as h s which comprises a discrete probability mass f 0 for s 0 and a continuous part f s for 0 s 1 is 25 h s c 1 η s 0 5 exp γ s 2 μ η s 0 5 0 s 1 c 1 μ δ 0 s 0 where the normalization constant c 1 would ensure that 26 0 h s d s 1 for 0 s 1 the solution of eq 26 leads to 27 c 1 μ 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 where c 2 μ η γ c 3 π γ erf γ 1 c 2 erf γ c 2 c 4 exp γ c 2 2 and erf represents the gauss error function which is defined as erf x 2 π 0 x e z 2 d z the expression of f 0 can thus be determined as f 0 c 1 μ 1 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 substituting c 1 as expressed in eq 27 into eq 25 the explicit expression of h s is 28 h s μ s 0 5 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 η exp γ s 2 μ η s 0 5 0 s 1 1 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 δ 0 s 0 the cumulative probability distribution cdf of s h s can be derived as 29 h s 0 s h s d s c 1 μ 1

c 5 c 5 c 3 c 2 2 1 2 γ where c 5 exp γ 1 c 2 2 s can be interpreted as the long term average value of s the long term average amount of water stored in the pond s s expressed in mm of water over its contributing catchment can thus be determined as s s s s c define r as the normalized mean runoff rate from the contributing catchment q as the normalized mean outflow rate from the pond and ω as the

ponds using this collection of closed form analytical equations the probability distribution of s which can be used to determine the fractions of time that water in the pond is at different levels the long term average amount of water stored in the pond the runoff capture efficiency the required orifice diameter and the maximum water level that would be reached during the operation of the pond can all be determined in an analytical way without numerical simulations 3 model validation 3 1 study area and data a hypothetical test catchment located in jackson mississippi usa with an area of 16 8 ha was created for the purpose of validating the accuracy of the asm hypothetical detention ponds serving this test catchment are all assumed to be designed only for water quality control purposes overflows or bypass flows would occur when the incoming runoff volume exceeds the available storage capacity of the pond these overflows or bypass flows would be routed through separate hydraulic structures e g overflow weirs or spillways rather than the water quality control orifice detailed routing of the overflows or bypass flows is not considered in this study but needs to be considered if the pond is also used for flood control purposes the u s epa swmm model was used to provide continuous simulation results as a surrogate of observed data due to the lack of actual long term continuous measurements the main physical characteristics of the test catchment used as swmm input parameters are displayed in table 1 the evaporation rate at jackson mississippi is obtained from noaa 1982 the level of imperviousness of the test catchment is assumed to be 80 details of the other swmm input parameters of the catchment can be found in chen and adams 2005 and wang and guo 2018 techniques used to estimate ϕ and sd for the catchment can be found in wang and guo 2018 historical hourly rainfall records from jackson medgar wiley evers international airport coop 224472 32 317 n 90 083 w in jackson is used for analysis of rainfall event characteristics the 50 year rainfall record obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc of the united states covers the years of 1964 2013 and the data for each year is from january through december a minimum inter event time miet is used to separate the continuous rainfall record into individual events and inter event times a rainfall event volume threshold is selected so that extremely small rainfall events with volumes less than or equal to the selected threshold are censored out from the original data it was found that an miet of 12 h and a rainfall event volume threshold of 1 mm are appropriate for the statistical analysis of rainfall event characteristics at jackson the statistical test results of rainfall event characteristics are presented in table 2 to satisfy the assumptions of the poissonian process of rainfall inter arrival times and the exponential distributions of rainfall event characteristics statistical tests such as poisson test and kolmogorov smirnov test can be conducted detailed testing procedures can be found in guo and baetz 2007 hassini and guo 2016 and wang and guo 2018 the histograms and fitted exponential pdf curves of the rainfall event characteristics including v u b and m are displayed in fig 1 it can be observed that the exponential pdfs fit well with the histograms the means of rainfall event characteristics for jackson are v 19 20 mm u 10 11 h b 111 58 h m 121 69 h and θ 71 7 these rainfall event characteristics are required in the application of the asm the same historical hourly rainfall data are used as input of the u s epa swmm model version 5 1 for the catchment rossman 2015 the results obtained by a set of swmm continuous simulations are used to examine the accuracy of the asm the total runoff volume rv and total overflow volume ov provided by swmm simulation results are used to calculate the swmm determined long term average runoff capture efficiency as 38 e rswmm rv o v rv the other performance statistics such as the average pond fullness level s and the detailed s distributions are all directly calculated using the time step by time step output data from swmm models 3 2 validation of er and s the accuracy of the proposed asm can be verified by comparing the analytical results and swmm continuous simulation results two main hydrologic performance indicators for pond systems i e the runoff capture efficiency er and the average pond fullness level s are evaluated and their results from asm and swmm are compared for the test catchment with an area of 16 8 ha located at jackson and the pond with a maximum water depth of 1 m a total of 78 cases incorporating 6 different values of pond sizes i e sc 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 mm and 13 different values of orifice diameters i e d 1 2 5 5 7 5 30 cm are selected for the purpose of model validation the combinations of selected sc and d values are physically reasonable and representative for various pond systems for these selected cases eqs 36 and 37 are used to determine s and er respectively using the asm the analytical results are then compared with the swmm simulation results the comparison of asm and swmm determined er and s results for the 78 cases are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively if the swmm results are treated as the observed data the mean values of er and s obtained from asm are 0 663 and 0 185 compared to the observed mean values of 0 653 and 0 194 respectively between asm results and the observed data i e swmm results the root mean square error rmse is 0 021 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is 0 994 and the correlation coefficient is 0 9983 for runoff capture efficiency while the rmse of 0 012 nse of 0 998 and correlation coefficient of 0 9997 are obtained for the average pond fullness level this demonstrates good agreements between the asm and swmm results of er and s for all the 78 cases for further demonstration the comparison results for the 78 cases are shown in fig 3 detailed comparison between er and erswmm for 6 different pond sizes is shown in fig 3a and b while the comparison of s results are shown in fig 3c and d as shown in fig 3 asm determined curves agree well with the dotted plots of swmm results for a specific pond size er increases and s decreases with the increase of the orifice diameter d for orifices with a fixed diameter when sc increases both er and s increase because less overflows would occur when pond size increases it is noted in fig 3a and b that the runoff capture efficiency curves determined from asm results are not very smooth at certain intervals of d i e around d 15 cm in fig 3a and d 20 cm in fig 3b this can be explained by the fact that er as determined by eq 37 depends on sm and sm as expressed in eq 19 is a piecewise function of k while k is dependent on d therefore sm and er are both piecewise functions of d the middle end points of d values in the piecewise function corresponding to the middle end points of k values as demonstrated in eq 19 create the relatively sharp turning points of the runoff capture efficiency curves in fig 3a and b as shown in fig 3c and d a sharp decrease of s results from the increase of the orifice diameter d at first and then s decreases much slowly when d is larger than about 10 cm 3 3 validation for the pdf and cdf of s the variation of pond fullness level as represented by the pdf and cdf of s is another useful performance characteristic for pond design and operation the pdf and cdf of s can be analytically determined using eqs 28 and 29 respectively the long term average pond fullness level s can be directly determined by eq 30 the comparison between the analytically determined pdf and cdf and those determined using swmm results is shown in fig 4 for demonstration purposes the case with a pond storage capacity of 40 mm is selected the comparisons of pdfs for orifice diameters of 4 cm and 10 cm are shown in fig 4a and b respectively the relative frequency histogram for 0 s 1 and the relative frequency of occurrence for s 0 were obtained from the output of swmm results the analytical results including the atom of probability at s 0 agree well with the swmm results the comparisons of cdf of s as presented in fig 4c and d also show good agreements 3 4 effects of dm and ra for a specific catchment the area ratio between the catchment and the pond bottom area ra and the maximum water depth dm of the pond are the critical design parameters in addition to the orifice diameter d the effects of the maximum water depth and area ratio on runoff capture efficiency and average pond fullness level are investigated to further verify the accuracy of asm for cases with extremely large or small design parameter values for a catchment with an area of 1 ha four types of cases with two different dm values 0 5 or 1 5 m combined with two d values 2 or 5 cm are examined in each type of cases i e each combination of dm and d a total of 101 continuous simulations for different area ratios i e ra 1 5 10 500 were conducted the comparison of er and s results for all cases are shown in fig 5 a d for all cases with various values of dm d and ra considered in fig 5a c and d satisfactory agreement between asm and swmm results is observed for a specific orifice diameter taking d 5 cm as an example the effects of dm 0 5 or 2 m and ra 1 5 10 500 on er and s are explored for two catchment areas i e ac 5 or 20 ha in fig 5b e and f the comparison between asm and swmm results still demonstrates close agreement for the total of 101 cases with different dm ac and ra values fig 5 therefore further verifies the accuracy of the proposed asm including the way of estimating the effective storage capacity for almost all possible design conditions the effective storage capacity of a pond was estimated using eq 19 which was derived by considering an average representative rainfall event and the size of detention ponds the verifications for the accuracy of asm shown in fig 5 in addition to what was shown in figs 2 4 demonstrate that the asm is accurate enough for almost all cases including those with extremely small and extremely large ponds or orifices the relationship between pond size orifice diameter catchment area and the runoff capture efficiency is nonlinear and complex using eq 37 this relationship which cannot be directly obtained from continuous simulations can be obtained directly fig 6 a presents an example for a test catchment with an area of 16 8 ha and a maximum water depth of 1 m the corresponding contour plots can be found in fig 6c another example is illustrated for a small catchment with an area of 1 ha and a maximum water depth of 0 5 m shown in fig 6b associated with its contour results in fig 6d the cause of break points in fig 6 is explained in section 3 2 the relationships between orifice diameter runoff capture efficiency pond size and area ratio are demonstrated well in fig 6 in addition to many other uses of the graphs as shown in fig 6 they can also be used as an efficient tool to quickly determine the required orifice diameter given a specific target of runoff capture efficiency 4 concluding remarks in this paper an analytical stochastic approach was developed to describe the hydrologic operation of storm water quality control detention ponds with outflows controlled by orifices in order to reduce the overestimation of overflow caused by the assumption of instantaneous rainfall inputs the concept of effective storage capacity was proposed an easy way of its estimation was developed considering the varying outflow rates of detention ponds the accuracy of the resulting analytical stochastic model asm was verified for many different hypothetical design cases it was shown that the asm for detention pond systems can provide accurate estimates of the relationships between runoff capture efficiency pond fullness level orifice diameter pond size catchment area and local climatic characteristics implemented easily into a spreadsheet the asm provides an easy to use and computationally efficient tool for analyzing the hydrologic performance of detention pond systems the asm can be used separately as a planning or design tool or together with continuous simulation models to help verify simulation results or reduce the number of simulation runs compared to the previously developed analytical probabilistic models the asm developed in this paper has the advantage of not requiring an independence assumption between rainfall event depth and duration further research may be extended to the verification of asm for detention ponds located at more climatically different locations acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc rgpin 5112 2016 and the china scholarship council 201406220156 the data used in this study are listed in the tables or obtained from the citied references appendix a demonstration of the existence of f 0 t during a dry period without inflow the normalized differential water balance equation governing the rate of change of pond storage can be expressed as a1 d s q s d t substituting q s as expressed in eq 13 into eq a1 and carrying out the integration from time t 0 to time t t with the corresponding s values from s 0 to s t we can obtain a2 s t s 0 0 5 0 5 η t 2 where s 0 is the initial pond fullness level at t 0 st is the pond fullness level at t t it can be seen in eq a2 that the case of s t 0 exists when t 2 s 0 0 5 η this means that the storage of the pond would reach zero if the dry period is long enough although the outflow q s approaches zero in a continuous manner since s may reach zero and may stay at zero for some dry periods that are long enough the probability distribution of s consists of a discrete atom of probability f 0 t for s 0 in addition to a continuous pdf f s t for 0 s 1 this is true for the steady state solution of the probability distribution of s as well therefore for our case of study it is worth noting that the steady state solution of the probability distribution of s includes a discrete atom of probability at s 0 the above demonstration is necessary because previous studies rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 concluded that the probability distribution of s would have no atom of probability at s 0 if the outflow rate q s approaches zero in a continuous manner that conclusion was reached because it was believed that s would approach zero asymptotically if q s is a continuous function and the process would only be at s 0 if it starts at s 0 we here actually demonstrated that this general conclusion is incorrect appendix b derivation of f s as shown in eq 24 the dirac delta function used in eq 22 is used for the special case of s 1 equivalently eq 22 can be written separately for cases with 0 s 1 and s 1 as b1 d f s q s d s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s 0 for 0 s 1 b2 f 1 d q s d s s 1 δ 0 f 1 q 1 μ f 1 μ 0 1 f z γ e γ 1 z δ 0 e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 γ e γ δ 0 e γ 0 for s 1 where f 1 is the probability density at s 1 dividing by δ 0 and neglecting the infinitesimally small terms eq b2 turns to be b3 f 1 q 1 μ 0 1 f z e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 e γ 0 for s 1 thus eqs 23 b1 and b3 are the general form of the steady state chapman kolmogorov forward equations for 0 s 1 multiplying both sides of eq b1 by e ys yields b4 e γ s d f s q s d s e γ s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ z d z μ f 0 γ 0 for 0 s 1 differentiating both sides of eq b4 with respect to s and dividing the resulting equation by e γ s eq b4 becomes b5 γ d f s q s d s d 2 f s q s d s 2 μ d f s d s 0 for 0 s 1 carrying out an indefinite integration of the left hand side of eq b5 a first order linear differential equation was obtained to be b6 d f s q s d s γ f s q s μ f s constant for 0 s 1 combining equations b1 and b6 yields b7 γ f s q s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s constant for 0 s 1 let s 0 eq b7 becomes b8 γ f 0 q 0 μ f 0 γ constant eq 23 can be converted to b9 γ q 0 f 0 μ γ f 0 for s 0 combining eqs b8 and b9 the value of the constant in eqs b6 b8 is determined to be zero therefore eq b6 is simplified as b10 d f s q s d s γ f s q s μ f s 0 for 0 s 1 let s 1 and replacing the value of the constant with zero eq b7 leads to b11 f 1 μ e γ 0 1 f z e γ z d z μ f 0 e γ q 1 μ e γ 0 1 f z e γ z d z μ f 0 e γ q 1 according to eq b3 the expression of f 1 can be derived as b12 f 1 μ e γ 0 1 f z e γ z d z μ f 0 e γ q 1 for s 1 the above procedure shows that f 1 f 1 therefore eq b10 is applicable to not only the cases of 0 s 1 but also the case of s 1 i e b13 d f s q s d s γ f s q s μ f s 0 for 0 s 1 eq b13 is a first order linear homogeneous differential equation its general solution is b14 f s c 1 q s e γ s μ 1 q z d z for 0 s 1 where z is a dummy variable of integration and c 1 is a normalization constant used to ensure that the total probability mass is equal to one eq 24 was obtained by simply substituting the expression of q s as shown in eq 13 into eq b14 and carrying out the integration with z values from z s to z 1 although the solution procedures presented above are very similar to what was presented in rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the difference is that the solutions obtained here are for the more general case with an atom of probability at s 0 whereas the solutions presented in rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 as well as in rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 are for the special case with no such atom of probability for ponds with their storage outflow relationships not accurately approximated by eq 13 a different functional form may be used to describe their q s functions and similarly the approximate q s functions may be substituted into eq b14 to obtain the solutions for those ponds
